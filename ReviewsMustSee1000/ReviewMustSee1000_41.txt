		<shortDescription>I don't even need to say that this is the best Batman of the series. It's obvious enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is all this yap about Michael Keaton as Batman? Yes, he was Batman, and he was a GREAT Batman. He pulled off every aspect of the role perfectly ? he was better than Val Kilmer, better than George Clooney, better than everyone. He portrayed the mysterious charm of the winged crusader just as well as he captured the cool and collected character of Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton is a huge part of the reason that this film was such a huge success, the other main portion having come from the tremendous contribution from Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Gotham City is created in incredibly detailed comic-book style, which adds to the overall quality of the movie.Director Tim Burton does an amazing job bringing this unreal world to reality, and Kim Basinger is excellent as Vicky Vale, the film's main female presence. The script is particularly brilliant. The role of the Joker seems to have been written specifically for Jack Nicholson, which would not be surprising because of how well he pulled off the role with lines like `Why didn't anyone tell me he had one of those?things?!' and `Remember me? When you dropped me into that vat of chemicals? That wasn't easy to get over, and don't think that I didn't try.' And, of course, my favorite, `?we'll be like Beauty and the Beast. Of course, if anyone else ever calls you beast, I'll rip their lungs out.' Everything, from the setting in Gotham City to the characters costumes to the actual dialogue, gives the unreal feeling of a comic book, but the characters are developed enough so that we understand their problems and we care about what happens. The movie is a thrill ride from the beginning to the end, and is enjoyable for all ages. If anyone is going to complain about who was chosen to play Batman, there is much more room for complaint among the film's several sequels. Keaton did a spectacular job that no one has ever even come close to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tim Burton Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton takes a darker twist to a cheesy over the top silly TV show that was loved by everyone. Batman is now played by Michael Keaton. Michael as Batman was perfect, he had the look, humor, and mystery that is Batman. Playing Batman for him, he became the role and I will always stand by that. For me, he is the best Batman, no one besides the original Adam West can touch his performance.Jack Nicholson is now the Joker. Who could ask for a better Joker? He has the look and dirty scary side to him that makes you fear but want to enjoy his presence on screen. He has such charisma and appeal, his lines were perfectly delivered and every scene, he stole. He and Michael were terrific together. They played off each other so well, it makes you go crazy almost. The Dark Knight vs. The Joker, the perfect super hero and villain. Jack stole my heart with his killer, no pun intended, performance.Kim Bassigner was also fantastic. She plays Vicki Vale, the love interest of Bruce Wayne/Batman. She is a photo journalist who is looking for the true identity of Batman, which leads to the question of if Batman can trust another being with his darkest secret? She was absolutely beautiful and charming. No other woman could've done a better job.Like I said, Tim Burton, he takes a different turn on this "Batman", but it's very appealing. Everyone loves this movie, and I can't blame them. Batman is the best super hero of all comic book hero's in my opinion. You see Spider-man can fly with webs, Super Man has super strength and can fly, but Batman just needs himself. He kicks butt by himself. :) The only thing you miss in the movie is Robin, his faithful sidekick, but I don't blame Tim for not adding him for this Batman. It wasn't needed. With a cool soundtrack by Prince and and awesome setting, please watch "Batman", it's a true classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Two Batman Are The Last.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie in the theater back in '89, I was just a kid - a kid paralyzed by the looks and the charisma of the super-hero ever! I didn't know much about directors those times, so I gave all the credit to Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Years later I understood that Tim Burton -leading as my favorite director- was all behind this, making Gotham City darker and wicked, taking Batman to a fearsome -unlike that horrible TV show!- and heroic level as he should have been. As Michael Keaton was born to fulfill his destiny as Batman, I don't think anyone else could handle the Joker except Jack Nicholson. I have never seen any character more suitable than these pair of super actors as super heroes. I don't know whether I should be happy or sad for the first two movie was shot by Tim Burton, for the following ones was not as good as the ones shot by him. The third one was not as bad as the fourth. But the "Batman and Robin" was the final humiliation ever made to me (I really don't know what Joel Schumacher was thinking). I bet everyone involved in the first two was crying their eyes out at the end of the movie. Anyway, Tim, Michael, Jack and Kim was the best crew for a movie, and they made it worth watching it over and over again. "Batman" is amongst the best movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1989, Tim Burton created the very first Batman movie with great stars like Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. The Joker is definitely one of Hollywood's best villains on screen. Jack Nicholson was born for the role, with his psychotic and sick look. Michael Keaton is also great as Batman and is pretty good as Bruce Wayne. Kim Basinger is kind of annoying at times, but she's not the worst damsel in distress ever seen on screen.Tim Burton has a unique way of doing Batman, and I think most people can agree that it fits the characters and the story. To bad Warner Bros. got rid of him after the 2nd film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "serious" comic book movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No radioactive spider bites or guys turning green or supermodels painted blue here. Campy television series aside, Batman has always seemed the most serious, the most grounded, the most real of all the comic book sagas. Our hero has no magical, mystical superpowers...he's just a guy in a suit. But where does he get those wonderful toys? In this film Tim Burton does a very good job of bringing the Dark Knight to life while also seemingly giving the dark, foreboding city of Gotham a life of its own. Gotham is dark, gloomy, and dreary...almost oppressively so. The city is almost a character unto itself in the film...dark, mysterious and somehow quite real. The brilliantly conceived, stunning visuals are the perfect backdrop for the story which will unfold.The story follows our Caped Crusader in his quest to clean up Gotham which is in the midst of a frightening crime wave. There was much unnecessary angst when comic actor Michael Keaton landed the title role with fans feeling that was a sure sign the film would lean towards the campy style evident in the famous television series. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Batman would be a serious film (well, as serious as a comic book movie can be) and Keaton was perfect in the Bruce Wayne/Batman role. Keaton's Wayne comes across as an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things. Keaton brings all the required seriousness to the role but also can add a little comic touch when necessary. Inspired casting pays off big time.Good as he is Keaton is actually overshadowed in the film. Who else but Jack Nicholson could cause the actor playing Batman to get second billing in a movie titled Batman? Nicholson's performance as the Joker is simply terrific. Maybe a little over the top at times but, hey, it's the Joker...he's supposed to be over the top. Nicholson livens up every scene he's in, he simply owns the screen. With two terrific actors doing outstanding work bringing our hero and villain to life the film can hardly go wrong. It's certainly entertaining enough but the film as a whole doesn't quite match the brilliance of the two lead performances. The supporting cast, led by Kim Basinger as the requisite love interest, doesn't add much. Instead of leaving well enough alone with a fantastic Danny Elfman score the whole movie comes to a screeching halt a couple of times while we're forced to listen to some inane Prince songs. And the story just seems to lack a certain zest. We want to see the conflict between Batman and the Joker, these two great characters played by two great actors. And for too much of the film that conflict simply isn't there. But all in all, Batman is certainly a worthy effort. Some top-notch acting, stunning visuals and a story that does just enough to draw you in and hold your attention throughout. To call this film great might be a stretch but one could say it is very, very good. Certainly good enough to be worth your while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and Thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark, foreboding and vastly entertaining, BATMAN changed superhero movies forever. Gone are the days of happy-go-lucky heroes arriving just in time to save the day. Director Tim Burton's Caped Crusader is a vengeful creature of the night preying on criminals who would turn his city into their personal playground.BATMAN is one stylish, thrilling and one helluva ride. While he's not generally associated with action, Burton proves it to be his forte as the Dark Knight Detective swoops out of the shadows, crashes through windows and employs a host of what his nemesis calls "wonderful toys," such as grappling hook guns and the amazingly versatile Batmobile. And man on man, this Batman kicks some ass, at one point daring an armed henchman with a "come here" finger gesture.BATMAN wouldn't have worked nearly as well as it does without the right casting ingredients. The hiring of Michael Keaton in the lead role drew plenty of snickers, but the underrated actor showed up his detractors with a suitably mysterious performance. We know his heart is in the right place, but we're never quite sure what we should make of him. Jack Nicholson's famous performance as the villainous Joker is every bit as good as they say. Nicholson is equal parts amusing and sadistic beneath the white face paint and green hair. Sexy Kim Basinger, as reporter Vicki Vale, also makes the most out of her screen time.BATMAN is one of those films whose obvious flaws are so easily overlooked. The worst sin a movie can commit is to be dull, and that's something BATMAN never does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were around in summer 1989 then you'll remember that Bat-fever was EV-ER-Y-WHERE! You couldn't look anywhere without seeing the Bat Logo in some incarnation. The film was a mega-hit. People were queueing up around the block for hours (the literal meaning of a blockbuster). The marketing team at Warner had to saturate the minds of the public with the big-screen coming of the Dark Knight. Up until this point the Batman series from the 1960s is how people regarded the Batman character and universe. Tim Burton corrected all that by giving us a dark, sinister and Gothic world with rich production design and a great score by Danny Elfman (who has made a career out of recycling the same old generic cues in nearly every movie he has scored). The original material is respected (to a degree), and the characters are deep instead of just campy.Michael Keaton is the best Bruce Wayne in my opinion. When he plays both Bruce Wayne and Batman you have to watch what he doesn't say and doesn't do. He's a rich, socio-phobic megalomaniac who has more money than sense. This is very different from Adam West's turtleneck playboy.Jack Nicholson is a great Joker too, not quite as intimidating or as iconic as Heath Ledger's take on the character, but still a role that has defined his career in a way. Nicholson's Joker isn't much more than an attention-seeking lunatic. But it's still nothing like Caesar Romero's campy, hopping-skipping-and-jumping villain.Anton Furst's Oscar-winning design of Gotham City is very original and unique, and is very much in the style of the Comic book. The smoke-blackened, cramped and claustrophobic 1920s buildings look and create a very oppressive atmosphere. This is definitely GOTHam City. Not LA like the TV series.They didn't even make any attempt with that show did they? In fact the Batcave in the TV series was like the set of a mad scientists lab from a 1950s movie. But the REAL Batcave in this movie is a monstrous cavern filled with stalagmites and it actually HAS bats in it. And there's no fireman's pole leading into it. With Christopher Nolan's reboot of the franchise currently the only Batman worth considering for most fans, it'd be a shame if you were to let this go ignored. It may not be as mature as Nolan's work but it has an edge that no other recent comic-book movie has.It's NOT an origin story. There's no 60 precious minutes on a build-up, it just goes straight to the action. Why can't more comic-book movies do this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton`s masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a Fantasy/Comic movie-masterpiece. First of all- the excellent cast- Jack Nicholson shines in the role of the manic and crazy Jocker. Nicholsons character is truly amazing- like a mixture of his former roles/characters in "Chinatown" (Jake Gittes), "One Flew Over the Cuchoo`s Nest" (Randle McMurphy), "Prizzie` s honor" (C.Partanna), "the Witches of Eastwick" (Daryl Van Horn) and of course "The Shining" (Jack Torrance)- but (the character) still keeps his own style. Michael Keaton also proves to be the ideal type for Burtons`s Batman. He reminds on the dark Batman from the "Dark Knight" Batman comics, and is the exact opposite of Batman introduced by Adam West in the 70`s. Second, Tim Burton created a unique athmosphere, exactly matching to the characters. Some people say that this movie is to dark, but I wouldn`t agree. I must not forget to mention the exciting Batman Theme composed by Danny Elfmann. Burton`s Batman, differnt from all the other Comic-hero movies, like Spiderman, Superman, Flash or Hulk, provides a refreshing character dimension.One of the best movies in the 80`s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good attempt to translate the comics to the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a Gotham City overrun by crime a new menace exists. In the shadows and rooftops a giant bat is terrorising the criminals who live in the night. Elsewhere crime boss Grissom's right hand man Jack Napier is trapped in a chemical factory by police. With Batman's intervention Napier is accidentally dropped into a vat of chemical. Considered dead he later turns up, scarred and twisted with a new sense of humour. Calling himself the Joker he takes over the city's gangs and begins to terrorise the city. Millionaire Bruce Wayne begins relationship with reporter Vicky Vale and finds himself personally drawn into conflict with the Joker as both himself and his alter-ego.This was very much a huge blockbuster and had a great deal riding on it in terms of merchandising and a possible franchise. As such Burton always seemed like a risk - although his dark toned work and complex characters probably made him a great choice. The film starts promisingly, many questions are asked - is Wayne totally balanced? What drives him to become the bat? etc - and the tone of the movie is darker than a friendly blockbuster. This is continued by the investigation by reporters Vale and Knox, but starts to wane (pardon the pun) with the development of Vale as a love interest and the hamming of The Joker. At some point the film loses the character complexities and decides to become a straight up good v's evil with plenty of effects and gadgets. That said it's still very dark and the set pieces are well handled. In fact it's the best of the Batman franchise so far.The problem is that it lacks a bite for Batman fans. I've always felt that Batman was always a few steps away from the criminals he's chasing, surely he can't be totally balanced and right in the head? Here these questions are half touched but never developed.Keaton is an unlikely Batman, but is the best so far. He deals well with Wayne's past when it is brought up, but is an unlikely action hero. Nicholson is pure ham, but is good for it. He hogs all the best lines and is clearly enjoying himself - the only downside being that he regularly eclipses Keaton's Batman. Basinger's Vale is built up far too much and should have been cut out of the story rather than become a key part of it. The rest of the cast are good and I always like to see Tracey Walters in a big screen film!Overall this is a good stab at the Batman legend. It's dark tone gives it the feel of the comics without the characterisation, but at the end of the day it comes down to good guy v's bad guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton (Beetle Juice, Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands) is definitely my favourite film director. If I had to pick his best film, this is definitely it. This live action story of the comic book hero, the caped crusader, is excellent. Gotham City is high on crime, and recently people have sited an unknown creature, or maybe a man, that calls itself Batman. Michael Keaton's Batman/Bruce Wayne is the main focus. He also has really good gadgets from the Bat Cave including the Batwing and of course, the Bat Mobile. The one who steals the show is the brilliantly cast BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson who falls into acid and becomes the evil Joker. The Joker is causing psychopathic incidents, such as making news reporters laugh to death. He plans to turn the city into a laughing smiling city so he and his gang can take over. Also starring Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Michael Gough as Alfred, Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon and Jack Palance as Grissom. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Effects. Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Nicholson was number 63, and Kim Basinger number 32 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Nicholson was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor, Batman was number 84, Nicholson number 71, and Prince number 68 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Batman was number 46 (Hero) and The Joker number 45 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes and Villains. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of bat guano.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS LIE AHEAD!!! Not that you should really care.Okay, so I am a bit biased as a Batman fan, but speaking for Batman fans in general, I must say it is impossible to be a true Batman fan and enjoy this atrocity. Tim Burton himself has said that he would never read a comic book, which, right there, explains the extraordinary lack of respect o the source material that this film contains. Anything that disrespects the source material that it is based on, especially something as grand and wonderful as the Batman mythos, this much should be shamed.Let's start with the basic formula. This is a superhero movie. It is based off the comic book. So why, instead of having the main love interest from the comics, Catwoman, which offers an insightful look at the psyche of the Bat, and shows a great psychological story, have some dumb bimbo, played to the Nth degree of ANNOYING by Kim Basinger, be the love interest? Honestly, she spends all her on screen time screaming and whining, it is impossible to see why Batman would be attracted to her, especially considering that he is BATMAN! He is dark figure with a Really messed up psyche, making him impossible to connect to, and really isn't one for love interests. that is why Catwoman is the great love interest that she is. She shares his dark psyche, and they are truly soul mates. But apparently Hollywood just wanted to go with the hot bimbo storyline, that completely contradicts who the character in the movie is in the first place, than give a great, insightful look at what makes Batman Batman.Okay, that's actually not even my fifth biggest complaint. If you want my biggest complaint, it's Michael Keaton. Okay, we all know what Batman looks like. He's a man who has trained his body to physical perfection over decades, and is a master of every fighting style known to man, so he knows how to fight his way through fifty men. What do we get her? Scrawny, curly-haired Michael Keaton shoved in a giant rubber body suit in which he can't move, so he just throws a little punch her, maybe a kick here...Geez Louise! Now, if you were to say to pretty much anyone that Jack Nicholson is not a great actor, you would probably be shunned from existence. But for a character like the Joker, Nicholson is all wrong. I mean, Tom Hanks is a great actor, but you wouldn't cast him as Superman, would you? The Joker is supposed to be a lean, long-faced, high-pitched voice, squealing madman who is completely incoherent, and does enjoys just laughing and killing people. Nicholson just does it all wrong, but it's not really his fault at all. He's just completely miscast. Look, I don't know how to explain it all really, but if you're interested in what the Joker, and Batman for that matter, really should be, watch the internet short-film "Batman: Dead End." Then you'll see what I'm talking about, and how absurdly different form Nicholson's performance it is.No, on second thought, and I'm so raving mad at even talking about this film that this is how incoherent I am, my biggest complaint would be how Batman ruthlessly and systematically slaughters criminals, even to the point where it's trying to be humorous with it. Btman is a dealer of justice, not of murder. He would never kill unless he had absolutely no other choice. But like I said, this movie has no respect for the source material, or, for that matter, even the character that they're portraying. I guess they just wanted a big boom-bang action movie. There is a scene in the movie where Batman stops his car, lays out, everything stops, he lays out a bomb, the bomb blow up, and he speeds away. I guess that's supposed to be funny, but to me it's just sickening. It's a Smithsonian on just how completely disrespectful this film is to everything it's supposed to portray.And what's up with the comically fat Gordon? He's useless. That's why Batman has to do all the work! He's supposed to be an action hero kind of good, tough cop. Oh well.Finally, this film is so lazily written that it just glosses over moments in it that make absolutely NO sense. Like how Batman's rope magically wraps around a gargoyle to KILL the Joker, which is pretty darn bad in the first place. This isn't a small continuity blooper that you MIGHT notice, it's more like "WOW! When did that happen!" Also, I guess it's supposed to be exiting when the Joker manages to shot down Batman's plane with his big gun, but dude, it makes NO sense. And all of a sudden, a dangerous fugitive who has just poisoned the whole city, offers a bunch of cash, and the whole city of Gotham just figures he's a nice guy, and flocks to him, without even so much as the police int he way of this huge parade that he just magically managed to whip up. This film is lazily written to be a big bang-boom action film, without any respect to the source material, or, for that matter, the characters that it, by itself, is trying to portray.Ultimately, I give this film the dignity of 2/10 because of a few enjoyable moments, but seriously, you could find better ways to waste your brain away.I'm out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have grew up watching this movie. It's simply brilliant. It's the best Batman movie ever made. Yes I'm brave enough to say it. It's better then The Dark Knight. It's better because of these reasons. 1. Batman's voice didn't sound like he was trying to be in a heavy metal band in this movie. 2. The Batmobile was better and more suitable for a Batmobile rather then a tank. 3. the music score! I mean when you hear Danny Elfman's theme to this you instantly think of Batman! The music in this was brilliant! 4.The hole idea that it was the joker who killed batman's parents then batman goes after revenge. 5.this felt more like a batman movie and the dark knight felt like a spy movie. And I can go on. I'm not saying the dark knight was a bad movie I thought it was good but I just like this movie better. Tim Burton did an awesome job with this! Jach Nicholson was great as the Joker. I liked how dark this movie was. Very good movie. You can never get tired of it no matter how many times you see it.</fullReview>

As Bruce Wayne he was a cool guy with on and off humor and still mysterious due to his past and why he is Batman.Tim Burton's vision of Batman was so breathtaking I don't even know if words can describe how terrific the manufacturing of this film was. Dark and Gothic, the way Gotham was designed making it so bleak and almost ugly yet, this was the way it was almost meant to be.The best Batman Movie ever made and Burton's best in my sight I loved it never gets old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman: Lest we forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone seems so willing to hop on the Dark Night bandwagon; a film that enjoyed commercial and critical success grossly disproportionate to its quality. Heath Ledger was exalted from C-movie actor to screen-legend overnight; showered with awards and praise,and his portrayal of the Joker was absorbed into the public consciousness as the definitive. And somewhere along the way, the fickle movie-going mob forgot where all the magic began, and where it stopped.The original 1989 Tim Burton effort prevails by every measure of creativity, craftsmanship and cinematic significance.Batman is one of the most atmospheric films I have ever seen. The film is futuristic but also contains some deliberately dated elements. Gotham has the flavour of the 1940s. Attired in suits, topped with fedoras and brandishing revolvers; the criminals are perfumed by the past in a classic film noir style. The result is a much more textured and evocative film; conveying a potently palpable sense of seediness and moral decay.Batman's scenes of action are impressive but measured. Burton understands that the key to great action is moderation; only then can the audience engage with it. The Dark Night seems desperate to entertain,compensating for a lack of vision by overloading scenes with elaborate special effects and stunts.Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne is, on the whole, more enigmatic and interesting than Bale's. They are similar in several respects, but Keaton, I feel, brings more humanity to the part; a social misfit and loner on the surface, but with hidden, dark emotional depths.Nicholson's performance, on the other hand, is a tour de force. Ledger provided the shell of a character (hair, makeup and costume) but without the creative and artistic instincts to develop it. Burton managed to bring all the weight and charisma of Jack Nicholson and apply it to a comic book character. The result is one of the most vibrant, vicious, and compelling characters ever committed to celluloid.And of course one cannot forget Danny Elfman's goose-bump inducing score; a sweeping symphonic masterpiece that manages to capture the film's excitement, pace and harrowing qualities.Time has not been kind or fair to Batman. Though big in its day, in the public's estimation, Batman has slipped down the popularity scale from a heavily fortified 1st to a distant and peripheral 3rd. I can only hope that once the Dark Night drug wears off the critics will have clairvoyance enough to restore Batman to its proper place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and brooding: This IS Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton was the best possible choice to jump-start the "Batman" series, without question. This dark and brooding film stands for me as what Batman is and should be: the most complex and intriguing of all superheros.The story concerns Batman as he faces his immortal arch enemy...The Joker (played superbly by the one and only Jack Nicholson). Although the story is at times fragmented, there is little to criticize as everything from the production design, the mood, the atmosphere and the dialog are perfect. Burton also creates a rich period flavor that oddly feels timeless as well.The cast is first rate with everyone turning in a good job. Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Jack Palance and Robert Wuhl are just a few of this perfect ensemble. Plus, how can you go wrong with Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent? Last but certainly no least is Michael Keaton who was, without a doubt, the best Batman by being goofy, brooding and likable all at the same time.This is certainly one of the best screen versions of "Batman" and was a perfect start to the series. It's just a shame it ended so embarrassingly but that's another story...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great BATMAN that started it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is still the king of the hill in terms of BATMAN movies made throughout our time. As the world turns and our time line is going to hell in a hand basket carried by the spoiled youth of our nation today, films are becoming more and more grotesque, violent and unnaturally clichéd to cater to today's easily bored audiences.1989 was a time when we were still able to see a film for its sheer quality story telling, appreciating styles from different directors such as the masterful Tim Burton in this case.BATMAN is the film that started it all. It took a franchise that was thought to be a campy comic book superhero (thanks to the earlier TV shows with Adam West) and brought it back to serious. Although the 80s did NOT require directors to push things beyond atrocious nor gratuitous for the sake of acquiring young adult's attention, this film was well balanced in coolness, ground breaking, dark, mainstream and humorous all wrapped up into one.Many many thanks to Tim Burton or else you kids would never have gotten your Batman Begins, today.And I personally still believe that the 89 primal looking bat suit, is still the best looking bat suit around. And the Batmobile in 89 is STILL the best looking hot rod I've seen in a bat film.Don't get me wrong. I liked Batman Begins very much. However, you can't deny the greatness of the bat film which had more hype than any other super hero film around, spawning merchandise and commercials which made everything seem batty during that era.This movie is solid gold. And I recommend anyone to give it a try with an open mind. Comparing or hating on this film for reasons that are obviously null (comparing jokers to the dark knight film, etc, so stupid) is not going to help anyone enjoy it.You gotta take this film for what it was. And unfortunately, any kid out there between the ages to 10 - 23, will most like slam this film. But since when do kids know whats good and what isn't? lol. Just turn on the TV and you'll see what I mean.Tim Burton's BATMAN. Check it out. Its a real fun film, even by today's standards. It holds up as great entertainment. Jack is the best Joker and Keaton still rocks as Batman.But, you don't have to take my word for it. *insert Reading Rainbow song here*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be labelled 'Quality assured, from start to finish'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has a reputation for directing dark and gloomy films. Like 'Batman Returns', this is a dark film, but definitely not gloomy. In terms of introducing us to a new series of 'Batman films', Tim Burton does an excellent job of bringing Batman into Gotham City, were no-body knows who or what Batman is. Micheal Keaton does a great job of developing his Batman character from start to finish. His character had to be developed, after-all, no-one in Gotham City knows whether Batman should be trusted or not, and is therefore perceived as being a mysterious character. Keatons overall performance is great, he plays the best Bruce Wayne role out of all the actors that attempted, and his Batman role is solid enough to make sure you would never want to mess with him! He has a brilliant sense of security that makes you feel safe, even when your just watching him in this film. The acting is brilliant as he his able to give both characters a separate personality, each being unique and entertaining.Jack Nicholson also puts in a fantastic performance. I have always loved to watch Nicholson in comedies, and his 'Joker' role suits him down to the ground. After a steady start to the film, you will soon see how he becomes the Joker and just how funny he can be, with his words and props. What you can love about Nicholson in this film is that although he is Batmans main villain, you realise towards the end he is just a joker, and no match for Batman in a fight. Kim Bassinger plays Batmans 'lover' in this film, and does a good job of showing us just how nosey some photographers can be, but Batman makes sure she doesn't get in his way.. too much. Afterall, has their ever been a woman in Bruce Waynes life who has not had a good job, and become attracted to him? The atmosphere in Gotham City is brilliant and sets the scene very well for Batman, as the dark roof tops and roads of the city do far more justice than bright sunshine in hot weather. Tim Burton also used the idea here of a city with no time-scale. In other words, the buildings and dress styles look very 1930's, but the technology is can look futuristic with Batman at times. The quality is in the directing and the acting. It is not a fast paced film, but moves steadily. Their are no un-realistic special effects, but clever props. Many younger viewers may slag off this film, but they will never realise that the quality comes from the story, directing, and acting. Not from modern un-realistic special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two hours of comic book fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly may I just state that 'Batman' is one of those films where Batman isn't really the star. The star character is in fact the Joker played to brilliance by Jack Nicholson. However seeing as Batman himself didn't have that much of a back-story back then, its no wonder. All the character had for a well enough established origin was 'parents were murdered in a back alley' (the graphic novel 'Year One' only hit shelves like one year before the films release). So its no wonder why the Joker almost steals the entire film. Having said that Michael Keaton does make an excellent Bruce Wayne/Batman depicting a man constantly in turmoil between identities. The plot line initially seems rather basic good vs evil. However after watching it time and time again it actually gets more intriguing. Particularly with how Joker rises to the top of Gotham's criminal empire to further his plot. If you want a Batman story thats still dark but more grittier then watch Nolan's interpretations. They're every bit as enjoyable as this and vice versa. But if you want to watch a Batman that's grim in a graphic novel way this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pillar Of 80s Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is awesome. My favorite Superhero movie of all time. As a life-long fan of the Caped Crusader, I have to say that if you want the real Batman, look no further. You found him.There is a certain kind of magic to Batman that no other film adaptation has been able to successfully match. The main difference between Chris Nolan's more recent Dark Knight trilogy, and Burton's 1989 version, is the visual style. The main difference is a place they call Gotham City.Tim Burton is known for many things, but above all else, it is his bizarre visual eye, a gift that works wonders in Batman. This film looks incredible! Burton creates a Gotham City that the viewer can get lost in. As opposed to Chris Nolan's outings, Tim Burton gives us a Gothic Fantasy of the highest order. Every visual element in this film is perfect; Gotham, the Batmobile, Joker, Batman himself, green ooze-- all of it. Nolan had a way of probing deep into the psyche of his characters, he seems to be a very psychological filmmaker, and he came to with fantastic results. Nolan was obviously interested in different aspects of the Dark Knight than what Tim Burton was drawn to. That makes for two very good and very different films. But the 1989 version reigns best of them all. Tim Burton gave us a work of Pop Art, a visual feast. A masterwork of the highest caliber. Tim Burton gave us a classic. Although his characters were not as moving as Nolan's would be, and the plot was not as complex as later adaptations would prove the Caped Crusader capable of, the film was pitch-perfect, ages incredibly well, and knows what it is. A comic book movie. And what does Tim Burton do with his comic book movie? He elevates the medium of film. Yes. I believe Batman changed the face of film, altered the practice of filmmaking, and raised the bar indefinitely. I have no doubt whatsoever that Batman is one of the finest Blockbusters ever assembled, and one of the best movies ever made.This movie means a lot to me, and a lot to my childhood. The older I get, the more important this film becomes. Something else happens too. It becomes enormous. Powerful. An event every time I sit down to watch it. Classic Good vs. Evil, rich design, completely unforgettable. I appreciate Nolan's films, I like all of them quite a lot, but when Tim Burton made Batman he had something to prove. This is the only film I can use as concrete evidence to provide support to my claim that Tim Burton is in fact a genius. Sadly, the amount of good films he has made are dwarfed in size by the fleet of stinkers he has produced. But Batman is undeniably the work of a very talented filmmaker.I wish that Criterion could somehow get their paws on this one. I know its impossible, but one can't help but dream. The film is such a powerful experience, a tour de force from beginning to end; Burton's Magnum Opus. Batman is so very important to a film fanatic like me. This should be taught in film schools around the country. A highly analytical dose of entertainment, the way Burton visually tells the tale is to be admired and studied for its precise tenacity and bold audacity. Tim Burton's Batman is a one of a kind experience that deserves to go down in film history as a pillar of 80s cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atmospheric Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely adore this movie. I grew up with this movie and it will always have a special place in my heart. I am aware of the 60s comedy series but This is first real definitive Batman film. Tim Burton crafted a cerebral film that draws you in due to its setting and atmosphere. The Characters are fascinating and the performances do a perfect job of capturing the complexity and these iconic characters. The cinematography is flawless and so is the direction. Everything about this movie just screams Batman and its freaking Epic. There is a scene at the beginning of the film When two goons are talking about their fear of the Bat just before The Caped Crusader himself gracefully glides down a few feet behind them in the distance. The elegant and eerie music that kicks in during this memorable scene from the film gives me goosebumps every time I see it. Danny Elfman's score captures the awe and majesty of The Dark Knight in a unique way that no other score ever could. I can listen to it over and over again and be moved by it. The score is inspiring, genius, intense, blood pumping, exhilarating, and just plain awesome. It becomes part of the world of Gotham city that audiences remember the most. Gotham is dark, brooding and a very fearful place. Tim Burton does an amazing job of making the audiences believe that this city need a symbol of hope like Batman. Someone who is just as if no more elemental and terrifying as the criminals that he is up against. The character of Bruce Wayne/Batman is presented Masterfully in this picture. He is mysterious and hides in the shadows for the most of the picture. This makes his appearances all the more meaningful for this film and exciting. His dramatic entrances are the best. The costume looks great and so does the bat-mobile and all of Bruce's gadgets. I absolutely loved Michael Keaton's Interpreataion of the character. As Bruce Wayne he is nerdy and unsure of himself. He can't overcome his inner demons by being Bruce Wayne. Bruce surrounds himself with so much exotic images in order to illustrate this. He is a man of few words who is unable to express himself. When he is Batman his attitude chances. He becomes a man of action who by dawning the symbol of a demon is able to vanquish them. The incredible visuals speak volumes about what the symbol of the Bat does for Bruce. It makes him stronger and it becomes shocking how good Keaton's acting is. His performances is magnificent. Kim Bassinger is great and underrated as Vicky Vale. She is a loving and sweet person. She probably the most normal person in the film which is much needed considering how crazy and fantastic all the other characters are. She is a reporter who wants to learn more about Batman and mostly about Bruce Wayne. I love the angle Burton went with her character. She isn't some shallow hotty who has the hot for Batman because he is the cool bad-boy in town like in Batman Forever(sorry Nicole Kidman). Time is well spent developing the relationship between her and Bruce and she it is clear that she genuinely cares for him. Vicky screams a lot and is clearly a damsel is distress but that doesn't mean she doesn't have courage. She follows Bruce into the darkest corners of his life and his brave enough to deal with the consequences. Jack Nicolson was born to play The Joker.He gives the best performance in the movie. He is absolutely amazing proving that The Joker is a difficult role to mess up. He is an incredibly goofy villain but not merely for the sake of it like Jim Carry and Tommy lee Jones in Batman Forever. Jack is no a comedian. He is an actor. He infuses his performance with a tint of malice and a psychotic outbreak in all the scenes with him laughing like a clown. He is a very creepy villain but also a very entertaining one.His fixed smile is brilliant and disturbing and his laughter is positively chilling. This movie has some great action scenes and set pieces but takes this film to the next level is depth and intrigue of the characters. The Characters are conveyed masterfully and this is what makes Batman a film that will be cherished and celebrated as one of the best superhero films for years to come.</fullReview>

Micheal Keaton plays Batman AND Bruce Wayne in a genius sense of subtlety while Jack Nicholson's performance is appropriately outlandish and perfect to every degree. The relationship between characters is the best I've ever seen. Even supporting character's like Eddie Knox and Vicky Vale stand out with the most perfect accuracy.

		<shortDescription>Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best examples of comic book to film migration ever. Keaton and Nicholson appear as two sides of the same coin. Both characters struggle to cement their dominance over both Gotham City and Vicki Vale. Nicholson has some of the best lines of his career so far as The Joker, and Keaton turns in a performance as Bats/Bruce Wayne that other Batman actors should envy to this day. The Director, The Screenwriter, and the rest of the crew put together a film that stands alone, even 18 years later. Gotham City is brilliantly portrayed as a run down, industrial revolution burg, being torn apart at it's seems by corruption and crime. The best part of this film, for me anyway, are all the details. The supporting cast, the wardrobe, the sets, and the masterful shots, all paint a vivid and poignant picture of what an entire city at the end of it's rope could be. This is a film that get's better every time it's watched. It achieves what so few films do. It can be compared on the same playing field with the finest predecessors of it's franchise can produce. It's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Around the time "Beetlejuice" was released in theaters,I was reading "Starlog Magazine". It was announced that they were going to film a "Batman" movie.The last time I remembered seeing "Batman" was from the 70s-the early 80s.The show was campy and really dumb to watch and the comics seemed to be more darker than the television series.At that time,the "Superman" films were dying,thanks to "Superman III" and "Superman IV:The Quest for Peace".It was hard for me to accept that a film like "Batman" was coming to the big screen.My only thought was how corny it was going to be.Almost a year later,I realized that I was wrong."Batman" works on all forms.It is a wonderful film which captures the darkness and the imagination of what I did not expect from the film.Tim Burton directs the film with such glee that I was having a good time just by looking at the film.The casting for "Batman" is appropriately well made for the screen.The art direction and costume design are given a 1940s noir style and the cinematography gives "Batman" a comic book look to the film.Michael Keaton is fierce as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Jack Nicholson is gruesomely hilarious as The Joker."Batman" is a dark film with fantastic special effects with a totally different look that had me feeling that I was being part of the movie."Batman" is a film that is fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all time favorite Batman movie. Micheal Keaton is my favorite Batman. Jack Nicholson is my favorite Joker. This movie is what a movie about Batman should be. It is dark, it is action packed, it is creepy at times, and it is perfect. It starts out with tourist in Gotham who are lost hen get mugged. The muggers are then scene on a roof top going through the things they stole. They hear something and Batman stands over them and opens his cape to form wings. He jumps onto the rooftop. and is shot. The criminals think he is dead for a second and turn to see him open his cape and kick on of them through a door. The other one runs but Batman throws a cable that wraps around his legs tripping him. Batman picks him up and holds him over the edge of the building. The mugger begs for his life and Batman pulls him close and says "I'm Batman". He trows the crook on the rooftop and steps of the side of the building. The criminal looks over the edge to see Batman gone. So this movie is defiantly a must see. I highly recommend it. The best Batman. The best Joker. The best Batman Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Superhero/Comic Book Film Of All Time And An Absolute Classic. Tim Burton At His Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Batman is,in my opinion,is the greatest superhero and comic book film ever made and is one of the films that set the standard for comic book adaptations. Filled with Amazing Action,Excellent performances,great direction and a brilliant score,Batman is one of my favorite movies of all time,a true classic and is Tim Burton at his best.Set in the fictional town of Gotham City,Batman tells the story of Bruce Wayne(Michael Keaton),who is a Billionaire by day,but,at night he is Batman,a masked avenger who stalks criminals and bad guys in the night gives them his own brand of justice. Now,Batman must face off against his biggest challenge yet,a psychotic criminal in clown make-up named The Joker(Jack Nicholson)who is terrorizing the city of Gotham. Now,Batman has to stop The Joker and save Gotham at any costs.Batman is a film that I have loved since I was kid and instantly made me a Batman fan,it was the first superhero and comic book film I saw and no other comic book or superhero film(although they're been plenty great and good ones since Batman's release)have had an impact on me the way Batman has. One of the reasons Batman is the greatest superhero film ever made and a classic is the way the filmmakers approach the material. Where many superhero films these days have origin stories and start at the beginning,Batman starts in the middle where we see Batman already beating up and stalking criminals at night and putting not only the criminals,but the police on edge. We don't see how Bruce Wayne became Batman,how he trains,gets the costumes or his useful weapons. It's bold move for this film not having an origin story from the beginning and starting in the middle. What I also love about this movie is the dark,Gothic style of Gotham City and timeless feel. Gotham City in this film is a dark,cynical place that's very much in the Film-Noir style,dirty streets,dark shadows,smoke,fog and harsh lighting during the night and the film also depicts Gotham City as a town where criminals roam and rule the streets. Batman was a film that brought a dark,brooding style to the superhero genre that has been imitated ever since this film was released. Where would Christopher Nolan's excellent Dark Knight Trilogy be without Tim Burton's film. The film at times has almost a timeless feel to it where you're not sure if the film takes place in the 80s,40s,50s or the 30s. It's great production design by Anton Furst adds to the film's timeless feel mixing the past,present and the future and that's one of the things I think set Batman from other superhero films. Batman and The Joker is one of the greatest rivalries in comic books,film and television and this film adds to the rivalry of this hero and villain. In the film,Batman and The Joker are at odds over the city of Gotham because Batman wants to save the city and the people,while The Joker wants to destroy the city and it's people and the battle and banter between the two characters is excellent and memorable. The Action and fight scenes are brilliant and well-done and fits with the film,because at times the Action can be violent,but also over the top and stylized. I've noticed that for years there's been a rivalry between Batman fans over whose films are better,the Burton films or the Nolan films and I don't think that's fair because Burton's and Nolan's films are different in tone and style. Burton's films are dark,Gothic and rooted in comic book style and fantasy where as Nolan's films are more gritty and grounded in reality. I love the Batman films from Burton and Nolan equally and if you're a true Batman fan you should see both as classic takes on a classic and iconic character such as Batman. The ending of Batman is classic,unforgettable and one of the greatest endings in film history and Comic Book film history and adds to the legend of Batman. An excellent conclusion to an amazing film. The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Michael Keaton is excellent as Batman/Bruce Wayne,bringing intensity,depth and edge to the role. Jack Nicholson is brilliant and at his best as The Joker/Jack Napier with Nicholson giving a funny,maniacal and over the top greatness to the role of The Joker making The Joker One of the best villains in film history. Kim Basinger is wonderful and sexy as Vicki Vale,a photographer who is investigating Batman and is a love interest of Bruce Wayne. Robert Whul gives a fun performance as Alexander Knox,with Whul bringing humor to the role. Pat Hingle does a good job as Commissioner Jim Gordon. Billy Dee Williams does a good and smooth job as Harvey Dent. Michael Gough is wonderful as Alfred,Bruce's loyal butler and friend. Jack Palance gives a fine performance as Mob boss Carl Grissom,who is also Jack Napier's boss. Jerry Hall(Alicia),Tracey Walter(Bob The Goon),Lee Wallace(The Mayor)and William Hootkins(Lt.Eckhardt)give good performances as well.The direction by Tim Burton is amazing with Burton constantly moving the camera and giving the film a dark,Gothic and brooding feel to it and giving the film a lot of energy and also does a great job with the Action and fight scenes. Great direction,Burton.The score by Danny Elfman is just brilliant and it's one of my favorite movie scores of all time. Elfman's score is epic,dark,operatic and definitely fits in with the tone of the film. An excellent score from Elfman. I also loved the Prince songs that are on the soundtrack which include songs like Partyman,Scandalous,The Future,Electric Chair and Trust. Great soundtrack.In final word,If you're a fan of Batman,Superhero films,Comic Book films or films in general,I Highly suggest you see Batman,a landmark classic in Comic Book films and Superhero films that will stand the test of time and is a film you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still my favourite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally decided to write a review on this after so many years and its about time. I watched The dark knight a few days ago and right after I went home, I rewatched this again for comparison and I have to say no doubt, this is still my favourite even though Dark Knight was good as well.Tim Burton's style is really unique and I loved the way he created Gotham city. Christopher Nolan's Gotham city was dark and modern, Tim Burton's one was probably more fantasy but there was still something eerie and lonely about it which I like.Comparing Christian Bale and Michael Keaton as Batman. Both tied in this sense although in terms of looks, Christian Bale is better because he is better-looking and taller. However, both captured the true essence of Batman: the struggles of being a superhero and a rich heir with duties.Now for the major comparison: Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholsan as Joker. As much as I applaud Heath's performance( I loved his version too!), Jack Nicholson is still my mainstay. He was the reason I started being a fan of Batman even though Tim Burton did as much. You may argue that if I had watch Dark Knight at that time, I would be a fan but no. I saw a wicked sense of humour, madness and intelligence as well as comedy for Joker in this movie. There are times where you can see his comedic side and times of madness. He killed people like Heath did in Dark knight. Intelligence of Joker was also included in this film as stated by Bruce as well as the invention of symalx gas and funny lines by the Joker like " where did he get those wonder toys?" and " You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses won't you?" are priceless. For Heath, I saw mainly madness and a little humour.These are the reasons why I prefer this over the highly acclaimed Dark Knight. The simplicity of the story of having just Joker as the bad guy, batman and the simple love story between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne was an added bonus as compared to Dark Knight which has too many plot lines and characters which could lead to confusion and diversion from the main plot line.Don't get me wrong though, The Dark Knight is still a wonderful film but this one is irreplaceable for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Batman should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I was never really a fan of Batman. I didn't care about the comics too much, the movies didn't seem to spark my interest, and just about anything Batman-related seemed lame to me. Then The Dark Knight came along. And all I heard were scores of people say its the best movie ever, and Heath was the best Joker ever, and all that fun stuff. So, being the investigative person I am, set out to prove this theory wrong.I wasn't really pleased by The Dark Knight. I mean it was good, don't get me wrong. But it wasn't God-like. And Heath was good, just also wasn't God-Like. Then I saw this movie and all I have to say is "Wow"...that and this small summary following it: The comic book style this movie had really made it fun. It was very fictional and old-fashioned, which brought it to life. The dialogue, costumes, sets, all of it really authentic comic style. This movie had a lot of dark comedy that was lacked in the Dark Knight, which brought it to life I think.Michael Keaton really impressed me as Batman/Bruce Wayne. His Batman voice was authentic sounding and not forced, plus he had a lot of humor and a laid-back style as Bruce Wayne. However, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the spotlight here. All he had to do was play his crazy personality that we've all come to expect from him. Only this time with a lot more comedy. He was undoubtedly my favorite Joker. Kim Basinger was decent as Vicki Vale. She just didn't seem to shine all that much. However, I think maybe she wasn't supposed to all that much. Robert Wuhl was hilarious as Knox, Vicki's partner. I think he deserved much more screen time. Michael Gough was perfect as Alfred. It was as if Alfred was written specifically for him but we all know that isn't true. Pat Hingle was very good as Commissioner Gordon, although he didn't get a whole lot of screen time/back story. Jack Palance was out-shined here, but filled the role of Carl Grisson very well. And lastly Tracey Walter was hilarious as Bob, Joker's personal goon.Aside from good music, set, and acting, the plot was solid. A lot of back-story at the right times, and twists that worked in the end.Best superhero movie I've seen in a while, it got me into Batman, I can tell you that much. Batman fans should have seen this one. If not, they can't really call themselves "Batman fans", can they? 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though it's now impossible to not compare with Batman Begins, this is still an amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On October 18th I purchased Batman Begins along with the 1989-1997 Anthology set, and spent the next couple of days browsing through the bonus materials. I'm not the most devoted Batman fan, I've read maybe 10-20 comics as a kid, but I know at least I can recognize a good movie when I see one. People have said that Batman Begins is the first Batman film to "get it right." I don't quite agree with that, since it implies that the others must've gotten it "wrong." Tim Burton's vision of Batman, a movie I've seen countless times throughout my entire life, is by its own merits a great spectacle. Exciting, dark, comedic, and absorbing.As I said, I took a good look at some of the bonus materials on the Batman DVD, which included hours of documentaries and interviews, and things of that nature. I never really realized what an important thing these filmmakers did for the image of Batman as we know it. Before 1989, everyone knew Batman as a campy superhero who nobody would think carried such...baggage. They did a great job bringing the Dark Knight to the big screen, even though it may have been a slightly flawed effort. But it still really does raise my already high appreciation for the movie.I also listened to Tim Burton's audio commentary. He described the movie in a way that was like a mini-revelation to me. Every now and then he'd point Batman out as being operatic. That just made complete sense to me. Maybe the movie compromised certain things about the comic book, such as the Joker turning out the be the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents. That is sort of silly, but it doesn't bug me too much. It made sense for this movie; it made the battle of Batman Vs. The Joker more personal. Again, operatic. Another thing that bugged people but made sense to me was the fact that Alfred let Vicki Vale into the batcave. If you look at some of Alfred's scenes earlier in the film, it is quite clearly foreshadowed, even though it still does manage to be a surprise (a pleasant one to me, not-so-pleasant for others). I think Alfred saw that Bruce was suffering and wanted to let her in (to his life, I mean, not literally into the batcave). Remember, he was about to tell her earlier before The Joker barged in. Alfred gave him a little "push" that made sense character-wise and most likely from a producer's perspective kept the damn movie moving quickly.It is also operatic because of the love triangles taking place. Bruce is falling in love (more or less I suppose) with Vicki Vale, but he is also Batman and struggles with that, while Knox the reporter is also smitten with her, and, almost arbitrarily, Vale catches The Joker's eye. It all comes together well. There's a rooftop showdown and then everything falls into place by the end. It doesn't end tragically, but, if you ever get the chance to listen to that commentary by Burton he explains the ending extremely well, as being bittersweet.Jack Nicholson deserves an entire comment alone on his pitch-perfect performance as The Joker, but he was just perfect. The writers of the movie didn't get it perfect and kind of took the cheap way out of things. At first, it's The Joker getting revenge on the people who wronged him, but soon after it swerves into a full-blown ego contest between him and Batman: "Why does a grown man dressed as a bat get all my press?" etc. This resulted in a funny gag involving different ways that he can destroy a television set.And, Mr. Keaton, makes a great Batman/Bruce Wayne. There's a sadness and mystery to him, and he makes the absurd notion of a guy dressed up as a bat believable.So even though Batman Begins is better, and will always seem to be brought up whenever you mention any of the 1989-1997 films, this first big screen vision of the Batman is great on its own rights.My rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hollywood classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1989, Tim Burton's Batman holds up very well 22 years after its release and I actually prefer it over Christopher Nolan's re-entry, as interesting as his vision is. As for Joel Schumaker's stunning though at times silly vision of Batman, I try to forget about those films. Burton's first Batman is pure escapism in a sort of old fashion way. No CGI to be seen here and it works better that way. It's no surprise to me that Burton's Batman has been compared to Citizen Kane (1941) or The Maltese Falcon (1941), Burton and production designer Anton Furst take you into a dark world filled with crime and also mystery. Other films at the time such as Blade Runner (1982) and Brazil (1985) had already experimented with the classic film noir style, done in a sort of retro/futuristic way but Anton Furst's design for Gothem City truly feels like you are viewing a modern retelling of the classic noir films from the 40s.Sam Hamm's script is solid and while it has been the target for criticism, I feel that he did a nice job, his dialog is very witty at times and a little over the top but it's appropriate, particularly with Jack Napiar/ The Joker. The performances are actually quite impressive and even better then what Chris Nolan got out of his actors but that's just an opinion. Micheal Keaton, while controversial and unusual at the time, gives a really good performance, he is very shy and sensitive which is the Bruce Wayne that I respond to the most. Jack Nicholson really needs no analysis for his work here, he is just perfect that putting into words is pointless. His joker is fun and even believable, Jack is just as great of an actor as James Cagney in my mind. Kim Basinger is actually much better then she is given credit for, her and Keaton work well together. The rest of the cast really are supporting characters, some are familiar to the Batman story, some are new. One of them being Alexander Knox. Robert Wahl plays a very likable guy who the other characters have a hard time taking seriously. His eagerness to find Batman and win his Pulitzer prize is well done and is a very down to earth performance, which I guess is what the movie needed.As for Tim Burton's direction, he handles the actors very well and as for the technical work, I have mixed feelings about that. A lot of moments have really well choreographed camera work but there are a couple of zoom in shots that I felt were sloppy and a little unnecessary. There are a couple of matte painting shots that may not hold up as well today but none of this really matters, it still works. Of course, Danny Elfman's score left me speechless. He combines the fun, the adventurous and the dark side of Batman into one piece. I recommend buying the soundtrack with Elfman's score on it, it's amazing!! I think that Batman may be the best Hollywood movie of the late 80s and I still consider it a favorite from my childhood. I know that comic book purists prefer Nolan's Batman but as just a movie guy who loves old fashion Hollywood movies, this one appeals more to my taste. Batman deserves its comparison with Citizen Kane or any other Hollywood masterpiece as far as I'm concerned, even Casablanca (1942) or The Godfather (1972). Burton's 1992 sequel, Batman Returns is equally as great and even takes the series into a direction that's more complex and provoking which Joel Shumaker ignored. While Christopher Nolan's Batman films have stolen the popularity of Burton's, I would argue that his will go down in history as Hollywood classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keaton, Nicholson, Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burton opens Batman with a scene which recalls The original animation series (also the scene Batman stands on a high-rise building), so you almost get that you won't be disappointed, because it is a signal that the director is 'conscious'. On the rooftop, two muggers and The Dark Knight. The atmosphere? Misty, dreadful, unsafe and mysterious places that thrill you, the mobsters seesaw between being colorful and being dark etc. However, this is not a shallow or childish adaptation. Yes, may be to compare Burton's Batman movies with Nolan's Batman movies are wrong, but I want to say a few things. Nolan's Batman movies were fundamental reconstructions, but they were very conventional on all counts. Tim Burton's Batman movies are not, those movies are peculiar. By the way, I am one of the people who say that the best Batman was Michael Keaton. Nolan is interested in ideas, Burton is interested in details. If you have seen The Dark Knight, remember Two-Face's screen time for example or Joker character was not highlighted. Tim Burton's characters are interpreted in great detail, with their actions, accessories (my favorite is the dentures), costumes (the best Batman costume is here), personalities etc. Plus the story telling (as said for example, the tone of the movie is very similar with the animation series or comic book) Jack Nicholson deserves all the titles as Joker. A superhuman performance. I would not just say that Jack Nicholson is pretty good as Joker. The scenes he appears are riot of colors, I love this. By the way, Tim Burton shows us the personality of Joker by only one scene, the goodbye talking when he visits Vicki Vale in her house. By the way, in the final, we hear a mysterious and sad sound and the commissioner's face when he finds out. That scene effected me when I watched it for the first time, I was almost a child. After Nicholson, to play Joker would be unthinkable, but Heath Ledger did it that happens once in a blue moon. Watching this new Joker was very amusing, interesting and Heath Ledger's acting was like Daniel Day Lewis style, excellent, but my favorite Joker is always Jack Nicholson. By the way, I don't want to compare Nicholson with Ledger, but want to say that Burton's Joker is much more active than Nolan's Joker. Burton's Joker does many crazy and very interesting things. He kills a mafia boss in a funny and also very sad way, he reshapes hundreds of photos, paints the restaurant (this scene deserves being put in the cinema anthology) Jack Nicholson's Joker is teaser, acute minded, so he leads Batman on a merry chase. Thus, Batman Joker encounter does not become disappointing. You care about what will happen, because you want Joker to be caught, on the other side, may be because of your sympathy for Nicholson or for his Joker character (he has an accident, he losses his magnetism, so you cannot dislike him exactly), you don't want him to be caught or dead. While I was watching the movie for the first time, years years ago, I pleased every time, when Joker dodges Batman. May be it is because you know that if Joker is caught or killed, the movie ends. Action scenes are may be less and mild, but great, so we get that Burton is good at making action scenes too. I love the restaurant scene, the chase scene comes next and the scenes which Batplane arises are great too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the sequels and the fanfare of the reboot, this remains my favorite Batman movie.I admittedly had initial concerns over Michael Keaton in the role, but I quickly warmed up to the actor as Bruce Wayne, and once the suit went on, his performance was spot on. Nicholson as the Joker was solid casting, and he gave a brilliant performance.This movie was just fun, and a completely different feel from "The Dark Knight". Whereas Dark Knight was endlessly gritty and tense, "Batman" was both dramatic and fun. There were plenty of light moments to break the tension of the Joker's murder and mayhem. In Dark Knight, there were no tension breakers at all. I'm a tremendous Batman fan (the comic character) and during Dark Knight I felt like I was sitting through an endurance contest rather than something I'd assumed would be entertainment. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking Dark Knight ... it was a tremendous achievement. But the mood was very different than the original "Batman", and I just find that I preferred the mood of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when i was a kid and i got this on video and i watched it so many times. But later, video got deleted :(. Well about 7 years i bought it for DVD and it was so huge masterpiece, what i didn't notice. This classical film should be top 250. Characters are so good. Michael Keaton is the best Batman by far. Jack Nicholson has really great lines and hes really good as The Joker. A reason why this movie is such a great is cause of its music sequences. This is what we need, we need music all the time in the movies. Other reason is its really entertaining with epic humors by The Joker. The story is great. Batman notices that Joker is the guy, who killed his parents." Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight" is classic. The end of the film is a full off excellent action and it ends really good with great music.A movie is not hard to make. It just needs to get great director as Tim Burton and great actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I Want You To Tell All Your Friends About Me...I'm Batman!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many, the superhero film craze began with, Superman: The Movie. But not for me. I was not yet born when Superman flew into theaters. So for my own part it all began in 1989, with the release of Batman. Fortunately not titled, Batman: The Movie.As you can imagine, I saw the movie when I was a kid and loved it. I still enjoy it today, but on a much deeper level that can only come from age. And while it may not be of the caliber of, "The Dark Knight" few comic book films are or ever will reach that kind of perfection. And besides in the late 80's Hollywood was not yet making pictures of that magnitude. Before you, reader, roll your eyes, and think great another "Dark Knighter", I assure you I will not compare the two films, and after this paragraph, I shall mention TDK no more.Now, I would like to talk about the plot, cast, score, and all the other things that make this a great film. And still memorable some 20 years later. Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, while not without it's flaws is quite good. And the film is largely based on Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's 1988, Batman masterpiece: "Batman: The Killing Joke". This film really nails the spirit of the of the world of Batman.(I am a huge Batman fan, can't you tell?"-MM-) And the sets and direction and lighting all combine to make for a very convincing Gotham City. Some much work, from so many talented people went into creating this world, I am flabbergasted to think about it.The cast is almost perfect. Michael Keaton, before this known best as a comedic actor, plays the brooding Bruce Wayne excellently. And somehow manages to out do that as the caped crusader. I mean he managed to wear a silly rubber suit and come off as one terrifying badass. And Jack Nicholson, proves what a talented actor he is with his dark and disturbing portrayal as The Clown Prince Of Crime, AKA, The Joker, Batman's greatest foe. Even the supporting cast is good. Kim Basinger as the classic 1940's Batman love interest Vicki Vale. And in a surprising choice we have Mr. Lando Calrissian himself as Harvey Dent, the once and future villain Two-Face. And that is only scratching the surface of the cast.The score, courtesy of Danny Elfman, fit's the film very well. In my humble opinion, it is one of his best. The music of Prince is interesting if a little strange. Overall, Batman has to be one of my favorite superhero films. Even now after so many more be unleashed upon the world. If you are a Batman fan or a fan of good films in general you could do worse than watch Batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first true Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I am not really a Tim Burton fan, I have been dying to watch his 1989 take on the Dark Knight. After seeing it, I enjoyed it.I thought Michael Keaton did an excellent job portraying Batman/Bruce Wayne and Jack Nicholson portraying the Joker. One scene I like is when one of the crooks was being held up by Batman said: "Who are you?" and Batman says: "I'm Batman." I do have to agree that it is a serious comic book movie, very faithful to the original comic books.I also consider this movie to be the first "official" Batman movie because it was not only the first released by Warner Bros., but the first based off the source material (although there was a Batman movie back in 1966, that was actually based off the TV series of the 1960s.)It's also a little bit of a shame Tim Burton is now doing a take on my favourite children's book Alice in Wonderland, because Disney will be releasing it and I like their 1951 animated cartoon version, although the movie did screw up the book.I thought some of the action scenes were great, like Batman getting chased by the Joker's goons and Batman fighting against the Joker. For any fan of Batman, this is an essential movie to watch. As a fan myself, I rate it 10 out of 10. I'll be watching the sequel Batman Returns (also directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton as Batman) and I'll comment on that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman(1989) vs Dark Knight(2008)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the recent press storm and domination at the box office of The Dark Knight I tried to get my head around comparing the two films. I'll be clear, I disregard films 3 and 4 of the original franchise,(ie. Val Kilmer and George Clooney as Batman), these were terrible films which pale next to Michael Keatons portrayal.Everyone went a little crazy about Heath Ledger's posthumous portrayal of the Joker, however now that I've seen the film, I really can't agree. He looks out of his depth and just doesn't carry it off. Jack Nicholson was born to play that role, he lives and breathes that part in his daily life, so all they had to do was add some makeup and a facial prosthetic to increase the size of that already huge grin and he was ready to go.To start with thats where the Burton films have an edge, beyond that there's Batman himself. Just like the Bond series, where there has been a reinvention and the casting of a young talent, Connery, for me and like many others, is the original and best Bond. The same goes for Batman, in terms of film adaptations, Keaton is the most versatile and adept at playing Bruce Wayne and Batman. For starters you just have to reference Beetlejuice and you'' see a screen stealing performance. Upon its release in 1989, Burton and Keaton, in that order, took Batman to a darker place in the conscious of the general non-comic reading public. Keatons Bruce Wayne, was shy, yet outspoken and slyly comedic at the same time. Current less observant Dark Knight fans will fail to notice this, as its something called depth, which current Batman(Christian Bale) only barely captures. As Batman, Keaton is hard and to the point with shades of Bruce coming through when he interacts. All Bale can muster is a silly lower and throaty voice. Given, the gadgets and cars have come along in technology, and thats great, we'd all love material that reacts to electricity and allows us to have a cape, which becomes a hand glider....but it doesn't hide some cinematic flaws.Before I draw a close on the bad points of the new film, I'd like to honourably mention Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent. It was awfully scripted, and post burning of the face scene, where his injured eye is moving around like something from 'The Mummy', that was just hard to watch, after seeing a potentially great film, move into the 'good' category.The better points of the film are many, and in particular Michael Caine(as Alfred) and Morgan Freeman(as Lucius Fox). The original Alfred(Michael Gough), was excellent, but Caine produces some of the best one liners available. They really should have used more of him, as he brought the air of a master with him.I read a review which compared the Dark Knight with 'Empire Strikes Back', 'Jaws', 'The Godfather', that person, who was English, should really sit with the stereotype middle American, ie stupid. Those films are cinematic reference points, in breaking new ground. The Dark Knight really isn't, its on a bandwagon of the new action genre, ie the one that the Bourne series really brought into the mainstream.Both films are great, in many ways, but for me, the 1989 version is the winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Batman. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Joel Schumacher got his hands on the franchise, Tim Burton directed this tour de force of cinematic brilliance. Try though I may, I have not one criticism of this movie. Tim brought his now trademark darkness to the film, and used it well. The best part of this film is, without doubt, Jack Nickelson's Joker. While he may not have the physical stature that most would picture when the hear the name "Joker", he more than made up for this in his character. Anyone who saw Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker and thought it was superior to Jack Nickelson's, you are, quite simply, incorrect. This is without doubt the best Batman film thus far. Period. To those of you who have not seen this film, I implore you to go out and rent it. Now. To those of you who have seen it already, go out and rent it again. Now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Super-Hero Flick Ever......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have watched this movie about a hundred thousand times in my childhood and it still is always as entertaining to me as it was when I was younger. Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker is amazing, I couldn't believe how sadistic he made the infamous Joker character into. Michael Keaton (besides Adam West) is the real Batman to me, his Bruce Wayne character was excellent and he played the Dark Knight beautifully. Kim Basinger and Robert Wuhl played great supporters as Vicki Vale and Alexander Knox, the two reporters that are just dying to find out about the winged crusader. Tim Burton did an excellent job in portraying a dark, gloomy, Gotham City and he made the characters come to life and almost jump off the screen at you, great stuff by a great director. Burton has always had that Gothic approach in most of his movies and it fits beautifully here. I couldn't ask for any better of an action flick with a superstar cast than this. I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the Batman legacy and is always open to view the different interpretations that filmmakers and the like have had of the Dark Knight over the years. Great Stuff. 10 out of 10 stars no doubt!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is still the best Batman film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Batman fan I can understand where most of the fans are coming from with their passion for Batman Begins. Don't get me wrong, I loved Batman Begins, but it doesn't top Tim Burton's film from 1989. Burton makes an interesting decision by combining the original Bob Kane/Bill Finger comics from 1939 and the early '40s, Frank Miller's work on Batman from the '80s, and his own take on the character.The film's plot is about Batman battling his first major villain, the Joker. In the beginning of the film we can see that Gotham City is in dept, the police force is corrupted, and the mafia controls everything. A friendly/naive family cannot roam the streets without being mugged or approached by hookers. It isn't a pretty place. The Joker is actually Jack Napier. Napier was mob boss Carl Grissom's (Jack Palance) right hand man before falling into a vat of chemicals and turning into the psychotic Joker.While the film does have its flaws you really can't hold it against it because Batman Begins has flaws of its own. Yes, the relationship between Batman and Commissioner Gordon isn't explored in this film. But, if you recall in Batman Begins the character of Scarecrow doesn't really do anything special. He is almost a waste! So, both films aren't perfect.Additionally, the film benefits a lot from its moments. I really love the scene in which Batman crashes through the window and rescues Vicky Vale. And, how about when he takes her to the bat cave? There are other great moments in this film that I really love, but I don't have time to get into. It is what you would call a very memorable film. There's a lot of images and moments that stay with you. I don't know if I can say the same about Begins.RATING: 4 (****) out of (****) The sets in this film created by the late Anton Furst are amazing. The musical score by Danny Elfman is amazing as well. Michael Keaton is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman. While, he may not be physically what Batman is supposed to be, I do feel that his performance was flawless. Jack Nicholson is great in everything he does. Kim Basinger was hot and Michael Gough's Alfred was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do I Look Like I'm Joking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is my favorite DC character and when it comes to movies based on the caped crusader, you guaranteed to get a slew of options. From the flashy, campy nature of the 60s movie, to the cornball, over the top manner of the Joel Schumacher films, to the dark, brilliantly animated atmosphere of the "Timmverse" films, Batman has had his share of makeovers throughout the years, but none can come close to the thrilling, Gothic quality of Tim Burton's 1989 masterpiece. In my opinion (light your torches), I think it is superior to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, and to this day, it still remains my absolute favorite Batman representation. Why else would I have a poster of the old Batman logo hanging on my bedroom wall? The look of this film perfectly showcases Tim Burton's macabre imagination. The design of the city parallels that of the 1927 science fiction landmark Metropolis or the 1920 German expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. It's one of my favorite looks for a city and it's a pity they didn't use the stylized, dark look of the city for Schumacher's films. I also admire the film's overall tone and feeling. Even though it's a Batman film (the first in a series), it still feels like a Tim Burton film, and Burton does a good job of re-imagining Batman as if he was his own creation rather than Bob Kane's. He treats Batsy with love and affection and of course comic book nuts will get all over the film for not following the source material closely, but this one still has it where it counts. In this film, the characters come first, and this film has some of the best you will ever see grace the screen. Michael Keaton very well might be my favorite Batman. Sure, the animated series Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy) was excellent and Christian Bale is okay with his dark, raspy voice, but Keaton proves that you can be a calm, collective Batman yet still be threatening and terrifying at the same time. He goes around in the cape and cowl smirking and giving off menacing grins to thugs and you can really tell that he enjoys playing the role. It's shocking that people thought he wasn't a good choice to play the dark hero. I thought he was spot on, really fit for the role. He did play Beetlejuice after all! All the other players are fantastic as well. Jack Nicholson's Joker is scary and funny as heck and with a permanent grin on his face, he really gives you the shivers. Like Keaton, you can really tell he enjoys playing the villainous clown prince of crime. He's always what I imagined the Joker being like in movie form, equipped with dangerous laughing gas and chattering teeth! I also like Billy Dee Williams, Kim Basinger, Pat Hingle and Michael Gough in their respective roles, and who could forget Danny Elfman's top notch score mixed in with those catchy, late 80s Prince songs. Batman is a great movie, and the impetus that led to other superhero films being made. I like to think that one day, Tim Burton will make another Batman flick, but I'm not holding my breath. Hopefully, somewhere down the road, a Batman reboot will come along that not only mixes in the contemporary nature of the comics and the Nolan films, but the dark, demented and overpowering nature of the Burton films. It would make for quite a Batman we have never seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Excels As The Joker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is a film directed by Tim Burton. Based on the DC Comics character of the same name, the film stars Michael Keaton in the title role, as well as Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, and Jack Palance. The film, in which Batman deals with the rise of a costumed criminal known as "The Joker".As a child, Bruce Wayne witnesses his parents killed by a young criminal. He vows to avenge their deaths in a lifelong battle against crime in the guise of Batman while concealing his secret identity, working in Wayne Enterprises. Years later, Gotham City is under control by crime boss Carl Grissom. Despite the best efforts of newly-elected district attorney Harvey Dent and police commissioner James Gordon, the Gotham City Police Department remains corrupt. Reporter Alexander Knox and photo-journalist Vicki Vale begin investigating the rumors of a shadowy vigilante figure dressed as a bat who has been terrifying criminals throughout the city.Vicki and Knox attend a benefit at Wayne Manor, where Bruce is taken by Vicki's charms. Knox, however, appears somewhat jealous of the chemistry between Bruce and Vicki. That same night, Grissom's second in command, Jack Napier, is sent to raid the Axis Chemicals factory. After the police receive a tip-off and arrive to arrest him, Jack realizes he has been set-up by his boss, angered by his affair with Grissom's mistress. In the midst of the shoot-out, Batman arrives and takes out Jack's henchmen.In a bizarre accident caused by his own ricocheting bullet, deflected by Batman's metal-reinforced gauntlet, Jack's face is ripped open. Reeling from the pain, he topples over a platform rail but manages to grab a lower rail with one hand. Batman momentarily clutches Jack's free hand, but the grip is soon broken, and he falls into a large vat containing an unknown chemical solution. Shortly thereafter, he emerges from an adjacent reservoir, his hair and skin discolored. Following a surgical attempt to repair his face, Jack is left with a permanent and twisted grin, giving him the appearance of a grotesque clown. Driven insane, he fashions himself as "the Joker".After killing Grissom, the Joker takes over his empire and holds the city at his mercy by chemically altering everyday hygiene products, causing those using a certain combination of products to laugh to death. Batman attempts to track down the Joker, who has become romantically interested in Vicki. It is revealed that the Joker, as a young criminal, was the man who killed Bruce's parents. Batman destroys the factory the Joker used to make the poisoned products. The Joker holds a parade through Gotham, luring its citizens on to its streets by dispensing money, intending to kill them with lethal gas. Batman foils his plan, but the Joker kidnaps Vicki and takes her to the top of a cathedral church. After a fight with Batman, the Joker falls to his death from the bell tower. Commissioner Gordon unveils the Bat-Signal along with a note from Batman read by Harvey Dent, promising to defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again.A dark and refreshing interpretation of one of comic kingdom's most beloved characters, Batman successfully wiped away the memory of the camp 1960s television show and proved that comic book movies can be highly entertaining viewing.The performances in the film is good except for Jack Nicholson,which is great since his portrayal of Joker too often overshadows the main character.That alone is one reason why the movie deserves a 10/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinema Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is easily one of my favorite movies not just for superheros, but of all-time. I LOVE this movie and always have. Back when I was a child in the pre-Nolan days, I was an avid fan of Batman: The Animated Series and the Adam West Batman I found out there were Batman movies from the 1980-90's and the first of those I watched was Batman. Ever sense that day I have watched it at least a dozen times and love it more after every viewing.Now, What I like about this movie is 1. The Actors and Actresses. I find Keatons Batman and Bruce Wayne to be by far the best performance of a Batman actor and the best of his career. And of course you got Jack Nicholson, God he is amazing in this movie and I feel like he is somewhat better than Heath Ledger. He just eats up every scene he is in. And than who have Michael Gough, Robert Whul, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance who are all great and I wish Williams and Whul would have Returned in later Batman films. The Only actor who I didn't really enjoy was Pat Hingle, but thats because of his performance as Gordon. And Bassinger was very good, not her best performance but still very good. 2. The Sets. Batman is Beautiful and has a great art-deco noir Gothic feel that just sucks you in to this hell on earth Gotham. I also love the Bat-Mobile the bat-suit and the Bat-wing. And I like how it mixes both an 80's and 40's feel to the city. 3. Story. Just a classic good vs. evil story that never gets old. 4. the Music. Now the one thing that is Dated is the prince music, but the only major scene its in is the museum scene. But I am talking about one of the greatest movie scores ever my Danny Elfman that fits the style of the movie so perfectly.In Conclusion, Batman is an action packed stylish superhero movie with all time great performances. Yes, there are flaws but there not major and don't distract you from the movie. So I give it a 10/10 and if you haven't seen it, please check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Batman Lovers Unite And Take Over!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm here to gather what I hope to be a large, but probably isn't, community of film lovers who agree that Batman and Batman Returns are the finest in the Batman film universe. I'm speaking to those folks who are somewhat bored with Nolan's take on the Caped Crusader and miss the original approach. Now, don't get me wrong. Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are good movies. There is no denying this utter fact, but my heart will always worship the first go around, starting with Batman and ending with Batman Forever(screw you, I know it's sillier and what not but I love it to death). One of my biggest disagreements with Nolan and his Batman world is Chicago as Gotham City. I just can't subscribe to it. I miss Burton's models. I miss this Gothic metropolis. I know Chi- town too well. It's too sunny, it's not Gotham City. Burton turned Gotham into eye candy and I really really miss that. Nolan is a fine film maker, but lacks the knack for pulling me into this all new realm of fantasy. One of the likes that I've never seen before. Because of this, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight bore me, a bit. Good movies, but nothing spectacular. Now, I'm ready for it. Come at me! Have at you! I may flinch a bit, but I can take it. Oh, and something I can bow down to that seems universal: Batman &amp; Robin doesn't work to an embarrassing degree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking anomaly of production and vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying as a huge movie buff, this is my favorite movie of all time. Usually making a choice like that isn't easy, but it wins my #1 spot in spades. The true beauty behind Batman 1989 is Burton's flavor. Letting a non-traditionalist visionary like Burton direct Batman was a big risk for Warner Bros considering all the expectations that inevitably would be riding on it. Burton was allowed to reinvent the substance of everything Batman by twisting it into a dark, evil paradox. He didn't just make a movie about Batman, he changed the public's idea of what Batman should be forever. No other comic book movie can make a claim that touches that.Another beautiful element of this movie is its mix of Gothic fantasy and shoot 'em up action. Even though Burton was given most creative control, he knew he had to give this film all the explosive action that's typical for a late 80's high budget action thriller. So it comes across as Tim Burton in overdrive, in which he pushed his own limits of potential. Batman thrives from its late 80's production. This is when action movie production was at an all time high, and before unnatural computer generated effects most new action films suffer from. So despite its over the top sequences, it still has a sense of truth about it. One action sequence I consider one of the coolest ever is when The Batmobile drives into the Joker's chemical factory, henchmen start shooting at it with machine guns, it stops, drops some mines, then drives out while the entire complex is blowing up (awesome!) There is another aspect of this film that is excellent but often unnoticed compared to the strength and drive of the storytelling. That's how this film completely manipulates the viewer's sense of time. Burton is a master at this. It routinely changes from a dark, saddened 1940's big city feel to a glossed over, gritty, material late 80's. Burton transformed much of The Joker's character to model a 1940's gangster boss, which I think is a neat creative throwback and fitting addition. Many of the Joker's men resemble Al Capone style cronies and carry classic weapons like Tommy Guns, .45 pistols, and revolvers.Another great element of this film is its occasional sense of lighthearted fun, despite all the darkness. This is present during the Joker party scenes with Prince music (the one in the art gallery is the best). I love how The Joker was transformed into a more dynamic character. He's insane, but also has an appreciation for art, and is a genius chemical expert. Nicholson's performance as The Joker was superb and unmatchable by any standards. He made The Joker fun, evil, crazy, but also added a sense of gentlemen class to the character. His wicked Joker laugh is incredible to say the least. His creative one liners are also fun and unexpected, such as "there's another rooster in the hen house" and "ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?" Danny Elfman's brilliant, gracefully haunting score is an undeniable driving force behind this movie. The intro with this score takes the viewer through dark tunnel-like grooves that eventually end up being the Batman symbol. This is a superb sequence and very innovative for the time, influencing many similar scenes in future films. Another thing we cannot forget is the Batmobile! It's too bad there's no academy award for vehicle design because that was deserved! It's sleek, curvaceous, all black, menacing, and powered by a jet thruster. It looks like a fighter jet on wheels with tail fins.This is my best attempt to describe in words what makes this film great, although it's impossible to note everything. Batman 1989 is a masterfully entertaining super film in every sense. Hopefully someday we will see something like it again in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive Batman film. Classy and imaginative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah Batman. One of the best superhero films of all time. Tim Burton's Batman is the definitive Batman. You want to know why? Well, it's certainly better than any Batman film adaptation before it. It's also better than anything released after it and that includes the grossly overrated The Dark Knight (2008). This Batman has style and intelligence. Michael Keaton isn't the brute that Christian Bale is. Keaton looks and acts the part. When you look at him in this film you believe that he is rich. You also believe that he has a hidden side to him. When you look at Bale you don't see any of this. Keaton's Bruce Wayne has a romantic relationship with Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale. Bayle's Wayne is neither charming nor lovable. He isn't even in a relationship. Tim Burton happens to be a better director than Christopher Nolan. Burton delivers the complete film package while all Nolan can deliver is a bit of impressive stuntwork. Burton's Gotham City is imaginative while Nolan's Gotham is Chicago. Burton is a visionary director. He delivers unforgettable and unusual images. Nolan on the other hand is not a visionary. He keeps ripping off Blade Runner (1982) and The Matrix (1999), but he still can't deliver. Danny Elfman's score is truly memorable while Hans Zimmer's score is unmemorable. Zimmer hasn't provided a good score since Thelma &amp; Louise (1991). Oh and Keaton's Batman has a classy Batmobile with plenty of much-needed gadgets. Bayle's Batmobile is a plastic-looking tank on wheels that can't survive a single hit from a rocket launcher. And now to the Joker. Heath Ledger's Joker is sick and over the top. He gets pleasure only out of acting like a bully. How he recruited all those loyal henchmen we'll never know. It seems the only one who drove him mad was his abusive father. And this was enough to turn him into the Joker? Something doesn't add up here. Ledger obviously ripped off some of Jack Nicholson's performance for his own, yet some fools out there keep saying that Ledger's Joker is better. Nicholson's Joker is smart and street-wise. He can come up with brilliant plans. The only thing Ledger's Joker can do is blow things up. Oh and we also know how Nicholson's Joker recruited all those loyal henchmen. Jack Nicholson is one of the best actors ever, and he's much better than Ledger. Just compare their resumes. The supporting characters in Batman are also better than in The Dark Knight. I can go on and on with more examples, but the point is that Batman remains the definitive film in the franchise. After all, it was the only comic book film to be included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's blockbuster that's dark and moody and mostly it's carried by Nicholson's scene stealing Joker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far 1989's original "Batman" from director Tim Burton is without a doubt the best film made of the franchise even though it's very dark and moody. From the opening sequence when Gotham City is shown you see the backdrop as dark and the sets in many scenes featured art and odd toys. Really Burton was a mastermind at skewing one's world view with this film by using an old technique from German cinema called mis-en-scene meaning the dark mood sets the tone for a film. Clearly aside from the art and dark sets that filled the scenes of Gotham City the darkness showed in the characters especially with "Batman" a man with a dark past who lives in the night shadows that features a city of pain yet this is a character that is always on the side of justice. Enter Michael Keaton who in my opinion has been by far the best "Batman" for the way he took and showed how bottled up the character could be with sadness yet his comedic sensibility mixed well with his dark explosive style. Also Keaton showed with ease just how his alter ego Bruce Wayne could really standout as a nice and believable rich playboy. We also see "Batman" as such an unusual man living in a world of pain as when Wayne meets the lovely and attractive Vicki Vale(played wonderful by Kim Basinger)he on one side wants to fall in love like a normal person, but yet due to his nightly obligations of fighting crime as "Batman" he cannot love in a simple world. Also to add to the problem he must save Gotham from the wild and freaky "Joker" and he learns much about his arch rival Bruce/Batman even discovers a dark past secret a tragedy that's connected to the clown prince of crime.Just to mention "The Joker" who's my favorite "Batman" villain simply for his laughing and lovable over the top clown style of pranks and gags. But stop the press enter the granddaddy of them all that's Jack Nicholson as "The Joker" the guy who was the ace in "Batman's" deck. "The Joker" so evil yet so liked for his patent satanic majesty style. With Jack who's the finest and best actor in my opinion to ever live who takes each role personal and does the character over the top by doing many scenes with a different style he clearly made the character become full circle. Nicholson himself "Considered his work as "The Joker" a piece of pop art. I for one like many and agree that it was one of the best performances in film history especially for a villain, now who else could have done "The Joker" better than Jack? Most would agree with me nobody! Overall this blockbuster is thrilling and the action is fast paced and the humor provided pumps very dark and strangely as Burton really mixed things well by making this film dark and edgy showing that the world is never normal and that the mind isn't always understood in a complex world. Yet in the end a gloomy story has a happy ending proving that he and many like "Batman" live on a cloud above us! Really in my opinion the best "Batman" film ever made due to it's darkness and secrets, the acting, direction, and writing is also top notch and the icing on the cake was applied by Nicholson's scene stealing performance as "The Joker" certainly one of the best in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people are enchanted by comics and superheroes, I'm not one of those people, at least most of the time. This is not one of those exceptions. To me this movie is just nothing really special.The acting was good but to a certain point. There is really no depth in the acting here like most superhero/comic movies. Jack Nicholson is above average in here with his uncanny charm but not really anything were you would say wow. His performance does not really freak anybody out or give any chills to anyone. It is really more of a laughable performance than a villainous performance that will stay with you. Michael Keaton is a very good Batman, definitely better than Kimer and Clooney, but something just feels of with him in the movie. To me he is not the problem though, it is the people that surrounded him in the making of this. Kim Bassinger is Kim Bassinger she is not good actress by any stretch of the imagination, at least in here. To me this cast was more of a way to fill seats more than anything else.The directing was above average. It is made in a very appealing way for comic book fans but not really for anybody else. The way this movie is directed is done in a very limited way. There is just no depth or purpose of any kind. It is just pure entertainment which to me is not very entertaining at all. I give credit to Burton for staying true to the comics but he still did not provide enough of a balance for me to be in awe.The writing was the way you would expect out of this movie. It was average with an average plot. It is just pure good vs. evil which I like to see once in a while myself but not something I would go after. The one good thing I can say about the script is that it does not take itself very seriously which is the most appealing thing about this movie. Yet it fails at showing the complexities of Batman which has really disappointed in most of the Batman movies(except Batman Begins and The Dark Knight). The movie also had a comic book style cinematography, with OK music.Overall it was an above average movie and is good enough visually to give it a good rating. It is not a horrible movie but don't expect too much if you are thinking this movie is like the recent Batman movies. To me this movie is more of a small child's fantasy than anything else which is OK for that child. Maybe we sometimes need to escape into a small child's fantasy though.</fullReview>

The music score of the film is one of the many big highlights of the movie because it compliments the scenes so well. The cast do a wonderful job in their respective roles and each suit their characters that they portray. The film actually looks fantastic and is made for the big screen and even though I have the film on DVD I would still watch it again at my local cinema if they ever re-released it. This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again because it flows nicely and has so many scenes that I love to watch. This film is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Burton's better films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is known for his creepy and bizarre characters/creations. Batman is no exception, as he takes the popular children's comic book series and turns it into a morbid and dark, surreal version, where crime is high and people are afraid to go outside. Much of the film takes place at night and in the industrial areas of the fictional Gotham city. Micheal Keaton (Beetlejuice) and Jack Nicholson (The Shining), are both excellent actors and the film is thrilling from beginning to end. The soundtrack by Danny Elfman added to the suspenseful atmosphere. The only flaw in the movie was that as usual, the cliché idea of an "evil chemical factory" was used, which has been done countless times before. The concept was very popular in the early eighties to late nineties (The Children, Goosebumps: Welcome to Dead House, The Secret World of Alex Mack, etc.) Overall, Batman is definitely worth watching, and it deserves the IMDb user ratings it currently has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tim Burton Classic that truly introduced Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this film the media perception of Batman was that of a cartoony character but this film thanks to Tim Burton introduced us to The Dark Knight that is Batman. This film shows Batman facing his most feared nemesis The Joker while as Bruce Wayne he attempts to lead as normal a life as possible. Now there was a lot of uproar to Michael Keaton as Batman before the film but after this film all doubts were forgotten. He is absolutely superb as both Bruce Wayne and Batman and really emphasised this new Gothic type serious character. Now the real strength of this film is Jack Nicholson's Joker, he is just perfect for this film and for this new Batman this Joker was the key counter for him and the performance was perfect and Nicholson was the perfect person to play The Joker. Kim Bassinger as Vicki Vale was decent but not fantastic and she was reasonable in her role, the character of Knox was decent too and neither took anything away from the film and added something to it. The story was alright with the transformation to the Joker but his motivations weren't really that believable and weren't an important part of the film. The script is really good and both Keaton and especially Nicholson have great lines that once again just fits this film magnificently. For 1989 the style is fantastic also the Danny Elfman score is legendary and the look of Gotham overall fits the Gothic film that this is which contrasts well with the prince songs. This is a fantastic film that still stands up now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original and Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without doubt the best film in the original Batman franchise. Michael Keaton was a brilliant actor to play Batman. Tim Burton did an excellent job on directed this masterpiece. The Joker, played by Jack Nicholson, was well played. I liked the fact that it showed the creation of the Joker from gangster Jack Napier to the 'Clown Prince of Crime'. The film's score written by Danny Elfman (composer of the Simpsons theme tune), is wonderfully dark and really matches the scenes of the movie such as the Battle at Axis Chemicals, my favourite scene. The songs performed by Prince were good too. The supporting cast was well played with veteran actor Jack Palance as crime lord Carl Grissom, William Hootkins as corrupt police officer Lt Max Eckhardt and Tracey Walter as Bob the Goon. Kim Basinger was gorgeous as Bruce Wayne's love interest. Overall, this film is one of the best superhero films of all time and will remain as a classic for years to come. A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton did a spectacular job when he Directed this, it is dark, gloomy, brilliantly acted (especially Jack Nicholson), and the whole movie was just amazingly done, it is one of my all time favorite films ever made.Lately in Gotham City, there have been some mysterious Bat sightings by criminals (who are caught by the mysterious Bat), and the police are investigating the mysterious events that are occurring, than a new criminal named The Joker (Jack Nicholson) starts to wreak havoc around the city including some peculiar murders involving a weird laughing Gas, than Batman (Michael Keaton) who is also Bruce Wayne, a famous millionaire, starts to try and solve the mystery and trying to catch The Joker and to make matters worse for Bruce a very attractive reporter named Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) starts to try solve the mysterious events...Micael Keaton is great as Batman and Bruce Wayne, he really portrays his character fantastically, and is well supported by Kim Basinger and Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough is really good as Bruce's loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth, but the one who steals the show is Jack Nicholson as The Joker, he plays the character tremendously and will always be remembered for his role, and in my opinion should have won an Oscar for his performance."Batman' is a fabulous film and it never drags on, it always keeps you interested in the storyline, the actions scenes are very well done, but Danny Elfmen's Musical score was amazing and is very memorable and I completely love it.This film is not just for hardcore fans (like myself), of the Batman series, this film can be enjoyed by anyone. So if you haven't seen it, definitely go rent it, buy it, its a cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly well done movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! Were to start with this amazingly well done movie. The actors are perfect in their roles, to me Keaton is Wayne and Nicholson is the Joker. But most of the credit should go to Tim Burton for creating such a unique city, it's like the 50's, but with late 80's technology.When I was about 6-7 years old I was lucky enough to see this movie on TV, and afterwards I thought it was the best movie ever made and batman was my new idol. Also I thought the Joker was really funny. Not so long ago I watched this movie again (about 3 years since last time) and I still thought it was great, although I didn't find the Joker as funny, now I thought he was more evil.A really good thing about this movie is the music, it is some of the best music ever in a movie. And thats really good cause it brings a certain touch to the movie, makes it more original, unique. The story in this film is not the best ever or something like that, it's very basic for a superhero movie. A masked vigilante dressed up as a bat haunts the criminals in Gotham City and the police are looking for this Bat dressed man called Batman. then there is a scene at a chemistry factory were mobsters break in to destroy evidence but the police and Batman finds out. It ends up with the bad guy leader falling down into acid and later gets a plastic surgery, but the outcome of the surgery is that it looks like he's always smiling. He then becomes the Joker and starts taking over the Gotham mafia and only Batman can stop him.My point is that this movies storyline isn't the best but the movie shines with perfect actors, music and a extremely well done Gotham City, these things makes this movie really good and puts it in my top ten all time favourite movie list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BATMAN is an incredible film which I find stylistically superior to THE DARK KNIGHT. Darker and more twisted than the 60's film, this is an incredible adventure. Batman, secret identity Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is a billionaire philanthropist haunted by the deaths of his parents. Which is why he is the Caped Crusader, The Dark Knight, The World's Greatest Detective. He is assisted by his loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough). He finds a love interest in the form of the smoldering Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) and an antagonist in the cackling criminal The Joker (Jack Nicholson). Keaton fits the Bat-Suit just right, Gough is wise and endearing, Basinger radiates sex appeal and Nicholson is delightfully hammy. This is one for the ages. Tim Burton's Gothic vision of Gotham City is great and fits the mood and style perfectly. One of the things I find especially good about this film is how Burton makes separate the two characters of Bruce Wayne and Batman. The film really captures how different Bruce Wayne and Batman really are. Love this film. Exciting and visually stimulating, BATMAN is the kind of film that takes you on a journey from the get-go and never lets up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BATMAN: A Hero Emerges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorGrowing up everybody had a movie they loved. A movie that was a very big part of there childhood. For me that movie would be `Batman.' It was a childhood favorite which I continue to cherish to this day. What is great about the character of Batman is that he is a real person, a person who's life was affected from a very young age and through his determination managed to get vengeance on all those who try to affect others the same way they affected his. The film starts as a teaser, we see a couple with a young child walking through the decaying city of Gotham. Much like that dreadful day in Bruce Wayne's life. The family walk into an alleyway where they manage to get mugged. Thu emerges the Batman.Mugger: Don't kill me, man - don't kill me! Batman: I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tell all your friends about me.Mugger: What are you?! Batman: I'm Batman. Director Tim Burton manages to create a city which is decaying in time and is as corrupt as it can get. It is a city in the need of help. Michael Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne/Batman and easily does the greatest performance of any actor to wear the famed costume. He manages to balance both characters giving Bruce Wayne a lost child quality in the need of comfort and Batman the vengeful deep spoken hero with the most intimating eyes to appear on screen. Jack Nicholson is equally as good in the role of Jack Napier/The Joker. The history of the character is not explained that well in this movie but we can establish that he is a tormented soul since after being framed by his gangster boss Carl Grissom he seems to be driven to the edge. Director Tim Burton and screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren develop a great story that is exciting, funny, and dramatic. They also develop the character of Batman terrifically as a man who wants to get vengeance but not be a killer/murderer like his prey. But once he discovers that the assassin of his parents is still alive he like the Joker is driven to the edge and becomes much of a murderer as the enemy itself.Inspired by Frank Millers `The Dark Knight Returns' and `Batman: Year One' we get the opportunity to see the publics point of view of both Batman and the Joker. The movie is almost flawless. What is missing is better development for the character of Commissioner Gordon and his relationship with Batman. However, his development is not missed at times. The film won an Academy Award for Anton Furst's amazing art direction but I truly think it should have taken home more. RATING: 4 STARS (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shock At First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being a little shocked when this came out. The Batman I was used to was the innocent, cartoon-like television series with Adam West and Burt Ward as "Batman" and "Robin," respectively. Thus, seeing something this dark was a bit of a jolt.Now that I've seen all six of the Batman films to date since this came out in 1989, it's no shock to re-visit this film and see a brooding hero and a dark city. It's still a bit of a shock and watch the first part of this and hear a bunch of profanity. That just doesn't fit with Batman films - ever. Thankfully, that got toned down after this one. Call me old-fashioned, but when this film was released with all the hype, a lot of kids saw this, too - young ones - so showing Bruce Wayne sleeping with Kim Bassinger was just another sign of the depravity of Hollywood and how it has changed over the decades.Having said that, and as an adult watching I was fascinated by the visuals and absolutely fascinated with Jack Nicholson's portrayal of "The Joker." Once the "The Joker" enters the scene, the movie is wildly entertaining. Bassinger, meanwhile, was in her prime and looked awesome.Besides the stylish visuals, they didn't overdo the violence, either, and it wound up being a pretty good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(94%) My favourite Batman movie, and indeed my favourite superhero movie ever made. The studios took a big chance and allowed a young Tim Burton to take on their biggest asset and he made a movie like no other directer could. Along with Christopher Reeve as Superman, Michael Keaton will always be my top choice for the role as he plays the haunted and lost Bruce Wayne so fantastically well that I doubt it will ever be bettered. Jack Nicholson was born to play the joker, the score is epic, the set design is wonderful. And although not everything runs smoothly, as far as I'm concerned this will always be the superhero movie to beat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think they took a chance on Tim Burton developing his own vision of The Caped Crusader in 1989's Batman, much like they did with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All gambles paid off in dividends.Batman was a phenomenal movie, in all aspects. Michael Keaton was perfect in both roles as Batman and Bruce Wayne. Jack Nicholson was also wonderful in his dual performance as the Joker and crime lord Jack Napier. The action was intense, original, exciting and inventive. The sets were masterful, the atmosphere and cinematography excellent and the mood ideal for the adaptation. Danny Elfman created and preformed his absolute best score and did to Batman as John Williams did to Superman; for the first time, both composers brought the heroes to life with a remarkable, rememberable and stunning score. The story, set-up and execution was exactly how real origin stories are supposed to be made. (On a personal note, I have little patience with movies based on characters I favor. I want to see them, and quick. I loved that they decided to show Batman up front, immediately and saved the origin story until much later as part of the mystery of Wayne. In my opinion, this was a brilliant and original move.) And Burton's vision beautifully blended in present day to the 1940's era when Batman gained popularity (yeah, I know he was originally produced in 1939.) Very little didn't work in this comic book adaptation. Namely Vicky Vale's consistent need to scream (count 'em, I believe the total number of screeching is 50+) Prince's so-so tracks and (SPOILER) I'm told that Joker didn't kill Wayne's parents in the original source. Obviously everything cannot be displayed from the comics ? we're talking 70+ years of material, and somethings have to be altered for dramatic purposes (see the enormously altered The Blind Side.) Also, only a very minute number or effects didn't work ? the only one that comes to mind is the first appearance of The Dark Knight from an above shot. It looked way too cartoonish.None of these minor complaints constitute anything less than 5 out of 5 stars. This movie was as near perfect as either a Batman movie, adventure, comic book adaptation or good vs. evil story could be. And, personally, it meant a lot to me back in the summer of 1989 when my father took me for the first (of three) time(s) to AMC Town &amp; Country on the Saturday after it opened in June 1989. This was a first for me ? the line was extraordinarily long and I was used to just going in and sitting down. It was also when I really started paying attention to the Box Office Reports as this was one of the biggest movies of all time, at the time. In addition, as much as I thoroughly liked the finished product, I wouldn't even appreciate it until years later when other lesser directors took their own visions on different comic book heroes. (Too many to list, but Daredevil, Hulk and any of the Punisher or Fantastic Four movies come to mind.) The plot/story was very well know, even back in 1989, but here goes: Mr. &amp; Mrs. Zillionaire Wayne die in front of their child in an alley leaving the heir in the care of family/friend/servant Alfred. Revenge (he calls it differently, but yeah, right) fills his blood throughout his life and when able, he becomes the masked avenger bent on ridding the streets of Gotham, USA of scum.Meanwhile, mobster (#2) Jack (Nicholson) is set up by his boss, Grissom (Palance) and after inadvertently being dropped in chemicals (Batman actually did try and save him) he becomes the self-titled Joker. Revenge and power is on his mind. His short list includes: Gang takeover from Grissom, the destruction of Gotham and demise of Batman, for obvious reasons.All at the same time, Wayne is conflicted with his vigilante's role and his new found love with Vicky Vale (Basinger.) He wants to tell her he's Batman so he can finally open up to someone other than co-conspirer Alfred, and speaking of which, in what many complain about, Alfred eventually does the deed for Wayne.Joker's also bent on romancing the lovely (and screaming) Vale, and when it's discovered she is a sore spot for Wayne/Batman, she's all the more enticing to Joker.Yada, yada, yada, there's mystery, suspense, action, rescues and finally, there's the big finale and revolutions that provide an exciting finale to one of the best comic book movies ever made.This movie hits so many demographics, including romance, comedy, action, adventure, heroism, good vs. bad, redemption that is highly recommended for all audiences. It wasn't until another visionary, Christopher Nolan's fantastic Batman Begins and the superior The Dark Knight, did anything come close to this masterpiece. And even then, neither Batman nor Batman Begins can easily be compared since they are far different takes on the classic tales. I.E. Batman was more of a fun, comic book movie whereas Batman Begins is a serious adaptation leaving the fun out the window. Both are great movies and both belong in any fan's collection.

		<fullReview>recently i voted this movie an 8/10*.however,it had been some years since i had seen it.well,after just watching it,i have to change my vote.this movie is better than i remembered it being.it's a much more stylistic movie than the recent"Batman Begins" and certainly much darker in tone,i think.i mean no disrespect at all to the latest movie.this is just a different movie.there is less backs story,in fact that aspect this minimal,but it works here.i think we are given enough to get immersed in the story.the character of Batman retains more of a mysterious air.i also really liked Batman's costume in this version.it seemed to have a bit more realism to it.and the fighting scenes were well done,also fairly realistic.of course,Jack as the Joker was an inspired choice.he really had fun with the character.he does go over the top at times,but it doesn't seem to matter.the film doesn't suffer from it.Michael Keaton was very credible as both Bruce Wayne and the bat.he was very understated,but you could tell there was a lot more going on than first appeared.as for the music,i loved Danny Elfman's score.it was pure genius.i didn't mind the songs by Prince,but i didn't love them either.many people have probably said that the character of Batman is two dimensional in this movie.i don't know if that's the case.i think he has many dimensions,but they are not blatantly obvious.you have to look beneath the surface a bit.i may be out to lunch with that statement,but that is just what i think.i said at the beginning that i would have to change my vote of 8/10.and i am.i think it's as good in its own way,(maybe even a bit better in some aspects)as "Batman Begins".this is not something i ever thought i would say.nevertheless,i give "Batman" 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Batman Movie To See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can i say about this movie. Batman From 1989 is the best batman movie in my opinion.The plot is that the police are constantly getting random attacks on thugs. Witnesses say that the attacker looks like a big bat. Meanwhile, A thug called Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) breaks into the axis chemical plant and accidentally falls into a vat of toxic waste and becomes the joker. He then starts to terrorize the citizens of Gotham. batman (Michael Keaton) then has to stop him before its too late.Everything about the movie is just so brilliant. Michael Keaton plays a super job at playing Batman. But Jack Nicholson steals the show. his role as the joker is flawless. The music is so good I bought the soundtrack which i am listening to as i am writing this review. The storyline is really good as it is basic but they cram a lot into the movie 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well where can I start? I have been watching this movie since I was a child so it kinda have a special place in my heart. Maybe not the best movie to portray the "real" Batman but the story is quite intriguing. For example the villain created the hero and then the hero created the villain (the circle of evil).Even though Michael Keaton is not tall enough to be Batman/Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton 175 cm, Batman 188 cm) he carried the role really well. He did a good Batman and a good Bruce Wayne. Jack Nicholson playing the Joker couldn't be more perfect because he manages to be clownishly funny and also scary at the same time.Well Harvey is portrayed by a black guy (can't remember his name but I know he was in the old Star Wars movies), and Vicki is blonde(!) and Alfred is played by an old horror Icon and Gordon is fat. But the actress and the actors did quite well even though some of them had a short screen time.I gotta say that I disagree with people saying that the sequel of this movie is darker. I think this one is a lot darker than the sequel and the reason for why I say it is because it has got a cynical sense of humor and irony. For example Batman was "created" by Jack and Batman "created" Joker by dropping him into the chemicals. Batman then gets his revenge by killing the Joker and thus destroy his "maker" and kill the man who made him which he also "created". Such irony huh?By the way people have a tendency to forget that the character Batman was inspired by the pulps from the 1930's and Batman used to kill villains. Which some find so "UnBatman" but I think it depends from person to person who the real Batman is.Anyway I am making the review too long so I'm finishing with: Damn good movie!!!!!!! 10/10 or whatever the f*** you say when you really like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been one of my favourite movies for years and years. This is the comic book movie at it's best, realistic enough but sticking to it's roots of the impossible. Keaton's performance remains to be the best Batman. Jack Nicholson gives us performance as the Joker, and with it is his dark and morbid sense of humour that appeals to me, I find him absolutely hilarious. The visuals and music fit perfectly together and to a visual artist like it's just perfect. What really works for this movie is that Batman's character is kept more of a mystery and because of that it's a better performance, and the Joker's story we learn the details of and is written and performed perfectly. Tim Burton's greatest film and one of my all time favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1989: it was a perfect teen time: it was the time when sequels were great, void of the CGI disease that kills ideas (Ghostbusters 2, Indy 3, Trek V). It was also the time when comics became mainstream in France and this Batman movie helped this a lot. The funny thing is that it was released late (in September), long after all the magazines and the hype talked about it. All the family liked it, with me buying the score and Prince's tapes and my brother buying the VHS (now, i know you laugh because you don't buy it anymore!). 23 years later, comics have exploded at screens but has become rather boring to read and watching this first movie again on screen is still great: The opening credits with the loud batman theme and the maze is the perfect beginning and encapsulates the whole movie: it's a Gothic opera, with visuals and music foremost. Thus, the actual script is not essential: in fact, it has good points (the tangent portrayal of Batman) but weak ones too (the gunned Batman, the ties Batman/Joker and the ultimate fate of Joker) . Actually, Batman stays rather in the shadows (which fits him) and it's rather the Joker and Gotham City that take command. Nicholson is always good playing insane so it's a good choice for the part and his character is really close to comics: a funny and flashy maniac who brings disorder. Gotham is built from a fantastic vision: buildings have character and it's also dark, tidy. Danny's score is phenomenal and Tim never let an opportunity to have an iconic shoot (the batwing on the moon). In conclusion, it's a great experience who can please every one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman at his all time Best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the late 1980's, Tim Burton and Michael Keaton teamed up to bring the dark knight back to his dark roots and make audiences forget about the campy 60s series.The plot his a classic cat and mouse scenario which works to the films advantage. After a dangerous killer (Jack Nichleson) fall into a vat of chemicals, he becomes the Batman's arch nemesis, the Joker. Now trying to kill the population of Gotham, it's up to Batman to foil his plans.Both Keaton and Nichleson share the screen equally, having enough screen time to keep us interested with their characters. Keaton was and still is the best live action Batman, playing a quiet and thought provoking Bruce Wayne and a dark and badass Batman. Nichleson is essentially his opposite being loud, creepy, darkly humorous and completely insane.Gotham City has Tim Burton's unique style of Gothic cinematography and surreal atmosphere, which perfectly suits the world of Batman. The Batcave, Batmobile and gadgets are all classic Batman and they appear here at their best. The film fits the bill as a Batman film really well...unlike Nolan's over realistic and dull series.All in all, Batman is the quintessential Batman movie. Keaton and Nichleson complement each over brilliantly, the Gothic style fits the tone and it's brimming with great moments throughout. It's Dark, it's humorous, it's compelling and it's Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrill ride from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Batman came out in 1989 I was completely blown away by it and was taken away by the fact that I was finally seeing my childhood hero on the big screen. I thought it was THE perfect film . However today almost 20 years later Batman Begins and The Dark Knight have been released and I have realized that this movie has some flaws and as a Batman fan i appreciate this film less now than I did twenty years ago . However I still think that for a neutral cinema goer this film is Great and deserves a high rating. Before I start praising the film let me get the flaws ( big flaws, there were some other flaws but I don't think it's fair to mention them) : 1. Who is Batman ? Why does Bruce Wayne, a billionaire dress up as a bat and fight crime at night ? OK his parents died when he was a child and then... ? Also as the Joker says ' Where does he get those wonderful toys ?' I don't even think the director knew how Batman really got his batmobile , batplane and all his gadgets ! 2. The Joker is Bruce Wayne's parents killer -big mistake it ruins Bruce Wayne's ambition to become Batman. 3. Batman Kills -HUGE MISTAKE 4. The plot was pretty weak compared to the Dark Knight. And finally : 5. It is true that Bruce Wayne is a little crazy , what do you expect from a guy that dresses up like a bat ? But in Tim Burton's world he is borderline physco. From sleeping upside down (what was Burton thinking ?) to shouting 'Come on lets get nuts ! ' . Now that we got the flaws out of the way let us see why Batman is a great movie. 1. When you compare this film to the other 3 Burton/Schumacher films it is the biggest 'Batman' movie out of all of them . 2. Michel Keaton was an excellent Batman despite being a shabby Bruce Wayne. He proved doubters wrong with an excellent and dark performance as Batman. 3. I had believed that Jack Nicholson played the Joker excellently however when compared to Ledger's Joker I had second thoughts. Still they are two completely different types of Jokers. Heath's portrayal is unique and only briefly seen in the darker comics. Jack's portrayal was more like the lighter comics were the Joker was seen more of a comedian than a psychopath but Jack still passes the role with flying colours. 4. Great and exciting action sequences which would look good even today. 5. Excellent portrayal of Gotham City as a city haunted by crime and corruption. 6. Great portrayal of other Batman characters namely Vicki Vale , Alexander Knox , The Major and Harvey Dent. I was abit disappointed with Commissioner Gordon , I though he should have been more included in the film but compared to his usage in other films I can't complain that much . 7. Excellent Bat mobile which is my favorite in the entire series (even Nolan's) 8. It was good to see the Joker's origin even though it is quite unrealistic. Anyway way guys when leaving the theater in 1989 I was in heaven , I Was delighted to see a hero who I had followed on the comic book be put on the big screen in such a professional way . I couldn't wait for more sequels to come out but as you know there were not as I expected . Today 'Batman' still remains the best of the Burton/Schumacher film series but when you compare it to the Nolan series there is a big difference. But when you see Batman for the first time like I did back in 1989 you'll be completely blown away by a movie which is a thrill ride from start to finish 8.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in awhile comes a movie which is SO good, you almost cannot conceive of any possible way it could be improved. BATMAN is such a film. From the casting (Jack Nicholson was BORN to play The Joker) to the cinematography (which is stunning) to the music (by Danny Elfman, who captures the mood perfectly) to the plot (which depicts The Batman as a dark, brooding hero, thank God), this is one of those rare films that hits it right on virtually every note.The ONLY quibble is the animated effects, which are weak. (The searchlights don't look real, nor does The Joker falling from a cathedral rooftop, nor the very early high shot of Batman turning around on another roof.)But Michael Keaton is so perfect at playing the psychologically tortured hero that one can easily overlook the fact that he doesn't really look strong enough to pick up a guy and hold him over a ledge. As Jack Napier/The Joker, Jack Nicholson has an absolute field day, getting the best lines in the film. The writers, Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, are smart enough to play up the fact that Batman and The Joker are two sides of the same coin. They keep the proceedings going in a clear, relentless and straightforward manner, mixing terror and humor masterfully. There have been many superhero flicks since BATMAN, but this one remains the best, most perfect film of its type ever made. Would that the sequels had been as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by darkling master Tim Burton, this dark, Gothic/punk action adventure is absolutely wonderful entertainment. Jack Nicholson was perfectly cast as Batman's nemesis, the Joker. His performance alone would have made this movie the hit that it is; no one does crazy like Nicholson. No one. "Winged Freak...terrorizes?...Wait'll they get a load of ME." Joker.But Burton did not rely solely on Nicholson's abilities as a crowd-pleaser. Michael Keaton is another truly talented star who was expertly cast. His portrayal of the Marvel Comics' character, Batman, was flawless.Michael Gough was awesome as Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne's loyal and ever-diligent man-servant. Alfred, to me, has always been the epitome of breeding, tact and dignity, and Michael Gough portrayed his character to the utmost degree. Well-trained British butlers are usually more sophisticated and better educated than those they serve, yet the better of their breed would never be so gauche as to point that out. While he is not in that situation, Alfred is no exception. His character is extremely well developed and Mr. Gough's portrayal is flawless.Gotham City was designed with the theme of the "Dark Knight" uppermost in mind; the architecture and atmosphere created was done with total expertise and a professional quality that still amazes me.Kim Basinger was quite convincing as Vicki Vale, Bruce Wayne's love interest. and professional photo-journalist and did a wonderful job in this role.The Gothic architecture throughout is breathtaking; Wayne Manor, in particular, is stunningly designed and constructed. The moldings, cornices and dormants are absolutely beautiful. Rich details like that add so much to a production. The furnishings are appropriately ornate and lavish; much unlike the Manor exhibited in the 60's series.But it does not stop there. Every scene is rich in architecture and creative design; so much so that it is implemental in setting the atmosphere of each scene. Burton's direction and foresight is brilliantly displayed in this production, rendering a professionally dark, witty and highly imaginative final product.The "gadgets" used by Batman were creatively implemented and highly imaginative. His utility belt was extremely well designed and equipped. Also, the design of his body armor was extraordinary. True creativity never ceases to inspire me, as this movie has.The museum scene with the Joker is classic, and possibly the most memorable scene of the entire modern-day "Batman" series. It is darkly hilarious and disturbing, and a definite "must-see."In my opinion, this is the best representation of the spirit and character of the "Dark Knight" ever produced. This is a truly inspired adaptation of Bob Kane's creation.SPOILERBut there IS one problem. In this version of "Batman," they have the Joker as the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents. If you're a fan of the comic book, you know that is simply incorrect.END SPOILERIt gets an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite Batman movie. Yes I even like it better than the Dark Knight. This movie came out almost ten years before I was born, and I admit that the special effects are pretty corny looking now, but name me a movie that won't look corny in the future. It's interesting that I love this movie so much because I didn't like Michael Keaton as Batman, and I don't find Kim Basinger to be all that attractive. But I've got to say the Jack Nicholson completely made up for both of them. Nicholson was a hilarious Joker, that made me love the movie. I don't think you can compare Jack Nicholson to Heath Ledger because they played the character so differently. Nicholson's Joker was meant to be funny but menacing and obviously the bad guy. Ledger's Joker was meant to be psychotic, disturbing, and beyond just the bad guy. It really depends on which interpretation of the Joker you prefer. I would take a comedy over a horror movie any day, so I prefer Nicholson. This movie was fun, and entertaining and if you're like me in that The Dark Knight was a little much for you, see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark &amp; mysterious figure called Batman lurks the shadows, meanwhile a psychotic gangster called Joker ups the crime in Gotham in Tim Burton's classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best and most influential comic book movies of all time. Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors and his dark sensibility made him perfect in bringing to life the first dark, serious and really mature Batman adaptation. Tim truly captured the essence of Bob Kane's original vision of Batman. The film is visually stunning as Tim brilliantly brought to life the look of Gotham city. Gotham feels big and dark, and production designer the late Anton Furst won a well deserved Oscar for it. The music by Danny Elfman is iconic, and is his best work. The story is simple, it's basically Batman vs. The Joker. Oppossed to the much more complex stories in Chris Nolan's Batman films years later. But a simple fight between Batman and Joker is really all you need. What makes the movie work are how interesting these two characters are, how well defined they are, how well directed they are, how well written they are and well played they are by the actors. First Micheal Keaton, who shocked everyone with his unforgettable performance as a darker take on the iconic Batman. When I look at Micheal Keaton I can never think of him as Batman, which is one of the really cool thing about him as Batman, he's the guy you least suspect. However there's been a lot of criticism towards how Batman's portrayed in this movie, but not against Keaton himself but against Tim Burton's direction. Many have felt that the film focus more on the Joker, that he's the real star, that Jack Nicholson overshadows the hero. I completely understand that view but I think Tim makes it all work well. Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman is defiantly low-key and very understated here. Keaton is the straight man to Nicholson's wild man. In the DVD audio commentary Tim responded to the criticism by saying he wanted to keep Batman a mystery and that he felt "less is more with him". One of the great things about batman here is that he is so mysterious. Keaton gives his best performance and does a great job at playing both Batman and Bruce Wayne, making them different personalities but part as one whole. Keaton's portrayal of Batman might be the best I've seen. Without even saying anything he has a presence that no one else who played him has. He comes off as genuinely brooding and intense, he's not just acting or pretending, he is that dark, mysterious, and never smiling hero Batman's supposed to be. As Bruce Wayne, Keaton is great in playing him as a reclusive, millionaire loner who's tormented by his parent's murder years earlier. Keaton's portrayal is different from most take on Wayne, he's not a playboy or socialite but a loner. Still Keaton gives a serious performance as Bruce Wayne and gives him the detective side, as he comes off as smart. Tim dosen't explain a lot about Wayne's life but we get an idea. The bat-suit is perfect along with his bat-mobile and bat-wing. There are great moments like his "I'm Batman" introduction to robbers. His ride with Vickey Vale to the bat-cave and the iconic ending with him looking up at the bat-single. But the actor who steals the show is movie legend Jack Nicholson as the Joker. As many said before this was the role Jack was born to play. Jack proves why the Joker is the greatest D.C. comic book villain after Lex Luthor. First, Tim and the writers do a great job in developing his character, this is the only time he's given a back-story, and one that fits perfectly. Writer Sam Ham writes the Joker in Jack's image and here the Joker was a cool, smooth and arrogant gangster named Jack Napier who fell into a vat of chemicals and became the psychotic killer known as the Joker. I love that they gave the Joker a lot of depth, he's not just some crazy guy doing stuff, he has real motivations and reasons for his crimes. He was so vain early on, so when his face and body got disfigured he took his anger at on everyone. Causing people to die with his grin on their face and destroying art masterpieces so they can be ugly like him. Nicholson gave possibly the best performance of his career. You can say he's too over the top but Jack makes the Joker's over the top &amp; theatrical insanity believable. This might be the best interpretation of the Joker ever and he's really, really evil here and is a perfect adaptation from the comic books. There are many memorable scenes here like Jack seeing his face after an attempt at plastic surgery and begins laughing manically. Jack saying "wait till' they get a load of me" and then makes weird sounds. Jack burning a mob boss to death with a joy buzzer and then talks to the corpse and laughs at him saying "I'm glad you're dead". A commercial with dead models advertising his poison causing people to laugh themselves to death and have his own grin on their corpse. And destroying art masterpieces while dancing to a Prince song. I love the make-up job on Jack, the permanent grin looks like plastic surgery gone horribly wrong and I just love that creepy, painful looking grin. Kim Basinager is great as photographer Vickey Vale and love interest for Bruce Wayne. She's a great character in her own right and I think she's one of the best loves in any Batman movie. Micheal Gough is a great Alfred and has a great relationship with Bruce Wayne. Billy Dee Willaims is good as D.A. Harvey Dent(unfortunately we never seen him become Two-Face). The great Jack Palance is perfect as Nicholson's boss. I also love the twist that a young Jack Napier killed Bruce Wayne's parents. I'm a die-hard batman fan and this is one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's on the screen is fine, it's what's on the page that brings this down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can have some of the greatest actors, a top director, brilliant designers and effects people, but if your script isn't up to snuff it can be a fatal flaw. Films based on popular comic book heroes and fans of them seem to have a love/hate relationship. Sometimes it's worked out in the end and delivered a great movie experience that satisfied many, but on the opposite end of the spectrum are the films that ended up being really off the mark. The first 'Superman' film was a blockbuster hit for Warner Bros. and spawned a series, but it would be a while before DC Comics' other beloved caped crusader would make it to the big screen. When it finally came together it sounded like a recipe for success; an innovative director, a top notch cast, some really talented designers and effects technicians, etc. Like the studio's 1978 superhero movie hit, 'Batman' too went to the top of the charts. The question now though is, how well does it hold up? Pros: Solid performances all around. Nice dark and brooding atmosphere. Exciting score by legendary Danny Elfman. Excellent production design. Fast-paced most of the time and never gets dull. A few good action sequences. Doesn't take itself too seriously and some of the cartoonishness can be fun.Cons: Really not much of a plot. Underdeveloped characters and relationships. Does get too over-the-top and silly at times. Pace is uneven at times. Final act leaves something to be desired.Final thoughts: This film became a phenomenon and is loved by many, but all things considered it really doesn't hold up very well. It looks good, is entertaining, has a great cast, and has some cool moments that are now iconic, but it collapses under it's own weight. Unfortunately it's one of those films that was made during a writer's strike and the original writers were not allowed to do any rewrites. Even Tim Burton was disappointed by how it turned out. It pains me to say it, but this is one of those films from childhood that I loved to death, but as an adult I see it for what it really is and it's not the classic it could have been.My rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vision not fully realised, but still a template of sorts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could never have lived up to its hype back in 1989, it was hailed as the film to rival the impact of Jaws &amp; Star Wars as regards historical cinema conventions, it was, we were led to believe, a new age in cinema, or so it seemed. As it was, the film went down a treat for the modern cinema going audience, it raked in cash galore and spawned a raft of very inferior sequels, but ultimately critics of the time were less than impressed.So it makes for something of an interesting experience viewing it again as it approaches its 30th birthday in 2019. More so in light of Christopher Nolan's bank busting Dark Knight series of films. I remember the hype and marketing campaign that ensured that the film could never live up to the gargantuan hype, and I'm honest enough to say that I was a little underwhelmed on first viewing. Yet time has been very kind to it, now showing that Burton had the nous and foresight to reignite a genre. Visually the film still stands up with the best that today's genre pieces can offer, the sets are incredible, with Anton Furst rightly winning the big award for his work here, whilst Burton's dark and deep tone captures the essence of Gotham City and Bruce Wayne's troubled mind perfectly, but does the cast fully realise the potential on offer?Sadly for me I just don't buy Michael Keaton as the troubled and vengeful Bruce Wayne, he is a fine actor that just doesn't quite cut it in the brooding close to madness department, and yet he's outstanding in the cape, arguably the best Batman ever. Jack Nicholson has the time of his life camping it up as The Joker, he steals the film for sure, but not because he is acting with great poise and class, but purely because in a film calling for the battle of two unhinged characters, he is the one awash in colour and overacting the maniacal side of the character to the max.Kim Basinger looks great and doesn't have to do much as Vicki Vale except say her lines right, pout, look scared when required and scream with conviction, and she does all these. But really any other actress could have done the same thing - though I'm personally relieved that Sean Young dropped out of the film and thus allowed some other actress to step in. The supporting cast do OK, and although the soundtrack by Prince pushes the boundaries of annoying caricature indulgence, it does work and the film remains today a very entertaining watch, but you can't help feeling that there is some great Burton vision here that never got fully realised. And that is a damn shame. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keaton's version of Ol' Batsy is NOT outclassed by Nolan's take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While The Dark Knight set box office records and drew more critical acclaim and discussion than perhaps any other super-hero movie ever, it shouldn't obscure the fact that the second Batman movie was pretty darn good in its own right. And yes, it's the second Batman movie. The Adam West one counts.Blooming out of the mind of oddball director Tim Burton, this Batman movie was one of the first films to introduce the general public to the darker and more psychologically complex world of comic book super-heroes that had replaced the wholesome, square-jawed, morally correct characters of the 1940s and 50s. That a DC character like Batman is the one who exposed America to the changes actually brought to the super-hero genre by Stan Lee and company at Marvel is one of those quirks of history. This Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is an odd fellow, disconnected from other people and real life, with genuine pain lingering just under his skin.Keaton's Wayne and Batman are probably the most interesting version of the character to ever appear in a movie, which makes it especially strange and regrettable that this film really isn't about him. First and foremost, it's about the Joker (Jack Nicholson). His transformation from slightly disturbed mob enforcer to larger than life, mass murdering super-villain is at the heart of the story. Everyone else is really part of an ensemble supporting Nicholson, with Bruce Wayne not being that much bigger a part than Knox (Robert Wuhl), the muckraking reporter out to break the story of Batman, or Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger), the photojournalist who comes to Gotham because she read Knox's stories and likes bats. In fact, Knox and Vale are really more important characters to the story than Wayne or Batman for the first half of the film. It's not until the second half of the movie that the title character plays a major role in what's going on.It's to Burton's credit and the actors' that the story doesn't really suffer because of its contrary focus. As you rewatch it, it makes less and less sense that Batman is largely about everyone except Batman. It's hard to understand why they thought the Knox character was necessary, for example. But Nicholson carries the movie on his back, Basinger brings more than you'd expect to the girlfriend/damsel in distress role and Keaton's performance is so quietly suggestive and intriguing that you don't realize how little he's actually in the film.Visually, the movie is as interesting as Burton's other films. Gotham City is a crowded, dirty, urban hell, like a 17th century city that grew and metastasized without any planning or zoning considerations. The Batmobile in this film supplanted the look of the 1960s version, becoming the standard template for how the vehicle would look for over 20 years. The Batsuit in this movie is probably the best looking version of the costume ever on film, certainly more aesthetically pleasing than the battlesuit Batman of the two most recent movies, though it did give us the thick, rubber Bat-helmet look that has burdened the character ever since. Burton doesn't really know how to shoot a great action sequence, but at least he keeps the camera steady so you can see what's going on. And there are a few times when Burton seems to miss the point of a scene and shoot it in a confusing manner.In the wake of all the praise given to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight, you might think that Nicholson's Joker would pale in comparison?but it doesn't. Ledger's Joker is a much deeper character who is less a real person and more a living embodiment of anarchy. Nicholson's Joker is much more grounded. He's an evil person, but he's very much a person. He has understandable goals and motivations. He's just someone who's inhibitions and impulse control have been stripped away. Some might say Ledger's Joker is more realistic but it's Nicholson who creates a more fully formed character.It is the question of realism that most divides this film from the more recent movie incarnations of Batman (and this film's immediate sequels as well). This movie is very much a work of fantasy where the filmmakers and actors don't expect it to conform to the rules and needs of the real world and don't expect the audience to want that either. It has an internal logic and sense of its own reality, but there's virtually no effort made to explain or justify how this stuff could happen in the real world. I would bet that future generations will look back and wonder at why people would feel the need to portray a character as outlandish as Batman in a realistic way and wonder at how much effort was made in The Dark Knight and Batman Begins to pretend that "Yeah, this could really happen" when it really couldn't.Batman is certainly more spectacle than substance. But when you're telling a story about a guy who puts on a cape and pointy-eared mask to beat the crap out of a murderer who looks like a clown?how much substance should you really want out of it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional but very, very dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Tim Burton movie is about the darkest superhero movie that had been created to date. Despite deconstructing the hero and making him a bit of a dangerous loony, the film exudes quality throughout. The sets are incredible with their detail and darkness, the acting is top-notch and the script is generally great, except when they diverge into irrelevant flashback scenes that do NOTHING to improve the story.Bruce Wayne is a complicated guy. Yes, he's rich and fights crime, but he's on the edge. Vicki Vale is a hot reporter who is apparently not mentally ill but also has no real purpose in the movie but to get saved by Batman. The Joker is a total nut-case--but a fun to watch nut-case, as he struts and preens while he dispenses evil.He is by far the best character in the film, as Jack Nicholson seems to have a lot of fun. Some of the most awfully violent but amusing images were the Joker's joy buzzer as well as the effects of Joker Brand cosmetics on its victims (two dead ladies make postmortem appearances in one of the Joker's ads on TV endorsing the products!). In addition, I loved the scene where the Joker and his men trash an art museum--spray painting and smashing artwork with abandon. That is until they get to the painting "The Scream"--Joker tells his men to leave that one alone--"Now that I like".Aside from the dumb back story, I liked all of the movie--even the violent things Joker did that I listed above. HOWEVER, I was appalled that the movie was marketed so strongly to kids, as this was NOT a kids' film. My wife and I saw a guy in the theater with his two year-old! The kid, naturally, screamed through much of the movie!! For adults, it's a wonderful film--but for kids under 12 or so, no way--it's just too dark and violent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly dated; should have been called "Joker"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie again recently, I have realized what a terrible joke this film is compared to the newest Batman film, "Batman Begins". The way people talk about this film on here, you would think that Tim Burton is some kind of legend, but that's hardly the case. If you honestly thought that this film is true in spirit to the comic book series, you are most decidedly wrong, but there are other problems at work here.First of all, watching this film will make you realize just how little focus is actually spent on the title character. Bruce Wayne's back-story is almost completely glossed over, and as a result, it doesn't feel like Bruce is trying to save the city he grew up in. Rather, the film makes him look like a complete psycho (especially evident in the "You wanna get nuts?" scene) who picks on petty thieves. Batman is supposed to be a detective, but it sure doesn't feel like he does much detective work here. Instead, he just waits until someone alerts him to a problem, then he shows up and saves the day.As I said in the title of this review, the film should have been titled "Joker", if only for the reason that, for most of the film, we follow Jack Nicholson around as he exploits to kill all the residents of Gotham. Not that Jack Nicholson is a bad actor, mind you, because he does what he to jazz up the role. However, I already understood his purpose within the first few minutes of seeing him, and I didn't really require seeing him sitting in his hideout cutting out pictures of Vicki Vale.Batman does not kill. EVER. He has a sense of morals, and a sense of justice. He doesn't just run around beating up and killing guys, especially to the point of blowing up an entire chemical factory with criminals inside. It may look cool on the big screen, but it's not who he is.I also found it surprising how stupid some of the characters are. For example, it seems that Bruce has no problem driving a woman to the Batcave, bringing her in, showing her around the place, THEN SEDUCING HER. Better yet, I also wondered how foolish the people in Gotham were when they were blindly grabbing money from the Joker's henchmen, in light of the recent event where he poisoned a woman on television who was using one of his products.I found Michael Keaton's performance...underwhelming, I guess would be the right word. He plays Bruce Wayne like a jittering, nervous wreck, the type of guy who probably spent his high school years cramming for exams in the basement. Even when he's in the Batsuit, he looks small and unassuming. As for the rest of the cast, they do commendable jobs, especially with Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred.If anyone hasn't this yet, and is wondering if the film is faithful to the comic books, prepare to be disappointed: this is nothing like the comics. There are several differences between the film and the comics, some of which work, and some of which don't. I guess having the Joker being the one who killed Bruce's parents may have worked on screen, but it sounds absolutely ridiculous once you realize that Bruce actually remembered who killed his parents all his life, and waits until the END of the film to tell Joker about this fact.What this film doesn't do is show how the general population reacts to Batman's exploits. Like one poster stated, the people living in Metropolis in "Superman: The Movie" and the people living in Gotham City in "Batman Begins" both react to what is happening around them. People actually care what is happening to the person that is saving them. Here in this film, we have no clue if anyone knows what's going on, or for that matter, if anyone even cares about what Batman does, aside from the city paper (and even they believe he's not real) and Commissioner Gordon.The action scenes in this film are also short and unsatisfying. It feels like Batman can just single-handedly beat up anyone, which is hard to believe, especially given the fact that we know from dialogue spoken in the film that Bruce hasn't been out doing his Batman thing for very long. Even the climactic battle with the Batwing is rushed and pointless. We never get to see the full capabilities of what Batman can do here.Bottom Line: I am giving this film a 4 out of 10, largely because of the strength of the supporting cast. This film really hasn't aged well. I would recommend that you watch either Batman Returns or Batman Begins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Batman" is a gripping and very moving exploration of the psyche; it peers into the souls of not only the Dark Knight, but also those of the people whose lives he changes with his presence. The film is brilliantly acted by its perfectly-chosen cast, which includes Jack Nicholson (the Joker), Michael Keaton (the Batman), Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale), Micheal Gough (Alfred Pennyworth), and Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox). Tim Burton makes perfect use of his wonderful directorial talents, Anton Furst designs a Gothic, beautiful Gotham City, and Danny Elfman's classic musical score further help make this a unique, thought-provoking, and very powerful modern classic, a masterpiece of film noir and grand opera.Michael Keaton's Batman is dark, brooding, and tormented. Jack Nicholson was unforgettable as the Joker. Nicholson's joker is maniacal magic. Kim Bassinger is Vicki Vale, whose affections are pursued by both Batman and the Joker. Prince's soundtrack was awesome. the score (Danny Elfman) is well done. the costumes are great and the set design won an Oscar. Plus... all of Batman's "wonderful toys"... The beautifully rendered Gothic landscape that Anton Furst creates in the sets and scenery of Batman is immediately evident upon first viewing of the film. But what is probably much less evident to most viewers, is just how much Burton and his production team borrowed from German Expressionism and the silent filmmaking of first three decades of the 20th century. If this movie looks a bit stale now it's only because so many other movies have imitated it and because Burton and Elfman have become one-trick ponies. However when you look at it as the leader of a cinematic vanguard of action movies you realize how good it is.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:My favorite of all the Batman movies that Jack Nicholson carries on his shoulders. My header is his famous quote about Gotham. It is now applicable to where I am writing from. With Palance as Boss Grisham and Hingle as Gordon the acting and Burton's dark direction give the movie the Gothic nature of the comic that make it legendary. Unrelentingly dark with humor as black as pitch, with the Joker as the world's 'first homicidal artist.' Nicholson adds humor which I found absent in Ledger's delineation. Yes, he was sinister but remember his name? The Joker, could we have some humor when you portray him? Here, the handshake from Hell is drop dead funny, no pun intended. The entire movie is almost all shot at night, a couple day interiors but Burton keeps it dark all the time as an existential metaphor for Batman. The death of his parents is here without consuming a half an hour. The tragedy that metamorphosed him into the duality that he became: half light and half night. Keaton will surprise you with how well he plays him. I liked Bale but notice how Keaton acts eccentric as Bruce Wayne yet cold and sinister as Batman. He really surprised us in 1989, he had been a comic actor up to this point this is the movie that branched him out into serious genres.There is good support with Basinger, stunningly hot, and Billy Dee Williams. I liked Caine's Alfred but Michael Gough always played him so well. Here he gently oversees Wayne's kooky rich eccentricity, watch him take the pen out of the plant and the champagne glass on the tray. For me, even with the dreadful Prince music, Nicholson's Joker is why I adore the movie. Who will forget: "You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses would you? She's about to trade up, A woman like this could put steam back in your stride." He is scary but also commensurately funny. Ledger had a couple of funny lines but nothing like this. The effects may be dated but they still are effective. My only problem has always been Hollywood Knight's Robert Wuhl who always gets on my nerves. He is not as insufferable as he was in that vulgar, gross out festival but he is still annoying here. He always finds himself drop dead funny, I wish I did. The stars of the movie, besides the cast and acting, are the great comic accurate Gothic design and photography which are so evocative of the dark comic. Burton always was the director since he loves dark imagery with satirical dialog. Yet, it never devolves into Superman 3. There are just a few laughing at itself moments; from my point of view, the best Batman movie ever made. I waited in line to see it for two hours when it was released. I did not regret it. Word of mouth spread rapidly, it was moved into the big cinemas of every multiplex. Those of you who are avoiding it because of Keaton will be stunned how well he does here in a demanding role that calls for wide range. Be warned, not for kiddies, the humor is as dark as the imagery. This is not the cornball TV show, thank heavens. Burton darkens it further in the next one Batman Returns which I liked but it scared the crap out of too many kiddies. Even here, I would not show this to children below twelve. It may not be violent graphically but Nicholson's joker is one scary, creepy psycho. When you say Batman, this is the movie I think of. A Great Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate superhero movie; as good as Keaton is, his supporting cast is awesome, Nicholson deserved 10 Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Gotham City, crime continues day after day. But, suddenly, there is force for good. During serious acts of violence, a winged, bat-like man is fighting back and winning. Some criminals are scared and so are the police, for this "Batman" is not one of theirs. No one knows his identity but, of course, he is wealthy millionaire Bruce Wayne in a cape. His riches allow him to invent new weapons and armor. Erstwhile reporter Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) is extremely avid about getting the bat story but when she meets Wayne at a party, it is super-attraction time. Meanwhile, Gotham has a new foe, sprung from an old nemesis. The Joker (Jack Nicholson) had an unfortunate fall into a vat of acid. now, his face is disfigured and he is out for revenge. This means taking down mob boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) who sent his former right hand man into his industrial doom. But, Joker is not going to stop there. Anyone who gets in his way will be cut down, as Joker plans to take over the city. But, wait, now Gotham has its new superhero. Batman has the capabilities to foil Joker when the grinning devil tries to poison the populace. Can Batman defeat Joker, win the girl, and keep his identity hidden? Yes, yes, yes! This Tim Burton film is beyond measure. As one of the first successful superhero films, its dark vision gave rise to countless derivations. Then, too, what a cast this is! Keaton and Basinger are top notch as the title character and his intelligent love interest. Palance, Jerry Hall, Billy Dee Williams, Pat Hingle, and all of the supporting cast are wonderful, too. But, Nicholson is the best! What a robbery for him not to win 10 Oscars for his superb turn as the definitive villain. Then, too, the art direction is matchless, with the final fall from a skyscraper giving rise to imitation after imitation. Costumes, script, and direction are also peerless. What, you haven't seen Batman you say? Go now, don't wait another minute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.Its a fun and enjoyable action with some very dark elements,but it dosen't take itself too seriously,there is a Tim Burton atmosphere throughout,but he certainly tones down his usually creepy directing style.It is quite different from the Batman films that would follow (particularly Christopher Nolan's trilogy),we are actually given shockingly little detail about Bruce Wayne's personal life and what possessed him to become Batman,he can be scene fighting crime and wearing the suit within the first five minutes of the movie,which I don't think was a clever decision,it didn't to give the audience more build up and excitement that I think is very necessary for superhero movies.It is very clear throughout that Burton was more interested in the Joker than Batman, admittedly he is a great character and Jack Nicholson shines in the role,a lot more than Michael Keaton does,but the film is called Batman and the fact that Jokers origins are told, and he definitely has more dialogue than the title character,is unusual,although it definitely makes for a different experience in the Batman universe.Action packed with very interesting characters and entertaining performances,I would recommend Batman to all fans of the franchise and to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. The caped crusader begins his fight against crime with the Joker,his biggest nemesis who is looking to take over Gotham City. Best Performance: Jack Nicholson Worst Performance: Billy Dee Williams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film captures the essence of the original Bill Finger/Bob Kane interpretation of the character, brought into a modern time that addresses the practicality of the real issue of dealing with criminals like the Nicholson Joker. In order for Batman to be successful he must maintain a ruthlessness and intelligence that the Christopher Nolan Batman does not have. Besides, a great man once said, "A good movie should be easy to understand and fun to watch". That man is Akira Kurosawa. The reason this is both the greatest Batman film and the essential Batman film is that it speaks for itself. Part of the marketing for the film was just the Bat symbol and the Bat symbol alone. But I digress. In conclusion, this film (From it's Music, Production Design, and Direction) is Exceptional, won Academy Awards, and leaves you feeling great after seeing it. It's a Batman film of its time but it's also the greatest Batman film of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that Superhero movies from comics are a standard staple in Hollywood releases, it's interesting to rewatch this movie and appreciate it for what it is. An adaptation by the quirky yet genius direction of Tim Burton.Batman is a normal guy and unlike the 'roided out heroes of today's films, he maintains a demeanor and calm on camera that gives the viewer a sense of imagination (oh no!). It's not what is shown on screen that makes this movie impressive, but it's ability to place the viewer in a different world, where a man dresses as a vigilante bat and the only reason why? It's because he's Batman and that's what he does! No explanation was needed as to his motivations. He's the caped crusader, the dark knight, the kind of hero kids look up to. All the origin story lines intertwined into Superhero movies now-a-days are boring and stale. This movie cuts right to the chase. Burton's Batman mask is iconic and Keaton's arched eyebrows fit the masked vigilantes 'look' perfectly.Burton masterfully uses shadows to give Batman's silhouette a dark and foreboding on screen appearance. While the comic fanatics wanted a slug fest in every scene, this movie paces itself. What it does is make one appreciate the kind of "man" that Batman actually is. Even as a superior conditioned martial artist, no one is invincible. Yet he still manages to have some cool fight scenes that make the viewer appreciate the time he is given on screen when fighting enemies.The Joker is also an amazing character. He get's his own 'origins' plot line mixed in with the arch of the film. You see a mob underboss go from toeing the line to insanity. The younger Jack Napier is a very impressive looking actor that is impeccably dressed. This feeds into the narcissism and vanity that is the Joker. He's a man that lost his edge and is now entirely unpredictable. A worthy foe.Then you have the sets on this film. Simply amazing. Such a treat for the eyes as you know you are looking at actual brick and mortar sets instead of the silly CGI backgrounds used in films today. The viewer can tell the amount of hard work and dedication went into really creating the universe of Gotham as a twist on pre-World War II eras and architecture. It's once again, iconic and unique to this film.And there are the little things, like when the two Reporters look hideous with frizzy hair and zits because all the cosmetic chemicals in the city have been tainted. Such a magnificent and subtle nod to the kind of love and dedication that went into this film.This film is truly a masterpiece. It takes itself seriously when it has to but despite the dark scenery and film noir elements, it is playful and a movie about a Superhero bent on fighting crime that no one else can. If you can't find enjoyment in this then go back to your Iron Man and Dark Knight Returns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypnotic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is a visual medium. It is the art of making an audience care about what is really no more than just lights on a screen. That is art, and that is awesome. Many films accomplish this job primarily with their story, such as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan or It's A Wonderful Life. However, there are films that take total advantage of their being part of a visual medium, and capture the audience's attention primarily with their direction, cinematography, acting, and lighting. I do not think any other film does this as well as Batman. Rather than trying to tell a coherent story, Batman is all about atmosphere and characters. I think that the success of the film can be primarily credited to director Tim Burton. He crafts an INCREDIBLE piece of cinema here. The direction, cinematography, and lighting are sheer brilliance. Everything in Batman looks so dark, shadowy, and haunting. Everything is larger than life and causes pure awe. It has an effect on me personally that is just hypnotic and makes it near impossible for me to tear my eyes away from the screen. That is how to direct and shoot a film. However, the look of the film is not all that holds the attention of the audience. The power of the on screen actors is something not to overlook. I honestly believe the film has one of the best ensembles of actors ever assembled for a piece of entertainment. Two great actors in particular stand out amongst the cast. Jack Nicholson plays- no, IS the Joker. I have seen extremely few actors who have seemed to enjoy themselves more in a role or have been as much fun to watch. The Joker is a total maniac. For seemingly no reason other than fun, the Joker does horrible things to people, murdering them or freezing their face in a permanent smile. And he loves it. Nicholson becomes the character. His laughter and antics while doing horrible things are just so priceless they're contagious and you find yourself laughing along as he commits murder after murder. He's quite possibly the single most entertaining villain ever put in a comic book movie. Not the best, but for me possibly the most entertaining. But equally amazing in his way is Michael Keaton as Batman. Casting crazy comedian Keaton as the dark vigilante may seem like a bizarre casting choice. That it is. And it's brilliant. Keaton is totally phenomenal in the role. As Bruce Wayne, he's awkward and quirky. You wouldn't suspect him as Batman in a million years. That's brilliant by itself. And then Keaton appears as Batman. And? he is incredible. He speaks very little, but he leaves an image that you will never forget. Keaton's performance combined with the direction, cinematography, and lighting is simply breathtaking. When he does speak, it's calm and menacing. You wouldn't want to get on his bad side. His very presence is menacing. He can so much as smile and be frightening. The smile and his movements show no fear and that he's ready to face off against you and take you down without a struggle. That's the Batman. The atmosphere and characters are what makes the movie work for me. It's a hypnotic, haunting experience that combines a hero and villain who are polar opposites. Batman is my absolute favorite comic book movie of all time. I find it to be more engaging and memorable than many plot-based films with its characters and atmosphere. That's pretty extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Modern Comic Book Movie Begins Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1989, the "Comic Book Movie" was Non Existent. Yes, there were the Superman Movies from the Seventies but They were a Stand Alone Series that had some Ripple Effects like some Low Budget Clunkers and the Wonder Woman TV Series, but the Whole Concept was Considered too Expensive as a Major Motion Picture Project, too Iffy, and the Absence of CGI for that "Realistic" Superpowers Effect was Another Deterrent.All that Changed after Tim Burton's Batman. Costing about 35 Mil, it Grossed more than 10 Times that in the USA Alone and that's not even Considering Video, Overseas, and the Avalanche of Merchandising. It was a Gold Rush.Audiences have been Reaping the Benefits ever since. With Outstanding Franchises like X-Men, Christopher Nolan's Reboots, and Spider-Man. But this is the Dazzling, Demented, Nutzoid Film that gave Birth to the Modern Comic Book Movie. Director Tim Burton and Production Designer Anton Furst Unleashed a Gothic Noir that Tapped into the Modern Angst of Cultural Cynicism. Add Jack Nicholson's Own Bent on the Joker and that was Enough to Propel this Anomaly of a Movie into Box-Office Overkill.But it is the Batman that is the Soul of the Endeavor. Ever Since His Introduction in 1940, Batman's Yang to Superman's Ying, Comic Book Artists and Writers All want to Work on Batman. He is the Premiere Lone, Brooding Hero that is Ripe with Rage and has been Bent and Shaped this way and that, but Still Remains...The Batman.Legendary and Existing Alone on an Island of Style, along with the Sequel Batman Returns (1992), there is Really Nothing Like the Two Seminal Exercises in Bent, Avant Garde, Visionary Expositions of Pop Culture Icons. The Two Batman Movies from Tim Burton Ignited a Fire of a Film Genre that is Still Blazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And still do. I grew up with Michael Keaton as my Batman and Jack Nicholson as my Joker. I still consider them to be quite fitting for their respective roles. There was something distant about the way Keaton portrayed Batman, but something quite human as Bruce Wayne. He was able to elegantly shift from being Batman to being Mr. Wayne. Jack Nicholson as the Joker is still able to creep me out. His maniacal laugh combined with his grin is, well, just creepy.Tim Burton did a good job adapting Batman into the big screen. Making him a somewhat believable and humane character. Realistic, but not realistic realistic. More like comic realistic. If he had made the movie too realistic it would have taken away the fun and the excitement of Batman. It is also a good thing he refused to use the campy approach, but a more focused and serious approach since it would also have killed the fun of it. Also a good thing he did not make it too serious. It is also quite important that Batman is just a mask and that Bruce Wayne is the real character unlike as in Batman Begins. Bruce is the reason for why Batman exist. Batman is Bruce Wayne's alter ego, whom he created to bring justice to the streets and to avenge his parents.The movie has a dark and odd sense of humor. For example, in this movie Jack turned Bruce into Batman, Batman turned Jack into the Joker. The bad guy creates the hero, but the hero also creates the bad guy. Which is an oddly funny circle of evil. So with the above statements, you might have already guessed that I am not much interested in the Nolan Batman, but more in the Burton Batman. By the way this is not the best movie Tim Burton did, but it is still quite a memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably should have been called 'Joker' (but never mind)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes it's hard to imagine the Batman franchise without Christopher Bale and co, let alone with someone other than Heath Ledger as 'the Joker.' However, many years before Bale donned the famous black cowl, Michael Keaton was the 'Dark Knight.' And, believe it or not, he didn't do a bad job (at the time).Although, despite Keaton being reasonably well-known, top billing ? naturally ? went to Jack Nicholson as the Joker. And for a good reason ? he steals every scene. Until Ledger's final performance as the psychotic clown, no one could really see anyone else as the Batman's most infamous nemesis. Perhaps the only downside was that Jack Nicholson was given so much screen time and so many of the best lines, it's hard to see Batman as anything but a secondary character who just pops up every now and again to thwart whatever the Joker happened to be doing at the time. Despite the fact that Batman ? technically ? has wings, his character doesn't get much of an opportunity to fly. Even the fact that Bruce Wayne had a 'love interest' in the form of Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale didn't give Batman too much extra time on screen. Plus Basinger was little more than a 'damsel in distress,' screaming and gasping in bewilderment and fear almost as much as she spoke.The 1989 vision of Batman was a smash hit, but not without its detractors. A lot of comic book fans resented the choice of director (Tim Burton) and his casting of Keaton in the titular role. Tim Burton confessed that he had never actually read a comic book (and some said it showed). However, his vision of the Dark Knight may not have been completely in keeping with its comic book roots, but it was pretty impressive. He certainly got the tone right, bringing Batman away from his 'campy' TV roots and portraying him as something much darker. Most described the outing as a 'twisted fairytale' which, although didn't reflect the source material, was a pretty accurate description.It's safe to say that now, after Nolan's Batman trilogy, that most people consider his to be the 'definitive' Batman. However, Burton's outing/outings shouldn't be written off as anything but good. If you don't mind the villain being given more screen time than the hero, it's worth a watch alone for Nicholson's performance. Heath Ledger may be the Joker of today, but Nicholson will always be the Joker of my childhood, therefore, I give him the last laugh.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

In the modern cinema lacks myths and imaginations, they are always real and gloomy.Although the new Batman movies are good, but they have not the Charm from Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne or Jack Nicholsons Joker's madness,Heath Ledger played it very well, but Jack Nicholsons "Joker" is for me the perfect opponent to Bruce Wayne.Christopher Nolan's version for me is not really a Batman movie, it's a James Bond with wings.Everything is great here, the Gothic-style from the City, costumes, settings, actors, the play of light and shadow, and last but not least make the music that all of the best Batman movie of all Time for me.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is my favorite superhero film next to the Dark Knight( another Batman film). Batman has always been my favorite superhero and this films proves it. Michael Keaton is my all time favorite Batman and Jack Nicholson makes a fantastic Joker as well.Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors and this film shows of his style. Gotham City looks old and dusty but beautiful at the same time. It looks like a futuristic 1950s if that makes any sense. There's not too much to say about this film except the one important thing. Go watch it!!! It's a very different film from the Dark Knight but you have to except that. There's some things better than this film and some things are better about the Dark Knight e.g Michael Keaton makes a better Batman film that Christian Bale and Heath Ledger makes a better than Jack Nicholson. Great film but very different from the Dark Knight</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They can afford to be odd"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the old Batman TV series, years ago. These quirky little adventures were kind of fun in their own way; exuberant, brightly coloured and very, very silly. I recall one episode which cliffhangered with Batman about to be sewn into a mattress. And of course, that Batman was clearly very insecure about his own identity, because he felt the need to give everything he owned the bat- prefix ? batguns, batmasks, batmats and so forth. That was the Batman of the 60s. Enter the Batman of the next generation.The thing that first strikes first about this version of the comic adventure is how dark it is ? literally. Production designers Anton Furst and Peter Young have really put the goth in Gotham City, creating trashy neo-noir streets and cavernous halls filled with steam and searchlights. The cyberpunk look was very much a staple of 80s action movies, but the mould for Batman is a little different. Taking in the 1950s-style newsroom or the daisywheel printout in the chemical plant, this looks more like the Terry Gilliam film Brazil than it does The Terminator. Director Tim Burton may not have contributed quite so much to the design of this picture as he normally does, but his unique handling of space is key to the overall effect. He often shows characters dwarfed within the sets, or throws in close-ups of props in action, giving every environment a life of its own.Then there is the character of Batman himself, as re-imagined by screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren. Notably they ditch the flamboyantly-dressed sidekick Robin, and aim to inject some humanity and realism into the caped crusader without making him boring. The focus is very much on the hero's dual lives as Batman and Bruce Wayne. The fact that this Batman not only keeps his alter-ego a secret from those who know him as Wayne, but seems almost ashamed about it is an incredibly sympathetic touch, and his inability to be a completely whole man for the woman in his life makes him a rather tragic figure. Of course, this isn't just a psychological study, it is at heart an action movie, but the depth and complexity with which the character is endowed make the fast-paced crash-bang business end all that much more satisfying. This Batman isn't just some unbeatable physical force, he's a human being struggling with his flaws just like the rest of us.And appropriately enough lead man Michael Keaton is not some strapping, strong-jawed action star. To cast a very average-looking guy of course makes the Batman persona more logical, because rather than use his physical strength Batman relies on machines, gadgets and his own intelligence. Keaton is best known for his semi-improvised comedy parts, but here he plays it straight, giving us a thoughtful, businesslike hero, open to his emotions and very much in the spirit of this adaptation. Keaton's restraint and naturalism is in complete contrast to his nemesis, Jack Nicholson's Joker. Although he has given some very good straight performances Nicholson is basically a big ham at heart, and he really knows how to go to town on a role like this. He is obviously just enjoying himself, improvising little flourishes and playing out his lines for all their worth (e.g. "brand Xssssssssssssss"). He provides a daffy counterpoint to what is sometimes a very serious take on the superhero movie.And yes, it is only sometimes that this version of Batman is serious. It may be dark, brooding and psychologically deep, but it's also a cornucopia of oddball ideas ? green gas, horrific plastic surgery, not to mention the final fight scene choreographed to a playful waltz. It makes the whole thing very watchable, compensating for the fact that the action isn't up to the high standards of the decade by simply throwing in something demented every five minutes to keep things interesting. It is in fact, like the 60s TV series, very, very silly. But also very, very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Batman experience like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid, I wasn't really into superheroes, but Batman always stuck out like a sore thumb when I would ask myself which superhero is best. The thing about Batman is that he doesn't have any superpowers, yet he is still referred to as a superhero! This always made me question what quality must a hero have to make him or her super? As of today, I still don't have a clue, but Batman remains my favourite. He's dark, he's depressing, but he also kicks a lot of super villain butt! Now, onto the film that made him popular again.1989's Tim Burton directed, "Batman" is the average tale of superhero vs super villain, and what better villain to have than the joker? Their confrontations, as well as Batman having to deal with the life of having two identities, is the basis for the plot. With each scene, the plot slowly unravels, and we don't feel as if the movie is in any way wasting our time with pointless scenes.Michael Keaton plays the legendary caped crusader to a point where we can relate him and feel his pain when he loses. He, in my opinion, is the best Batman. That smile that he pulls in the final confrontation scene is nothing short of sheer brilliance, and is something that only Keaton can do.Jack Nicholson IS the joker. He's played enough roles to know how a psychopath is supposed to act, and he does it with a slight sense of dementia and psychosis, which makes the Joker who he is. His jokes are hilarious, and his look is classic. I'm sorry to any Heath Ledger fans, but Jack steals the show in a way that Ledger never could. I'm probably going to get scolded for that, but it's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.If you're going to watch a Batman film that succeeds in terms of darkness and a bit of dark comedy, then "Batman" is for you. I'll go as far to say it's the best; but don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and be prepared for a ride.8 sets of chattering teeth out of 10.</fullReview>

I hadnt seen it in a few years but i remembered liking it, though i think it swept me away even more so this time, Jack Nicholson was outstanding, Michael Keaton was possibly the best Batman ever, Kim Basinger was fantastic, and Michael Gough was flatout great as Alfred, the only thing i didn't necessarly get swept away by was questionable choice of having so many Prince songs in there, though this is a Tim Burton film and he is quite an eccentric filmmaker. I recommend this film to any lover of a weird quirky funhouse of surprises.All in all i give this movie 9/10 *'s for being so awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's First Batman Movie Is Probably The Best One.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only first seen this movie in it's entirety about 10 years ago. It is very good. Michael Keaton plays batman extremely well, never giving away too much and being the all round good guy Bruce Wayne also. Needless to say Jack Nicholson steals the show as the warped Joker, a classic performance in itself: creepy and yet hilarious. Nicholson really enjoyed this role, you can tell. There was a lot of controversy I believe over Keaton playing the title role and not some 6 feet 4 macho man but that is beyond the point: Batman is a man. He is Bruce Wayne - billionaire business tycoon who remains in the shadows pretty much until terror reigns over Gotham City and he saves the day. Batman may look scary but he isn't at all. He is the good guy and we see that in this film. Kim Basinger was well cast as Vicki Vale, the sexy journalist who has a BIG thing for bats...batman...and...guess who?...Yes!...Bruce Wayne! It's an enjoyable adventure with a great cast and we would expect no less from a genius director like Tim Burton to give us a great, fun-filled 2 hours of movie magic.</fullReview>

It maybe looks like I am maybe too late for reviewing this movie but it is classic movie and many generations will watch it . There are so good parts of this movie . When I compare it with other Batman movie I think that it is one of better . Maybe it isn't better than Nolan's movies but it is in better half . Actors are also very good .Tim Burton directed this movie and you can see his good imagination and I think that it is one of better directors for this kind of movies . I still can find his directing weapon which is very well used . Maybe he was in this movie too much that he forgot that there are some parts which are reminding me on some modern fairytale . I like his imagination and way how he wants to show imaginative side of the movie. He found himself in this movie.Michael Keaton as Batman maybe was too calm but his role was definitely one of most wanted roles in superhero movies . I wasn't maybe too happy because of his appearance in this movie but he surprised me . I was very happy because of the way how he acted this role . Keaton maybe looked sometimes confused in this movie but I don't think that he was confused . His way of acting maybe looked frivolous but it wasn't . He had to fit into Burton's vision of my favorite superhero .Jack Nicholson as Joker was the best part of this movie and he was so good . It isn't so easy to act some lunatic . He was very convincing and he is better Joker than Heath Ledger . Nicholson was maybe more crazy and he was real Joker from comic book . He was really good . I really appreciate Nicholson's spectra of acting . He was damn good and he really did his job very well .Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale was maybe not as good as Keaton and Nicholson but she had clear and maybe the easiest role in whole movie. I appreciate her acting but I don't think that she was in same level with two main characters . She looked like real example how to act some supporting role in this kind of movie . Burton really made this movie like he wanted .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gentlemen, let's broaden our minds. Lawrence!! And the music plays!! I don't know but I didn't see this one coming after years of the comic books and the 1960's series on television, in which I loved. I tell you, I didn't think about this, until they (the studio) released the 'Pre-views' for this in I think it was late 1988. I believe every potential ticket buyer stood up for this one. And ah, let's take a moment... Nicholson: "You can call me Joker!" If you don't think this cat can play a criminal master-mind in the most degenerate way and yet with a flair for the dramatic, and still dressed like a well tailored comic-book character, then you-don't-know-Jack!! The right idea for casting this, in both arena's. Who would have thought that Michael Keaton, would be the Man! He shined as a hero multi-millionaire in reclusion. He fought crime, convincingly with crushing strength and in style. People were griping about Keaton as Batman, when word had gotten out in the shooting process and the studio was ready to pull-it, I heard until Tim Burton the director told them they need to see him in action first and he gave them the pre-view reel of this. That made believers of them all! Funny thing was that Bill Murray of SNL was the almost original pick for this comic caper. Think on that one for a moment, I mean Bill is great, but whoa, I don't know here! The Joker was given a gold plated deal of a contract on this one. He received a guaranteed 10 million, or a percentage of the 'Gross' whichever was highest. He ended up with over 60 million for himself! Jack Palance another giant in character cinema. And as Jack's boss that was perfect. There are not many, that can be the criminal empire boss like Palance could play it, as he did so well.Then the others who played in this putting the rest together for a fun feast of the senses in regard to a crime fighting blockbuster. Kim Basinger in what was quite a Hey!-day. She was lovely and soft as silk to look upon. "Well, miss vale." The joker exclaimed upon seeing her for the first time. Then there is Robert Wuhl, the ever smart-alack type reporter who carried it off as if it was nothing but him. In love with Vicky too, but would lose out to the Batman. Of course. I was glad to see this come to the theater and do as well as it did. I can't believe that it was now over 20 years ago. WWhere does the time go? RECOMMENDED HIGHLY (****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Batman' has a problem, it has a far superior interpretation of the same source material released 19 years later. In all seriousness though you can't really look at 'Batman' the same way after seeing Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight'. It isn't fair to Tim Burton or Christopher Nolan but it's inevitable. 'Batman' has aged in the same way 'Superman: The Movie' has. That being said the imagination of what is put on screen still has the power to entertain. 'Batman's power to entertain is in no way diminished by Nolan's 'Dark Knight'. I can still have a lot of fun with 'Batman'.The fact is Tim Burton is one of the finest directors of this era of film. 'Batman' though represents one of his earliest efforts in film-making. It was a very ambitious project for the time and I don't think young Burton could quite handle the epic scale of some of it. That being said Burton has made a version of 'Batman' that is uniquely his. I appreciate that very much. It's hard to put a unique voice on 'Batman' because he is a legend. Say what you will about Schumacher's films but he too put a unique voice on it. I think every director tackling the series has made it his own. In Burton's case I think he has offered the most visually impressive 'Batman'.The problem with Burton's Batman and this first series in general is it's complete lack of character development. In many cases we feel we are getting to know caricatures instead of characters. I don't know if I place the blame entirely on Burton. I think I could just as easily blame the blockbuster aspect of the film, or Nicholson's Joker for upstaging Bruce Wayne. We don't really want to know the Joker. He's more of a force of nature than he is a character (This includes Ledgers version as well). We have to get to know Batman though to fully invest ourself in the story. We don't get to know him at all. He is distant. We know the back story but we don't know the force that drives Batman out into the night. Schumacher and Burton didn't address the psychological aspects of the character at all. Burton was more interested in his villains. I think Keaton could have offered a truly inspired performance. Since he is given undeveloped material we merely have a very good performance when it could have been excellent.That is really my main gripe with the film. Watching it after having seen and loved 'Dark Knight' I still think a lot of it really works. Perhaps what brings me back again is Nicholson's Joker. Never has an actor so blatantly chewed the scenery or gone over the top and I have to say I loved every minute of it. There's only one person who could have gotten away with this and still had this performance and the film work and that is Jack Nicholson. His performance is full of energy and it's one of the most fun performances I have ever seen. I mean I can;t help but invest myself with him because he is a magnet. I laugh and continue to laugh with Nicholson's Joker despite his being completely screwed in the head. Maybe this isn't the best written or performed interpretation of the Joker, but it isn't a wrong interpretation either. Nicholson actually makes us Jokers ourselves as we laugh at his crazy antics.What is as much a character as Joker or Batman is Gotham it's self. The Set Direction is beautiful. It's the perfect marriage of Burton's vision, the comics, and inspiration from German Expressionism, and Film Noir. It isn't realistic or gritty like a New York or Chicago but it has a beautiful dream like quality.What is really special also is Danny Elfman's fine score. The music is really a backbone to this picture. The theme is one of the most memorable in film. I rank it among some of John Williams or Bernard Hermann's great works. It's a theme that stirs the blood like the Star Wars main theme. I get tingles when I hear it and that is the true mark of a great musician. Elfman hasn't offered anything truly spectacular since the new millennium but he has already more than left his mark on cinema music lore. To think this didn't get an Oscar is really a sin.It isn't the best Batman film but it's a very good film. It still has the power to lure people in and most importantly entertain them. 'Batman' in many ways created this superhero genre we are in today. I'll tell you this I'd take Burton's Batman over almost any of today's current crop of Comic Book fodder except of course Nolan's 'Dark Knight'....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman 1989 A movie that I watched over and over again as a youth even though at the time I did not completely understand it. This may not be the best movie for a then five or six year old. I have had a VHS copy of the film and Two copies on DVD. This might be the one film I have watched the most in my life time. I fin...ally rewatched it yesterday after many years. It amazes me that this film is only rated PG down here in Canada and PG13 in the USA. With all of the mass murders, mobsters and mutilation. Oh yeah and the fowl language. Let me say this Jack Nickelson does a wonderful job at bringing The Joker to life. He got all of the memorable quotes in this film. Not to mention his entertaining rampage spreading chaos as he murders the citizens of Gotham, while rocking out to Prince. I guess The Joker is spreading death pain and purple rain. A highly intelligent man with a disturbingly dark scene of humour. Its his unpredictability and untamability that makes him one of the greatest villains of all time. This is really a anti hero's journey this movie. Because traditionally Batman is not supposed to kill anyone regardless of the situation. The Joker is supposed to exist to torments Batman to push him over the edge. He is the harlequin of hate and lives for the idea of bringing Batman and the world around to his level. As soon ... See Moreas Batman kills somebody he is just as bad as the people he is trying to stop. Perhaps the idea that Batman kills criminals in this movie is the sickest joke of all. Oh Yeah - As a kid I remember having a poster of The Joker from this movie on my bedroom wall. Good gosh I wish I still had that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylistically great comic book film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The criminals of Gotham City are running scared due to sightings of a 6 foot bat creature that has been stalking the city for the past month. The police don't believe the sightings to be legitimate. Little do they know that billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne spends his evenings as Batman, a vigilante that strikes fear into the hearts of criminals. Meanwhile, Gotham's District Attourney Harvey Dent and the police force are working to bring down crime boss Carl Grissom, and Grissom's right hand man Jack Napier is given the job of covering up criminal activity in a chemical processing plant. During a confrontation with Batman, Napier falls into a vat of chemicals and emerges as a psychotic villain known as The Joker. When the Joker begins poisoning Gotham's citizens with tampered hygiene products, Batman must come out of the shadows and try to stop the Joker once and for all.Batman is an example of a comic book movie done right. Tim Burton is able to balance his style with the style of the Batman comic books in order to create a unique and entertaining film. Burton creates a dark and Gothic world for Batman to operate in, and as a result makes the character darker, as he should be. Everything Tim Burton has done with this film fits so well. The way Gotham City looks is genius. The buildings are warped and decaying, and the weather is almost always gloomy, as if the city is reflecting the criminal element within. Bruce Wayne is a brooding and serious man, though he does show glimmers of a lighter side. Michael Keaton, though not really looking the part, plays the part very well, creating a menacing, gravelly voice for the Batman persona that would come to be used by most actors to play Batman in the future. Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker is a fine piece of acting. He plays the character as a mix between the sadistic and murderous Joker of the 70s and 80s and the goofy prankster of the 50s and 60s. Danny Elfman's score is perfect for the tone of the film and gives the movie an epic quality. I really enjoyed some of the story elements such as starting the film a month into Batman's crime fighting career, before anyone knows he really exists. It's really interesting to hear the criminals and police force of Gotham talking about Batman as a supernatural urban myth.Despite all the great qualities this film has, it does leave some things to be desired. When it comes to the character of the Joker, there were things I felt could have been done better. I felt that even though Jack Nicholson gave a great performance, there was too much of Jack Nicholson in the Joker. He didn't really change himself all that much. The Joker in the comics has no name, no identity, and can't remember who he was before he was the Joker. In this film he is just a mobster with a disfigurement, and he knows exactly who he is, and he doesn't really change from before his origin to after. I felt that the flashback showing the Joker as the man who killed Bruce Wayne's parents was an unnecessary change from the comics that was just thrown in to make the final fight more personal. I felt that the relationship between Batman and Commissioner Gordon could have been explored more. Commissioner Gordon barely had anything to do in this film, and he's supposed to be a big part of the Batman mythology.Overall, this is a vastly entertaining comic book film, and is a great movie in itself as well.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and moody; but with a sense of humour, and real cinematic imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although today it can be seen as something of a flawed work - compromised somewhat by continual studio interference - Burton's first Batman film (1989) remains a surprisingly vivid comic-book style action adventure film, peppered throughout by the director's continual quirks and characteristics, which for me, makes the experience all the more unique. I know it's almost the accepted opinion these days to reject Burton's vision, post Batman Begins (2004); with many critics dismissing this as closer in tone to the retro 60's TV series, which is bull, as we all know. At the time, this was considered the darkest knight of all, and the continual shift into more violent and lurid psychological territory presented by its sequel, Batman Returns (1992), saw Burton dismissed from the series indefinitely. Although Nolan's subsequent Batman films have attempted to take the franchise into more credible areas - and with great success - they for me lack that certain spark of imagination and subversive sense of humour that made the Burton films so radical and so much fun.Here, the world of Batman - as presented by Burton - gives the film much of its power. Whereas previous adaptations of the character had placed him within the context of a recognisable present-day environment, this Batman creates a dark, Gothic underworld that is part Metropolis (1927), part Gilliam's Brazil (1985). You could also argue that there's a touch of Blade Runner (1982) presented here as well, with the retro-futurist look of distressed exteriors and Art Nouveau creating an odd juxtaposition; suggesting an almost timeless setting that is falling rapidly into despair. With these references in place, Burton goes wild with strokes of German Expressionism and references to film-noir, as he plays not only with an excellent use of shadow and composition, but also with a sly and irreverent use of colour. For example, with this presentation of the Joker (still a contentious factor for some viewers), Burton gives us a screaming, pop-art inspired lunatic - again, part Warhol, part Edward G. Robinson - with the typical charm and caddish likability that only Nicholson could truly convey.I have no problem with this presentation of the joker. Ledger's variation exists in a different world with a completely different tone, so such comparisons are ultimately faulty! The only similarity is that in both films the Joker dominates the proceedings, more so than Batman himself. In Nicholson's hands, the Joker is dangerous *and* amusing; his charm combined with his insanity making him even more fascinating. He is, as he proclaims, an "artist"; someone willing to disfigure their own fiancé for the purposes of creative expression. "I create art until someone dies", he says, and we believe him. The introduction to the Joker - post-transformation - is still a completely iconic scene, as he aggressively demands a mirror from his plastic surgeons and then smashes it in a fit of mad giggles and inevitable hysterics. This scene - like the following one in which he reaps revenge on a former partner that betrayed him - is straight out of the best of post-war Noir. Admittedly, Batman, by comparison, seems less interesting; with the limitations of a character who essentially hinges around the absurd idea of dressing up in a rubber costume and fighting crime, always requiring a great leap of faith on the part of the audience, as he is forced to become even more brooding and serious in order to remain somewhat plausible.Regardless of what more obsessive comic-book fans might suggest, I thought the style of this film - with its use of framing and composition - was pure comic-strip. It's not a graphic novel adaptation, but a proper comic book style adventure; with the skewed angles and tight editing creating that feel of reading from one panel to the next. It benefits from the team that Burton surrounds himself with, from the cinematographer Roger Pratt, who shot the aforementioned Brazil and turned the seedy side of London into a screaming inferno for Neil Jordan's great film Mona Lisa (1986), as well as composer Danny Elfman and the late production designer Anton Furst. The only thing that really lets us down are a couple of somewhat dated optical effect shots, such as the introduction of Batman looking down on the city from a high-rise tower block, to some obvious miniature work that probably ties in with Burton's fondness for the work of Ray Harryhausen or director Mario Bava. Nonetheless, these are minor flaws that we face in numerous films and ones that are easily overlooked.Ultimately, the argument of realism offered by many detractors of Burton's Batman films makes very little sense; again, we're talking about a film in which a billionaire playboy dons a head-to-toe rubber costume and fights crime at night - how much more plausible can this get? Burton's approach to Batman, drawing on some of the more revisionist comic book works of Frank Miller and Alan Moore, conveyed a darker, more personal slant to the character, but still retained that sense of colour, fun and imagination that the more recent Batman films seem to have lost. They're still great films, but for me, the two Batman projects from Burton capture the spirit and tone of the character perfectly, as well as conveying a naturally intuitive approach to film-making that resulted in some genuinely interesting cinematic work. The follow up, Batman Returns would be even better, and remains probably my favourite Batman film, if not my favourite Tim Burton film of all time.</fullReview>

And my God, the MUSIC?I don't know when I've seen a movie lit up the way Elfman did with this beautiful score. The music is so pure and well-written that the Academy must have overlooked it by accident when they were passing out nominations. Oh, well?that happens all the time. In a home theater with good bass, its hard not to notice when Commissioner Gordon switches the bat-signal on at the end-- that music lights up just like it! Then it calms down just enough for Kim Basinger to look up and think about her new boyfriend, and then say Hi to good old Alfred. When their car turns and leaves, the music fires up like a shooting star, showing the main character one last time in grand, heroic fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The answer YES!!!!! This is bar none the best of all Batman films and don't let anybody tell you different.This does not show the origin of Batman but does show you the reason behind him doing the job he does. The villain in this film is the Joker portrayed beautifully by Jack Nicholson who i think should have won an award for the performance he puts in. The film is dark and dingy and feels out of place compared to many superhero films but its effective and it works, Draedevil tried to go for this dark city by night but it failed. The cinematography and direction are spot on and this is one of Tim Burtons finest achievements to date and the cinematography keeps you at the edge of your seat and never really lets you sit back and relax which is another reason why this film works so much. My favorite scenes have to be the last forty minutes as we see Batman avenging his parents and the score by Danny Elfman does the last forty minutes justice and Tim Burton makes the ending great big and grand which is what it needed to be. The final confrontation with the Joker and Batman is one of the most powerful scenes i've seen on celluloid for ages.So why should you watch this film, well all i can say is if you want to watch a comic book film that isn't just about the amount of effects you can put in then get hold of this in anyway possible sit back and watch it again and again and again.******** OUT OF **********</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson's depiction of the Joker should have, in my opinion, earned him an Oscar. Later in the movie, when Batman crashed through the skylight as Danny Elfman's perfect score blasted over the soundtrack, I knew I wanted to make films with such power and style for the rest of my life. I know some might be thinking "So what, it was just a typical summer action flick." But you have no idea how much I owe to this masterpiece. Every frame of Batman is flawless.

		<fullReview>Given the pre-assumptions of audiences regarding what to expect from this film prior to its release, this film must have shocked all those expectant of a nod to the 1960s camp TV show Batman. On the contrary to this assumption, Burtons masterpiece (still my favourite Tim Burton film to date) creates the Gotham that was intended for Batman, and explores the emotional baggage of the man behind the mask Bruce Wayne.Must credit goes to the scriptwriting here, which intertwines the back story of Bruces parents tragic death with the story of Batman v Joker. The Joker played brilliantly by Nicholson in the role he was born for proclaims 'you made me' before Batman retorts 'you made me first'. While Nolans recent exploration of the dynamic between Batman and Joker portrays a playful game of cat and mouse, Burtons meek instalment takes it to a more personal level.While Keaton is amazing as Bruce Wayne, the lonely millionaire who's haunted by his tragic past, Nicholson steals the film from him. Every scene the two share is an example of Nicholson owning Keaton at acting. Not only that, he's so so funny as a psychotic i cant think of anyone better for the role (Ledger is certainly more devilishly menacing, but Nicholson definitely brings humour to the role more naturally. Maybe its just me, because Nicholson tickles me in the Shining. The guy just cracks me up when playing a psychotic).While Burtons Gotham as stated earlier presents us an abstract environment (now something of a niche in hindsight) clearly nodding to German Expressionism, it is also symbolically suggestive of a dangerous environment; one that needs Batman.The film isn't flawless though, since Bruces love interest Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) proves to be one of the most irritating characters in film with constant screaming at every opportunity. Aside from this i cant think of any other flaws in truth, anything comparative with Nolans trilogy of realist Batman would seem unfair to use for criticism, since Burton is Burton and has his own approach to the character, much like Nolan is Nolan and has his own. I think upon viewing you wont disagree Burton has hit the nail on the head here in approaching Batman and taking away the perception of Batman as the camp 1960s superhero.</fullReview>

And if I may say, Jack Nicholson's performance is captivating &amp; jaw dropping. I feel Heath Ledger's performance is often considered the greatest portrayal of The Joker (It is legendary). However, Jack N.'s performance reminds me of James Cagney's trademark portrayal of gangsters. I believe Heath drew much inspiration &amp; technique (not discrediting his originality) from Jack's Joker. Overall, many amazing, remarkable scenes, a great story line, beautiful scenery makes this film a 9/10. :-)JUSTIN M. BUCK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at a young age on VHS, I never really got the humour from the the Joker, but I loved the film and thought that it was the best comic book ever. After all these years I still love it, the plot follows Bruce Wayne, a lonely and mysterious man who secretly goes out to fight crime every night as the Batman. When Vicki Vale starts to date Wayne she find's out that he is not who she thought he was. While this happens,Jack Napier is sent by Carl Grissom to rob the Axis Chemical Plant but the whole thing turns out to be a set up by Grissom, and while confronting Batman, he falls into a vat of chemicals turning him into the Joker. The Joker now even more crazy then he was before decides to poison Gotham's like him when he puts the same chemicals that made him into products like shampoo,deodorant,etc. Batman foils his plans but the Joker has a dastardly plan to dump money onto the crowd at Gothem's festival ,painting him to be the good guy and batman as the villain. Batman then takes his balloons that were meant to kill the crowds at Gotham but did'not. the film ends with Batman finding out that the Joker killed Batman's parents and the Joker finds out that Batman is Bruce Wayne. This film is one of my favourite films of all time and unlike the inferior sequels,the film is a hell of a good time. Micheal Keaton is superb as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Even though, he is'not like the Bruce Wayne from the comics, he actually makes the character interesting. And as Batman, he's BAD-ASS.Jack Nicholson portrays one of the best screen villains of all time (ranks up there with Darth Vader in my opinion). At times, it seems like he steals the show but that's Nicholson for you. Tim Burton really nailed the character, he made Batman a great screen hero and the Joker a great screen villain. here's looking at you Tim, for making the best comic book movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Knight's First Great Outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays there's a new superhero movie out every summer. But back in the 80's superheroes were still considered to be entertainment mostly for children. Then the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and The Killing Joke by Alan Moore came out and were a huge success. A movie was right around the corner.The plot takes place in the familiar setting of Batman's home town, Gotham City. The city is all but controlled by mob boss Carl Grissom with police Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent all but powerless to stop him. Enter the caped crusader who starts making a name for himself as Gotham's protector. He becomes the interest of journalist Vicki Vale who is determined to find out who is under the cowl.On the opposite side of the spectrum a local thug working for Grissom, Jack Napier, encounters the Batman during a heist at a chemical plant falls into the acid. He emerges with a permanent smile and christens himself as The Joker. Joker starts to take out the other mob bosses and terrorizes the city with various deadly chemicals mixed with random every day appliances. He also gains an infatuation with Vicki Vale and constantly stalks her. Batman has to stop The Joker and save Gotham from the scum that turned him into the hero he is.This movie captures the spirit of Batman almost perfectly. Gotham City is a huge Gothic metropolis that's unique style is something only Tim Burton could create. The casting is brilliant as well. Michael Keaton plays a perfect Batman as well as Bruce Wayne and is still one of my favorite Batmans today. Jack Nicholson was also a great choice as the Joker and manages to pull off a great blend of funny and creepy.All though I thought a few things could've been improved, like the action scenes and the lack of character development for Gordon and Dent, this movie was a great way of bringing Batman back to the silver screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 years later, I took the video out and watched it again, and would you believe it? Tim Burton's film-noir has become a classic! Not only do we see the batman stirring fear into the hearts of crooks, which was the costume's intent, but we have been left with a motion-picture score that Danny Elfman didn't match again until Spider-man.Out of all the Batman films that came after, this one is still my personal favourite. Why? Because of the sophistication of Bruce Wayne's equipment compared to the time period. Because of the twist in character that allowed a wealthy industrial magnate to create a force that could only be called a superhero in a world where there were no superheroes.And, we're treated to a menace in everyway the Batman's rival, when Jack Nicholson steps out as Joker; a psychopath who kills and disfigures for pleasure. All told, the cast, the story, the direction and the production make this truly movie entertainment. Watch it at night in a dark room. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

From the cast to the script, everything worked the right way to entertain and amaze the spectator.There must be no one better than Jack Nicholson to play the joker character. His face and his expressions perfectly fit this role. Since the beginning of the movie we could see he was a extremely evil person who's got no respect for others. On the other side, Michael Keaton was just good at playing Batman. Read it straight, he was good, but another actor could be perfect in this role.I saw The Dark Knight 3 years ago when it was released to the cinema so I don't have a big memory of it, but I don't remind being so amazed with a hero movie since Spider Man. From now on I'll be watching (and reviewing of course) Batman movies until a re-watch of TDK, so I'll probably edit something here to make a comparison between the main actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A+ I remember seeing this film as I child and once the credits rolled, all I could say was "WOW". They had done it. Mind you I was born in 1992, so I became a Batman fan due to the Kevin Conroy original series and so forth. I had always wondered what a Batman film would look like. Not those camp filled crap fest with Adam West. That's not how Bob Kane had envisioned the characters at all. Instead, it is Tim Burton who breathes life into my favorite character.It all starts out with a spectacular cast. Michael Keaton is perfect as Bruce Wayne, portraying a tormented soul that was still heroic to the audiences. Thanks to Michael Gough we are able to connect deeply with him even more so. Kim Basinger did quite well, while Robert Wuhl is our comic relief somewhat but I enjoyed him in it. The talent of Keaton is nearly outdone by Jack Nicholson as Joker. His role defines psychotic, a twisted homicidal "artist" as he puts it quite often. Though he displays many of the cartoon and comic book weapons, the darkness and insanity the character gives off still makes you feel an aura of dread while in his presence, such a volatile being really. I give kudos to both this Joker and Heath Ledger's; I guess the latter might be more suited to today's realist movie goers.The story is definitely Batman at his darkest, yet enjoyably comical at times. Burton sets up a grim atmosphere with remarkable sets and nicely done lighting. Pacing is never off in this movie as well. One of the main reasons the movie really works is just that Batman is embodied so perfectly. Danny Elfman is a damn genius; the score is beautiful and thrilling. It cements the both heroic and dark moments, as well as the tragic. The flashback scene where Bruce remembers them murder of his parents was mysterious and daunting, downright exhilarating and full of terror.You see, despite the spectacular re-makes, this film will always be remembered for what it inarguably is: and that is a one-of-a-kind take on Batman that is a dam classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best comic book adaptation ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman" is a dark, yet very entertaining and brilliant portrayal of the Batman universe. The fantastic sets and immense storyline grip you and keep you within Gotham City and all that happens, it certainly makes you someone who does not want to live there. Gotham City is a character itself, and the film immerses you into it. Back in 1988, when the film was in production, The word "Batman" was twinned with the words "camp" and "comedy." So when Michael Keaton was cast as the lead role, who was a well known figure of comedy, i.e. Beetlejuice, the uproar was mind blowing. Nobody wanted him to be Batman, or thought he could even be Batman. How wrong were they? Keaton's performance is spectacular, both as the brooding Dark Knight, and as the troubled Bruce Wayne. For me, Keaton is Batman. He captured all the essence of Batman and made it so dark you would for a second forget that it is Keaton behind the mask. In my opinion, no other actor has ever topped the performance of Batman by Keaton. He was dark, menacing, intimidating, all within the opening 10 minutes. Which is what people want from Batman. Also, there is no "rule" of taking anyone's lives, which I feel is the best way to go. You can tell from his portrayal of Bruce Wayne that his sole purpose in life is to be Batman. That's who he really is. Bruce Wayne is the mask. As well as an excellent performance from Keaton, comes a magnificent portrayal of the Joker by Jack Nicholson. He is THE JOKER. You can't compare his and Heath Ledger's portrayal because despite sharing the same name and look, they have completely different motives, as well as being in a completely different world. Nicholson and Ledger are both outstanding, but Nicholson's the best in his Batman universe as is Ledger's to his. Nicholson brilliantly plays the cool yet nasty gangster Jack Napier, then transitions fluently into the crazy, sadistic, and often quite darkly humorous Joker. His and Keaton's performance is what makes the film. It would never have been as good without those two. Tim Burton's direction too is very good, he has created a perfect world for the Batman universe to live in, albeit with the help of brilliant Anton Furst, who deserved his Oscar. Burton made the action scenes truly explosive, and the softer scenes with emotion. He may have got carried away in the second film, Batman Returns, and made it perhaps a little too dark, it's still a decent Batman adventure, but this film, is faultless. The only nitpick some people have is Burton making the young Jack Napier kill Bruce's parents. Personally, I feel it was a clever move, as it now makes it more personal between the characters. So, in all, not only is it one of the best movies of all time, but the best comic book adaptation of all time. From the awesome Batmobile through to the magnificent sets and Danny Elfman's rip roaring soundtrack, this film is a legend on it's own, and set the benchmark of how superhero movies should be made. And no one's topped it yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's glowering Gothic melodrama came on the back of a Batman print resurgence, namely Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (1986) and Year One (1987), and Alan Moore's The Killing Joke (1988), which, unlike various writers and artists in the 1970s, successfully banished the spectre of camp that haunted Bruce Wayne's world since the 1960s TV series. Burton and screenwriter Sam Hamm helped thrust Batman into the public consciousness so firmly that he's been there since, surviving a mauling from Joel Schumacher, whose nipple-oriented efforts looked set to hurl this particular corner of the DC universe back into the garish ages, and recently boosted by Christopher Nolan's thunderously popular trilogy.Showing his unique talent for blending comedy, horror and oddball characterisation in Beetlejuice (a Michael Keaton character who couldn't be further from Batman), it was a no-brainer to bring Batman to the big screen at the time - and it remains so. At his best Burton paints the most beautiful nightmares in cinema. Schumacher's misguided Batman Forever and his execrable Batman &amp; Robin took the camp to Adam West extremes; Nolan has since driven into the darkest recesses of the soul. Burton finds the best balance: a glorious Gothic theatrescape populated by timeless archetypes and amusing caricatures, with a simple and convincing love story at its centre. It's tempting to snigger when we look back and consider that Burton's vision was considered "too dark" at the time, given the sombreness of Nolan's work. But bear in mind that the 1989 Batman and its sequel Batman Returns are both 15 certificate movies to Nolan's 12A. Simply, Burton's Batman is a killer (as he was in the early comics).Some fans continue to weep over Burton's liberty-taking in the re- imagining of the Wayne parents' killer, or Vicki Vale's (Kim Basinger) admittance to the Batcave, or the fact that Keaton is the wrong side of six-foot and built more like a tennis player than an American footballer. But I'm a fan also and I don't weep for such things. Gotham City and its inhabitants and histories comprise a constantly evolving and devolving universe; a series of parallel time-lines co-existing and occasionally converging, but always connected by the non-super, very human hero at its heart: Batman, wearing the mask of Bruce Wayne, made helpless by a nightmare memory. As such, so long as the character's essence remains, there is no point in making claim to the "true" Batman because no one vision is "truer" than the next.The fact that Burton himself found the film "boring" makes it all the more strange that so many elements in his gloom-drenched fantasy work so well: Anton Furst's astonishing production design; Danny Elfman's timeless score; Michael Keaton's complex Batman and Jack Nicholson's definitive Joker. Other elements aren't quite so successful. Prince's soundtrack makes for a reasonable album in its own right, but it feels fairly incongruous in the context of the movie. And the "pale moonlight" repetition, though lyrical, removes the intriguing possibility that Batman may be retrospectively adding a face to his parent's murderer, not out of genuine recollection but because of a single-minded desire for vengeance...</fullReview>

I've watched Batman a number of times over the years--enough to be able to remember quite a few lines of dialogue, which is unusual for me--and I can't remember watching it before and thinking that it was anything less than a 9 or 10. Last night, however, I was very disappointed with the film. I don't know if I just wasn't in the mood for it, or if my critical eye has changed, but I feel even generous giving the film a 7 this time around. It's loaded with problems.Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren's story/screenplay cleverly takes us back to the days when Batman was just getting started in Gotham City--he was best known to criminals, but primarily as a myth. Those who believed the myth, at least a bit, were unsure what to think--it was unclear whether the "Bat Man" was out to hurt or help people. A reporter for the big Gotham daily newspaper, Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl), believes the myths and continues to print stories about alleged sightings, to the ridicule of his fellow reporters. At the same time, we delve into a story about Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), a questionably insane head henchman for Gotham's complicated underworld network, which involves not only big baddies, like Grissom (Jack Palance), but the police as well. We also get to know Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), whom visiting photojournalist Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) is quickly falling in love with. Eventually all these threads and the Batman "myth", plus the birth of stock Batman villain, The Joker, collide. Director Tim Burton takes his time putting them together--getting to the superhero identities are "big turning points" as mini-climaxes, despite the fact that by now, even those who have not seen the film know who the superheroes are in their more mundane guises, as well which actors play them here.Since my critical surprise this time around is going to result in me mostly complaining about the film, let me mention the things I like about it first. As I implied above, I think that starting Batman at this early stage of his Gotham City crime-fighting career was a good idea. I'm not quite sure that taking so long to get into the identities of Batman and the Joker was a good idea, since Batman was already such a pop culture phenomenon by the time this film rolled, and the publicity machine is so high when you have stars of this caliber involved that there was little mystery about who the Joker was going to be. Burton spends way too much time fudging around before he gets to the meat of the film--the "big reveals" feel more like drawn-out ritual. But wait, I'm supposed to be talking about what I like.Gotham City is a sometimes-amusing satire of the common perception of New York City, and big cities in general. Well, it's mostly amusing at the start of the film, when our token victim family tries to make it back to a "safe" part of the city, or the part they know, and they have to work their way through a sea of hookers and hoods to get there. Of course, they do not make it before they're brutally mugged. Big cities aren't really like that, but people who are afraid of big cities believe that they are. After this good opener, Burton mostly forgets about this particular satire mode.I also like the production design a lot. Gotham City is part New York City, part Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), and part giant factory, or the inside of a giant machine. The costumes, gadgets, makeup and so on are all fantastic. I think that Jack Palance's performance is great, although he's not in the film nearly enough. There are also a couple times when Burton's Gothic sensibilities worked for the film.There are also a few mixed blessings. The first is that Burton references a number of other films in an unusual way. There are scenes taken from sources as diverse as Star Wars (1977) and Vertigo (1958). While I also like Star Wars, Vertigo and many of the other source films, I don't quite get what they're doing here as such blatant lifts. Maybe Burton intended the film as a spoof, but that reading doesn't quite work. This is much more serious than the real Batman spoof, the 1966 ? 68 Adam West television series, and the lifted scenes do not play like spoofs.I'm a big Jack Nicholson fan, and I occasionally like Michael Keaton. But Nicholson this over-the-top might not be a good idea. As an actor, Nicholson tends to be over the top in other films even when he's trying not to be. That's part of what I love about him. And Keaton is appropriately moody, but oddly pouty at the same time. I kept waiting for a scene of him blow-drying his hair before heading off to a disco.The biggest flaw, though, is that Burton's pacing/timing seems oddly off. Scenes drag on far too long, as do sections of the film. Lines are delivered at bizarre times in relation to other character's lines and actions (listen to Basinger's scream when the "fake gun" goes off at the end, for example), but Burton seems to not notice. There are also a lot of non-sequiturs in the script, both in individual lines of dialogue and overall, in the "logic" of many scenes and sequences. Fight scenes are neither blocked nor filmed well. Worse, two key performances--Wuhl and Basinger--are horrible (and Basinger must have troubles with high heels, by the way; they kept working excuses for her to take off her shoes into the script). Given the combination of the wonky pacing/timing, the non-sequiturs, and the bad performances, much of the film is lackluster at best, and annoying at worst. A 7, or a "C", is generous, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tim Burton flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has commented that he wouldn't be caught dead reading a comic book.....and this movie (which is based on a comic book character)shows that. This movie and Burton's other batmans show his complete misunderstanding/ignorance of the whole Batman verse and his pathetic attempt to "Burtonize" it. It seems to him that near anyone can put on a costume and go from "regular Joe" to a caped crusader. Come to think of it, Burton described Bruce Wayne as a "regular guy" that becomes something else when he dons this costume. Bruce Wayne a regular guy??? He saw he parents murdered in front of him as a kid, rules an industry empire and is driven by his darker half to become a masked vigilante that swings from skyscrapers to fight crime. Tim Burton really, really needs to stick to his claymation type movies of weirdness because he has NO talent for an action movie &amp; in-depth character like Batman. I pity Michael Keaton for getting stuck with a director like Burton for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton and Keaton create the definitive Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before 1978, the thought of legitimately good movies based on comic book superheroes was a ridiculous idea. That was until Richard Donner's Superman came along that year and proved that it could be done well, with the fantastic sequel pushing the boundaries of how great they could be even further. However the Superman series soon declined with its silly and utterly abysmal sequels, and the failed Supergirl spin-off.Luckily, it was then decided to tackle another big DC Comics star in film: Batman. Luckily, instead of continuing with the camp tone Batman was now famous for thanks to the 60's TV show, and that the Superman films used for the most part, director Tim Burton made the wise choice to take the character back to his dark and gritty roots and getting back to the issues that made him such a great character in the first place. Not only does this tone work, and helped to establish that comic book movies could be gritty and serious, but Tim Burton is just the PERFECT director for Batman, not only creating a perfectly crafted and eerily Gothic Gotham City that just draws you into its atmospheric world, but it's clear he gets the character of Batman and what makes him tick, only needing to use the flashback of his parents murder once to make his character and motivations all come full circle. And Keaton, against all odds at the time, plays the role to perfection, nailing Batman's stoic demeanor from the comics and Bruce's withdrawn personality. His performance remains the definitive portrayal of the character as far as I'm concerned.And what can I say about Jack Nicholson as the Joker other than "perfect casting". Nicholson nails the role of the Joker, with great comedic timing, a threatening presence and a convincing, sinister, deliciously insane laugh. The use of his backstory from "The Killing Joke" was a nice touch as well, although it does rob the character of mystery like Ledger's Joker had in The Dark Knight. Just a minor complaint though.As for the controversial decision to have Joker be the one who killed Batman's parents, I wasn't particularly OK with it. While it's much more preferable than when Spider-Man 3 did the same thing with Sandman killing Uncle Ben, as that went against the entire point of earlier films in the series while this sticks to its own themes, and the idea of Batman and Joker "creating" each other is a nice touch, this idea does annoyingly take away from an important part of Batman's character in the comics. But not a major complaint on the whole.Another criticism would be that Vicki Vale is a really boring and stereotypical love interest who doesn't do much of note and screams way too much. But Kim Basinger is hot as hell as usual (and gives a good performance) so there's a bonus. Finally, I have to mention Danny Elfman's superb score, with his Batman theme still remaining the definitive Batman theme to this day, perfectly fitting the tone of the character and is just as iconic as John Williams' Superman score.Despite some flaws, it is a great blockbuster that took the comic book movie genre into new waters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good BATMAN movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is gonna be short.I love BATMAN and this is the reason why I love the film. Jack Nicholson plays Joker and he is really amazing. Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne and Batman and he could not have been any better. Tim Burton's direction is just simply dark and gritty. Christopher Nolan would do this for his BATMAN trilogy, released from 2005 to 2012.The rest of the acting is really amazing including Billy Dee Williams and Kim Basinger. The screenplay and story stays true to the comics as well as the movie. The theme by Danny Elfman is one of the most memorable themes along with his theme for "THE SIMPSONS" is really cool and fantastic.The story of the film follows the comic nicely and I think it is really cool. The film is the best BATMAN ever, along with Christopher Nolan's DARK KNIGHT trilogy and it is really amazing and fantastic. The Batmobile and the Batsuit is really amazing and fantastic. The production designs are great as well and I give credit to Anton Furst, who also designed the poster.The editing is very amazing and the film is really well shot and very fantastic and credit goes to Roger Pratt and this film's run time goes by quickly and I have no problem watching both Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger's Jokers because there is no comparison between the two. Just like Joker, Christian Bale, Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer are the only three best Batman's on the screen ,at least until next year, when Ben Affleck plays the part in BATMAN vs. SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE.Overall, this is why I love BATMAN and it is definitely giving a 10 out of 10 because there are no major flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real class act, Tim Burton being a strange choice for the director of a superhero film, he cleverly intertwines pitch black darkness with hope for a better world. With an iconic performance from Jack Nicholson as the primary villain of the film, Michael Keaton's hard-faced Batman is a good balance to the eerily cheerful and likable villain. Prince's polished contribution to the soundtrack gives an edgy sex-appeal that works wilfully with the zany orchestra of Elfman. Whilst later on the series did take an extremely sharp turn in its tone - with the addition of Christopher Nolan to the directors willing to take on Batman - Tim Burton's attempts cleverly balance out the dark nature of the character and the camp and classic performance of Adam West in the 60's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that kickstarted an awesome blockbuster franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought back in 1989, Batman would be the movie to kickstart an awesome blockbuster franchise? Batman's popularity skyrocketed since the release of Batman in 1989. A lot of things have occurred which owe the movie Batman a lot of credit. Bat-mania was a pop culture phenomenon which spread like wildfire and to this day has not dwindled. Batman merchandise is still very popular amongst many Batman fans as well as many movie fans.Batman starts off with showing us that Gotham City is indeed a dangerous place to live in with crime and corruption plaguing the great city. The Mayor has ordered District Attorney Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) and Police Commissioner James Gordon (Pat Hingle) to increase police activity and to combat crime in preparation for the 200th Anniversary Gala celebrating the birth of Gotham City. Amongst Gotham City's undesirables include mob boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) and his second in command Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson). Jack Napier and several henchmen are sent to raid the Axis Chemicals plant which turns out to be a set up by Grissom in revenge for Jack Napier having an affair with his mistress Alicia (Jerry Hall). During the shootout between the police and the criminals, Batman (Michael Keaton) appears to thwart the getaway of Jack Napier and the henchmen and in the ensuring battle, Jack Napier is knocked into a vat of chemicals and presumably killed. Batman escapes into the night after the police attempt to stop him, dismissing him as a costumed vigilante.Reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) are assigned to uncover Batman's identity as well as the reasons behind Batman's actions.Batman is actually revealed to be billionaire and philanthropist Bruce Wayne, who is troubled by a tragic past in which he witnesses the death of his parents as a child by a mugger. Bruce Wayne lives a secluded lifestyle in a mansion away from the city with his trusted butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough).Jack Napier has managed to survive the accident at the Axis Chemicals plant and through the help of a doctor has managed to salvage what was left of him. Jack Napier has left his identity behind and with his new look of bleached white skin, green hair and a permanent grin he reveals himself to be known as The Joker. The Joker brings it upon himself to wage a new campaign of terror amongst Gotham City as well as Batman with his promise "Wait till they get a load of me".Batman must also take on The Joker, as well as continue to keep his identity a secret from Gotham City, as well as his new found love interest Vicki Vale.Tim Burton, previously known for his work with Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985) and Beetlejuice (1988) cemented his reputation as a uniquely visually dazzling director. Tim Burton introduced a dark and sinister universe to Batman, in contrast to the camp and comical take on Batman which audiences knew and loved with the 1960's show Batman. Also full credit to Tim Burton for omitting Batman's sidekick Robin and just focusing on Batman/Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton attracted a lot of controversy when he was selected to play Batman/Bruce Wayne, as he was widely known as a comedic actor with movies such as Mr Mom (1983) and Beetlejuice (1988), and as a result caused an uproar amongst many Batman fans with 50,000 protest letters sent to the offices of Warner Bros. studios stating their displeasure. Many fans were fearful that this was going to be another camp Batman movie. It goes without saying that those that criticized Michael Keaton as Batman have not been heard from since. Michael Keaton also added another string to his bow by establishing himself as a dramatic actor with a darkly comic personality. Jack Nicholson fits into his role perfectly as The Joker with this being one of his many memorable roles in a stellar career which includes but is not limited to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), The Shining (1980), A Few Good Men (1992), As Good as it Gets (1997), and The Departed (2006). Kim Basinger was very memorable as Vicki Vale, the beautiful and talented photojournalist. I always liked Kim Basinger as an actress and here she is stunning. I must admit I had a secret boyhood crush on her as a young kid following Batman.It's hard to believe that Batman celebrated its 25 year anniversary last year in 2014 and today, Batman is still a strong influence on pop culture. Although it is dated now there's no denying that Batman was the word on the street upon it's release. Batman was a runaway box office success in 1989 which grossed over $400 million worldwide and made a lot more through home video.It's no use comparing and contrasting Batman (1989) to The Dark Knight (2008) or any of the other sequels for that matter. Though they are both equally excellent movies, they are still two separate unique movies. Michael Keaton and Christian Bale has their own unique take as Batman. Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger also have their own unique take as The Joker although not taking anything away from Heath Ledger his role was the more memorable given his untimely passing in 2008.If Batman was not a success, any hopes for a franchise would have been lost in the night. This franchise owes a great deal of gratitude to the 1989 blockbuster Batman. Although The Dark Knight trilogy was excellent in its own right, Batman is still one the greatest movies I still get a thrill out of watching. Batman is still a pleasure to watch years later and Michael Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne lives on as one of my childhood heroes.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Classic Rendition of a Great Comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation of the long-running comic book series accomplished two things: it rescued Batman from the realm of camp it had been associated with since the 60's television series and it opened the door for future comic book adaptations. The film does it's best to remain faithful to the source material and retains it's semi-serious tone, as opposed to the Schumacher films in 1995 and 1997. In the film, Gotham City is in the grips of a crime wave with a mysterious "Batman" stalking the rooftops at night; Batman finds his first real challenge in the form of the Joker, a psychotic former mob enforcer whose close encounter with a vat of chemicals has left him scarred and insane.I've always loved the visual style of this film. The production design on Gotham City is fantastic and it's sad to think Schumacher would eventually come along and give it flair. In Burton's Gotham, the city is reminiscent of New York or Chicago but with stronger industrial and Gothic influences. It blends modern culture with a taste of the 1930s/1940s styles. The original 1989 Batsuit design remains one of my favorites but upon recent viewings I'm noticing more and more how stiff it's movement was, before they managed to give it more flexibility; it makes for some amusing moments in fight scenes when you can tell the character is having trouble moving fluidly.This film also boasted some of the better performances from the main characters in the BATMAN series. While Christian Bale remains my favorite Batman/Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton is a close second. Keaton's easily got the charisma for Bruce Wayne and he does a great job creating the tough persona when in the suit. Jack Nicholson, who received top billing in the film, has a memorable performance as the Joker. I can see influences from Cesar Romero's portrayal in Nicholson, blending with his own natural style. It's a great combination though the Joker's dialogue is weak at times. The screenwriters, in their attempt to make the Joker as insane as possible, drift a bit too far into incoherence sometimes and the random babble doesn't cut it for me; still, the character was also given some of the more memorable quotes in the film ("Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?"). Also, the Joker's makeup and costume design is this movie are freakin' awesome; it's one aspect I thought the 1989 film had over the 2008 film because Nicholson just looked wicked. Kim Basinger does a fair job as photographer Vicki Vale, but falls into the "damsel in distress" role; Robert Wuhl as newspaper reporter Alexander Knox was too corny and some of his "one-liners" had me cringing.By now, most people have seen Burton's BATMAN but a newer generation will be raised on the Christopher Nolan reboot. I love Nolan's films but I hope the newer generations don't forget where it all began in 1989. Both of Tim Burton's BATMAN films were amazing action movies and I'd hate for them to be forgotten as new Bat-fans are wow'd by BATMAN BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT. For the record, as much as I love the Tumbler, I still think the 1989 Batmobile was one of my favorite car designs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually stunning action-packed comic book adaptation, Jack Nicholson definitely helps!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman, one of the very famous comic book superheroes of the 20th century, was created decades before I was born, but I've been familiar with the character ever since I can remember. It seems one of my earliest memories was hearing an older boy say he was Batman, which I think happened when I was just under three years old, the year this movie came out. Since it's a PG-13 rated movie, it would obviously be a long time before I would be old enough to see it, but I was more than old enough by the time I first watched it in late 2005. That was when I first saw all the modern Batman movies that had been made so far by that time. Right now, I've seen this first installment in the franchise a total of four times, and it hasn't worn thin with several viewings!Gotham City is a corrupt, dangerous community with a high crime rate, but a mysterious man in a bat suit, known as "Batman," is known to appear and fight criminals! The city's residents don't know who this man is, but he is Bruce Wayne, a rich man whose parents were murdered in his presence when he was a child! He lives in a mansion called Wayne Manor, and the only one he can consider family now is his butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Jack Napier works for Gotham City crime boss Carl Grissom, and is sent to raid a chemical factory one night. This is a set-up by the boss, and after the police arrive, a shoot-out begins! Batman gets involved in the fight, and eventually drops Jack into a vat of chemicals! The criminal survives, but is disfigured from the chemicals, and becomes the Joker, a clown-like lunatic who kills Grissom and then threatens the city with deadly hygiene products! Batman must try and stop The Joker's evil ways, but the people in the city don't necessarily realize that Batman is on the good side! A lot of things help this comic book movie work, and one of them is some of the performances. Michael Keaton is good in the starring role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, and so are Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Michael Gough as Alfred, etc., but the most notable performance is that of Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier/the Joker, especially after the character becomes the Joker! This main villain here, one of Batman's famous enemies from the comic books, provides a lot of the humour in this film, and I think Nicholson's talent has a lot to do with this. This successful 1989 blockbuster also features lots of action and suspense, as one would expect, and this really helps keep it entertaining for so much of its approximately two-hour run! I can't forget to mention the visuals, which are dark and absolutely stunning! Since the movie was directed by Tim Burton, this is not surprising. On the downside, there's occasionally some fairly weak dialogue in this film, especially between Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale, and the Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) character's quips are generally not funny like they're apparently supposed to be, but fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives by a LONG shot! It has now been more than twenty years since this movie's hugely successful box office run, and it's clearly still popular today, even after the massive success of Christopher Nolan's two Batman films, "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight", and I would say it deserves to be. After Tim Burton directed the first two installments (this and "Batman Returns"), Joel Schumacher took over for "Batman Forever" and "Batman &amp; Robin" and sadly polluted the franchise. The series wasn't redeemed until Nolan rebooted it in 2005. However, this 1989 film can still be remembered as a great start for the franchise. As a PG-13 rated film, it's obviously not appropriate for little kids, even though Batman has usually been known to be kid-friendly. This comic book adaptation is very dark and intense, and there's also some swearing and mild crudeness, but if you're old enough to watch it and you generally like superhero movies, I highly recommend this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark yet comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right better start by admitting I am a massive fan of both Batman and Tim Burton. With that out of the way it will come as no surprise that I really like this movie. I also think that this movie has stood the test of time well. So much of this movie suits Burton especially it's Gothic setting making for a marvellously dark and moody setting with just a touch of comic book. It was brave of Burton to do away with the typical comic book back story and tale of origin that normally hangs like a mile stone around he neck of most super hero franchise initial instalments. Instead we get a much better slow release of Bruce Wayne's back story. Michael Keaton is great as Wayne / Batman though inevitably he completely upstaged by Jack Nicholson's tour de force performance as the Joker. Yes this performance had now been superseded by the awesome performance of the late Heath Ledger. This Joker really is a different beast. Nicholson dominates every scene he is in almost getting the hero treatment from Burton. As shown in the scene where Batman battles the Joker from his air craft. Missing with numerous shots whilst I just takes the Joker one shot to take Batman's air craft down. My only gripes with the movie ar Burton's weakness at shooting action sequences (they feel to much like choreographed clown sequences). Also Kim Bassinger dos not really work for me as Vicky Vale. But then weight that against the rest of the great movie which especially works in the symmetry of Jack / the Joker creating the Batman and the Batman in turn creating the Joker. This added to the legend Prince submitting th soundtrack makes this a classic to be enjoyed time and time again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is dark, edgy, and somewhat funny at the same time. But it's still a fun little film to watch, and one of Burton's finest classics. Michael Keaton as Batman is perfect. I don't see why people had to protest against having him in the role, but he was pretty darn cool as the caped crusader.Jack Nicholson as the Joker is amazing. He's funny, creepy, and as you might have guessed, one banana short of the bunch. I think Burton did a fantastic job with the character development for the Joker, it's really true to Kane's comics. Some other high points were the special effects, the action, which was perfect for a Tim Burton film, and the dialogue. Keaton is the only one who can play a dark, griddy Batman in a nice, casual voice.Overall, a true classic, and one of the best supper hero movies of all time. It is surely beyond the campy, cheesiness of Adam West's Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie after 20 years of its release, I thought that it would be a bit jaded, faded and dull compared to recent superhero movies. But I was surprised thoroughly to find out that this movie was good, really good. Though Spiderman 2 is still on the top of my superhero movies list(I haven't seen TDK yet) I did not find this to be a strong contender. In fact, if it would've solved out some of the problems that I had with it, it would surely have been on the top.Batman has a great performance by Jack Nicholson, a decent one by the main actor and the actress. Jack rules most of the scenes as the terrifying Joker who laughs at other's deaths without any remorse. He plays his role easily and melts into his character.I haven't read any of the comics but I thought that a little too much attention was given to the Joker rather than Batman himself. Most of the scenes were dominated by him. That was slightly a problem as I didn't really seem happy with Batman's role.The actress too is really good and looks nice, though I did feel that the other reporter could've good a longer role. Chemistry between the two is visible in bits but I wasn't fully convinced. Michael Keaton is good as batman but it is difficult for me to comment on whether he has played his character convincingly because of me not reading Batman comics.The story was okay according to me, as it was a typical superhero type. I just felt that portraying the Batman as an evil character in the town according to the cops was too unoriginal. There could've been a bit more elaboration in the story.It was a thoroughly entertaining movie. I'm going for an 8 for this movie.</fullReview>

I thought this was the best thing since sliced bread when I saw it in the cinema. In fact, were it not for Edward Scissorhands this could be Burton's masterpiece. Seriously. It achieves everything that could be expected of it. It's got not only the dystopia but also the circus-fantasy of the comic strip; to that is appended the gaudyness of the TV series - it's not camp though. Burton's not afraid to use the considerable funds he's got on tap with a wonderful series of sets and in-screen effects and vehicles.Best of all the picture bursts with charisma. Jack Nicholson is at the height of what might be described as his second period (i.e. post-Cuckoo's Nest, pre-As Good As It Gets). Michael Keaton manages his own brand of unhinged well - his Batman is a much darker, more thorough character than Christian Bale's. Kim Basinger is the perfect Vicky Vale - I'm a fan of Sean Young (originally cast) but the sharp, comic-cook blonde is what this picture needed. Michael Gough is a definitive Alfred.All this gilded with an underrated (and actually, unjustly maligned) album of original music by Prince. A great matinée. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Batman so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this when it first came out and being totally blown away by Nicholson's performance as the Joker. Having seen him in the Shining (over-the-top performance, but scary) and The Witches of Eastwick (even more over the top, but funny), I wondered whether he could take this style of acting any further, and indeed he could. His performance as the Joker is easily the most hilarious madman I have ever seen on film. In fact, I have rarely laughed so much seeing a movie as the first time I watched this one. Maybe Heath Ledger is scarier in the latest Batman movie (which I have not yet seen), but I am convinced he is not as entertaining. I am not a big Burton fan, but I think the direction this time is good, Gotham is a well constructed nightmare city and the story is well told. I am not too keen on Michael Keaton ordinarily, but I think his role as Batman is one of his better efforts. All in all this movie is far superior to the disappointing Batman Returns, and also significantly better than the much hyped Batman Begins which is an OK movie but nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "The Dark Knight"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's 1989 entry in the Batman series was one of the biggest hits of the eighties. In a marked departure from the campy TV series, Burton dialled up the darkness with a Gothic-tinged interpretation that still managed to remain true to the spirit of the comics. This adherence to the source material is the main reason why I prefer this film to "The Dark Knight".First of all, while dark, this film is not deadly serious. It's a mix of darkness leavened with frequent dabs of humour. This is the best approach to accentuate the Joker's peculiar qualities while contrasting him with the mysterious Batman. Jack Nicholson turns in a fine performance as the Joker, off-kilter as only he can be, while never descending into camp. Too bad the rest of the cast is no better than the usual standard for superhero films. (Michael Keaton, for all the controversy surrounding his casting at the time, makes a perfectly serviceable Bruce Wayne/Batman.)Tim Burton's directorial style, coupled with the impressive, foreboding sets creates a very interesting Gotham City. The flamboyance of the Joker is contrasted with the cool elegance of Bruce Wayne and the menacing aura of his alter-ego, Batman. Danny Elfman's moody, operatic score is also an essential ingredient in the mix. Speaking of music, there are a handful of tunes by Prince featured as well. They haven't aged too badly and are actually more fitting than you might expect.The series went completely off the rails when Burton moved on so don't let the later Val Kilmer/George Clooney follow-ups keep you away. In my opinion, this is a strong contender (along with "Batman Begins") for the best Batman film to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton was great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is the first and best film of the series. I saw this on TV and on video. The choice of acting was great. I especially liked Micheal Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as the Joker. I also liked Kim Basinger as the lady who tries to find out more about Tim Burton. This movie has a dark, eerie feeling to this film because of Tim Burton's directing and the great visual effects team. Of course, Danny Elfman's score was great. Even the plot and the script was above normal. Basically, Batman has to stop the Riddler from taking over Gotham City or there will be peril. Die-hard fans of Batman will really like this film. I give this action-packed film a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's vision of the Batman Saga is wonderful, the cast members generally perform. Jack Nicholson does about as well as anyone could with the bizarre Joker character, but...he can't dance!! Every time he tries, he looks terrible. Tim Burton obviously envisioned the Joker as a 'whirling dervish' but Jack just can't pull it off. Whether he's shooting Grissom, handing out money to the crowd, or dancing in the belfry with Vicky, he just can't dance.What do you expect? He's a white guy. Like me.Rick Jolley</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman reviews, part I: An excellent start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Batman is a story full of ups and downs, surprises and disappointments, redeems and crashes. Of all superheroes, Batman is probably the one who had the most interesting and hectic career so far. Since his debut in the American comic books in 1939, the Dark Knight never stopped from catching the imagination of youngsters and not-so-young-sters, should it be with comic books, TV series, toys, collecting items and so on...But it's probably the 1989 film by Tim Burton that remains the height of Batman's career. It's by far the most profitable work in the history of the Dark Knight and also maybe the most representative, because it's its visions of the superhero and of Gotham City that still predominate in popular culture, even after the release of the Christopher Nolan movie "Batman Begins" in 2005.In this super-production from director Tim Burton, it's Michael Keaton who pulls on Batman's cape and the suit of Bruce Wayne. In Gotham City, everybody knows Wayne, since he is a very wealthy man with a philanthropic side and living in a sumptuous mansion with his butler Alfred (Michael Gough).However, for the majority of the city's inhabitants, Batman is only a rumor and those who claim to have seen him appear as credible as people who pretend to have seen Bigfoot, extra-terrestrials or the Loch Ness monster.In this first movie, Batman's adversary is none other than the Joker (Jack Nicholson). An interesting fact: it's for the moment the only Batman film to have only one villain. But we have to admit that it would have been a shame to team up the Joker with another criminal who wouldn't be able to handle a candle for him.At the beginning of the movie, the Joker is Jack Napier, the right-hand man to gangster boss Carl Grissom, played by Jack Palance. Grissom is responsible of the corruption of many policemen throughout the city. One night, Grissom sets up a plan to kill Jack via the corrupted police, best exampled by Lt. Eckhart (William Hootkins). However, with Batman's intervention, a chain of events will lead to the birth of the Clown Prince of Crime himself.If the movie has been such a great success, it's because it works on numerous levels. And it all begins with the actors.If it's Jack Nicholson who is the top billed actor on the posters and in the opening title sequence, it's not for nothing. He's by far the best actor of the movie. While he's just correct as a simple gangster, his Joker transformation allows him to truly reveal his extraordinary abilities. Wearing his ceaseless grin, his purple and teal costume, his clownish make-up and his green hair, Nicholson adds even more with his manic character and his extremely macabre humor, trademark from director Burton.Michael Keaton, who was under-estimated because of his comedic roles, is very surprising. His Bruce Wayne character is pleasantly mysterious and tortured, often making forget that he is a millionaire and owner of a large company (which is not even mentioned at all in the whole movie).Robert Wuhl, another comedian turned dramatic actor, is also efficient in his role of a serious and shrewd journalist who tries to break the Batman mystery.Kim Basinger plays Vicki Vale, a photojournalist who works with Wuhl, but she falls in love with Bruce Wayne. Her performance is correct, but Keaton and her visibly develop no chemistry.If there's another character that should be added to that list, it's Gotham City itself. Designed with a master hand by Anton Furst and Peter Young, Gotham's architecture blends post-modernism and German expressionism to perfection, creating a unique mix of "Blade Runner" and "Metropolis". And the sinister look of the skyscrapers and the buildings reflects pretty well what's happening in the streets of the city. At the beginning of the movie, we see tramps searching garbage cans, prostitutes wandering in the streets and bandits attacking everymen, making alleys hazardous places.The Batmobile and the Batwing are also mentionable.The soundtrack and the songs are simply remarkable. Danny Elfman's music is terribly contagious and Prince's songs are not only good, they're placed at the right place at the right moment. We only have to think of the museum sequence in which the Joker and his thugs commit an obnoxious crime : vandalizing and destroying artworks.There's also that iconic scene where the Joker throws $20 million to the people in Gotham's main street and kills them thereafter. The image of a man falling to his death with bills in his hands is especially striking.The Joker is probably the greatest villain we have ever seen in a comic-book adaptation. And because of the magnitude of Nicholson's performance, it is doubtful that somebody could beat him someday."Batman" is full of classic moments and it would be almost impossible to list them all. It's difficult to say whether it's the greatest superhero film ever or not, but it's undoubtedly the one which launched the superhero movie trend, which still goes on stronger than ever today."Batman" is strewn with little imperfections here and there, but we hardly notice them and they have little impact on the movie's quality. Despite these insignificant mistakes, the legacy of "Batman" is almost impossible to estimate. And even if Christopher Nolan gave a different direction to the franchise with, should it be said, an excellent movie ("Batman Begins"), he has failed to replace the imagery from Burton's vision in popular culture. And that's what gives to Burton's movie even more prestige.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-Introducing The Caped Crusader or King of Crimefighters Trumps Joker's Aces!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In bringing Batman to the big screen in the late '80's, there were both some advantages and also a few problems.First of all, because of the "Camp" 1966 20th Century-Fox/ABC TV Series, the a greater segment of the public was familiar with the character than previously. This was a plus and gave Writer/Director, Tim Burton, a running head start on the project.The tongue in cheek,"Camp"Humor approach could also be problematical and was not going to be used in these big budget blockbusters.And, yet, Adam West's Scout's Honor,super Straight Shooter approach to the Batman personality was strong in people's minds. But alas, what to do? In a coup-de-tat of casting brilliance, Michael Keaton was cast as the dual identities Bruce Wayne/Batman. Mr. Keaton had a reputation as being a brilliant comedic actor and had risen to the status of "Movie Star". He also had presented us with some fine,dramatic performances. (If you don't think so, just try screening CLEAN AND SOBER some evening.) Now what can we say bout Jack Nicholson's Joker? Well, at last we have a Marriage truly made in Heaven-Jack Nicholson as the Joker! It can't be topped!* Kim Basinger(Vicki Vale),Pat Hingle(Commissioner Gordon),Billy Williams(D.A.Harvey Dent), Jack Palance(Carl Grissom) and Michael Gough(Alfred,the Butler) all round out the upper tier of the fine cast.Robert Wuhl who portrays a Newspaper Reporter named Alexander Knox, introduces us to another Tim Burton trademark. Namely,that is using old movie actors' names and archaic terms for places. 'Alexander Kox' is the name of a fine film actor of the '30's, 40's and '50's.*** The script takes two early Batman stories and combines them with some original themes to produce an intelligent,gripping and action filled screen story. The 1st story was from Batman Comics #1, Spring 1940 issue. It was simply titled,"The Joker", and presents him as a Contract Killer or Crime Syndicate Hit Man, if you will. He used poisonous gas which caused the deceased to die with a Sardonic Grin on their countenance. This story,though Joker's 1st Appearance,did not give his beginning as The Joker, no Origin. The Origin of the Joker was published some years later and was adapted into the occurrences we witnessed in the movie at Axis Chemicals.Mr. Burton did do The Joker and all of us a favor by Christening him, Jack Napier. For alas, he never was given any name in the comics.Okay, now for some complaints. First of all, Most any Batman reader can tell you the name of the Murderer of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Thomas Wayne, Batman's parents. It was a low life, scum bag street mugger named Joe Chill. Burton puts the killings on the young Jack Napier. Can we reconcile this revisionist heresy? Well, how about the fact that the flash back scene of the robbery/murders showed 2 bad guys. Could Chill and Napier have been partners? Works for me.The worst sin of all was in killing off The Joker. Bad move there, Tim and how did DC and Warner Brothers permit this?(not to mention the method used.) * It has been said that once the scenes of Jack Nicholson,with broad sardonic grin on face, chopping his way through doors in THE SHINING, the role was his . It took a while, but he finally acquiesced.** The use of names relating back to Film History and U.S. History for that matter, seem to be a favourite ploy of Tim Burton.In addition to this "Alexander Knox", in the Sequel, BATMAN RETURNS(1992), the name of the Super Rich Utilities Tycoon(Christopher Walken) is given as "Max Schreck", which was the German silent film actor portraying the Vampire in The NOSFERATU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the first four Batman Films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie I saw in the theaters, and it remains, what I think, the best movie of the first round of Batman films by Warner Brothers. Though the storyline is different than the original comic strip, the plot is still greatly hashed out, giving us a dark and intriguing movie.Here, Michael Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and is out to rid Gotham City of the terror caused by Jack Napier/The Joker (Jack Nicholson). Keaton delivered a serious and powerful performance, while Nicholson delivered a wild performance with a dry and outrageous sense of humor. The fight scenes were choreographed extremely well, especially between Batman and the Joker's henchmen. In addition to Keaton and Nicholson, each of the other actors gave solid and memorable performances, not campy and cheesy like the series. Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Robert Wuhl as Alexander Knox and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon were all awesome. This movie follows the same dark and suspense-filled mood as the comics, a complete departure from Adam West's light-hearted and whimsical Batman TV series.In addition, unlike the later Batman films, every element was well-balanced out in this movie-not overkill, no over-the-line special effects and no plot holes. Danny Elfman's music score was spectacular and the Tim Burton's direction was superb. Every single one of Batman's gadgets, from the Batmobile to the Batwing, and from the Batarang to the Batcave, were all executed extremely well. Batman's costume, in its glory black leather, was the best I've seen.Overall all, a film which blends in good character comprehension, humor, action, drama and suspense. Holding out as a true original film, none of its sequels meet up to this film's elements.Grade A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman has about everything you need in a good solid action film. It has great performances by Michael Keaton playing Bruce Wayne/Batman and one of the greatest villains of all time, The Joker, played by Jack Nicholson. The strongest part of the film is the music. The opening scene with the credits has very powerful music in it. The only bad part of Batman is that it doesn't have that good old Batman taste. It's too dark for young children and has some bad words, mainly said by the Joker. But, The Joker is the best character in the film, even though it is titled Batman. I also like the fact they show how Jack Nicholson became The Joker. It's not that bad of a transformation, well it kind of is. If you like Batman and New York City, Batman is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great dark superhero movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This decade there are more superhero movies being made than in any other previous decade. Back in 1989 superhero movies were still a new genre and along with "Superman" from 1978, this movie set the standard- and opened the doors for many other superhero movies and movies based on comic-books.Of all the superhero characters I probably like the Batman the best. This is because of all superhero's he is perhaps the most humane one, with real emotions and dark edgy tendencies. He also isn't a character that has any superhero powers or is invincible. I really like that about Batman. This movie perfectly translates this superhero character to the silver screen, completely with all his humane characteristics.The movie is casted well. Pat Hingle, William Hootkins (who unfortunately just died, over a week ago), Michael Gough and Robert Wuhl are really some comic-book looking characters. Michael Keaton is a good but not great Batman/Bruce Wayne. I'm not always too fond of his style of acting. He is good as Batman but not always really as Bruce Wayne. But best casted actor is Jack Nicholson as Joker/Jack Napier. When I think of the Joker I think of Jack Nicholson and when I think of Jack Nicholson I think of the Joker. He simply IS the Joker. No way any other actor could had ever done, or ever will do a better job. He plays the character with so much fun and comedy that he truly becomes one of the most memorable and enjoyable movie villains in history.The movie has a perfect dark atmosphere and a typical Tim Burton like environment. He simply was the perfect director for this movie. His odd sense of humor also works perfectly for the movie and there are some truly subtle hilarious moments in the movie and some typical fun like, crazy Tim Burton characters. The fantastic music is composed by Danny Elfman. It really is a great superhero piece of music that suits the movie extremely well. The main theme is highly memorable and has become one of the best known main movie themes in history. I think it's fair to say that this is Elfman's best work till date.Is "Batman" a perfect flawless movie? I wish I could say yes, because I absolutely love watching this movie and have many fond memories of it. Unfortunately the movie simply isn't perfect. The story doesn't always flow very well and it gets obvious that the movie it's script went to many rewrites and was even rewritten during filming. Not everything in the movie always really connects to another, especially the ending feels out of place.Still "Batman" is a great dark superhero movie that is always very entertaining to watch as well.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film. Well chosen actors and well directed. Certainly a big change from the old 60's camp Batman.Michael Keaton played the parts of Bruce/Batman well, and certainly had the right voice for when he was in the costume. Jack Nicholson also does a fine performance in this movie, and manages not to go over the top with his character. He knows when his character needs to be a bit more serious and then when he needs to be crazy. A well balanced performance by him indeed. Also his henchmen are not silly like in the later Joel movies, so that adds more menace to Batman's foes.All in all a great movie with just enough darkness to it and great performance all round, which gets it a vote of 8 from me. Also who can forget that great Batmobile which will always be my favourite design, and the great theme tune. Batman 1989!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie, we're introduced to the origins of both Batman and the Joker. Which works because this is the first movie of its kind and draws the audience into the Bat world.Tim Burton was a relative unknown, given his success at that time was Pee Wee and Beetlejuice, which also starred Michael Keaton. However, he stuck to a vision that everyone expected - that of Frank Miller's Year One and The Dark Knight Returns. Fans were skeptical if Michael Keaton can deliver as the dark knight, but his performance brought on a decent Bruce Wayne, and a menacing Batman. Michael Keaton developed 2 voices for Batman/Bruce Wayne, with the former being lower in tone. He set the benchmark in which the other Batmans/Bruce Waynes will be compared. Nice touches in the script also demonstrates the Bat's penchant for appearing and disappearing, which adds to his mystery as an urban legend, and his crashing through the skylight of the museum with cape spread? Priceless. The "putting on the batsuit" scene also set a precedence, and the rest of the films will have something similar.And who could forget Jack Nicholson's Joker, who really stole the show as he danced along to Prince's soundtrack for the movie. I remembered the first time I saw the Joker's face (heavily guarded secret at that time), and saw the permanent maniacal smile that sent the chills. Nicholson, though a bit pudgy for the role (check the comics - the definitive look by Adams, Aparo, Borland, is always slim), owned the trademarked laughter.The movie introduced a myriad of support characters, some of whom are staples in the comics - Alfred the Butler (played by Michael Gough, one of the constant in this franchise), Commissioner Gordon (played by Pat Hingle, also another constant), Harvey Dent (yes, he's in the movie as District Attorney, played by Billy Dee Williams) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger!), and some of whom are created for this movie, like mob boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and Jerry Hall as Alicia.But one "character" stood out amongst all. The Batmobile. Always a feature in the comic books, and always the one which attracts all the attention. To many fans and movie goers, this is the definitive Batmobile for the movies - menacing looking, yet slick and beautiful, with a big bad afterburner to deliver that extra turbo boost. The audience gasped in awe the first time it was on screen, parked outside the museum when Vicki Vale was saved. I always drool at the poster - the one with Batman, arms folded, standing beside the Batmobile.While the film's narrative was dark, twisted yet fun, and Gotham being brought to life by sets designed by the late Anton Furst, fanboys did have some qualms about the movie, which I will discuss here.Firstly, Batman doesn't kill. Sure, he'll kick the ass out of you, but he draws the line at taking a life. This is something which will resonate throughout the movie franchise, which I detest. Yes I know, it's Hollywood, and body count makes an action movie.Although the budget was huge, some effects were still cheesy, like the Joker's helicopter, which was really a toy model (no attempts to make it no so obvious), and the entire crashing of the Bat-wing into the streets of Gotham looks like it took a poor man's lesson from Godzilla's model making.While touching on the origins, it pays not to screw it up big time. Sure you can update it for the movies, but some things are sacred and should stay as such. Sure, we're shown the Waynes being gunned down in Crime Alley (and that scene in which Bruce pays regular homage is noteworthy), but it's always to an unknown Joe Chill. Here, the Joker (as Jack Napier) was the killer, just to facilitate the plot. I would like to state that the Joker did not kill the Waynes. Never did, and this aspect never will change.Also, with origins, Jim Gordon wasn't Commissioner when the Batman first appeared (ok, slightly contentious here, since Bob Kane did introduce Gordon as Commissioner, and only in recent times had this been changed. But I'm sticking to the latter). My main gripe here is the relationship - there is zero chemistry between Gordon and Batman, which I hoped would improve in the latter movies, but was utterly disappointed. Their relationship is key in the mythos, and sadly, this is always overlooked. Gordon in the movies is just a support cameo character. Sad, but true.We don't see much of what Bruce Wayne does. Vicki Vale's question "and what do you do for a living" was conveniently interrupted by Alfred the Butler. Sure we know he has his millions, but what does he do besides walking around town? Wayne Tech / Wayne Industries are not shown in Burton's movies, which are key areas in which Batman derives his toys from.It's not as if I disliked the film. I liked it, and so do many others back in 1989. Many fans were satisfied with the outcome, and made it the Blockbuster for that year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just blows my mind that over 600 people out there would categorise this movie as awful? Arguably one of Jack Nicholson's most charismatic and believable performances, and Keaton was brilliant in this and the sequel. The plot, the script, the set, the dark undefinable quality from start to finish? This movie is dead set awesome. Easily one of my favourites.Remarkable parallel with The Godfather series in that you see a very steady decline from the first to last(?) Not to say that Batman Returns was not an excellent movie. Likewise Batman Forever, which in its own way was commendable and ultimately very entertaining. I think we all have seen Batman and Robin. I think the word "garbage" is doing it too many favours. A very slow, steady decline - with an enormous leap downwards at the end. Let's all hope Batman Begins resurrects our faith in the series. And for god's sake, keep Joel S away from anything aside from coffee duty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman gets the 1989 Hollywood Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't labour on about the obvious facts, such as "I'm a huge Batfan" or "This is the first time Batman was put on the screen since the campy '60's show", as you are all probably aware of that. I'll simply cut to the chase, and say that this movie is a good film. Not amazing, not brilliant, but definitely good.The director, Tim Burton, creates a highly stylised Gothic version of Gotham City, in which crime and deception reign over good and decent moral values. Enter the Batman, alias Bruce Wayne (Micheal Keaton), who will do everything in his power to bring right and justice to the dark and dirty streets of the terrorised metropolis. Encountering the psychopathic criminal-turned-lunatic Joker (Jack Nicholson), and love interest Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), Batman attempts to save his city from the threat of the Joker's "Smilex" gas and defeat the clown prince of crime for good.That synopsis, from a comic fan's point-of-view, sounds fantastic, doesn't it? And back in 1989, I doubt anyone had seen anything quite like it. It was the yang to the "Superman" (1978) yin. Today, however, we are blessed with a more matured sense of super hero film, such as the "Spider-Man" and "X-Men" series'. "Batman", in retrospective comparison, leaves you with a worrying taste of 'violent camp'. People insist vividly that the film is more adult and took the character and his world more seriously than the 1966 television series, but the film boasts Nicholson prancing around a museum, spray painting over the pictures and Keaton hanging upside down, like a bat, as a form of 'humourous meditation'.Having said that, the acting from the two lead characters is fantastic. Keaton is patchy as a rather hesitant Bruce Wayne, but manages to shift easily into the dark and mysterious Batman persona to give a solid performance. Nicholson is faultless, as he usually is in title roles such as these. Basinger is little more than a scream machine, and manages to pander to the damsel-in-distress role successfully... whilst Micheal Gough (Alfred Pennyworth) and Pat Hingle (Commissioner James Gordon) present an interesting secondary cast, which would be camped up to no end in future sequels. Finally, Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox) and William Hootkins (Lt. Max Eckhardt) play two of the most vile and uninteresting characters to appear in cinema, playing sleazy and boring '80's cast types that have little to no relevance to the plot or to the Batman mythos itself (outside possible one off roles). A very varied cast.Accepting the fact that this film revolves around "style over substance" is the key to enjoying it. Burton may not be able to direct Sam Hamm's uninteresting and unquotable script that well (Nicholson uses his incredibly performance to create the most memorable quotes), he does deliver an amazing work of architecture in the form of the amazing set-built Gotham City, and Danny Elfman gives the film a most amazing and awe inspiring score.In conclusion, worth seeing at least once, but unless you're a fan of Tim Burton or Jack Nicholson, it's probably better to rent, rather than buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enter the Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Batman was released in the summer of 1989, the comic book movie was at low ebb. The last major comic book adaptation was 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, which had taken a critical and box-office drubbing. With the unveiling of Batman, however, the comic-book movie was suddenly red-hot, as masses flocked to see the film multiple times and turned it into the highest grossing film of the year.Batman was a project that had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, passing through several filmmaker's hands before ending up under the direction of then relatively unknown director Tim Burton, who had delivered the surprising sleeper comedy hit Beetlejuice in 1988. Under the direction of Burton, the film shied away from the image of the campy late '60's television series that aired on CBS, which became a cult classic. Instead, Burton and screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skarren gave the character a darker, harder edge, most likely influenced by the grittier comic tales of Batman from the mid to late-'80's, most specifically writer and illustrator Frank Miller's revolutionary take on the character in the 1987 graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns, and made Batman the must-see event of the summer.The film opens in a crime-ridden Gotham City. The city's rampant lawlessness has caused people to lose faith in the traditional law enforcement organizations, even as the city has elected a new district attorney, Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) to stamp out the criminal element. However, criminals around the city are speaking in whispers of a new force on the streets: a creature that has been nicknamed The Bat, who boasts the outward appearance of a bat, but in truth in actually millionaire Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) in a form-fitting armored suit that looks like a bat, and who coins himself Batman. Haunted by the death of his parents as a child at the hands of muggers, Wayne has donned this outfit to exact justice from those who are beyond the reach of the police. The appearances of Batman are being followed by investigative reported Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl), joined by photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), who quickly develops an attraction to Wayne, and the two are soon in the midst of an affair.Meanwhile, in advance of the city's 200th birthday gala, Harvey Dent and police commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) have decided to shut down the leader of the city's syndicate, Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) by raiding business that are fronting for his organization. During a late-night attempt to clean out one of the businesses, Grissom's right-hand man, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) is trapped by both police and Batman and accidentally falls into a vat of chemicals that transforms his skin chalk-white and a botched surgery attempt gives him a permanent smile, sending Napier over the mental edge and creating a new persona: the Joker.Batman has two primary strengths, the first being its impressive visual design. Realized by production designer Anton Furst, Batman's look is a remarkable one. Gotham City is a decaying megalopolis, filled with crumbling edifices of better days long since past, covered in dirt, grime and steam. It is a heavily stylized vision of a city in decline, and creates a perfect environment for the crime-ridden world of Batman. In addition to Gotham City, the interior of the batcave, Batman's hideout under his vast home of Wayne Manor, is notable also, full of city support structures dotted among the walls of the cave. The film also boasts a semi-retro look. It appears to be a mixture of modern-day technology and that of the 1940's, an homage to the time when Batman was originally conceived. Today, many of these visual styles are rather blasé, thanks to it's recycling in countless other science fiction and comic book movies (and arguably, Batman had cribbed a great deal of it's look from such films as Blade Runner, but which were not as successful and therefore overlooked as a source for Batman), but when introduced in Batman, they seemed fresh and unique.The film's second strength is the performance of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Nicholson takes hold of the screen with manic intensity. He is outlandish and hilarious as the insane, homicidal 'clown prince of crime,' and most scenes that feature him have an energy that entertains. Nicholson totally immersed himself in the character, prancing about wildly, cracking off puns and chewing the scenery mightily. Most of the film's memorable scenes are those featuring the Joker, and again, the performance of Nicholson gave way to multiple pretenders to the throne in countless films from that point on, but most were not able to match him.Beyond these two aspects, Batman is largely a mixed bag. The film's greatest weakness is its rather bland hero. Batman and Bruce Wayne, for the most part, isn't exactly a memorable character. Sure, Batman's suit looks cool, but there isn't much to him other than that. The romance between Bruce Wayne and Vicky Vale is also pretty weak. There are some interesting aspects to the character of Bruce Wayne, specifically relating to how his decision to become Batman was formed by the loss of his parents, but the film just grazes the surface without plumbing the depths. Weaknesses in characters may be partially attributable to director Burton. Know both before and later for films centering on oddball characters and scenarios, Burton has never seemed comfortable with what would be classified as 'normal,' and as such, focuses all his energy on the odder aspects of the film (the look, the character of the Joker), which are his fascination, and lets the less unusual aspects suffer.That being said, Batman is still enjoyable enough to be among the better comic book adaptations produced, especially at the time it was released. Better films have followed, but Batman is still an entertaining entry in the genre to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader? Hubba Hubba! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a long-awaited feature, Batman. And it long preceeded the popularity of many of those nauseating comic book based movies which seem to crowd the theaters these days (mainstream American filmmakers: will you try nothing new?)! And this one is, in my opinion, one the greatest comic book based movies of all time (although, I haven't seen the Superman movies since I was a little kid and can't remember much of them). Unfortunately, once Tim Burton dropped out of directing the third and fourth and (they just keep making them why?) on and on and Joel Shumacher took over, it was all over. I think the first two Batman movies directed by Burton and starring Michael Keaton (Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) are the only ones worth watching.Burton was perfect to direct this one. Ironically, he couldn't get the okay on this film by the studio until the success of his previous movie, Beetlejuice shined at the box office. His gloomy atmospheres that we saw in Edward Scissorhands (the scenes in and around the mansion) and Beetlejuice were perfect to create a live version of Gotham City (including using his regular composer, Danny Elfman, to create the great orchestral soundtrack), where our hero, the hermit Batman (Michael Keaton) lives. But, Gotham City is in trouble when a bunch of deranged gangsters, headed up by The Joker (the best comic book villain ever, played wonderfully by the typically slick Jack Nicholson), who wants to put Batman out of commission by making him look like a regular villain and The Joker like the city's saviour. The only person who may be able to help Bruce Wayne/Batman is a timid Gotham Globe reporter, Vicki Vale (Kim Bassinger). Batman was the first major commercial blockbuster movie that I remember (I was only seven at the time, so give me a break), with numerous product endorsement commercials (especially for Coca Cola) every time you turned on the television. It was a pretty incredible feature, with great action, a slamming good cast (Keaton is damned good in nearly everything I've seen him in, anways, even the garbage movies he mostly appears in recently years; Nicholson; Basinger; Billy Dee Williams as the D.A.; Jack Palance; and etc).I don't know how well die hard fans of the comic enjoyed this movie (or how they may compare this movie to the Batman sequels that follow), but I certainly enjoyed this movie a lot. If you read the IMDB trivia, you will notice that Tim Curry was considered to play The Joker. I'll bet that would've been interesting and with Tim Burton as director, Curry would have been used just right in this movie (bummers!). The trivia also indicates that Charlie Sheen and Bill Murray were considered for the role of Batman. I don't think that would've worked good at all (Charlie Sheen always appears so deadpan and I can never take Bill Murray seriously, so maybe they wanted Batman: The Comedy? in which case, Bill Murray would've been great). Keaton and Nicholson were perfect in their roles as Batman and Joker and it was probably the most memorable roles of both actors' careers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bat flies again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll bet when Tim Burton was asked to helm the big budget version of Batman in 1989, it must have been a great honour. At the time, he didn't have that many films under his belt, (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice) and he was still finding his footing as a director. But Burton managed to effectively recreate Gotham City from Bob Kane's original ideas rather than the campy 60's series, and put a forbidding, Gothic metropolis on screen.Gotham City is a town wracked with crime. Murderers and muggers are everywhere, and the police are run ragged trying to keep a lid on things. But there is something else in this city that is much more ominous. There are stories of a giant bat that appears out of nowhere, captures criminals, and disappears. This bat creature (who calls himself Batman) has come to the attention of Gotham Globe reporters Alexander Knox (Robert Whul) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger). They both believe there is a story behind the rumours.Hoping the chief of police Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) can provide some answers, they catch up with him at a charity ball hosted by billionaire Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton). Bruce is rather eccentric, and is quite taken with Vicki. But there is more to Bruce than meets the eye. He is the mysterious Batman. This begs the question, why would a billionaire dress up as a giant bat every night?On the criminal side of Gotham City, the crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) wants to get rid of his right hand man Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), who is having an affair with Grissom's mistress Alicia (Jerry Hall). He sends him to a chemical plant, then tips off the police. But Batman learns of the break-in, and tries to stop it, making himself public for the first time. But things go horribly wrong. Batman accidentally drops Jack into a vat of chemicals, and leads to the creation of a new menace, the Joker.With the acid giving him a permanent leering grin, green hair, and a twisted personality, the Joker intends to wreak a terrible vengeance on Gotham City. He invents a new substance called Smilex, which kills its victims, but leaves them with a permanent grin on their face like the Joker's. Batman is the only one who can put a stop to the Joker's reign of terror.Michael Keaton is perfectly cast as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He gives a very convincing performance of a man who has to deal with duality (something Val Kilmer and George Clooney were never able to master). His actions throughout the film raise a lot of interesting questions. Is Batman on the side of good? Is he a vigilante willing to abuse his own power to satisfy his own ends? Is he psychotic? These are all questions that are never completely answered, but the possible answers are hinted at, and the audience is forced to come up with their own conclusions. One thing is certain, he is a lot more like the Joker than he is willing to admit.Jack Nicholson is over the top as the Joker, but he manages to be an impressive screen presence. There are some intriguing aspects to his character too. He doesn't think of himself as a murderer, but as an artist. He transforms people into (un)living works of art. But his art is so ghastly, that you really see how psychotic he is. He even seems genuinely hurt that the people of Gotham City regard him as a madman, when he believes Batman is the real maniac. The truth is, I'm not so sure he's wrong. After all, Batman is the one who unleashed the Joker on the city. All the people that have died are on his head too.As the film progresses, we learn why Bruce Wayne became Batman. When he was a child, his parents were gunned down right in front of him. This is obviously a vengeance crusade for him, even though he is not ready to admit it to himself. It is always interesting to see whether he will step over the line into complete and utter madness.Although action films are not Tim Burton's field, the action scenes are well handled. They're even artistically done. Cool! The Batmobile is stunning to look at, as is the Batcave, which is as dark as Bruce's own personality. Burton's vision of Gotham City as a twisted, hulking, menacing Halloweenesque town is very impressive. He was definitely more suited to the series instead of Joel Schumacher.Bruce's relationship with Vicki is not that interesting, and they don't have great chemistry (compare it to Keaton and Michelle Pfeiffer, no contest). She is pretty much a screamer and is just the token love interest. The film could have done just as easily without her.Michael Gough is very good as Alfred, and his surrogate father relationship with Bruce is great to watch. Sometimes it seems he is the only one who has a clear insight of what is going on in the world that makes up Bruce's troubled mind.The final confrontation between Batman and the Joker is fairly reminiscent of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Batman's instability really comes to the fore here, and is ably matched by the Joker's. The death of the Joker is very spooky, because it almost seems he is laughing at the world from beyond the grave. That is a death artistic enough that even the Joker himself would approve.The first of the franchise, and when the series was still decent. Its a shame Tim Burton was eventually replaced as director, because his vision was too dark for some. But I think his vision was perfectly suited for bringing the surrealistic, Gothic world of Batman to life. Burton permanently carved out a niche for himself as one of Hollywood's most distinctive, and visually striking filmmakers.Terrific stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid my uncle took me to see 'Batman' on the big screen. Keep in mind I had no idea of all the trouble with Michael Keaton playing Batman. I went to the theater and left amazed. To this day during the final scenes I still get chills from the first shine of the bat-signal to the camera panning up and seeing Batman at the top of the cathedral. I believe this movie set the tone for comic book movies of today. I believe Burton's vision (which not many people understand.) was perfect. It was a beginning movie, so why not start from the beginning of the comic series. When Batman first premiered in the comics the tone was dark and villians rarely ever lived. Also, Burton used Frank Miller's dark portrait of Batman in the 80's. Also people complain that Batman had used guns. Look in the early issues of Batman, he had a gun. I know this movie will live on forever. No matter who directs the next bat-films, they will all be compared to Burton's Batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumphant Screen Debut of Dark Knight...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BATMAN was comic's first truly 'Gothic' hero, a dark avenger prowling, gargoyle-like, on rooftops, casting a giant bat silhouette (featured on the title page of every "Batman" comic for nearly thirty years), and swooping down on gun-wielding criminals armed with only a 'crime lab' on his belt, and an incredible knowledge of fighting skills and the criminal mind. He could be killed in any confrontation, and his own mortality made him far more identifiable to the comic-reading public than the God-like Superman, gifted with powers "far beyond those of ordinary men", whose innocence and purity were best suited to sunny days and simple issues of 'right' and 'wrong'. Batman was the 'Yang' to his 'Ying', an all-too-human creature of the night, walking a tightrope between 'justice' and 'vengeance', whose life was stunted by the murders of his family, and whose very existence was a self-imposed mission of revenge. Heavy stuff, and irresistible to an America coming out of a nearly decade-long Depression! While television, 20 years later, provided the final 'nails' to Batman's 'coffin' (with the decision to turn the character into a campy buffoon, spouting platitudes and running around a daylight Gotham in gray tights and a midnight blue silk cape), the 'softening' of Batman actually began with the introduction of a preteen 'sidekick', Robin, in 1941. Trying to expand the Caped Crusader's audience base, the 'darkness' of Batman was gradually chipped away, giving him a 'family', a sense of humor, and villains who became more "Dick Tracy"-like caricatures of evil than actually menacing, as time passed. Television simply finished the process, nearly destroying all of Batman's credibility. It took nearly twenty years, and a series of revisionist artists and writers, to totally 'revamp' Batman, culminating with Frank Miller's epic "The Dark Knight Returns", in 1986.The decision to move Batman back to the big screen (he had appeared, in two silly, low-budget incarnations, in 1940s serials), was a truly daring move, and hiring Tim Burton, the most unconventional director in Hollywood, to helm the project looked, initially, as suicidal. Certainly his first move, to cast light comedy actor Michael Keaton in the lead, did little to instill confidence, although Jack Nicholson was such a 'natural' to portray arch-nemesis "The Joker" that he had been the fans' overwhelming choice for the role in polls taken as far back as the early 1970s. But Burton was dedicated to capturing Miller's vision, buoyed by his own unique idiosyncrasies, and the 1989 production became a ground-breaking achievement, changing the 'look' of superheroes, on screen, forever.Gone were Robin, the one-liners, the goofy interpretations of super-villains, and the bouncing around a generic Gotham by day. Attired in all-black body armor (a vast improvement to the tights), Batman was returned to a midnight Gotham City both threatening and claustrophobic, a retro-thirties vision of Hell where period costumed citizens scurried about like rats in a maze. Corruption ruled this world, and the Dark Knight's existence was not only justified, but essential for the survival of any kind of society. Armed with his "wonderful toys" (particularly his heavily-armored Batmobile), Batman was every bit as frightening as the Joker. With his sporadic appearances being initially denied by the police (a gimmick that would be resurrected in DAREDEVIL), even the climactic 'gift' of a Bat Signal to summon him "when needed" only enhanced his otherworldly, vampire-like persona.What an amazing transformation had been accomplished!While Tim Burton's follow-up, BATMAN RETURNS, would become too self-indulgent, and Joel Schumacher would single-handedly sabotage the franchise by the series' fourth installment, the abysmal BATMAN AND ROBIN, in 1997, the first BATMAN still remains an undeniable triumph, and, with innovative British filmmaker Christopher Nolan and star Christian Bale set to resurrect Frank Miller's vision in BATMAN: YEAR ONE, in 2005, Batman's greatest adventures may still lie ahead!  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman: 14 years later and still the king of Comic Book Movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I watched Batman again. I've seen it more times than I can remember. I've seen it so many times that I could probably quote the entire movie from start to finish. I like Batman. I never was the biggest comic book fan but from time to time I would take enjoyment from reading one or seeing a movie based on a pop culture hero. Yet the first Batman film I am completely nuts for. I don't know if it was simply because I was 13 and an impressionable youth when I saw the first film or if it was the quirky story directed by the equally quirky Tim Burton, or if it was the beautiful art design by Anton Furst that first captured my fascination. I do know that for each of these reasons the first Batman will forever be in my personal favorites list of movies. The comic book films that come close to Batman is its sequel Batman Returns, last years Spider-Man and this year's X2. However Batman Returns went overboard on the freak-show motif and Spider-Man for as impressive as it was, was lacking in some visual style. Of course Batman has an advantage over Spider-Man being that he exists in a fictional city and not in real-life New York. Batman isn't weighed down by comic book limitations. It truly is an adaptation. It doesn't try to be an audio-visual comic book like the recently released Hulk. It takes the basic ideals from the comic book and fleshes it out for the big screen's more mainstream and reality driven audience. Also in this film they play up on the quirky character play. A man who gets dressed up in black-rubber has got to have just as interesting a story as an evil psycho-path who dresses up like a clown. On top of that there are so many cool gadgets and gimicks in this film. I mean does anything beat this movie's Batmobile? I think not. Batman 5 out 5 stars. If you have not yet seen it then you should get yourself to a video store. It looks great on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Batman" - My #7 movie. 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many reasons to watch Tim Burton's vision of the popular DC Comics character. One reason would be that this version of "Batman" is much darker and stays true to the noirish origins of the comics. In short, it's basically everything the 60's show was not. I used to watch the show and looking back on it, I now think it was pretty cheesy. I applaud Tim Burton's decision to return to the darker, more brooding "Batman". I first saw "Batman" in the theater when I was four back in 1989. Though I vaguely remember seeing it then, I can say that it had to have been one of the greatest experiences of my life. I've had a VHS of the movie (that is decent quality) for a long time and I bought the DVD two years ago. I have recently begun watching all kinds of comic-to-film translations for the last two or three months and "Batman" ranks very high on my viewing list. ("Batman" has been more or less followed in the same mold of darker comic book-to-film translations by "The Crow", "Blade" and most recently "Daredevil".) From the amazing opening credits (fantastic Danny Elfman score included) and then the establishing shot of Gotham City, it pulls you in and doesn't let go. There are so many reasons to like "Batman". Aside from the darker and moodier setting, the performances are one reason to watch it. Michael Keaton will forever be the perfect Bruce Wayne/Batman. You can tell just from the shots of Keaton in costume, that he is truly one of the most menacing figures ever created. When not in costume, we see a man, torn apart by the vision of his parents murder, fighting crime with a vengeance. We see that Bruce also has some deeply-rooted psychological problems as well, which comes to surface in the scene where Kim Basinger's character questions him on being "normal". Jack Nicholson is equally menacing as the Joker. As some people have already stated, his performance is not over-the-top nor is he "stretching his acting talents", but he is simply playing an over-the-top character full-tilt. The action scenes are another reason to watch "Batman". From the opening sequence where Batman takes down two muggers to the shots of the Batmobile speeding towards the Batcave, to the final climatic battle in the church bell tower at the end, "Batman" is pure excitement. My personal favorite scene has always been the ending with the parade and Batman's assault on it with the Batwing, followed by the battle in the church. "Batman" remains today to be Tim Burton's most well-known film and one of the greatest comic book films ever. You can see why I like it so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's also the first movie I remember watching as a young kid. This movie was great back then and of course, it still is. Batman is the best superhero who walks the earth with a tortured soul, so he simply smelled like movie potential. With all these new comic-to-movie translations coming out now (X2, The Hulk etc.), I bet you anything that they look back to this classic for inspiration.The cast of the film is first rate, such as Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger. Michael Keaton does an amazing job as the Dark Knight. There are a lot of memorable scenes and quotes in this one. My favorite scene is the ending scene, not that I wanted it to end, but because there was so much substance in it.

		<fullReview>Definitive. Artistic. Dark. Classic. Humerous.Can you name many other 1989 films that score as highly on so many plains and share a similar box-office intake? Thought not.Tim Burton takes the helm of this renowned film (where 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman &amp; Robin failed,)delivering the key aspects of darkness, plot and action which the story deserved. The Danny Elfman musical score won him further contracts such as 'The Simpsons' and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (also a Burton project)and certainly blows all other competitors away! In fact this film was so successful when it came to merchandise (despite the 15 certificate in the UK, the mainstay of the products were action figure)that it held the Guinness World Record until the 1999 Release of 'Star Wars I - The Phantom Menace' which beat it with the aid of a far greater, more expensive marketing campaign! Furthermore, Michael Keaton is a superb Batman (I do doubt his Bruce Wayne performance a little)and Jack Nicholson is breathtaking as Jack Napier/'The Joker' stiring plenty of laughs along the way...I would not recommend the Warner DVD as it has NOT been given the attention that it deserves i.e. the footage has not been remastered and there are next to no special features - even the chapter selection menu is incomplete."Quick - to the Batmobile!" to rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Batman" opened to record breaking numbers when it first opened back in June 1989, and deservedly so. This is easily the best film in the series. None of the sequels come close to topping this one for great fun. The plot: Batman tries to save Gotham City from the outrageous villain Joker. Michael Keaton is terrific as Batman/Bruce Wayne; Kim Basinger shines as the beautifully seductive reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson gives arguably the craziest performance of his career as the Joker. Directed by Tim Burton, "Batman" is one of the best looking movies that I've ever seen. The Oscar-winning production design is eyepopping and mindboggling. I love movies that have production design that takes you to a world like no other seen before (like Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner"). The Gotham City look in this movie is unforgetable. The special effects and music score (by Burton regular Danny Elfman) are superb too. "Batman" is great fun from start to finish. And boy do I love that Joker's laugh! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the first Batman at the theater in 1989. I was four years old at the time and i had no idea what i was watching. So, When i was about 11 I bought a copy of Batman. Now i was able to understand the film and till this day it has remained one of my favorite films. Since then i have purchased all 4 of the Batman movies and this one is still the best. The script was really dark and mysterious and i think it brought the character of Batman to life. Tim Burton is an excellent director and his dark direction of the first Batman gives a great insight into Batman's world. The scenery and music intensified every scene.The acting is great in this film. Michael Keaton is the best Batman yet. He plays the roles of Bruce Wayne/Batman really well. He has a dark personna that brings Batman to life. Jack Nicholson is hilarious as The Joker. I enjoyed every moment that he was on screen and he is my favorite character in the movie. Kim Basinger is good as Vickki Vale. She brings the film a great female lead and is the first of Batman's many girlfriends. With a soundtrack backed by The Artist Formely Known As Prince, this movie is excellent. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dark, serious version of BATMAN? It's quite an innovation to me, because the only BATMAN I knew before this was the campy 1960's TV series that I saw in reruns when I was growing up. When I heard that Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson were going to star, I said, "Michael Keaton as Batman? I don't know about that, but Jack Nicholson as the Joker is perfect casting." I was right about Nicholson's Joker, and Keaton's Bruce/Batman is quite credible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Keaton had the vision for the DARK KNIGHT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first and best of the Batman films will never be matched. Michael Keaton understood the character so well it was scary. If you watch scenes in the movie, Keaton portrays an emotionally scarred Bruce Wayne so well that you'd think Keaton really was Batman. Nicholson as the Joker was the perfect casting as well. Nicholson's own insanity brought out the character, and he was the best Batman villain to date. If the Batman franchise is going to be revived I think Keaton needs to wake up and smell the coffee. Everybody wants him back. And if Keaton doesn't return then Batman needs to returns to his "dark" roots again. "Batman &amp; Robin", which was the most shameful movie I've seen in years, shouldn't even be considered a Batman film. It was more of a mock-homage to the 1960s T.V. show. Anyhow, 1989's Batman will go down in my book as the best Batman movie. However Batman Returns (1992) was just as good, but for it's own reasons...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman (1989) Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Batman stars Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader, Jack Nicholson as the clown prince of crime, the Joker, and Kim Basinger as a photographer and Bruce Wayne/Batman's love interest, Vicki Vale. I first saw this movie when I was about 6 years old and I was so scared of Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker that I couldn't finish it, but when I was 13, I decided to watch the movie again and was able to watch the movie all the way through and was no longer scared of it, and I loved the movie and Nicholson's performance became one of my favorite parts of the movie.I have always been a Batman fan and after watching this movie for the first time on Blu Ray, I realized how much I really do like this movie and how I appreciate it even more now than I did then. One of my favorite things about this movie besides Nicholson's performance is Michael Keaton as Batman, not so much as Bruce Wayne, but his performance as Batman, he's my favorite Batman next to Kevin Conroy ( I know it's just his voice, but he's still awesome).After exploring more of the Batman universe though, I have a few small complaints about the movie and that is I realized how under-developed and under-used Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent are, they have a much bigger role in the Batman universe and I just think they got the short end of the stick. As for the other performances, I thought Kim Basinger did an okay job as Vicki Vale (although her screaming got kind of annoying after awhile, which I'm sure many will agree), and Robert Wuhl was good as Alexander Knox, sort of the comic relief of the movie. The other things I love about this movie is the score by Danny Elfman, it's just classic, speaking of the music, I actually don't mind the Prince music in the movie, I didn't really think it was too much of a distraction, in my opinion. I also love the production design and cinematography of the movie, the setting looked and felt like Gotham City to me.Overall this is one of my favorite Batman movies of all time and I just love almost everything about this movie, the directing job by Tim Burton, the acting, the music, and the whole look of this movie, it's just great, it's a classic Batman movie and I highly recommend it to all Batman fans and comic book fans in general, awesome movie. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's version of Batman is an almost perfect superhero movie. It really depends on the type of feel you prefer for one of these superhero movies. If you're like me you prefer the traditional more lighthearted comic book feel with some dark humour and comic relief, as in this version of Batman. Not to say that Chris Columbus's darker and heavier version isn't also amazing, it's just a much different feel. I don't really want to debate the two versions of Batman because I love them both, so I will just talk about this version here.Jack Nicholson is fantastic as The Joker. He made millions and millions of dollars by insisting on a profit share for this movie which of course went on to be a massive hit, and he deserves it. He manages to pull off being both menacing and also funny, and even sympathetic. Jack Palance is also great as his boss.Michael Keaton is still my favourite Batman, though not my favourite Bruce Wayne necessarily.The comic book style action, snappy dialog and great performances (for this kind of a feel they are going for) all make this a fantastic movie that still holds up.You can't compare it to the newer Batman trilogy, because they are deliberately very different in how they feel and what they present. Love them both!</fullReview>

The costuming was amazing. The acting was right on key, the direction and flow was awesome. And the music was just brilliant. It's everything you want to see in an action film. Trust me it's the bomb. This is the best Batman film out of all of the movies. Everything was great. The acting, the script, the special effects. Everything was a well done job. The filmmakers for once should be very proud of themselves. It was a great one. So everyone who's a fan of Bob Kane and Batman. They will not be disappointed. This film on DVD and Blu-ray will have you wanting to see all of the other Batman movies. Even though the rest of them aren't as good. So definitely a 10/10. Watch it and have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sticking to the true foundations and values of the Batman comic books, this 1989 venture into the series has almost turned into the most overlooked superhero movie of all time. Getting rid of the '60s quirkiness and instead using a new mix of quirk and edginess, Tim Burton made a fine film that has definitely captured the hearts of true fans of the series, the comic books and the nostalgia of Batman.While not as visually startling or entertaining as Christopher Nolan's trilogy, Burton held onto the moderate design campiness that historically would be used make to a superhero film enjoyable. Not only were the costume and scenery excellent, but also the presentations of the characters; Most notably Jack Nicholson's Joker character; eventually overshadowed by the impact made by Heath Ledger's portrayal, but the main compliment given would be that Nicholson played The Joker the way he was meant to be played, while some would consider this to be the complete opposite of innovative, it was still a very fun effort; with his approach being very similar to Jack Torrance in 'The Shining'.Nicholson's approach is essentially dictated by the story though, which isn't the big Hollywood, edge-of-your-seat thriller of twists that The Dark Knight would go on to be. It's not a roller-coaster ride, but the admirable acting from Michael Keaton served very well to the story. The often disputed Bruce Wayne does a great job here, in my opinion; I don't want to go on a rant but Keaton plays the role a whole lot better than Val Kilmer and George Clooney would.The screenplay is great for what it is, the soundtrack is fine but not memorable, odd considering the amount of Prince in it, and the film's legacy? Well 'Batman' from 1989 pretty much set the stage for a great new batch of quirky but dark superhero action movies, some are great, some are 'Batman and Robin', but this was a great starting point. Don't forget about this gem. ***3/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman has always been one of my favourite superheroes of all time, and Tim Burton's film of Batman is one of my favourite superhero movies of all time. The acting, the cast, the directing, the music, the cinematography, the set and the effects are all done wonderfully. The action scenes may be a bit cheesy but they're still exciting and entertaining. The story is kind of basic, but it's true to the comics (i.e. the death of Bruce Wayne's parents and the creation of the Joker in the chemical plant). It also makes me wish I had lived in the 80s because a lot of movies that I really like were released during that decade.Jack Nicholson does an amazing job as the Joker (along with Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight and Mark Hamill in the Animated Series) and he manages to be both dark and scary at the same time. And most people consider Michael Keaton to be the best Batman, and I agree with them because he's both mysterious and intimidating. I really enjoyed Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale as the love interest. Not only was she a pretty face, but she was also a good in her character as well. I also enjoyed Michael Gough (R.I.P.) as Alfred even though we don't as much of him. But I like him because he's kind and lovable as Alfred and you can see that him and Bruce are close and acts like a father figure to him. In my opinion, as much as I love Chris Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy (minus The Dark Knight), I have to say this is one of the best Batman/superhero movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton was able to do what people had been wanting to do for years but never could think of a good way to transition Batman to the big screen. The campy version of Batman that was the 1960's TV show wasn't going to make for a very good movie. Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan are still the only 2 directors to have done good Batman theatrical release movies, Joel Schumacher's version are an abomination to the series.Michael Keaton is my favorite of all the actors to play a live action Batman/Bruce Wayne to this point.Jack Nicholson's version of The Joker gets overshadowed by Heath Ledger's version and while not quite on the same level as Ledger's, it's still a quite good performance as Batman's most well known villain.I didn't quite like the idea of Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent since that didn't really fit in with the rest of the Harvey Dent characters before and after. But even with that said he still did a good job with the role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Batman Jack Nicholson plays the Joker. Now, Jack Nicholson's Joker is no Heath Ledger, but it is still a great performance. And, Michael Keaton as Batman, I was surprised, he did very well! Not as good as Christian Bale, but good. I know I shouldn't compare this to Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, but I do, because I LOVE the Nolan movies. One thing I don't like in this movie, is Batman's suit. It looks cheap and I don't like it. But, I understand because this is an 80's movie. This is WAY better than Batman Forever, and Batman And Robin, but not as good as Batman Begins or The Dark Knight or Dark Knight Rises. But it's a good time, and if your a movie or comic fan, you should check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off with let me say that this Batmobile is a beautiful car. I love that design and would definitely drive that every day if I owned it.The theme music by Danny Elfman is PERFECT for a Batman movie. It is moody and powerful.Michael Gough was extremely convincing as a Butler. Jack Palance as a mobster? Absolutely! I was disappointed in Kim Basinger though. Her performance was very flat. Billy Dee Williams also gave a rather lackluster performance.Jack Nicholson's Joker is excellent. He really seems to have fun playing this character. This Joker is not especially original but in my opinion that is a good thing. When I watch a movie about comic book characters I expect the characters to be faithful representations and not radically changed.Michael Keaton is not an obvious choice to play Batman. However, I think that he pulled it off brilliantly. When he is in the Batsuit he emanates a kind of calm intensity. His portrayal of Bruch Wayne had a subtlety that is rare in this type of movie.This movie is good for another reason as well. The battle between Batman and the Joker is a very personal one. Not just because of the back-story but also the way their relationship develops throughout the movie.This is the best comic book-to-film movie that I am aware of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Batman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of copycat superhero movies out these days, so you have to applaud a movie that takes something as far fetched as a costumed superhero and makes it believable in realistic surroundings, even if it came out in 1989.I think the Michael Keaton Batman movies are so superior to the later films in the series. The campiness of that live action TV cartoon is quickly forgotten as we see what Batman would really look like in our three dimensional world, but you have to think, if this darker and more grim figure had popped up in the Sixties or the Seventies, might we know who he was with that comedic visage of Adam West as Batman trapped in our minds. This is the best role that Michael Keaton has ever done, both in costume and as Bruce Wayne, and the movie that made us forget Jack Nicholson's catch phrase from the Shining. A lot of kudos also have to go to Jack Palance, quite possibly the only man who could put Nicholson in his place. All the men are augmented by the masterful direction and vision of Tim Burton and a script that takes the viewer to the same height that the first Superman did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is my humble opinion that Michael Keaton did the best job of all the actors who portrayed the Caped Crusader in the four Batman films. The church scene in the climatic sequence with Batman chasing The Joker is a replica of the church from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo(1958). The scene even rips of the famous chase of the main protagonist in Vertigo(1958). One of the films weaknesses is there never seems to be any kind of chemistry between Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale that works with the same emotions of Lois Lane and Superman in The first two Superman movies.The director was mightily influenced by the mood and style of Mario Bava and its apparent in the film's set designs and art direction. A Bava picture that possibly inspired Batman(1989) in its feel and looks is Diabolik(1968). Jack Palance is in the film for too short a time to make any sort of impression as Boss Carl Grissom. Not as emotionally involving as Superman the Movie(1978), Batman(1989) still has enough visual punch to make it last as a closing chapter of the 1980s.</fullReview>

He shows up when there is danger in the town. The outside is like a big bat. At first, people didn't believe the hero's existence-in fact, people thought that it was a bad guy. The hero of the mystery got into the news by town people, when there was a showboat who wanted to fight. This showboat's name is Joker. He is not a usual showboat and like a Pierrot both the outside and his behavior since he fall in a barrel of acid thing. His behavior is too abnormal. For example, people are killed laughing by Joker, he makes people laugh by force until killed by him, and scatters the poisonous gas while enjoy dancing. He is always lunacy.Why Joker wants fight with the hero? Because,the hero and Joker love a same woman, and the woman loves the hero. Joker has deep jealousy for the hero. In addition, the hero has a fatality so, Joker killed his parents in his childhood. For this reason, they hate each other.One day, Joker carry off the woman for fight with the hero. Ofcouse, the hero helps her, but Joker's persistent henchman stand in the hero's way,so put up a bad fight.While the woman gets terrible treatment by Joker.The hero(like a bat) fights in haste.

		<shortDescription>This is my review of Batman, i'll explain the story when we get into the review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is none other than a classic. I know a lot of people say this is rubbish compared to the dark knight but remember the dark knight was made quite recently. This movie was made in 1989, before modern movie techniques were made. Well after telling you about all that, let's talk about the plot. At the point in time it is set, batman is only a rumour in Gotham city. Few people believe in batman, and two of those very few people is reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Whul)and photojournalist Vici Vale (Kim Basinger).they try to uncover the mystery of Batman's identity. There are a few subplots, but I don't want to get into those now. If you're not familiar with batman, this may be a spoiler but if you not sure then just skip this bit. If you're still reading this bit then Batman's real identity is that of Millionaire Bruce Wayne played by Michael Keaton who plays Batman as well, as he tries to stop the evil menace of Gotham City the Joker played by Jack Nicholson. The movie just looks beautiful looking like it's the 1950s, but then again that's what director Tim Burton is best at with movies like Edward Scissorhands and Sweeny Todd which have that dark, fairytale look to it. Now there are problems with this movie. I think my biggest problem is that the Joker has more screen time than any other character in the movie. Now I'll say this a lot of people complain that Batman doesn't have a lot of screen time. The reason why that is because they are trying to create mystery to the character. Although I think Vici deserved more screen time than the Joker. About the performances the only ones I'll talk about are Batman, the Joker and Vici Vale. Keaton by far gives the best performance of the movie. The reason why that is because out of all the actors who have played Batman he is the least assuming out of all them which I think that's what Batman is supposed to be. Nicholsan always gives a great performance and is one of the best villain actors of all time. However because he gets so much screen time he is a little off putting from the rest of the characters and it feels likes this movie should have been called Joker rather than Batman because he gets so much screen time but overall he is a good joker. Basinger also gives a good performance as Vale. I don't really have a lot to say about her , but she is a interesting character and she's a bit like a James Bond girl. Overall this movie is entertaining, but you might have to see it a few times before you will appreciate for what it is. Now for the rating I give it 4 and a half out of 5. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is a classic in a lot of ways, it was the very 1st Batman film I ever saw, and despite a few problems that I have with the film, I still hold it in very high regards. Tim Burton is a very unique director, with his films a lot of the time being quite dark, and gloomy, Batman was no different. Gotham looks very bleak, and very creepy, while giving us a hero who mostly plays it straight in Michael Keaton. My main problem with Batman, even though I enjoyed it immensely was, it was sometimes too dark for it's own good. I often felt relieved when ever Jack Nicholson showed up on screen, because he proved the humor I desired. That being said, the action for this time was amazingly exciting for the time, I especially enjoyed the final showdown between Bruce and The Joker.Performances. Michael Keaton makes for a very effective Batman. While he isn't quite in Christian Bale's league, he's still miles above all the rest. He's able to add a great sense of mysterious, and wonder to the role, while proving just the right amount of charisma. His chemistry with Kim Bassinger was also on the ball. Jack Nicholson is wonderfully OTT as The Joker. He is clearly having a blast, this is honestly one of my favorite performances of his. Kim Basinger is pretty good as Vicki Vale. She's strikingly beautiful, while manging to be a likable love interest. Michael Gough adds a touch of class to the role of Alfred, I enjoyed his time on screen. Rest of the cast are equally as great.Bottom line. Batman is a film i've seen quite a few times. It really is an excellent film, and one of the better superhero one's out there, therefore I highly recommend it.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph of style over substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original modern day Batman movie succeeds in pulling it's audience in with it's amazing visuals but fails to have any real substance. That is not to say there isn't nothing to like about this movie other than on a superficial level. Jack Nicholson as the Joker steals the show portraying the clown prince of crime as a homicidal maniac with a demented sense of humor just as he should be. Michael Keaton effectively plays a Bruce Wayne trying to deal with duel identities as well as the dark avenger Batman. Unfortunately the characters in this movie go nowhere as far as development is concern and it's hard to care about anyone in this movie. But it is the visuals in this movie that work setting Gotham in a timeless almost 1940's retro style that had in influence on the superior animated series. The music by Danny Elfman is incredible being perhaps the best score in any super hero film to date and in my personal top 5 movie scores of all time. It may seem that I don't think much of this movie, but I do. I considerate it to be best Batman of the original franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years Batman has been a demigod, comedian, and psycho in a funky costume. Rather than bicker about which movie, TV series or individual comic book run is the definitive Batman (and for the record, I thought Batman Begins was a bit weak), I'll say this is a very good Batman. Burton's version of Batman is definitely more demigod than comedian, leaving the snarky(and highly quotable) lines to the Joker, as portrayed by Jack Nicholson. From Batman's first appearance, terrorizing criminals more like Dracula than a bellowing blowhard on a zipline, to his final confrontation with the Joker, something suitably more Gothic than a runaway rail train, he's presented as something almost supernatural. The real fun in this movie lies within the supporting cast, which adds a lot of charm to what would be a movie full of rehashed stereoty-excuse me-archetypes. Robert Whul lights up the screen as Alexander Knox. Billy Dee Williams has commanding screen presence as Harvey Dent(a role "Forever" scared by Tommy Lee Jones and J. Schumacher). William Hootkins' gravelry delivery as Lt. Eckhart steals (well, borrows) the show. Even Tracey Walter, no more than Nicholson's shadow and foil as Bob the Goon, show's some bitch'n acting chops. Free from on-screen sound effects, and hopping tanks, Batman is an overblown action film that packs sizable thrills, a few laughs(within context), and a fair amount of Tim Burton's recognizable touches, all of which keep the overall film, dark, moody and ultimately entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S10 Reviews: Batman (1989)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic fight of good versus evil plays out splendidly in Tim Burton's stellar adaptation of Bob Kane's much beloved comic.Michael Keaton plays bazillionare socialite Bruce Wayne, a bumbling ladies man by day and a black cowled avenger in the night. In his youth he made a promise to combat evil in any form after the murders of his parents. The Dark Avenger goes up against his arch-nemesis Joker this time around whose evil scheme is to poison Gotham City and bring it to its' knees.Burton captures the visual style of the comics wonderfully. His quirkiness is perfect for the tale of Batman and his colorful stable of characters.The script by Sam Hamm and Warren Skarren is excellent with several modifications to the back story which are understandable (The substitution of Joe Chill as Wayne's parents' murderer with Jack Napier) and sometimes hokey (bumbling Bruce - what's this Superman? Not to mention the villains taking up way too much screen time). Easily the best and most fulfilling comic adaptation of its' time. The Gothic production design and Danny Elfman's score are just the icing on the cake. Nicholson's Joker is highly entertaining and Keaton, while seemingly an odd choice nails the part perfectly. I saw this puppy 12 in the theaters in 1989 and it remains an all-time favorite.S10's Rating: 5/5 or 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! I think this is the best Batman movie money can buy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. Batman Begins (the new one) is really really good and I recommend you see it. However, this movie is amazing. Batman is appreciably dark, just like he should be. And I always liked my Batman dark. There are only a few humorous lines, which are really good, for example the first line about the car. The Batmobile is stupendous. Jack Nicholson does a wonderful job as the Joker. He was meant to be the Joker...he does a great, zany performance. The romance is not cloying or over-the-top. And the best part of it is the mood it sets. I gave this movie a 10, if I could have given it higher I would have. Truly an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mistake Left Disregarded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one goof IMDb forgot. At the top of the Bell Tower, the Joker clearly melts the bolts on the bell with acid from his squirt-prank flower, making it fall from where it was hanging and blocking access to the tower, yet when Batman fights him and his goons, there's a bell which he uses to aid him in fighting. Personally though, I thought his movie was wonderful. Michael Keaton did such a wonderful job at playing Batman and Jack Nicholson was terrific and the only actor that could do the role of The Joker justice. It's a shame Keaton didn't play the role as the dark knight in Forever and Batman &amp; Robin, he probably would have made them both much better movies. Screw Bob Kane, if he thinks Val Kilmer did better than Keaton, he must be as messed up as The Joker. I really hope that BATMAN BEGINS will be as good as the original and will have some relevance to it (especially the part were Jack Napier shoots Bruce's parents with the classic quote, "Ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight? See you 'round, kid".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was perhaps the best superhero movie ever. In its time, it was really a marvel and to most people i know it still is. While some people look deep into the flaws and compare ever inch to the comic book, i do not and therefore i see a great movieThe Acting by Michael Keaton (best batman) is very well done, but of course Jack Nicholson's Joker shines as the great villain. Jack did such an awesome jobWhile i will not give any spoilers just in case there are some who didn't see it.......the entire ending from the Parade to the final showdown on the Cathedral was too good.Also loved the darkish realistic urban style of Gotham City, showed corruption and crime big time. Dialouge was very well done (even some curses and violence = plus).I give it a 10/10, def rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I saw this for the first time when I was a kid in the early 90's, I always revered it as one of the best comic book movies of all time, up there (in my opinion) with "X-Men", "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm", "The Crow", and a handful of others.Well, I don't know why I did that. I just saw it for the first time in several years, and it was pretty boring. The visuals are beautiful to behold, the costumes and set design are nothing short of perfection, but that's about it... Much of the dialogue is rather corny, and character development is severely lacking. I particularly hated Vicky Vale, who is nothing but a blonde cardboard cutout with absolutely no background or personality and does a lot more screaming than talking; since much of the story revolves around Vale, it makes the movie a lot more boring, and I was constantly wondering why Batman was in love with such a robot. Even the Joker's character is a bit confusing, because I couldn't really fathom how such a serious, suave, gritty psychotic gangster could suddenly be transformed into this laughter-crazed lunatic with a twisted sense of humor. I thought the personality of the young Joker-to-be chronicled in "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm" was much more believable as a precursor to the Joker than Nicholson's rendition of Jack Napier.The Elfman score is good and fits in well, particularly the main Batman theme. However, the Prince music really dates the movie: if this film didn't have that music, it would have a very timeless atmosphere, which is the kind of thing that Gotham really needs, as evoked in "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm" and the rest of the animated series. As it is, the Prince music is the film's only cultural artifact that makes me feel like I'm looking at Gotham in the 1980's.Even the action sequences are rather silly and contrived, saturated with things that just "look cool" but utterly destroy suspension of disbelief due to their unfathomable lack of logic... Masters of action like John Woo and James Cameron can make the utterly unbelievable seem quite believable, but either Tim Burton can't do this or the person who designed these action sequences just plain sucks. Or maybe my expectations for this movie were just way too high and I was criticizing it far too much.In any case, I saw "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm" a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed it much more than this: it had better character development, better dialogue, better action sequences, and the visuals were superb (though it's still not quite as gorgeous as this movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**** (out of ****)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner Brothers "Batman" is a dark, haunting film; one that is full of pain and anger; yet, it also holds the grand and heroic qualities that make it a great picture and one of the most successful movies of all time. "Batman" closely follows the early Bob Kane comics in it's style and personality, while borrowing a few features of the more recent Batman graphic novels by Frank Miller and Alan Moore. The script by Sam Hamm and Warren Skarren is a very tightly knit one, featuring a slew of great lines, some amazing scenes, and, quite thankfully, the absence of Robin. Michael Keaton is dead on in his portrayal of both Batman and his alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, but Jack Nicholson takes the cake with his wonderful, maniacal performance as The Joker. Tim Burton's solid direction, top-notch action sequences, spectacular sets, and a fantastic score make for a thrilling ride from beginning to end. Truly, the best comic-book movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a bad movie, just an uneven and unsatisfying one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many things to like about Tim Burton's "Batman," and yet just as much that annoys and frustrated me that I find myself in a state of praising and criticizing it almost in equal measure. Here is a well-made action movie done with skill and great artistry, yet it tells a story that it is hard to care anything about. It presents a wonderfully bizarre villain in The Joker, while pushing the hero into the shadows and never taking advantage of the opportunity to get inside his head.That's a major misstep because out of all the superheroes, Batman is the most interesting. He is a figure of deep psychological complexity. Unlike Superman, who sees the world from the air and possesses a body that is impervious to pain, Batman sees the world from the ground up, and hobbles home every night to nurse not only his wounds but his personal demons. He is so deeply damaged by what he has experience that it traps him into a personal prison, a batsuit, to do a job that he knows will never be finished.Approaching that deeply troubled soul might have seemed a reasonable assignment for a director like Tim Burton, whose films are dark and broody and often tilted in favor of the outsider. He clearly wants to pull Batman out of light of the campy 60s TV series and put him back into the shadowy world of film noir, where he belongs. Yet, his Batman is curiously muted. Instead of telling a story about a troubled character, Burton's film is a standard ordinary Batman adventure in which The Caped Crusader attempts to bring down The Joker. Ho-hum. We can read that in a comic book.The film isn't a complete waste. It is evenly split between elements that work and elements that don't. To our surprise, the element that doesn't work is Batman himself, and his alter-ego Bruce Wayne. As played by Michael Keaton, Batman is a shadowy figure who appears from nowhere in a rubber suit to terrorize Gotham City's criminal population and then disappear as quickly as he came. As Bruce Wayne, Keaton seems way too calm for a man dealing with, as he calls it, "a head full of bad wiring." He doesn't look much like a billionaire, more like a guy who works for one.Jack Nicholson, however, is right on target. He gives a splendid, virtuoso performance as The Joker, a role that he seems born to play. He's on screen very soon and very often. So often, in fact, that he really becomes the bulk of the movie. There are moments when The Joker has so many scenes that we tend to forget that Batman is even around. That might have something to do with the fact the scenes involving Bruce Wayne are kind of dry and dull. Even his love story with press photographer Vicki Vale seems somewhat inevitable. They're drawn together by the plot, not by personality. The scene in which she finds out his true identity is one of the dullest reveals that you've ever seen. They don't seem to really care about each other. Vale, as a character is incomplete. She's introduced as a photographer who travels to war zones to record the carnage, but then she becomes just a damsel in distress.As uninvolving as this story is, you can't deny the craft involved. Gotham City looks like a suburb of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Created by the last Anton Furst, the architecture of the city makes it look like it was put together out on the spur of the moment, not out of necessity. It stands for the twisted nature of the corruption of the city itself. You could only wish that the story and the cast of characters were as well designed. This is a movie of great craft but of little characterization. It's not a bad movie, just an uneven and unsatisfying one.**1/2 (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman At His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1980's, producers were having trouble getting Batman on the big screen, luckily, Tim Burton was there to give them a film that had great characters, great music, and a great look.Taking place in the grim Gotham City, tourists are attacked by a pair of muggers, who then hide on top of a building after the mugging. They get into a short discussion about a mysterious figure known as Batman, who has allegedly been taking out criminals in Gotham. Batman then appears, and apprehends them. As one of the muggers pleads for his life, Batman states that he won't kill him, but he wants him to tell fellow criminals about him. After the muggers are taken in by the police, a dirty cop heads into the alley to collect his payment from Jack Napier, consigliere of crime boss Carl Grissom. As Napier and the cop talk, the conversation nearly escalates to death, as guns are briefly drawn after the cop tells Napier that he will never rise in the mob due to his mental instability. Napier, also arrogant amongst his other issues, has been sleeping with Grissom's girlfriend, and as revenge he sends Napier to a chemical factory to do some mob work, but Grissom tips off the police about it. On the same night, a fundraiser for Gotham's 200th anniversary event is being held at the manor of local billionaire Bruce Wayne. At his fundraiser Bruce meets Vicki Vale, a photojournalist attracted to Gotham City by the Batman rumors. The two begin a relationship. At Axis Chemicals, the police arrive, and Napier and his cronies scatter until Batman arrives. Napier attempts to shoot Batman, but the bullets are deflected and hit Napier in the face, horribly scarring him. Napier falls back over the railing right over a vat of chemicals, Batman attempts to keep him from falling, but accidentally drops him into the chemicals. Batman flees the scene. The chemicals wash into the harbor, and a white hand reaches out from the water. It turns out Napier has survived the incident, but the chemicals have permanently stained his skin white, his hair green, and his lips bright red, and some seedy plastic surgery also leads to him having a permanent grin. After killing Grissom, Napier takes over the mob and begins to refer to himself as the Joker. Using Axis Chemicals, the Joker taints various household products, poisoning the citizens of Gotham City, and the already existing hatred the Joker has for Batman increases after he thwarts his crimes, and he becomes determined to replace Batman as the freakish center of attention in Gotham City.Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the title character mysterious, and this suits him perfectly. Michael Keaton's performance is great, he's intimidating, funny, cool, and often doesn't even need to speak to sell such things, his facial expressions do the trick just fine much of the time. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker: Loud, attention- craving, and hilarious. It's very interesting to watch how the Joker's personality escalates, beginning as an unstable gangster with aptitudes of art to becoming a homicidal madman who scars women and creates devices more deadly than they appear. The cast is great all around, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is, in a word - incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. It suits Batman perfectly, dark yet adventurous. Prince did two songs for the film, "Partyman" and "Trust". They may seem unnecessary or out of place to some people, but I enjoy both songs and their uses, and the scene in which Partyman is used is actually one of my favorite scenes.The production design perfectly represents the non-realism of its characters and its own universe: It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. Gotham City looks like a cross between the Emerald City and Dracula's castle, a vast noir metropolis filled with crime. Jack Napier sums up the city perfectly with his line "Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be happier someplace else", with locations like the smog-riddled Axis Chemicals and the seemingly impossibly tall Gotham Cathedral being the highlight of this dark world, which is complimented by the atmospheric skyline. The title character has two vehicles that he uses, the Batmobile and the Batwing, both are sleek and go with Batman perfectly.This film also has ton of great quotes, with some of my favorites being the exchange of "What do you want?" "My face on the one dollar bill.", and Knox's line "He must have been King of the Wicker People."There's a sort of "reap what you sow" theme, with the character's actions in the past heavily affecting the present day story. In his youth, Jack Napier murders Bruce's parents, which causes him to become Batman. Years later, Batman accidentally drops Jack into a vat of chemicals, turning him into the Joker. The two have a great dynamic, encountering each other in various personas at various times and places. Their hatred for each other comes from so many things, which include their desire for revenge against one another, the Joker's advances on Vicki, and Batman stealing the spotlight from the Joker.The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.</fullReview>

We see the first and best BATMOBILE ever and also the BATPLANE or BATWING. Jack Nicholson is awesome as the menacing and psychopathic Joker but still having a weakness for the fair sex i.e., Vicki Vale played by Kim Basinger. There is ghoulish humor galore in this film as it is a Tim Burton film after all. Incidentally if you are a big fan of Michael Keaton like me and want to know which is other good films are: 1.

		<shortDescription>"Batman"- A Must See For Comic Book Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman (1989) Directed by Tim Burton Starring Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Jack Palance, Michael Gough, Jerry Hall, Pat Hingle, and Robert Wuhl.Synopsis: As Gothom City approaches its 200th Anniversary, the gang riddled streets and crime filled alleys are watched over by a new man- Batman (Keaton), a man who dresses as a Bat and strikes fear into the heart of evil. Meanwhile, in the wake of a mob boss' mysterious disappearance, a menacing psychopath with a sick sense of humor has taken control of the gangs of Gothom, and he is the Joker (Nicholson). As Batman terrorizes criminals and the Joker terrorizes the public with a deadly laughing gas, photographer Vicki Vale (Basinger) tries to find the reasoning, as well as the identities behind both men. Review: While its story could have been improved upon, and certain elements took away from the overall feel, "Batman" remains a great, imaginative movie that any fan or non-fan will enjoy. It is well done, creative, and most of all entertaining. Looking at the film and its predecessors, as well as the new series reboot "Batman Begins", it is obvious that this movie had the perfect cast, the perfect look, the perfect feel, and it came out in the perfect time. Although many complain that this, as well as "Batman Returns", are too dark and moody, I believe that it is exactly what Batman needs. Batman is a character driven by revenge and a certain piece of himself that is missing. He is the perfect example of an anti-hero, and his story is not at all campy and light. He is the Dark Knight, and he lives in Gothom City. Tim Burton does a great job at bringing Gothom City to life as well as making Batman a dark, Gothic story that truly has come to define the modern definition of the character and his allies in the comics. Jack Nicholson steals the show as the humorously psychotic Joker, a man who accidentally fell into a toxic chemical bath, coming out barely alive and with bleached skin, green hair, and a permanent grin with a wicked sense of humor to go with it. Even though he is evil, sick, and sadistic, you just have to love and enjoy the character. Nicholson makes a villain that we fear but we also can laugh with him, and that is the best kind of villain there is. Michael Keaton dons the cape and cowl as Batman and Bruce Wayne, and next to Christian Bale he remains the best Batman. His Batman is intimidating and strong, and a real hero who is also a tortured soul. He is constantly haunted, and he can not help but go out and fight crime. However, Keaton does not work as well as billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. He certainly isn't bad at the part, and it is very hard to go from a dark hero dressed as a bat to a billionaire playboy, but something is missing from his Bruce Wayne. That missing link, however, doesn't really effect the movie at all. Kim Basinger is the lead female this time around, and she does a great job in her role. Certainly, Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in "Batman Returns" is much more interesting and seductive as a love interest, but Basinger's Vicki Vale is a suitable and likable character, who also shares some strong qualities. Many people complain about little aspects of the film that really don't matter in the overall feel of the film, and actually help this particular film. Many say the Joker's origins should not have been told, or Jack Nicholson wasn't tall enough, or that Batman's parents were killed by someone different, or that Vicki Vale wouldn't be let into the bat-cave, or even that Michael Keaton looks too much like a nerd to be Bruce Wayne, but when you're watching "Batman" you are brought into a different world where things like those don't really matter, and you are suspended in disbelief and quite entertained. The only problem that is actually noticeable is the fact that Prince performed several songs on soundtrack of the film, and when the Joker dances to them it really just makes you laugh at the movie. It was made in the 80's, I should get over it, but somehow I just don't see Prince fitting into the dark story of Batman. However, the musical score by Danny Elfman is just superb, and to this day his scores in "Batman" and "Batman Returns" are some of the most impressive works in a major motion picture, and they are the best the "Batman" series has to offer overall. If you're looking for a fun time where you can sit back, enjoy a well made movie, and appreciate a different type of superhero, then go watch "Batman". Tim Burton and the crew did a magnificent job here, and his first two movies are the best out of the first four "Batman" films. If you like this movie, you may want to look at "Batman Returns" which is more a Tim Burton type movie than this but is a great sequel that doesn't rely on the success of this movie. "Batman Forever" is also good, not as good as the first two films but it explores some of the psychology of Batman/Bruce Wayne, which is nice to see. Skip "Batman &amp; Robin", because if you like the feel of 1989's "Batman" then you will hate that one. You will also probably enjoy "Batman Begins", and even though many say 'You can't like both "Batman" and "Batman Begins"' there is no reason not to like them both. They are different, but at the same time they are both great movies. So remember, watch "Batman" and put a 'smile' on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two concepts of what constitutes a "comic book." To the true fanatic, the modern "comic book" is a misnomer; being anything but comic, they are serious, dark and even tragic tales of violence and cruelty. The only thing comic about them is their format: pen and ink drawings illustrated in sequential panels like the Sunday funnies. To true believers, the accent is on the "book," as in literature; thus they prefer the pretentious term, "graphic novel." To the less discerning among us, the accent is on the comic: what point is there in reading or watching a cartoon if it doesn't make you laugh, or at least smile? Shouldn't "serious comic book" be an oxymoron? Either way, comics are outrageously improbable tales that often defy logic and good sense. Some people justify reading comic books by buying into their self-absorbed pomposity and quietly ignoring their total lack of logic, while others see through the pretense to mock their fundamental absurdity.BATMAN, the TV phenomenon of the 1960's, was all about the mockery. And, despite Tim Burton's track record of creating campy and satirical movies, his big screen version of the Batman saga is all about the pomposity. Dark, heavy-handed and downright gloomy, Burton's BATMAN is flat out depressing; it has more in common with a horror movie than with a heroic fantasy. Avoiding any attempt of even accidentally recapturing the cheerfully silly tone and intent of the old TV series, Burton and his film approach the saga of the crime fighting superhero with nary a hint of good cheer; and what little that might pass for humor is so joyless and cold that it could rightly be called sadistic. If that is what you seek in "comic book" adventures, then BATMAN succeeds gloriously. If you are expecting more from such a tale, such as inspiration or humanity, then Burton's BATMAN is largely an unpleasant film-watching experience.Michael Keaton, so good at playing cocky, comedic characters, is subdued yet surprisingly effective in the guise of Bruce Wayne. His casting, however, raised many an eyebrow as people questioned his ability to fill the Batsuit. In reality, as Batman, Keaton is largely inconsequential: heavily padded in a costume that vaguely makes him resemble a Naugahyde easy chair, Keaton gets lost in the disguise and much of his character is obviously played by a series of stuntmen anyway. Some thought Jack Nicholson stole the film as The Joker; and though the part indulges Nicholson's penchant for flamboyant overacting, it is a remarkably joyless performance. Nicholson brings out the character's innate evil, but he never even suggests that the character himself is actually enjoying being evil. His evil was more fun to watch in THE SHINING. Here, ironically, Nicholson's overacting is stiff; the audience is never invited to share in the fun of his evil behavior, like say Cesar Romero did on the TV series. A good villain is someone you hate; a great villain is someone you absolutely love to hate.But the real villain of this film is its overall tone of despair and depression. We must take it for granted that Gotham City is worth Batman's efforts to save because this vision of the city -- and by extension society and mankind in general -- is unrelentingly pessimistic. It is a fundamental division in the philosophy of life: Is evil an outside force that threatens humanity, or an extension of humanity destroying from within? For a hero such as TV's Batman, there is hope because good protects us from an alien evil. The darker outlook of the comic book and movie Batman suggests that evil can only be contained, never eliminated -- it is in us.This evil outside versus evil inside dichotomy is also apparent in the interpretation of Batman. Rather than Batman being a "duly appointed officer of the law" as was Adam West's incarnation, the prevailing cinematic image of this superhero is that he is every bit as much of an outsider as the criminals he pursues. Rather than being the opposite of the villain, this theory assumes him to be just the other side of the coin. This BATMAN belabors the idea that both The Joker and Batman are freaks, their garish costumes being extensions of their antisocial natures. Batman, a violent vigilante, is simply the lesser of two evils.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really an expanded trailer that has dramatic cancer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no fan of Burton, a director who has been propped up by A-list designers and DOP's for years...but, I like "Sleepy Hollow", "Big Top Pee Wee" is passable, and "Ed Wood" is a classic (thanks to the brilliant screenplay). I despise "Beetlejunk", though, and see "Mars Attacks" as a massive missed opportunity. "Big Fish"? It's beyond rotten. Which now brings me to "Batman". What a pile! Nicely shot and beautifully designed, as many Burton films are, but there's more drama inside a block of ice and more suspense on a toilet seat lying sideways on a desert bombing range. The film is a horrible trailer expanded to feature length and suffers from terminal dramatic cancer. The final "chase" scene with Nicholson is beyond awful and Keaton's Batman has no charisma. Compare this to the terrific "Batman Begins" and you'll see the difference a good director makes to strong material.</fullReview>

Keaton's acting is non-existent, Nicholson's is over-blown. This is the movie that forever ruined all subsequent super-hero comic book adaptations by saying that tights (with muscles underneath) is corny, while rubber black armor (with nothing underneath) is not. Wrong. This movie is pure, idiotic camp.1/10 (because less than that was not available)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall: This movie is incredible and arguably the second best Batman movie ever made (First being THE DARK KNIGHT). Each actor plays their role well and Tim Burton does a fantastic job. I love this movie! Good: The contrast between Batman's dark and grittiness &amp; The Joker's delight and insanity is beautifully done. The music is incredible all the way through and the Batman theme song is amazing. Stellar performances from everyone all around the board. The story is well put together, the pacing is decent and the dialogue is great; plus one point for use of... "I'M BATMAN!". Nicholson's Joker is arguably one of the best jokers and Keaton's Batman is a great Batman.Bad: The sound effects for the guns are pretty poor and I didn't enjoy the Joker's crush on Vicky Vale subplot nor did I find the prospect of The Joker murdering Bruce's parents that interesting or cool.Best Part: The whole scene in the Art Museum.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember going to see this as a kid when it came to our local theater. It was a rainy overcast day which made it perfect to see this movie. We had picked up t shirts that had Batman on them. This has been my favorite movie for over 27 years and continues to exemplify Batman. The action and dialogue are amazing. The film noir look is amazing and despite Batman's limited motion during fights it is still amazing. Jack Nicholson is an amazing Joker. He is the definitive live action Joker. It was unusual to modify the origin so that a pre-joker killed Bruce's parents but it still works. Their have been many other Batman movies but nothing compares to this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to comic books movies that are faithful to the source material but still appeal to a general audience, this one ranks up there as one of the greatest. When you combine the creative genius that is Tim Burton, with the fantastic acting of Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as the Joker, you get an epic masterpiece for all time. Released the same year as that piece of garbage, The Little Mermaid and making $222 million more at the box office, this motion picture has superior characters, a superior musical score done by the now passed on artist Prince, and a superior story of the Dark Knight going against the Clown Prince of Crime. For anyone who's a fan of the Caped Crusader, this is the number one movie based on the character to watch.</fullReview>

These movies were perfect for when they came out cause this was the first dark superhero film. It paved the way for superhero movies nowadays to be successful off their dark storytelling. I also love Jack Nicholson as The Joker. He manipulates the people of Gotham and constantly makes the audience on the edge of their seat with how insane he is.

		<fullReview>Batman (1989) Is a cult classic and is a must watch for any comic book related fan. Though today it is outclassed By the Nolan Films, Batman 1989 is really one of the best movies i've seen. Gotham City is dark, scary and depressing. Just how the comics have it. A city that is overrun by crime.Micheal Keaton is a wonderful actor. Both as Bruce Wayne AND Batman. Keaton Batman has this mystery feel to him, as Gotham City is trying to get a grasp on who this caped crusader is and why he's doing it. Wayne in this film seems innocent. Sure he's rich, but he is a kind, gentle and harmless. The exact opposite of Batman. Jack Nicholson is portrayed as the Joker. And as for him, The Joker in this movie is memorable. The times when your watching the film and you hate the villain for his action, but you find yourself laughing at the jokes they make even if you feel bad laughing at them, THATS what the joker is like for me. He is enjoyable even when he is scary.The soundtrack and sounds are the best part about the film. You see the Batwing Soaring through the sky with Danny Elfman's superb soundtrack. (Its the best soundtrack he has done in a very long time. I would like to highlight a specific scene when the Batwing flies up in the sky to line up with the moon, so it looks like the moon has a giant bat-symbol on it. The Batwing drops, and It makes a long scream like noise when it drops along with Elfman's fantastic score.The only flaw i have is some shots could've been better, and Gotham looks a little weird sometimes, but that's just minor. (Sorry if i'm nitpicking a little bit)Overall, BATMAN (1989) is a fantastic movie. With superb acting, musical score, plot, sound, special effects, you name it. This movie excels in everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is and always will be my all-time favorite superhero, and this movie is a perfect representation of the Dark Knight. Tim Burton created a masterful comic book world.Michael Keaton is a phenomenal Batman/Bruce Wayne. He portrays Bruce Wayne as cool and suave and portrays Batman as the dark, mysterious, brooding superhero that he is in the comics. The "I'm Batman" scene at the beginning of the movie is a fine piece of filmmaking.Jack Nicholson is absolutely incredible as the Joker. People are going to want to crucify me for this, but I think he is way better than Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker looks terrible, and he was just way too creepy for me. Nicholson, however, brings out a perfect mix of the comic side and sadistic side of the Joker.Kim Basinger is great as Vicki Vale, Bruce Wayne's love interest. Michael Gough as Alfred is fantastic as is Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon.The dark, Gothic atmosphere that Burton brings to Gotham City is unreal and just adds to the quality of the movie, as does the truly iconic music score by Danny Elfman.The movie also has great action. The climax in the cathedral is great stuff. There are also many great shots, such as the Batwing silhouetted against the moon and the final scene.This is a masterpiece of a comic book movie and a true classic by Tim Burton.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman (1989) Film Review by Adam GonzalezThe film that set the bar for future Caped Crusaders to come, the 1989 Batman movie directed by Tim Burton, starring Michael Keaton (Batman), Jack Nicholson (The Joker) and Kim Basinger (Vicky Vale) was much more "Dark Knight" than its predecessor's Adam West 1966 Batman TV series.The film is set in a time where Gotham City is overwhelmed by crime led by the Joker, a gangster turned madman after he falls into a vat of chemicals which leaves his face permanently disfigured with a smile. The only one who can stop him is Batman, the secret identity of orphaned billionaire Bruce Wayne. In the middle of all this crime fighting, Bruce falls in love with Vicky Vale, a photo journalist who attempts to uncover the truth about Batman.Micheal Keaton and Jack Nichokson set the bar for these two iconic DC comic book characters. Keaton managed to find the right balance for Bruce Wayne, the playboy billionaire and Batman, the vigilante crime fighter. He still, in my opinion of course, has the best "Batman Voice". Nicholson's Joker was magnificent. He owned the look of the classic Cesar Romero Joker from the 1966 Batman series, but added the sadistic humor that was needed for this dark film. Basinger was delicate and alluring as the heroine who gets trapped in the middle of this love triangle. And who can forget Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, played by the late Michael Gough, who raised Bruce and is the only person who knows his true identity.Tim Burton's Batman has always been the one that other Batman film's are compared too. They set the tone and trend for what a great Batman and Joker should be. So if you've never seen any of the Batman films before or have only seen the more recent Dark Knight films, then you need to do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Although Christian Bale and Heath Ledger did an amazing job in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, Keaton's Batman and Nicholson's Joker will always be the one that started it all.So now I ask you this, have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?</fullReview>

The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this film makes me think that I should hate this, but then I take a step back and think. This isn't meant to be realistic, I think it's meant to be a fantasy. The beauty of it therefore is the fact that it is a fantasy film about real life things, like love and responsibility. One of the other good things about Burton's Batman films are the lack of plot, it isn't necessary to dwell on why Bruce Wayne is Batman, or to develop overly complex plots that is one of the faults of the Nolan films. In some ways this film is superior to Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight as it gets on with it and it is really easy to believe in the world Burton creates, something that I thing he excels at. It some ways I prefer Nicholson's Joker to Ledger's I believe Nicholson to be a better portrayal of The Joker whereas Ledger is obviously a better villain, but not really The Joker as he should be. Michael Keaton gives us a better Batman than the modern Bale does, though I think Bale is a better Bruce Wayne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson puts in a performance for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman shows off his clever visual style, it just too bad the film hasn't aged well. It begins with Batman (Michael Keaton), a mysterious character known only to criminals and police, trying to help thwart a crime wave in Gotham City, which seems to be in a strange time warp combining the future with the '30s. It progresses and we learn that Batman is the crime-fighting disguise adapted by billionaire Bruce Wayne.Carl Grissom; a big time crime boss's "number-one guy" is a hood named Jack Napier (Nicholson); since Napier is making time with Grissom's moll Alicia (Jerry Hall), Grissom sends him on a suicide mission to clean out evidence at the Axis Chemicals plant. In a subtly ambiguous moment, Batman fails to save Napier from plummeting into a vat of acid, turning him into a permanent clown-faced bad guy known as The Jocker.Michael Keaton, though a reasonably good actor, I don't think was a very good Bruce Wayne and not believable as man swinging from building to building. Tim Burton is an imaginative filmmaker with an obsession for the visual aspects of films, but here it doesn't fit, there is a very Gothic cartoony feel to it and it just doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>atmosphere over action (warning Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film shows how successful comic book translations can be. Many critics complain that this film is all style and no substance. One must look closer to realize how wrong that is.To begin with, the first thing anyone notices about this film is the atmosphere. This film is joyous or upbeat like superman or spiderman. This is a dark, brooding, and beneath all this lies an anger that infects the main characters. Also adding to the atmosphere is the noirish theme and look to the film. Gotham city is a poeticly gloomy place and the characters are all in one way or another meanspirited.Michael Keaton is very effective as batman. The key to his performance lies in what the last 2 installments forgot about the batman character, that being the mystery ,sadness and anger the fills his character. If one where to look at his character closely, he is nothing more than a bitter vigilante seeking some sort of revenge for the death of his parents. While he doesnt get as much screen time as the joker, keaton still manages to create a character of great complexity and mystery. This leads to the joker character.Jack Nicolson isnt streching his acting talents. He plays a wildy over the top villian to great effect. He manages to be hilarious and terrifying at the same time. His character is really important in the fact that he contributes most of the meanspiritedness and anger that fills the film. His character has alot in common with batman. Both these men are creations of each other. Both are have a deep anger that lies beneath the surface. Nicolson did get the majority of the screen time but looking at the film, one cant complain seeing as how he is so entertaining. While his character is the most entertaining, he isnt as complex as batman.Tim Burton is a director in love with oddball characters. Looking at the film, the action seqeunces are not really that impressive when compared to films of the 80's like "Die Hard, Aliens and Lethal Weapon". What makes this film so effective again is the atmosphere and characters. There are 2 exceptions when it comes to lack of action in this film. The first being the batwing sequence simply because this is one of the few over the top sequences in the film. The other is the final confrontation on top of the church. This fight sequence between the joker and batman is very interesting. Keaton gives this scene a real psychological edge and we truly see just how much anger he has towards the joker. Nicoloson plays this scene for what it is on his part, a chance to go hilarously over the top.The only sore part to the film is kim basinger. While she is a fine actress, her character is simply there to fall in love with bruce wayne and scream in terror at the joker. While a film like this demands a character like hers, a little more depth could have been added.This film shows that by having a great sense of atmosphere and staying true to the comic book characters and even giving them some psychological depth, a wonderfully entertaing film comes about that for all intensive purposes should no be entertaining as it is seeing as how mean spirited and angry this film is. One should also realize that this is not a film for small children seeing as how violent it is. All these lessons were lost on the writer of the last 2 sequels who went for the goofy campy tone of the 60's TV series. What we are left with those films are hollow empty shells after seeing the first. It leaves one wondering how two fine actors like Val Kilmer and George Clooney could have been if the had been given better scripts.In the end though, I reccomend that you see this wonderfull film and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to assess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me that there was much potential with this film that went unrealised. While there are definite positives in the film; very effective set design, some fair visual ideas and the presence of some good actors. Veteran British actor Michael Gough impresses, but is perhaps underused as Alfred; he should have been drawn into the actual plot more I feel. Jack Palance I didn't particularly notice; it follows that an actor with his presence should have been used to the full. Nicholson however, is well used. You couldn't ask for much more in terms of portraying an insane, cartoonish character. Nicholson is, pretty much as always, enteraining when on screen, and plays the part of the maniacal "Joker" in a very appropriate larger-than-life fashion. Kim Bassinger at times is appropriate, but is too often sidelined into a stereotypical role. Michael Keaton as Batman, is rather too subdued and uninteresting. While I feel Burton's approach with this film - to show the similarities in methods between Batman and Joker while noting the moral differences - is a good one, it is not played as it could be, and the script is partly to blame. The script has some moments of amusement in the dialogue, but not enough, and more tellingly, the plot is all over the place. The narrative is nowhere near strong enough, and it's often left to the direction and photography to establish any kind of cohesive angle or mood. I did enjoy this film, largely due to Nicholson and the impressive direction of the visual side of things, but the failings in the script and in Batman's portrayal detract. One is left to ponder what might very well have been, with better use of the cast and a better screenplay.Rating:- *** 1/4/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best in-between Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Give Michael Keaton a break, his "Batman" has more substance than any of the pretenders to the throne, second only (in my books) to the inimitable Adam West interpretation of the swinging sixties. Keaton brings a relaxed poise to bear, in contrast to the intensity of Jack Nicholson's demented gangster turned scarface nemesis, the Joker. Burton's re-imagination of the classic crime stopper is a real movie, not just a stylised vehicle for celebrities like Val Kilmer or George Clooney to further inflate their profiles clad in superhero attire.From cinema-great Jack Palance to Hammer-Horror royalty Michael Gough, this is a standout effort. Jack Nicholson's Joker is pure ham and it's the right tone to pay homage to the "Batman" most audiences grew up watching. If you can't have Cesar Romero, then Nicholson's twisted psycho is next best. Sultry Kim Basinger was hot property at the time, and her intrepid reporter Vicki Vale is a competent and feisty leading lady between the contrasting styles of the leading men.Great supporting cast including Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Lee Wallace and Tracey Walter carry a lot of weight in their roles, more than enough to compete with the Nolan franchise, reinventing the theme again for a contemporary audience, and contrasting approach to the caped crusader capers. I know that a certain Mr Bale is flavour of the month, can add or drop weight as required to play a role, but Keaton emerged from "Night Shift", "Mr Mom" et al to play this important role and did so with tact and poise and deserves more credit than many reviewers currently pay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie hasn't aged all that well, and I'm not sure why. I was 8 when it came out, and I absolutely loved it. I saw it four times in the theater with my father, who loved it even more than me. And so last year I was stunned and appalled to find that several of my friends had never seen it - I dragged them to a video store immediately.Well, it's still entertaining enough; Nicholson is still great, and so is Burton &amp; Co.'s brilliantly deranged camerawork and art direction. But something's missing, and Batman no longer mesmerized me. I don't think it's the special effects - Ghostbusters, for example, has held up remarkably well despite its effects, which are now mostly laughable (and who wasn't terrified of those evil dog-monster-things at the time?).This could just be one of those sad cases where something is imitated so often that it no longer seems all that original, even if it was groundbreaking when first released. Or maybe it just needs a screen bigger than my TV's. Maybe you need to be in that late-80s mindset. I don't know, but if you're one of the thousands (millions?) of people with glowing childhood memories of this one, I'd recommend renting something else and leaving them intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once state of the art, now forever damned to stand in the shadow of Nolan's movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman" was one of those 80's movies that every kid loved, but me, I've never gotten round to seeing it in my own childhood. All my friends raved about this movie and had action figures, but the character of Batman just left me cold. I had never read any Marvel or DC comic books, and the 60's TV series was corny to me even then. When I finally saw Tim Burton's movie at the age of 12 (or something like that), I was disappointed. I had expected an entertaining dark, fairy tale-like flick in the vein of "Ghostbusters" or "Gremlins". While "Batman" shared the general feel of those movies, it never conjured the same kind of spirit. There were just a bunch of characters that I didn't know or care about, and Batman and his gadgets (the Batmobile, the Batwing, the suit, even the damn cave) seemed silly and childish.Now, more then 10 years later and after the franchise has been restarted successfully by Christopher Nolan, I have rewatched "Batman", mostly because I wanted to compare Jack Nicholson's and Heath Ledger's Joker. While I must say that Ledger's performance is much more interesting and will definitely go down in history as one of the best villains of cinema, it's unfair to say that Nicholson was worse. Sure, Jack just played himself, but that's exactly what he had been asked to do, and he did it well. There's a reason he got top-billing in "Batman" as the Joker steals every scene he's in. If his version of the villain is less intriguing than Ledger's it's the screenwriters fault.Anyway, everything about this movie is now damned to forever be compared to Nolan's popular reincarnation of The Dark Knight, although it is quite unclear which movie exactly this one should be compare to. Like "Batman Begins" Batman's origins are explained here, and as in "The Dark Knight" the Joker is the main villain. Truth be told, "Batman" is inferior to both of Nolan's efforts, but putting those movies up against each other is a bit like comparing apples and oranges.Burton stays faithful to the comics when it comes to Gotham's look, Batman's gadgets and some character's origins. However, Nolan's version captures the feel of a "Batman" novel much better, because the movie is more believable and can actually be taken serious. Burton's more playful approach does have its own merits too, though. It avoids some of the pitfalls that Nolan with his claims of hyper-realism fell into. This "Batman" doesn't waste so much time on telling how exactly Bruce Wayne became The Dark Knight. While it's fascinating to learn about that in "Batman Begins", it's also a bit too drawn-out and boring at times. Nolan's supposed realism also overlooks the fact that Batman is a comic hero after all. He may not have any superpowers, but the hits he takes, the gadgets he builds, the threats he survives are still impossible in real life, so when you try to make it seem otherwise like Nolan does, you can fall flat on your face more often than not (just the fact that a grown, tough guy will put on a suit with bat-ears is ridiculous, in my book).Burton has all the advantages of flamboyant, over the top comic book-action. Still, his "Batman" is slow and boring for the most part. Now, that I know some characters like Alfred and Harvey Dent, it's intriguing to watch their stories being set up, but if you don't know anything about them beforehand, you could care less about these characters. Michael Keaton's Batman is merely a weird guy dressing up and playing with stupid toys. The joker isn't threatening, just amusing. Vicki Vale, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is superficial and so naive and girlie-like, women would consider such a character offensive nowadays. There's not much to identify here and that's Batman's main flaw. It seems like a two hour ad for action figures.The director would improve some of these faults in the much better balanced "Batman Returns", and unlike Joel Schumacher's horrible sequels Burton's movies still hold up pretty well. There may be none of the philosophical subtext that Nolan's "The Dark Knight" is rightfully praised for, but there's plenty of mindless fun, and that's good enough. Fans of the Batman-comics can count themselves lucky to have two completely different, but highly enjoyable versions of their favorite hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great looking movie with nothing inside.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is the ultimate example of a movie I desperately wanted to like, but could not do so. The set's and designs are amazing, and they have proved to be very influential on countless films since this was made. That is the only really redeeming feature of this movie.The script is flat out awful. Some of the worst dialog in a major motion picture you will ever see. The Vicky Vale/ Bruce Wayne scenes at his manor are downright wretched. The entire "Dancing by the pale moonlight" stuff is pathetic, and the frankly weird need to try to tie Batman and the Joker together by making him be the one to kill Bruce Waynes parents, thereby "Creating" Batman is not needed, and severely strains the credibility of the movie.The casting, which some have praised, is even worse than the script. From the top on down, every single role is wrong. Keaton doesn't have either the menace or physical presence to play Batman, or the light devil may care attitude that is the face he is supposed to put on as Bruce Wayne. Nicholson was already too old to be playing the spry and limber Joker (Again not physically right for the role.) Jack had already played the same character at the end of The Shining, except with less makeup. Kim Bassinger is wasted as the slight love interest. Most annoying of all, this is right in the middle of the film career of Robert Wuhl, one of the most annoying, untalented actors to ever grace the silver screen. In this film he portrays himself, a fast talking smart ass who always seems out of place in every scene he is in.I guess its the best of the four Batman movies, but that is faint praise indeed. When compared to Superman, Spiderman or even the X-Men movies, Batman comes up far short of what a comic book movie can be. Hopefully the upcoming batman movie with Christian Bale will begin a move towards a Batman that fans of the comic books and the movies can all appreciate together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As kid growing up on Batman comics, I really hated this movie when I saw it when I was 18 yrs old. Stupid effects, terrible acting, awful sets, the Batman costume looked clunky, Michael Keaton was a miscast (he lends no weight to the role), and the script was ridiculously stupid. Oh yeah, and Prince's soundtrack was just out of place (and I'm a fan of Prince). Jack Nicholson was alright, but definitely grand standing the entire film. I never understood the appeal of Tim Burton...he's definitely not right for this material...better off directing quirky Pee Wee Herman movies or Sleepy Hollow. Thank God Christopher Nolan directed "Batman Begins"!!!! Now that's a freaking Batman movie!!! It will stand the test of time. Burton's won't!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday, I have watched a 1989 movie of my most favourite Hero in the DC Universe... Batman Done by Tim Burtin, Starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight himself... The movie is based on the Comics by Bob Kane, I own the Batman Motion picture anthology on Blu-Ray, But it's an high honour of me to Review this movie.After watching it, I thought it was a good batman movie, It might be an 80 movie but it's still a good movie, It was a big hit back in the day, Sure it might have some stuff about Batman wrong, But if you look through that stuff, It's a good movie, I enjoy it as it is, I'll review more of the Batman films in another point of time. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman for me has always been a bit hit and miss towards film, TV and ... well pretty much everything. And I have to admit this movie is kind of a middle standing option for that. I mean It's brilliant, It truly is a fantastic and awesome Tim Burton movie, which Is why I love It but I get the feeling that If I was a comic book fan more I'd probably loathe this movie. It messes around with pretty much everything from Batman's origin tale, screws up The Joker's characteristics (just to say I LOVE Jack Nicholson and his acting Is on point in this movie before you let the hate flow through you) and I don't know about you guys but Michael Keaton's Batman is just ... it's just perfect, as is his Bruce Wayne. Pity his career took a credibility hiatus between Jackie Brown and Birdman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I dedicate this review to Prince Rogers Nelson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a good 13 years since I last saw this, and it hasn't aged one bit. Jack Nicholson completely 100% nails the character of the Joker and you can tell he is really enjoying himself. The movie manages to find the perfect balance between campy, cheesy, and serious all at the same time. I know a lot of people try and compare this one to "The Dark Knight" as to which one's better, but they're both fantastic in their own way. This movie is more true to the comics in terms of how the characters are portrayed, and "The Dark Knight" is a more serious take on it. What I'm trying to say is, comparing this to "The Dark Knight" is like comparing apples to apples.Now if you were to ask me which one of the two I prefer, I would say "The Dark Knight". But Tim Burton's "Batman" is a very close second. And I know, people will still compare the two films lifetimes after I'm gone, but to me, there is no clear winner in terms of which is more superior. Both films are definite classics, not just in terms of superhero films, but cinema in general. If you want a more campy, fun, cheesy, yet slightly serious Batman, watch this. If you want a serious, darker Batman, watch the Nolan trilogy. I happen to love both. Also, since Prince did the soundtrack for this, I now have a review to honor him.R.I.P. Prince</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack as the Joker - spot on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Led by the dark vision of Burton, Batman appears on the big screen true to the comic book feel, but painted with shades of gray. Jack Nicholson plays a fantastic Joker, maybe the best maniac/mad hatter style ever done. Jack's performance is trying to achieve something much different than Heath's in the newest rendering. Heath did the demonic twisted Joker, Jack Nicholson turns in a performance more like the original TV show with added darkness. I really liked this 89 Joker after seeing it again for the first time in years. Keaton and Kim have a nice believable romance that is fun to watch when the action subsides. Definitely worthy of a re-watch for all the grown up kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before Ben Affleck, Christian Bale or even George Clooney donned the cape and cowl; Michael Keaton surprised and terrified audiences of the late 80's and became the first definitive Batman to tread in darker and edgier territory. And since then, no other Batman film has been able to achieve that perfect balance of comic book surrealism and gritty real world tone.It's hard to imagine nowadays, but before 1989 people would have scoffed at the idea of Batman being a "serious" superhero. The very name itself conjured images of the campy Adam West TV show which were full to the brim of clichés, montages and over the top action sequences. It seemed impossible up to this point that Batman could be the dark and serious crusader that we know him as today. So a group of talented minds came together and sought to create the realistic and gritty version of Batman that the character's creator, Bob Kane had always envisioned he could be. And they succeeded. Big Time.This success is due in part to three major components. The first being the look of Gotham city. In Burton's film, it looks incredible. Straight out of the pages of a comic book and transitioned flawlessly onto the silver screen. It's dark, stylistic and almost post-apocalyptic. My favourite on-screen version of Gotham to date. The second component that really makes this film work is Michael Keaton's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman. For years I've always been quick to jump to the defence of this version of the dark knight for a few reasons. The first being that Keaton did not have to change his voice to play an intimidating Batman. The second was that he portrayed Bruce Wayne in a very convincing manner. Humble, sophisticated, reserved but humorous when need be. The best use of his subtle wit is when he confronts the Joker in Vicki Vale's apartment upon being asked: "Bruce Wayne? N'est-ce pas?" His response is simply "Most of the time." And finally the third component that makes this film work is of course, Jack Nicholson as The Joker. Need I say more? Certainly not the most mysterious or intimidating Joker we've seen (that honour goes to Heath Ledger) but, his portrayal is my favourite because of how seamlessly the character transitioned from comic book to movie screen. He is completely psychotic, hilarious and oh so fun to watch. No one could have done it better.This film is by no means perfect. It certainly has flaws but most of which I can completely forgive because for me, this IS a believable Batman story because of how it's presented to us. I can wholly believe that Keaton IS Batman and Nicholson IS the Joker. The use of colours (or lack of!) make this Gotham look brutally dystopian. Striking visuals go hand in hand with genuine performances. And an absolutely thrilling musical score by Danny Elfman takes it all to perfection.This is my favourite Superhero film of all time so I do not take it lightly. And neither should you, because I firmly believe that Batman would not have nearly the same reputation as he does today if not for this dark and brooding resurrection of his character. If you're a Batman fan by any stretch, ignoring this film would be a dreadful mistake.</fullReview>

Once we got there I had no time to grab food/drinks it was sit down. It just started so I had no time sitting down in anticipation and I must have never blinked because I was immersed by the impact, live action and dark version (like the comics). and to me for the first time an interesting super villain. Batman/Bruce Wayne and joker were both creepy and peaceful all in their own right. The car was exquisite at the time and made me build Lego versions for a decade. Like I mentioned in another review that I cannot compare this and the later version to each other. One important factor is ya sure joker is more "cartoon" like yet I beg to differ. If you can remain completely yourself and "sane" looking (lack of better term here) and talk to someone you just singed slowly to death. Well speaks for itself at that point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the campy and outrageous 60's TV Series (and film),this was a revelation. Finally this was a much more serious and darker adaption of Batman (though it does get a bit bloody stupid at times) and Michael Keaton was an exceptionally good Bruce Wayne/Batman even though Jack Nicholson overshadows him which is probably not a good thing since the villain obviously should get less screen time than the hero. Tim Burton did a decent job of directing this film even though it tends to be more visually stunning than being able to tell a coherent story. Gotham looks like a noir 40's,dystopian city with endless skyscrapers beyond the clouds and it looks amazing. But the origins of Batman hardly gets explored except a brief flashback and The Joker gets more screen time than he deserves. That being said,Jack Nicholson perfectly portrays the Joker with his usual craziness and gleaming smile. Kim Basinger does a pretty good job with her character even though Vicki Vale is a bit of a damsel in distress and feels superfluous to the plot. Michael Gough is also a delight to watch as Bruce's fatherly like butler Alfred. In terms of the musical score,Danny Elfman's efforts are excellent but the bizarre inclusions of a couple of Prince Songs don't feel right in a Batman movie but I guess Prince was big in 1989. Overall this movie is very good but far from perfect. It struggles with character development and plot feels a bit incoherent at times but it's a great way to spend 2 hours of your time with if you've got nothing better to do I suppose. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action movies are filled with more exaggerated scenes each day as one might think that he is playing a computer movie. Batman, on the contrary, has so simple scenes so that you may focus more on the cast and the story. Just like light saber scenes in first trilogy of Star Wars is brief without any exaggerated choreography, even the fight between Darth Vader and Obi van Kenobi yet light saber fights are intensely used in 2nd trilogy. This Batman movie is great not because of millions of dollars are spent for complicated stories and high-tech shootings, but because of excellent Michael Keaton, Kim Bassinger, Robert Wuhl and legendary Jack Nicholson. I will keep on watching this movie throughout my life just to remember what a big actor Nicholson is.</fullReview>

The Theme of the movie is to always fight for justice and that one man can make a difference. In the start he is fighting off crime in the starts and trying the best he can to get rid of it. But then Jack comes along, a big time gang member is setting up a plan to steal money from a chemical plantation, then the Batman and the police show up. Batman and Jack start to throw fist by fist and by mistake batman throws him off a rail and into a pool of green chemicals and in the other side of the pool his skin is white, his hair is green, with a twisted mind, the Joker was born.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hailed as a classic, but oddly unengaging...and Nicholson doesn't help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I the only person who doesn't like this movie? I mean, everywhere I look I see undeniably positive reviews of this film. That not to say I didn't like it at all, as Tim Burton is a skilled director who always puts a lot of style into his movies which makes them watchable. But I'd much rather sit through X-MEN again than watch this over-the-top, overlong supposedly "epic" movie which is ruined by the dreadful spectacle of Jack Nicholson going way over the top, so far so that he actually ends up completely embarrassing as the Joker. I mean, sure he looks the part but damn, he doesn't know when to call it a day. Any scene with him in ends up being silly or cheesy in a bad way, and only Burton's pleasantly dark set design and concentration on the gloomier, more disturbing parts of the mythos make it possible to sit through this movie.Sure, there are good points. The big budget for one. This means that many of the special effects are impressive, there are lots of cool stunts and action. Burton has also assembled a large cast for his first major movie. Michael Keaton essays the role of Batman and is good as the eccentric hero. Kim Basinger is the love interest who fails to make much of an impact and just ends up being another female-in-peril. Also appearing in minor roles are Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, Jerry Hall and, of course, Michael Gough as the butler, Alfred. Genre fans of course will know Gough from his starring roles as usually a mad scientist in many low budget '60s/'70s British shockers, and again his character is a great one (shame he's underused like most of the cast).Another thing I don't care for about this movie is the running time - it seems to go on forever, with a number of drawn-out climaxes at the end so you think it's never going to be over. I don't know... maybe the sight of a man in a bat costume just doesn't do it for me. I've never been a fan of comic books either. I much prefer the camp delights of the original Batman movie over this one, no matter how cheesy it may be (and at least Cesar Romero was actually FUNNY as the Joker). I guess I'll just have to admit that this film is one of my "blind spots".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction/Action Classic and the best Original Batman film from the 80's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1989 Batman is the original Dark Knight and Tim Burton's Classic Dark Knight film. Jack Nicholson was well-cast as The Joker he was a wonderful in his lead role performance. Michael Keaton was just great as Bruce Wayne/Batman, he acted like the role of Batman was written on his skin. Kim Bassinger did a wonderful performance as her role Vicki Vale. I think Vicky Vale is very underrated character from all other female lead characters in all Batman films. Michael Gough did a wonderful job as the butler Alfred Pennyworth Batman's helper. Seriously Alfred for me will be always Michael Gough not only that he acted much better than Michael Caine did he even showed more heart and caring in the whole Batman franchise than Michael Caine did. The acting in this film is awesome, the character developments and the story plot are TERRIFIC! Michael Keaton caused an uproar when he was casted as Batman as fans boycotted the idea yet in Christmas 1988 when the trailer hit theaters the silence was shut as it was a nice teaser. This movie was the most hyped movie of 1989 as months audiences including fans had waited even with a second trailer that showed up in the spring of 1989 and merchandise was everywhere as it was the year of the Batman, hell even TV stations had reruns of the 60's Batman show to cash-in on the phenomenon. This movie opened on June 21st 1989 and became one of the highest grossing movies of all time and the biggest movie of the year earning acclaim and making Batman cool again just like Frank Miller and Alan Moore did. The Action and fights sequences were great and awesome. At least so much better than they were in Batman Begins (2005). It was my first Batman film I ever saw and this movie just absolutely Kick Ass. The Batwing that appears by the end of this movie is awesome by using to combat the Joker. When the Joker launches a deadly Smilex gas attack through balloons, Batman came in the Batwing and destroyed the balloons, angering Joker. Awesome! Batman then fired off several missiles and two mini guns, killing many henchmen but missing Joker, who in turn shot it down with one bullet from his long barreled revolver. The Joker Thugs are amazing. The main theme score by Danny Elfman was just amazing and really beautiful. I absolutely love this movie. I would never compare all other Nolan batman films with this masterpiece. Except The Dark Knight that it is the best Batman film. I will say it again this movie is AWESOME! The Batsuit designed by Costume designer Bob Ringwood who turned down the chance to work on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman was AWESOME! Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because "the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Gotham City, a big city where crime has been occurring lately and a mysterious caped crusader named Batman (Michael Keaton) is wiping streets clean of criminals, it leaves the police especially commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) baffled. A gangster named Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) was dropped into a vat of chemicals which leaves him disfigures with paint-like white bleached skin and ruby-red lips plus green hair which makes him clown-like as he now calls himself Joker, he begins to terrorize the city of Gotham and stalk a sexy photographer named Vickie Vale (Kim Bassinger). Bruce Wayne who is Gotham's richest man falls in love with Vickie yet she doesn't know his true secret that he's Batman, but can Bruce deal with romance and battling with Joker at the same time?Batman is a 1989 American superhero film directed by Tim Burton and produced by Jon Peters, based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It is the first installment of Warner Bros.' initial Batman film series. The film stars Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton in the title role, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough, and Jack Palance.The Dark Knight of Gotham City begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being the clownishly homicidal Joker.This is definitely my favorite classic Action film from the 80's it was always my favorite childhood movie and it will always be. The action scenes are just fantastic and how Batman saves Gotham City from the Joker balloons of a deadly Smilex gas attack was amazing. Beside The Dark Knight this is my second favorite film of all time of Batman. I will always love it to death! Michael Keaton will be the only Batman for me!:P.10/ 10 Grade: A+ Studio: Warner Bros.

		<fullReview>That's the real beginning of this Tim Burton of great fame. This film is absolutely crazy as for the tomfoolery, the ghosts, the people and the situations. It is off limits in all possible ways but it is great because this time there are two things that hold the whole story together. [?]TOM BURTON ? JACK NICHOLSON ? MICHAEL KEATON ? BATMAN ? 1989This new version of Batman was bound to rejuvenate the old story. It was intended to reopen the book though it was closing it in a way. Batman was not the flier we thought he was but he was only a very good acrobat who had very good weapons that threw cables all around and helped him get out of the muddy marshes of life right into the sky. At the end of his metal thread he looked more like a spider swinging in the wind than a bat, but let's say he was close enough.The main rewriting was not about that technical side of things. The bat mobile was not the great war tool it was supposed to be. It was awkward and did not play a great role. What's more the flier version of it ended down on the steps to the cathedral with Batman inside. Not very swift that bat mobile. But well you have to do with what you have and nothing else.The main rewriting was not the car nor the plane nor any of these vulgar means of transportation. The main rewriting was the girl who went through all kinds of traps, tricks, fears and frights in the hands of the Joker or in the hands of Batman. Luckily or unluckily she fell in love. The poor darling! In love with a bat, and they say it drinks blood. But at the same time that makes Batman a real man who can fall in love and have an adventure with a woman. Once again, in 1989 we were still very far away from Proposition 8 in California and the rulings of the Supreme Court in 2014 or is it 2015. It was so earth-shaking that we don't even remember the date.But Batman knows how to do it in style with champagne and luxurious British cars with the driving wheel on the right side, and door opening the way they haven't opened for now more than fifty years. That makes the film really attractive and the girl very remarkable since she is able to keep a secret. For a press photographer that is rather amazing. She cancelled her chance to get a Pulitzer Prize. You must admit love has no limits.I guess after a few winter nights spent in solitude and fear she might find the adventure less attractive, but well, we will cross this bridge when we come to it, shall we not?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Separates The Hero From The Villain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After this film nearly every comic property was being green lighted for production. Though it's often maligned for its lack of background on the title character it is worth noting that this is primarily inspired by the oldest Bob Kane, Bill Finger and Jerry Robinson stories of the Golden Age (Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore's The Killing Joke as well). If you have ever read them you will see that this is a great realization of the era of comics. One of my main complaints with the story is that, unlike 1978's Superman, this is not the Good vs. Evil mythology of American comic book tradition. Behind the facade of the fantastic adventure is the psychological conflict of the two leads (supposedly inspired by The Killing Joke primarily) which leaves Batman looking as bad as the criminals he fights (this was popular in the 80s.)Though Batman was a bit stilted in action due to the restricting costume, such were the times when this was made, a certain low-techness does suit this considering the timeless 1930s inspired look of the movie. This was the first comic movie to give us a surreal look to it without resembling a live-action cartoon. It's timeless and surreal look was seminal for the adaptations that followed.This movie is more of the comic on screen, in spite of its liberties with Batman's character on killing, than the Nolan films. Nicholson is as big and overthetop as the Joker from the comics has been. Keaton is as dark and arch as Batman should be (his Bruce Wayne was a different more distracted take, as if there is no Wayne identity or very little of one). Basinger was our Alice in this Wonderland and plays it very quotidian as if this is the type of world that inhabits these fantastic characters.The film has a nice slow pace that builds motivation for the excitement of its biggerthanlife action sequences, but falls apart around the 3rd act where the action really begins to sacrifice logic for affect. You could really tell this film was being rewritten as they were filming (as was the case according to Burton's book about his films). Danny Elfman's now classic music and Anton Furst's surreal Gotham City set carries the ending as though it were a silent film giving this movie an operatic feel that is exciting even when the action is questionable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Batman is a instant masterpiece. Yes today we are full of comic book films but Batman in 1989 was one of those films that really set the stage for what's to come. The film just does a lot right and Tim's formula to stay true to the characters really shows in this film.Our three main stars are Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger. Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne/Batman Now despite that he has done comedy films he actually shows he can play in a comic book film he does well as Bruce Wayne and he gives a present as Batman his performance is very well done and to this day he is still one of the best to ever play Batman.Jack Nicholson plays The Joker the film's main antagonist. Jack has always been a impressive actor and this film is no different The Joker here is very smart and a killer. He brings the Joker to life on the screen each moment he is on screen. A performance you have to see to believe.Kim Basinger plays Vicki Vale is a local reporter in Gotham Kim's performance makes her a convincing character. The film is full of unexpected moments that you have to see to believe The film story is dark and yet Tim makes it work for fans of Batman and honors it very well.The music is superb and it is so well done every piece of the music written for the film does a great job with helping each sceneBatman is just one of the best comic book films ever made and still remains impressive it also contain some of the best lines ever said in any motion pictureI give Batman (1989) an 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved Batman '89</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is gonna be short.I love BATMAN and this is the reason why I love the film. Jack Nicholson plays Joker and he is really amazing. Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne and Batman and he could not have been any better. Tim Burton's direction is just simply dark and gritty. Christopher Nolan would do this for his BATMAN trilogy, released from 2005 to 2012.The rest of the acting is really amazing including Billy Dee Williams and Kim Basinger. The screenplay and story stays true to the comics as well as the movie. The theme by Danny Elfman is one of the most memorable themes along with his theme for "THE SIMPSONS" is really cool and fantastic.The story of the film follows the comic nicely and I think it is really cool. The film is the best BATMAN ever, along with Christopher Nolan's DARK KNIGHT trilogy and it is really amazing and fantastic. The Batmobile and the Batsuit is really amazing and fantastic. The production designs are great as well and I give credit to Anton Furst, who also designed the poster.The editing is very amazing and the film is really well shot and very fantastic and credit goes to Roger Pratt and this film's run time goes by quickly and I have no problem watching both Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger's Jokers because there is no comparison between the two. Just like Joker, Christian Bale, Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer are the only three best Batman's on the screen ,at least until next year, when Ben Affleck plays the part in BATMAN vs. SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE.Overall, this is why I love BATMAN and it is definitely giving a 10 out of 10 because there are no major flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort of fun but not a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I like less the more I think about it. While viewing it I found it somewhat entertaining for some reasons, but something felt missing. After thinking about it, I realized what it was, and noticed more things that I didn't like that I never noticed while watching the movie. My biggest problem has to do with the character development. Most of all, the Batman/Bruce Wayne character. The problem with him is that we briefly learn that he has repressed his inner feelings about things like his parents deaths, but it is never really explored. We never get much of anything from him resulting in him being a very dull protagonist with little personality. I suppose Burton and the writers were aiming towards making him more mysterious and darker by leaving his backstory and his thoughts and feelings mostly hidden, and it works doing that, but the problem is that it makes him very hard to root for or feel any empathy for. On top of this, the balance between the protagonist and the antagonist is off. The joker, who we are not supposed to root for, is given more screen time and made a little more entertaining, which is probably why Nicholson, who played him, is given top billing. At times, I almost wanted to root for Nicholson because, although he lacks depth as well, his character is shown more and is more entertaining because he has a wild and seemingly unpredictable manner. Plus, Nicholson looks like he's just having a blast playing him. He's the only one who rises above the clumsy dialogue and thin characterizations to make a truly memorable performance.There is nothing special about the supporting cast. Some of them, like Harvey Dent or Commissioner Gordon, show up occasionally, but their characters do not have any impact on the overall story. So, if they were never in the movie in the first place, the movie wouldn't be any different. Kim Basinger plays Vicki, Bruce Wayne's love interest, who is very one-dimensional, and shares an absurdly lackluster chemistry with him that makes the romance hard to buy. They both seemed to fall in love very easily and just exchange generic dialogue. As for the story, I feel it suffered greatly from some of the things I mentioned above. For example, it spent a large chunk of time on the bland relationship between Bruce and Vicki. I also felt some things it was doing often tested the dark tone it was trying to have. For example, the joker going for Vicki because he's attracted to her. I thought that making the supposedly psychotic homicidal villain fall in love with her was just stupid. It would have been much darker and he would be more intimidating if he didn't care at all for her. Also, the jokers plan with the hygiene products was nearly as ridiculous.There are a couple things I'd like to still address that kept me somewhat entertained throughout, other than Nicholson's performance. That of course is the visuals. Burton, as always, is gifted at making bizarre and striking visuals, and this film is good evidence of that. Although some of the action scenes aren't very well shot and some special effects seem dated, it mostly looked great. The lighting was still beautiful, the batmobile looked cool, the buildings like the cathedral were well designed, and the costumes and make up were impressive. Another thing I really liked was the score. It was memorable and exciting, though I still wish it was put to better use by being in a movie with a better story and characters. This is one of those movies that I enjoyed just a little more than I feel I should have. It is a hollow film with lots of style and little substance. But, I'd still recommend it because it is cool just to see. Not only because of its visuals and Jack Nicholson, but because its interesting to see the iconic first batman movie that attempted to take a darker tone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, it might not have had the depth and quality that we saw from the more recent Batman films but for what it was in its time, it is an entertaining movie. Strong performances from the movie's trio of Keaton, Basinger, and Nicholson, also gave this picture a boost with Keaton making the role of Wayne/Batman believable, Basinger with the just right level of balance as Wayne's love interest, and Nicholson with a way over the top performance ( and that's a good thing ) as the maniac clown Joker. Nicholson clearly is enjoying his role as he laughs his way through the various and often disturbing acts that he commits, giving our hero Batman a tough job to do as he constantly finds himself trying to stop the Joker from slowly tearing Gotham City into pieces."He stole my balloons!" -Joker (Batman 1989)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman became a critical success and audience and ended up influencing countless other productions of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman finally gets a new live-action version in 1989 through director Tim Burton. At the time, Burton was not even that turned out. If today it is considered a chief revolutionary of aesthetics and styles themselves and established, before the release of this their first blockbuster he had only directed a few short films and TV movies. For the film had on your resume only unexpected success Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985) and even greater success Beetle Juice (1988). With the success of the latter, Burton was chosen by Warner to command the film.Even with a budget not so astronomical for the time ($ 35 million), the film became a critical success and audience and ended up influencing countless other productions of the genre and ushered in a new era unquestioningly productions, often for adventure and action, made with hitherto unimaginable budgets, mass advertising, big stars with huge salaries. The films had high probability of success and offering the viewer guaranteed fun, especially when your target audience (teenage boys).One of the points that make the film certainly be commended and have a space between the great icons of cinema is its art direction, that knew capture the essence of the place in which the protagonist was inserted and made something really shady with its dark lighting, filled with skyscrapers and gargoyles, smoky streets denoting further abandonment and danger around every corner full of prostitutes and bandits - and all this being further enhanced with virtually all outdoor scenes being run at night. This setting even served as a model for the creation of Gotham in "Batman Begins" director Christopher Nolan over a decade later.Burton climbed Michale Keaton to be his Batman. Not necessary to say that the choice has generated many complaints and protests from fans around the world. After all, Keaton had much less stature and physical strength to personify the hero of Gotham. Rounding out the cast had Michael Gough playing the legendary butler Alfred, a father figure in the life of Bruce Wayne, Jack Palance as the criminal Gotham, Carl Grissom, Robert Wuhl as reporter Alexander Knox, Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Billy Dee Williams as the new district attorney Harvey Dent (barely tapped off and it would have a more important role in Burton's next film, but that was deleted from the script of the sequence), and the beautiful Kim Basinger as photojournalist Vicki Vale, Bruce's interest, but that also ends up being the target unhealthy attraction of the Joker. All performances are correct and do not clash at any time.Already Joker to live, the ordeal was almost unanimous until that year when the double Oscar winner for A Cuckoo's Nest and Terms of Endearment, Jack Nicholson, was announced in the cast.One of the most consistent complaints of the fans is the excessive emphasis given by Burton to the villain. Joker has more screen time, carries the best scenes and has the best dialogs, and rightfully so their performance is remembered even today. Nicholson fact not agreed to receive a salary, and asked for a percentage of the merchandising of the film, causing it won $ 60 million profit, making it the highest-paid actor for a single job at all times.Michael Keaton on the other hand, even with advance reservations and criticisms from fans, manages to convey the painful baggage of his character, and the techniques of Burton with his game camera, always from the bottom up and focusing on the armor could give the magnificence required when the Dark Knight appeared on the scene.The fights in the movie are a theme of its own. The major drawback is the uniform of Batman, that reduced mobility. Burton chose to show on action scenes Batman always stopped, he parried every blow, moving as little as possible. Besides the action and fight scenes, Burton also slipped to exaggerate the supposedly comic scenes of crazy Joker. Some scenes are completely disposable and boring, as laughable scene in which we see a sign written "surgery" that leads to the basement with a kind of precarious medical instruments, blood on the walls and dim lighting. In addition, the scenes involving the Joker dancing, especially the invasion of the museum, as well as several random and forced him laughing.Impossible not to mention the soundtrack striking and not unjustly Oscar nominee Danny Elfman, present in all the works of Burton. Elfman composes a track intoxicating, contagious and dangerous weather goes perfectly Gotham while the adventure itself. It's a track that does not stop.It's a origin film, but that is seen on the surface, and the source of much of the character is not only omitted, as amended, especially in portraying the death of Bruce's parents by the Joker, with the sole purpose of strengthening the headquarters of Revenge Bruce and disappointing the most ardent fans. But apart from this fact, the film manages to be faithful to the comic and please, generating sequences later.Burton managed to present well the character and show who is Bruce Wayne / Batman, and create a visual pattern to more serious films and dark superhero categorically. Batman got great box office and contributed to increased sales of the magazines of the character and the popularity of the character. It is rather a good movie and well worth the interpretation Jack Nicholson becoming an icon among the villains for a long time, and the technical aspects already mentioned. Being a production well made for its time, shows a good restart to be the Dark Knight on the big screen movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Readers, let's Broaden our Minds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was with considerable excitement and great fanfare that the Caped Crusader returned to movie screens in this 1989 Tim Burton effort. Aided by the darkest tone yet seen in a superhero film, a brooding Michael Keaton and an enormous performance from Jack Nicholson, it was a big hit and spawned a franchise.Unlike the only other really successful superhero film we had to go at the time, Richard Donner's Superman, Batman does not get bogged down in origins. We learn, through flashbacks well into the film's run, that Bruce Wayne saw his parents murdered by Jack Napier when he was a child, and this led to him becoming a vigilante. How he learned martial arts, developed weapons, and ended up with a bat obsession is anyone's guess. The police and media are trying to work out what to make of stories of this weird guy jumping around wearing a batsuit, kicking ass and killing criminals, and so are we.What Burton does focus on is Nicholson, understandable given that some estimates have Nicholson being paid upwards of $60 million for his appearance by the time all the box office and merchandising receipts were cashed. This is the Joker's origin story, a sleazy mob enforcer, horribly disfigured and driven mad after being betrayed by mob boss Carl Grissom. Nicholson is equal parts menacing and funny. He is a sadistic, unstable force of nature who commits atrocities and then laughs about it, including one scene where he makes a TV commercial featuring people he has killed promoting a poison he's unleashed on the public. Not a light character, but a lot of fun to watch.Against this kind of insane evil, we need a hero to get behind, and playing off Nicholson's enormous performance, Keaton provides a strong adversary. Disturbed, brooding, but driven, this is a man who will kill for the greater good and hold evil accountable. He's no Elliott Ness, but by the time the final confrontation unfolds, we know where he stands and can get behind him.The supporting cast, while somewhat wasted, are all welcome. Specifically Michael Gough as Alfred, the Wayne Family Butler. Kim Basinger is a typical damsel in distress as Vikki Vale, Billy Dee Williams is criminally wasted as Harvey Dent.I've often heard people say of this film that it is not dark and doesn't have Batman in it enough. I'm not certain they watched the same film I did. Nicholson's Joker is a frightening creation, perhaps even more frightening for the humour he indulges in as he commits acts of considerable evil. And, while this is Nicholson's film, Keaton is too good to simply fade into the background.One can argue that the Batman in this film is not the one from the comics, I'd disagree, but it has been argued. But one can't argue that the film itself isn't an entertaining and timeless entry into the superhero genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's first outing into the world of Batman was moderately successful. I do think that it's the best live-action Batman film until Christopher Nolan took the reigns but it's not without its flaws.I liked the pacing of the film. It was fast which helped keep the film interesting by avoiding having many scenes that felt pointless and unneeded although there were a couple. Having a fast pace and a story that remains coherent and compelling is an important balance to hit when making a superhero movie because fans want to get to know and get inside the heads of their favourite heroes but they also of course want to see the action. I think Tim Burton managed this. I also enjoyed Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker. The casting choice was great as at the time of production Jack Nicholson had already proved himself to be a good psychopath as Jack Torrance in The Shining so he portrayed the Joker with ease.I did have some problems though. The most prominent of which were my issues with the script. To me it seemed like the writing of the script was rushed and therefore some elements of the story and the development of some characters seemed rushed also. And there were a few noticeable plot holes that I struggled to ignore. Also I had some issues with Burton's direction. With him at the helm of the fight scenes it made them quite disjointed and it was often hard to follow what was happening. The direction of Batman also wasn't handled very well. At multiple points in the film we saw Batman simply walking around, whether it was down a street or up a long flight of stairs he would simply just walk places with no sense of urgency so the character wasn't as dynamic as he should have been. Plus seeing Batman waddle around in his uncomfortable rubber suit really emphasised the fact that Batman is really just a rich guy in a suit. Instead we should have seen Batman disappearing into the shadows and then suddenly reappearing to surprise his enemies which would have kept his reputation as the Dark Knight intact. As a whole though this movie pleases fans of the character and casual views will also find enjoyment throughout most of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now This is Michael Keaton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me a little while, but I finally got through to doing this review. From the first time I heard those words, 'I'm Batman', I was hooked. As excellent as the cast was, the entire franchise was resuscitated by one, Mr. Tim Burton. Holy Jeepers, this guy grabbed this not-very-superhero; erased embarrassing (but funny) TV memories and transformed him into the first on-screen 'Dark Knight.' Michael Keaton took the roll and became 'The Batman.' Is he the best? Subjectivity will rule on this. I personally think this roll belongs to Mr. Keaton (even-though there are some very strong seconds.) He did not have all the flash-bang afforded to the latter versions, but he did have that ideal on screen presence, personality and charisma ? lacking in later models. And who is the best 'Joker?' That is very tough. I do prefer Jack Nicholson even if Heath Ledger was probably the scariest. Mr. Nicholson is more of what one would expect from the comic-books; while Mr. Ledger is something you would expect to find in the deepest, darkest confines of some asylum. Nicholson's portrayal was scary; Ledger's was disturbingly scary. All in all ? if I can see a movie over and over and have fun doing so, I consider it a success. I liked this movie better than most 'Batman' movies, and will continue to sit and absorb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary, a great direction for Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* The thing about this Batman movie is that, it's good, it really is, and this is the movie Batman needed at the time, since most audiences still thought of the Adam West Batman. Now though... we've had Nolan's epic trilogies. We've had a better Joker, we've had a better Batman, and we've had better action, and a better story, so this movie is sort of eclipsed by the Nolan movies. Still though, this is a good movie. Michael Keaton, though criminally underused, is a great Batman. He's got a lot less screen presence than you'd expect, he's sort of quiet and subtle. Bruce never really jumps out at you, but when you think about his character, you realize how great he is. Joker on the other hand, chews up nearly all the screen time, and Nicholson delivers a very funny, and very memorable Joker. I do like him a lot, I just wish Keaton got to do a bit more. Kim Basinger plays reporter Vicki Vale, Bruce Wayne's love interest for this film. She's actually one of the better love interests in superhero films, because she actually gets a character defined apart from Bruce Wayne, and is more memorable than a lot of the other girlfriends in comic book movies, even though she only had one film. Now let's talk about the action a little. As I said before, we have better Batman action now, but I'd still like to give this action a big thumbs up, because it brings some much needed realism to Batman. The only downside is that the way it's choreographed or whatever, is really slow. In some action scenes, people just stand there while Batman whips out gadgets. It's still good action, it's just that now the action scenes have become a bit more refined and flashy, making these just look a little bland. Now, one thing that isn't too great, is that there's never the classic Joker pushes Batman to his limits, tempting him to kill. No, Batman's okay with killing. He doesn't try to do it, but if it happens, then, no big deal. I don't mind a different take, and while I do think this version is interesting, I just think that they lost a really good dynamic. The story also is pretty...chaotic. I know that's how Joker's supposed to be, but falling in love with Vicki Vale because of her picture? Seriously? I do like Joker killing Bruce's parents, and I like his Joker toxin or whatever he uses on people that he keeps trying to distribute, and I like the pseudo mystery around Bruce's past and Batman's identity, even though everybody already knew the secret to both. In the end, Batman may have lost a lot of the charm it once had, but it's still worth revisiting every now and then to see and older and different take on Batman.</fullReview>

Tim Burton wonderful dark mind too the campy side and turned it into the nightmare, the dark creature of the might. Gotham's hero. With a brilliant cast including Oscar winner Jack Nicholson they bring you the batman film everyone wanted to see. With some the best villain in comic book history the joker unleashing terror on Gotham. The dark knight is the one and only one to stop him. As many have called this the movie of the 80's it really was. Burton and co bring you a film full of terror, action and laughter. 26 years on and all ages still love this film and rate it along the best of the batman franchise some consider the best. Take a journey to the dark city of Gotham and find out for your self if batman can stop the joker?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was 3 so I have a bit of nostalgia but this film is NOT FOR ME. Now that I read the comics I see so many problems first it was Joe Chill who killed Batman's parents and in other retelling a random thug hired by the mob never the joker, now I know this probably works for the film but as a fan I don't enjoy it. Second batman KILLS, Batman did kill in his 1st app and later issues but that was in det comics 27 1939 and the the early 40s and then after that he stopped then in Dennis o Neils run and Scott Snyder as well as early frank miller we see that batman never kills witch shows that hes different from his criminals. Third I don't like Vikki vales character the script made her so annoying and when Kim b. Is given a good script she does a good job and the other character that sucks is commissioner Gordon the whole reason for the character is to have a good relationship with batman their like the 2 people who work together they have respect for each other and help out. Fourth I don't like the joker my fav live action joker is still Cesar Romero in this film its jack n. Playing himself which I hate. Thats all my problems rather then that its a movie for all ages and if you don't Reed comics you'll probably like this I do like how they stayed true to the original comics and modern where its dark and serious and Gothic. I say give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton Gives a very imaginative superhero film that gives a new meaning to saving the day.First a little background. Back in 1926 there was a film called The Bat about a killer who wears a bat costume and mask. This film inspired Bob Kane to create a superhero named Batman. There 2 Serials on Batman One titled Batman in 1943 and the other titled Batman And Robbin in 1949. Then in the Sixties came a Batamn show starring Adam West And Burt Ward that ran from 1966 to 1968 which spawned a Batman movie titled Batmn The Movie In 1966. But Batman Fans decided that it was time far a more serious Batman film. And they got just what they wanted.In 1989 we were given a very dark and grim Batman movie that told the back story in grim detail. Batmans back story on how he became Batman was that he was going to a play with his parents but a crook, Jack Napier robbed and shot his two parents leaving them for Death. Now to over come his fear of bats Bruce Wayne played by Micheal Keaton dresses up as a bat and calls himself Batman fighting crime all throughout Gotham City.He then meets up again with Jack Napier played by Jack Nicholson and drops Jack into a vat of acid making his face have a permanent smile. Jack then puts on a little makeup and calls himself The Joker and wants to spray everybody with a gas that causes you to have a permanent smile.Finally Bruce gets into a relationship with Vicki Vale played by Kim Basinger. Bruce really wants to keep his secret but just can't because deep down inside he truly loves her.This is by far one of the best superhero films since the original Superman The Movie in 1978. This film is just filled with a terrific cast and an excellent story. If you love comic books and superheros you are going to love this movie.Rated PG-13 For Intense Stylized Violence, Some Language And Sexual Innuendo.2hrs 6min/126min.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goddamn Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not taking anything away from Nolan's interpretation, Tim Burton's Batman remains the definitive (cinematic) Batman to me, and this first film remains my favorite superhero film of all times. In retrospect, Burton's approach seems like a sort of middle ground between Nolan's dark, gritty realism and Schumacher's colorful camp; rather than try to make Batman realistic, Burton focused on the mythological and surreal aspects of the character, and in his hands Batman was the mysterious and violent figure he was originally conceived as; casting 5'9" comedian Michael Keaton turned out to be a brilliant move that perfected that image, because Keaton was the only actor ever who managed to make it seem plausible that not one of Bruce Wayne's acquaintances realized that he's Batman; Keaton's Wayne and Keaton's Batman were two entirely different people, which made the transformation all the more startling.Batman is just one of three stars in this cult classic. The second one, of course, is Jack Nicholson, whose casting as the Joker was considered almost too good to be true. Burton's take on the Joker, and especially his origin, was unusual and controversial among fans of the comics, but Nicholson played the part with such terrifying and insane conviction, that it was impossible to resist. He was hilarious one second and frightening the next, making for one of cinema's best villains. Nicholson's Joker was different than Heath Ledger's, not better or worse; while Ledger's Joker was a sociopath anarchist, Nicholson's was utterly and truly insane. It's up to you to decide which one was more dangerous.And the third star, naturally, is... Gotham City. Burton was the only director who gave Gotham the respect it deserved and gave it life - Burton's Gotham was Gotham, not a desaturated Manhattan. Gotham is why the movie received a very well-deserved Oscar for art direction; Burton created Gotham as a surreal world of skyscrapers and gargoyles, and it's an image that showed its influence back in the comics as well as the various animated adaptations.Tim Burton's Batman is one of the very few superhero movies that allowed the characters to keep their surreal, colorful weirdness without looking silly or campy. Batman's world is entirely unreal, but the dangers and violence are very real indeed. The Dark Knight succeeded in throwing Batman into our own world; Burton's Batman is the one true film to take place in Batman's world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Batman" has so many strengths and so much going on in it at all times that it never seems to matter so much that the titular character is a little shallow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When surrealistic and avant-garde director Tim Burton made his first Batman movie in the close of the 1980s, he started a superhero movie fashion that has continued clear to the present. Since this film, gone have been the days where superhero movies were shiny, elaborate, and cheery. Now they are shadow-laced, even more elaborate, and dark in nature. And you know what? That does seem to be the best route, especially for a character as nihilistic and inhuman in appearance as Batman. After all, there isn't really a completely goodhearted personae coming from a character standing six feet tall with spike-like ears, a shielding mask, and an assortment of weapons resembling his namesake.Mr. Burton's movie pits Batman (Michael Keaton) against his most popular opponent, the ever-smiling chaotic Joker in the gloomy streets and corridors and museums and bell towers of Gotham City. The Joker starts out as a mob-employed hit-man (Jack Nicholson) who in a struggle with Batman, pummels into a vat of acids. When he emerges, he is psychologically damaged as well as physically and goes on a wild spree through the city...all for the fun of it.This "Batman" has so many strengths and so much going on in it at all times that it never seems to matter so much that the titular character is a little shallow. That Mr. Nicholson is constantly more engaging, more funny, more entertaining, and more interesting as the Joker. As the sinister, ever-smiling villain, Mr. Nicholson is packed full of energy and enthusiasm, playing his mad part to the hilt in a way that is quite joyful. That there is one of Mr. Nicholson's successes as an actor; he loves to act any part and one can feel that personae any time he's on camera. As the titular character, Mr. Keaton is also in fine shape and his mannerly and manipulated performance works in a very subtle way. It really shows the talent of the actor when he has a small part to play and so little dialogue and yet manages to get off so much more in his performance. The scene where Mr. Keaton visits an alley where a traumatizing event happened to him before really demonstrates his skills, for he emits so much emotion while actually containing it.How this guy has yet to receive an Academy Award nomination is beyond me.So "Batman" has two good pawns opposite the chessboard, even if the villain completely upstages the hero. Moving on to its greatest success, there is the art direction. Even when compared to the great sets and architecture used in Christopher Nolan's two recent Batman movies, this Gotham City still presents the greatest artistic achievement. Director Burton and his team realized that Batman was something of a fantasy, part of an alternative-reality and therefore it was fitting to give it an alternative-reality feeling. It's almost like a nightmare from Salvadore Dali. And there are only two surrealistic directors who could handle this material so well. One is David Lynch ("Blue Velvet," "The Elephant Man," "Wild at Heart") and the other is Tim Burton. The payoff really shows, as he coordinates his camera with precision and inventiveness so that we can always see the elaborate sets as well as appreciate what is happening in the foreground with the characters.This is still, as far as I am concerned, the best of the "Batman" pictures. It's got the best villain, the most suitably Gothic tone, the most engaging set design, the most entertainment value. With great supporting performances by Kim Basinger, the late Michael Gough, Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, and Robert Wuhl (who looks and acts like Joe E. Brown impersonating a police officer) that movie holds up very well. Some might expect a stronger, more out-there hero, but as far as I am concerned, "Batman" plays all its necessary parts to the right level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good start to the original four Batman movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This particular series of four films would end up being kind of a mess, but it had a good starting point. This film would chronicle Batman as he fights crime in Gotham as an emerging villain does his best to throw it into chaos. It is not really an origin story as you will not be seeing Batman training or designing his costume. At the start of the film he is Batman and there is already word of him on the street. You will see Joker being created in a manner of speaking in this one, but not like would be typical in future comic book films. This film features Michael Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne and as playing the characters I say he is second best to Christian Bale. However, no one so far has played a really good Batman/Bruce Wayne yet in any of the films so far in my opinion. So far the best version I have seen comes from the animated series, just hard for a real person to be both characters. Michael Keaton is actually rather good as Batman at times, but sometimes it just seems he is kind of off when delivering a line as the caped crusader and one thinks of Beatlejuice or Mr. Mom, and one should be thinking of neither while watching Batman. As Bruce Wayne he is okay acting the part, but he absolutely does not look the part. Still, after him Val Kilmer and George Clooney would make anyone pine for Keaton to return for the sequels. Jack Nicholson plays the Joker and he does a rather good and insane job often carrying the film. There are not all that many scenes of Batman in this film, however, this limited use of the caped crusader would only make his limited appearances more special, the highlight for me when he and Joker meet in the museum/restaurant that ends with a great chase with the first incarnation of the Batmobile in a serious movie and the best of the original three. It even rivals the one used in the last two films of Christopher Nolan. The film is not perfect, however, as the Joker in the comics is an anarchist and here it seems to often that he is under control and has a plan. From what I understand there are parts cut out that would have helped define him as more the anarchist type. The Batsuit looks way to constricting in this movie and will in the remaining four of this series and you can see that the fighting is very limited here, with Batman exhibiting limited movement and the less said about the use of Prince on the soundtrack the better. Still, the musical score that starts with the opening credits is very good and for the most part so is this Batman, certainly the best of the original four which are supposed to be interconnected, but nearly every one of them has a different tone as we go from this one which is dark to the second which is dark and Gothic with odd bits of humor, to forever which is a bit lighter and more colorful to the fourth one where they get back to almost 60's television style with stars dying to be in the films as it appears they were not trying to make a good film, but rather it was just a party or something. Started good and I think it could have been a pretty good set of films had Burton and Keaton stayed on board, granted I was not the biggest fan of returns, Burton most certainly never would have made anything close to resembling four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reviewer from New Zealand has a great review on here and I agree with every word. This movie is my favorite movie of all time. You had to have seen it back in 89 to understand how brilliant it was. I was only 4 and I could tell it was a masterpiece. Every second of Elfman's score matches what you see on screen brilliantly. Every time you see Keaton's grin under the mask and that awesome batman logo on his suit it is a treat. This movie still has the best bat suit ever. It is so tough and rugged. Batman return suit was OK but 89s is still the most scary. In batman 89 you always have the perfect amount darkness around the suit to male it look perfect. Visually it is the most appealing movie I've ever seen up there with Psycho and Vertigo. Also Keaton has the toughest portrayal of batman. He stands up and boxes his enemies in a street fighting style which makes sense because all conflicts take place in "street settings" it is so satisfying when u see batman get to beat the crap out of Nicholson at the end and drop have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight. When batman spreads his wings at the beginning and that Elfman music kicks in it gives me chills. And of course Nicholson is amazing. This movie also works in the gangster genre. It angers me how good it is. Finally i would say the visual style is timeless. This movie was made in the late 80s but i see no 80s influences other than the cars. It will always be the 1940s in that world. Warner bros hiring Burton was genius. Great art direction, music, costumes, action, acting, and overall vision of batman there will ever be. I've watched it over 100 times and i never get bored with it. Burton has described the movie as operatic and i think that is really fitting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Batman" was a franchise that hadn't seen the light of day since the 1960's with the Adam West and Burt Ward television series/movie. But in 1989 Tim Burton brought the dark knight out of retirement and rebooted the series with Batman. This new rendition stars Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (aka Batman) and none other than Jack Nicholson as The Joker, one of the greatest Batman villains, if not the greatest. Batman tells the story of how The Joker came to be and then pits Batman, who is still a fugitive running from Gotham law, against the homicidal maniac who is hell bent on taking over Gotham city. Throw Tim Burton's unique visual style and you've got yourself quite a compelling Batman tale.Now, I had seen this movie so many times as a kid, and I always remember loving it. But it had to have been at least ten years since I had last seen it. A lot of things have changed since then, the most significant being the release of Christopher Nolan's Batman reimaginings. I hate to make the comparisons, but it is virtually impossible. Burton's Batman is a lighter and more animated Batman story, compared to Nolan's dark and gritty Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. After seeing what kind of serious potential the Batman story and mythos has via Nolan's telling of the story, it makes the more cartoonish and silly Burton Batman pale in comparison. Batman is a dark character with a tragic story and very deep and psychological auras surrounding him. Nolan captures this perfectly with his films, but Burton doesn't delve nearly as deep in Batman.But all that being said, a man like Tim Burton isn't one to really go that psychologically deep into his films. Instead, he enjoys making unique visual experiences for his audience with all sorts of compelling style to his visuals. And he does this very well in Batman. We see all of the familiar quirky camera angles and and robustly animated tracking shots full of the dark colors we are accustomed to seeing in Tim Burton films. This is a Batman film through the highly recognizable Tim Burton lens, which is something different for Batman, but I don't know that it is something I'm a huge fan of. I love Nolan's dark rendition of the series so much that Burton's view of the aesthetics of the superhero franchise sort of miss the mark for me. He does it well but I prefer Nolan's depiction much more.Aside from the visuals, the best thing about Batman would have to be Jack Nicholson. His depiction of The Joker is spot on for the style this Batman film encompasses. Once again I'll have to make comparisons to The Dark Knight, and once again I'll have to say that I enjoy Heath Ledger's Joker more than Nicholson. This, once again, is because it suits me infatuation with the dark and gritty. Nicholson's Joker is much more clowny than broodingly serious, but I can't deny that he pulls of homicidal maniac very well. I didn't doubt for a minute that Nicholson's Joker was a brutal killer who is very mentally unstable. But the way Nicholson pulls off these moods is much different from the way Ledger did it in The Dark Knight. That being said, they are both incredible actors and each of their Joker portrayals is excellent in its own way.Batman is a good film, but it definitely feels more like a Tim Burton film than an actual Batman film. Nolan has shown us what the Batman franchise is capable of, and so Burton's take on the series now seems a bit lackluster. But there are some uniquely great things about this film, but overall I was nothing more than entertained for two hours. This is an enjoyable film and it's always great to see some well made Batman action, but that is about all this film has going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comic book come to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action packed? Yes.Fun? You got it.Realistic? Who cares? At first, I was going to tell you how disappointed with the original Batman, but then I remembered: It's a film based on a fantasy comic. It plays by a different set of rules. Sometimes no scientific explanation is required when it comes to certain plot points. For instance; the Joker's face. What's the deal with that? A botched surgery in a dingy basement? Sure. A chemical reaction? Why not. The point is, it doesn't matter.I was also going to tell you how disappointed I was with the unrealistic violence, but then I remembered: It's PG-13?and for good reason. What would have been the point of making Batman 'Restricted' when most of the audience was in the 10-15 year-old age range? Sure, Batman appeals to all generations, but in order to bank the maximum amount of money at the box office, a PG-13 rating made the most sense. That means you're going to see plenty of violence, but little to no actual bloodshed. I thought the script and direction did a decent job dancing between the adult/underage audience with the chiefly dark atmosphere but rather tame dialogue and carnage.The original Batman certainly isn't the best of the series, but it's a decent start and holds its own. The Tim Burton influence is acute and recognizable. The special effects are rather phenomenal for the time period as well. Watching the Batmobile's shield activate is quite astounding. It's hard to believe that effect was accomplished in such a crisp manner in 1989.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman has been the biggest superhero without super powers since his classic debut in 1939. He has had countless TV shows made about him and Batman movies are STILL being made after almost 70 years of being one of the world's finest superheroes.Tim Burton made a dark stylised movie in his classic Burton-esque style that everybody has come to love since. It has the dark atmosphere of a horror movie and the suspense of what else, Batman. The character's stories are so suspenseful it's amazing what they can do with one character. There were elements of the Dark Knight Returns comic, and the nature of Batman: Year One.Highly recommend it for anyone who loves comic book movies and Batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic that started the superhero 'crime-saga'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting from this film and ending up with latest's like The Dark Knight, a person wonders why the Warner brothers fired the inclusive and creative Tim Burton....He WAS the best man for the job! Nonetheless Nolan is doing a DAMN good job on his latest adaptations of the crime/superhero saga.Batman the film, is unmissable, its also one of the most under-rated films i've seen! The film exceeds thoroughly in every aspect except for a few 'flaws' of its own. Burton literally created a spectacular world of his own with his dark and thrilling settings. He did such a good job that I got sucked into the universe of diversities....Acting is top-notch, Nicholson is perfect as the chaotic and crazy Joker. Keaton also does a good job in place of Bruce Wayne/Batman. Supporting cast also remains at the very lest decent...Overall, Batman is a classic that I can watch over and over again, because of the spectacular/intriguing sets, grasping direction, and excellent performances. Don't listen to the critics, because they underrated this film for no real reason!'The instant classic doesn't beat The Dark Knight, but it's remarkably a great use of time and money'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman's first return</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In which Tim puts the Goth and Jack puts the ham into Gotham City. Director Burton rightly re-does Batman as a solo night-time crime fighter, with Gotham City as his bleak but monumental backdrop, haunted by the memory of his parents' slaying in front of his childhood eyes, even re-writing Bat-lore by making their assassin The Joker in an earlier incarnation as a young hoodlum before his metamorphosis.The story centres on both the main protagonists desire for beguiling photographer Vicki Vale which makes for a straightforward conclusion as both fight for her atop a church tower, rather than giving the Joker some world-domination schtick. In fact if it wasn't for the fact that both the mains are costumed characters, the plot would play very well as a realistic crime-thriller.But we do love those costumes and all the accoutrements that go with them. The Batmobile is sensational, especially when it cloaks itself in armour and while I missed the old Bat-cave, director Burton I think draws a pretty good line at what he allows in from the comic-book origins. Certainly Robin wasn't missed.As for the casting, I really like Michael Keaton as Batman / Bruce Wayne. His gamine appearance at first seems too slight to be our muscle-bound hero until you realise it's his costume which beefs him up. Kim Basinger is fine too as Vicki Vale, sexy but credible. I have long had a problem with Jack Nicholson's acting, all ham and no bone. Here he gets all the best lines and gets to dominate screen-time and while he gets some terrific scenes in which to extemporise (pretty freely I'd say), he never looks like the Joker should and in fact just looks like Jack Nicholson with a manic grin, in fact just make that Jack Nicholson.Better I focus in the plotting and cinematography which are both excellent. The story moves forward credibly at all times plus I liked Burton's sly references to other Hollywood classics like "White Heat" (very apposite, here), "Vertigo" and even "Gone With The Wind", which in itself reveals the director's ambition. The set design is eye-popping, Gotham looming out if the blackness like El Greco's Toledo, while the interiors of Wayne Manor and Vicki Vale's apartment are sumptuous.On other fronts, I didn't feel Prince's music belonged in the movie at all. Quite who thought pop's fey-est character tied in with the darkness here is anyone's guess. All that said, this was a terrific update of the Batman character, wiping the slate clean from the camp 60's version.</fullReview>

I love him as Batman, but I'm glad he didn't get to stick around for the last two films. Nicholson's Joker is great, don't compare it to Heath Ledger's though, they are two completely separate performances. Jack was crazy, comical and I didn't see any cartoon in him really, okay maybe at times. The love connection could have been better between Kim Basinger and Michael Keaton, it didn't keep me as interested as I would have liked. Keaton as Batman was dark, and as Bruce Wayne was very suave and witty. Jack Palance was strange to see here but I enjoyed it all the same. It was very well directed and scripted with a great set, all in all, a great Batman flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my ideal take on the hero, but Burton's dark and atmospheric Batman is a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's dark vision of a comic book superhero. No blue and gray tights, no Robin the Boy Wonder. Burton creates a timeless Gotham City, a sort of 1940s/1980s hybrid; an occasionally spooky place of smoke and shadows. The movie seems to take some inspiration from old gangster films and classic horror movies. The mysterious Batman instills fear into criminals with his phantasmic theatrics (similar to the ideas in BATMAN BEGINS).Michael Keaton doesn't look like the kind of person who'd play a superhero, but he does a good job in the black rubber suit. As Bruce Wayne, he's fine as a kind of distracted eccentric, but he just doesn't *look* like the Bruce Wayne type (from the comics).Jack Nicholson gives an excellent performance as the Joker, although he's not exactly how I picture the character. While wonderfully off his rocker, it's hard to get past the square face and familiar voice of movie star Jack Nicholson and see the playful Joker from the Batman comics. Despite this gripe, there's no denying that Nicholson is wildly entertaining in this role.Kim Basinger is okay as the girl, photojournalist Vicki Vale. I don't think she added much and there's something about her eyes (the makeup?) and '80s fashion that I never really liked.At the time BATMAN was made (1989), the only other major superhero films were the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, which are obviously an entirely different animal. ("Truth, justice, and the American way" and all of that.) The last appearance of Batman in the public's consciousness (not counting the comics and cartoons) was the campy 1960s Adam West TV show. So Warner Bros. took a risk allowing a young Tim Burton to bring his darker vision of the Caped Crusader to the screen. The risk payed off, as Batman always had dark undertones and viewers were excited to see the hero brought to life in a serious movie.BATMAN is not my ideal version of the hero, but it's a good interpretation of the darker side of his mythology. (It might be a little scary for kids.) After a recent viewing, I found I liked the film more than I remembered. It has a nice atmosphere and Gotham City is well-done. There are many memorable moments, brought to you by Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, or director Tim Burton. Danny Elfman's musical score is outstanding. Again, while not ideal in my mind, the film holds up pretty well. (Except for the dated Prince songs.)7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton creates light fun in dark superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crime in Gotham City has beaten the police force and the residents must rely on a masked man who attempts to resolve the problems with a man driven by chaos.Now 20 years old, Batman remains amongst fans the film that redefined superhero genre, and it sure has all the wham bam action to cement it as a true actioner, made memorable through a dazzling Jack Nicholson, courageous score and that what is now renowned as typical Tim Burton darkness.These last 20 years the Batman series has changed quite dramatically. From Burton's original batman and Batman returns to what have been labelled the franchise killers in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Then a brave and clever Christopher Nolan revitalized the comic book legend in batman Begins and The Dark Knight that have slashed box office records all over the world and made Bats cool again.This being the first set the benchmark for what was to come. Tim Burton, the brilliant director opened the door to his Hollywood fame by creating a dark setting for a story and including a colourful and often humorous script to coincide with the superhero. Burton's ideas for grandeur are never understated and he goes for the complete knock out effect. The parade scene at the end of this film echoes charisma and an unashamed approach to spark a feeling of disillusion to the hearts of Gotham and the misleading portrayal the Joker is leading here cements the director and actor at the top of their games.Before the Dark Knight was released last year there were doubters questioning Ledger's casting as the king of chaos. But through some startling physiological method acting the Australian actor created the first Oscar winning performance in a Batman film. And the tables have turned from when Nicholson showcased a sensual showcase of bravado and madness as his turn. But look closely here as Nicholson's typical grin and confidence shine through and some delicious phrases earn him a good reputation as one of Batman's arch rival.The fact that Batman himself is barely apparent in this film is to the scripts advantage. Like Lecter in Silence of the Lambs you crave for more but are not rewarded and the character is therefore better because of it. Appearing to fight crime and look cool in cars and planes make the superhero stronger and project coolness.What the film lacks now is the advantage of modern technology. The Dark Knight proved explosions could be better and lighting could establish a more effective setting. The pacing can occasionally slow to a halt and having The Joker talk too frequently hinders the character's madness.Batman is a highly likable film where there are no holds barred with Burton's ability to create lightness in his darkness and with bravado cast this is good enjoyment.</fullReview>

Even in Good morning Vietnam, his humour didn't come close to funny, I am hoping he's doing something else other than acting. Keaton was great as the batman, also Jack Nicholson who is my all time favorite actor. Since The Shining his career went so far skyward it's hard not to imagine this guy winning two Oscars in his life time. Kim Basinger was very lovely in this film too, her unique persona that led to her investigating Bruce Wayne to be the Batman was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm the guy who usually sees the original movie after watching the more modern, new release. I saw the Dark Knight, and I decided to watch this movie from the Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989 - 1997. I have to say, this movie was pretty awful at first, but as the movie progressed, I learned to respect it's aging graphics (but still pretty old during their day) and it's Joker, which is very silly. The death of the Joker wasn't much for me. I was hoping to witness a laughing Joker, as he said, it's better to go out with a smile. Well, he didn't go out with a smile. He went out screaming.The scenes of Gotham were pretty dark, and made thins feel messy throughout the movie, but that's how movies were in 1989 so I will respect that. Batman's actor, who was not fit, not skinny, not overweight, not obese, but in between them all, wasn't really kind of the guy I was hoping to see playing Batman. I was hoping someone of the sort like Adam West. The smirks of Batman in the beginning really bothered me, because I don't really think Batman would smile a little.. even at all, if he was trying to save someone from falling down a building. Very bothersome.Through all of the aged effects and acting and scenery, I learned to love this movie, and I am ready to watch the next one really soon. You have to admit, the originals will always be better if you watched it first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Batman film wasn't the best in the series. it wasn't exactly the worst either. It was a good attempt to make a Batman film. Batman is far from being Tim Burton's best, it's probably his worst. Besides Planet of the Apes. The Batman films, to me, got better and better as they went on. I know Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever wasn't as serious as the others. But in the old Batman films, Batman Forever was my favorite. But enough about the Batman series. This is my review for the original Batman film.I did like the original Batman film. I think it was way too damn serious. I think that the performances in the film were good. Of course, I only mean Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton. I suppose Kim Bassinger was alright also, but there are really no other people in Batman. The problem with Batman is that it's way too serious and there doesn't seem to be that much excitement. There is more action in the last half hour of the film. I did like Jack Nicholson's Joker, but I think that his Joker just seemed way to zany and less scary and evil. He had more fun playing him than we did watching him. I'm not saying he did a bad job as The Joker, but he's no Heath Ledger. Batman, despite some of it's flaws, works in some way. The Plot: Batman is a masked vigilante that fights crime at nights. When he accidentally lets go of a criminal named Jack Napier, Napier falls into boiling acid. Napier comes out and looks like a clown and starts killing people.He names himself The Joker. Batman A.K.A. Bruce Wayne is in love with a news reporter and The Joker soon does too. The Joker is planning something diabolical. So Bruce must save Gotham and his girlfriend and stop The Joker before ti's too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman, Burton style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Friday night, in April of 1990, a young boy, around five years old, sat down to watch a film. This was a film that he had been anticipating seeing for almost a year, his eagerness to see it augmented by a love for an old 1960's television series and a comic book he always had his mother buy him. When he watched this film, in the company of his aunt, he was a changed boy. That old television series would never be the same, his love of the comics would be cemented throughout his childhood and his list to Santa Claus that year would feature every piece of Batman merchandise under the sun. The film (if you hadn't guessed) was Tim Burton's Batman and to this day remains one of my favourite films of all time. Yes, Christopher Nolan's reboot is a work of genius as well, in many ways an exclusive piece of work from that director in the same way this and Batman Returns are to Burton, but, and it may be the rose tinted glasses I wear anytime I watch this film, or the fact that I was very young and the film represents a rite of passage for me, this film will always be my favourite of the Batman movies. Sure, Nolan's are more realistic, get better reviews and universally popular, but there's something about the inherent Gothic quality of Tim Burton's direction and style in this film, the psychotic humour and quirkiness of Michael Keaton's rendition of Bruce Wayne and Jack Nicholson's tendency to got over the top that he ends up pretty much higher than he really should that I really respond to. Then there is the batmobile. Yes the tumbler is good and it turns into a batpod, but let's be honest, Anton Furst's design for the Batmobile in this film is sleek and cool as hell.The look of the film is quite simply wonderful. Gotham City is truly a wonderful looking hell hole of Gothic proportions. The art deco architecture, the smoky, noir like back alleys, Bruce Wayne's beautiful mansion and hi-tech batcave, the Notre Dame like Cathedral, Burton and production designer Anton Furst have truly made Gotham into a living, breathing and plausible city and none of it was filmed on location, instead using the whole of Pinewood Studios to create their vision of Batman's world. Yes, Nolan may have used Chicago, but Burton's Gotham has imagination, although thankfully he never allows it to become as ghastly as Joel Schumacher.Then there is Michael Keaton. I'm not going to compare and contrast Michael's performance with Christian because actually I think there are many similarities, but focusing on Michael Keaton he brings a lot to the plate as Bruce/Batman, a lot more than many of his critics claimed at the time. What I love the most about him is how much of an emotional mess his Bruce Wayne is, incapable of claiming his love to Vicki, his inability to tell her he is Batman and his constant need to push her away makes this version of Batman a very complex individual, but one that is layered with some beautiful humour and a possible psychotic undercurrent ("You wanna get nuts? Come on, let's get nuts"). If a brooding nut job is going to dress up as a bat, I can really guess it's this one. Sure you can tell when he is or is not wearing the suit in the action sequences, but he has where it counts and his is a performance you can never forget. Just look at that haunted look as he remembers the reason he became Batman.As for Jack Nicholson. Well, people still talk about him to do this day and it says something about how memorable a performance it is when nearly twenty years later it's still viable enough for comparisons to Heath's rendition in The Dark Knight. Heath's maybe the anarchist, but Jack's is a cackling killer, a psychopath with a grin who may not have the relevancy of the current incarnation, but is just as dangerous, mainly because Jack's Joker is funny when he is at his most psychotic. This adds up to a nice comparison with Keaton's Batman as the two characters through fate and destiny become the architects to each other's origin tale, a lovely storytelling stroke that Burton mines for all its worth.I suppose its wrong to compare the movie to The Dark Knight as both are vastly different films set in extremely different universes (I feel really bad now, I really love The Dark Knight), and I guess my love for this film is offset by, as mentioned earlier, nostalgia, but I love this film, I just love it for the dark look, the gadgets, the action sequences, the effects and the Batmobile. My God is that the greatest car to appear in a film, or what? I guess you could say my love of films really started here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nowadays, all talk is centered around Christopher Nolan and his cinematic interpretation of the "Batman" comics. This is perhaps well-warranted; Nolan not only captures the essence of the Dark Knight as his world, he also reinterprets it for a new generation. Does the success of the Nolan films "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight" mean that we should forget about this 1989 film by Tim Burton? Not at all.This film still holds up after twenty years. There's no wonder why we still watch "The Wizard of Oz" or "Star Wars"; some films are just timeless. And while this film may start becoming outdated (in terms of special effects, etc.), it shouldn't be forgotten that when it was first released, it was simply revolutionary. Before this film's release, the general public's view of Batman was Adam West -- he's fun, he's adventures, but he's still goofy. This was a far cry from the comic books of Frank Miller and Denny O'Neal, who sought to return the Caped Crusader to his dark roots. But Tim Burton's "Batman" changed all this by introducing to the general public the idea of a Darker Knight. And boy is this film influential! This started the trend of making dark Batman films. A popular cartoon ("Batman: The Animated Series") was created because of this. This movie also introduced the all-black, rubber suit (instead of using gray and blue/black tights), something used by prospective films, and is still used today with "The Dark Knight." Burton added darkness into Batman cinema; Nolan took it a step further. Without Burton, there'd be no Batman films today.Burton has an interesting vision of Gotham. While not as realistic as Nolan's, Burton's Gotham is still gritty. Here you have street gangs, corrupt cops, and lowly street thugs. There's even some profanity here. Adding to this is a mixture of 1980s clothing and technology with 40s/50s fashions lifestyles. The Art Deco buildings blend well with the Gothic architecture. Here you have an atmospheric feel, a dark, brooding mood, a mixture of realism and surrealism. It's like you're in a comic book brought to life...yet at the same time, you're in real-life.Michael Keaton is still great as Batman. He has presence, capturing the brooding nature and elegant style of the Dark Knight. While I'm not a big fan of his socially awkward Bruce Wayne, Keaton truly makes you believe he's Batman. He uses two distinct voice for Batman and Bruce Wayne, and he still delivers shivers at the "I'm Batman" scene in the beginning with the quiet, raspy, and simply haunting voice of his.Some may have complained that Batman is underdeveloped as a character in this film, and not much attention is focused on him. While this may be true, the film actually benefits from this. Batman is mysterious, lurking in the shadows, the way he should be, and the decision to limit his scenes perfectly captures this. And besides, this is supposed to be Batman's first appearance, and the mysteriosity works very well. I especially loved portrayal of Batman as a urban legend -- a great introduction indeed!Jack Nicholson is still a great Joker. While not as frightening as Heath Ledger, Nicholson's Joker was very evil and very twisted for that time. Here's somebody who turns his assistant into a living work of art, causing her to commit suicide later on, shoots his boss fanatically while enjoying every minute of it, and tries to kills everyone is Gotham; this is something that no pre-Nicholson Joker would ever do! And boy does Jack steal the show. His tone of speaking and mannerism and a joy to watch, and he has some of the best lines in the movie -- just as delightful to listen to as Ledger's.And who can forget that iconic score by Danny Elfman? It is simply beautiful. It was nice to listen during that scene with Batman and Vicky Vale on the Batmobile as he drives through the night, and the finale in the end is an even greater joy to listen to, with Batman perched on a rooftop with the Bat signal in the sky. That is a scene that gets stuck in your head, and there are perhaps many more in this film. Tim Burton is a master of visuals, and that is clearly shown in this film."Batman '89" was one of the biggest-selling films of that year, and today it's one of the most successful films of all time. It and "Superman '78" helped shaped the superhero movie genre we know today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have the original Batman motion picture epic, and I won't waste your time: Is it good? Yes, of course it is; did you really have any doubts? Tim Burton's dark, gritty comic book world is flourished with a punchy, direct set of action sequences and a heart-warming romantic subplot that is executed with class and finesse. The whole package is really one of stunning sleekness, always moving at a fast pace and never failing to amaze.Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton are at top form here, with Keaton in particular being the best Batman ever to grace the silver screen by a long mile with his subtle emotional nuance and flawless charm and execution, and Nicholson...well, you get the idea this role for him was like a dream come true, a catharsis of sorts. He gets so into it, and you really start to respect him for it. Even when he comes off as crazy as a hatter, which is most of the time.The action scenes are simple and not too flashy, but they work well and are definitely easy on the eyes compared to something like Terminator Salvation, which damn near made me deaf and blind in the theater. The story is excellently told, simple and snappy, never trying to over-complicate itself, although there are a few points where it seems to stumble over itself and move too fast for its own good - like the entire first quarter or so, as good as it was.And there WERE some things here I didn't like, like how they made the Joker the guy who killed Bruce's parents. What the hell? That isn't how it works; that just ruins the whole idea of the Batman in the first place. He's not a character out for revenge, he's a character who protects people because of what happened in the past. It just...doesn't gel well at all.So that's Batman - entertaining, dark and easy to enjoy on all fronts, well deserving of the perfect score. Is it better than The Dark Knight? I'll just leave the verdict out on that one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No matter what, this Batman is A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's 1989 mega blockbuster 'Batman' is one of the best superhero films of our times. I've seen this film, at least 10-12 times, and I never get bored of it. The film created a frenzy during its box office run and became a cult favorite. In honest words, Burton's 'Batman' is cinema at its very best. Pulses: Everything. The way Burton has shown Batman, no film ever has. The action sequences, the witty and memorable dialogue and most of all the masterful performances: Michael Keaton is by far the best Batman ever, he's a legend. He looked like like Bruce Wayne and justified Batman like no one has to date. Jack Nicholson's Joker act is masterful. Kim Basinger looked so alluring and delivered such a fine performance.Miunses: None.On the whole, 'Batman' is the best film of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Is Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and most original 'Batman' of the series, Tim Burton's darkly Gothic drama set a standard for which others have strived and failed.From the very outset you know it's going to be rather special. The camera pans gradually around some gloomy, unfamiliar canyon-like edifice whilst music wakens from deep, ominously whispered string-cords that tantalise briefly before steadfastly growing to a full-volumed crescendo. The visual and aural imagery are perfectly choreographed to suggest a frightful revelation, whilst the structure is disclosed to be the 'bat' insignia. If ever IMDb were to establish a 'TOP 250 Intros'; this must surely be in the first ten.The movie segues to a Gothic Gotham City in the evening, where honest working people are outnumbered by the hookers, pimps, touts, muggers, beggars, alcoholics and sundry loafers who litter the pavement and make travel by anything other than cab all but impossible. It's an urban nightmare that - for an increasing number of citizens in any city today - is already fast becoming reality.A young couple are ruthlessly murdered in front of their child. That child will grow to be the eponymous vigilante.One of the many arch-villains against whom Batman is pitted in the comic-books is the joker. Here we see him as a henchman, lieutenant to an ageing criminal baron, and maintaining an extremely dangerous liaison with his boss's moll. Jack Nicholson is our man, perfectly cast in a role that is surely made to exploit his special talent for excess. He is handsome and fearless and only waiting for a chance to inherit the empire.He and Batman cross swords for the first time, and in the conflict Nicholson's man falls into a vat of chemical. He escapes capture but is horribly disfigured. And so begins their grudge. This is heightened when Batman realises that The Joker is the very man who murdered his parents many years before.Nicholson, now 'The Joker' on account of his disfigurements, eliminates all opposition and stages a coupe. He sets about a reign of madcap anarchy.There are wonderfully contrived confrontations, and set-pieces to die for. Keaton is as ideally cast as our handsome, virile, borderline-psychotic hero as his manic adversary. Camera-work and sound/music score are crafted to perfection. Lighting is invariably gloomy and threatening. Burton has abolished the sunshine. And you feel the dismal, claustrophobic influence. Special-effects are as good as you could wish - there was no CGI in 1989; directors had to use their imaginations! Two scenes let the movie down, I think. The domestic sequences involving Batman's blonde journalist love-interest and his butler's cheery confidences are needlessly schmaltzy, time-consuming and tend towards a hole in the plot rather than a breathing-space in the action. Likewise, towards the end; The Joker kidnaps this young woman and takes her to the belfry of Gotham cathedral. Here, he engages in a lengthy and rather camp ritualised dance with her that seems to serve no other purpose than to fill a predetermined time-slot. It drags, and is frankly rather boring. Small as they are, they obtrude so much that I've docked a point for each.Otherwise it's a tense, exciting audio-visual fest with values that stand the test of time against all its later incarnations. Everyone puts in a decent turn of acting and there are some nice little one-liners in an above-average script.Still highly recommended. Be sure to have a good sound system (mine offers 400-watts) and don't miss the intro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Tim Burton could create a comic-style world for Batman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton did an excellent job when he brought Batman to his dark but colorful world. Burton's success relies on nightmarish settings, dark characters with a wicked sense of humor and behavior, and terrific music. All these elements were given Burton's treatment.Batman faces his number one nemesis, The Joker who is played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. His portray as the villain is wicked, evil, and somehow funny at the same time. Batman isn't a dark figure but still Keaton's performance is strong. The comic-style performances suit perfect for the movie. The same happens with the score and cinematography.The most memorable scenes have to do with The Joker: first when he kills Bruce's parents, and then when he dies. This is by far one of the best action heroes movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to the ambitious vision of director Tim Burton, the blockbuster hit of 1989 delivers the goods despite an occasionally spotty script, giving the caped crusader a thorough overhaul in keeping with the crime fighter's evolution in DC Comics. Michael Keaton strikes just the right mood as the brooding "Dark Knight" of Gotham City; Kim Basinger plays Gotham's intrepid reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson goes wild as the maniacal and scene-stealing Joker, who plots a takeover of the city with his lethal Smilex gas. Triumphant Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst turns Batman into a visual feast, and Burton brilliantly establishes a darkly mythic approach to Batman's legacy. Danny Elfman's now-classic score propels the action with bold, muscular verve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is Batman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Avoiding the laughable approach of the 60's TV show, Tim Burton has crafted a visual achievement. 1989's BATMAN, Tim Burton's revisualization of Bob Kane's dark comic book hero finally gets the right treatment. A dark resonant version, with a more human character to the hero, something that old and campy 60's TV show refused to be (along with many other things). Although this BATMAN is not free from flaws, and it has dated more than a bit, it's still better than it should have been. This is doing the job right.Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne and alter-ego Batman with real emotion. He makes the characters human and hero side with reality. Co-stars Kim Basinger plays (one of) Bruce's girlfriends Vicki Vale, Robert Wuhl portrays the nosy tabloid reporter Knox who Vicki works for and Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough and Jack Palance (in a cameo) provide bit roles.Hell, but the real stars are Jack Nicholson's menacingly eccentric performance as The Joker and Burton's grand style. Nicholson's portrayal as The Joker is both menacing and over-the-top, but the overall effect is great, and often hilarious. Then there's Tim Burton's focus on style over substance. The script leaves much to be desired but Burton's style makes an adequate distraction. Although somethings are wrong with the script, looking how Burton is in control on the film's wonderfully dark and gloomy style are satisfying. Production designer Anton Furst (who died after the film's completion) takes great pain at providing a perfect film noir-ish atmosphere in his stylish version of Gotham city. Although it's often shot in the dark, they still provide beautiful scenery.It's not a great Batman, but a very good one. Batman movies have been made the way this BATMAN was made, and that's good. So, thank God Tim Burton showed up in time to give Batman the right treatment.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't expect better out of any other superhero movie other than "Batman." Michael Keaton was excellent as the dark knight. I also enjoyed Jack Nicholson as the notorious Joker. Tim Burton did a really good job with this one; he departs from his quirky style of film-making and becomes an action director with this. My only complaint about it, however, would be that they should have focused more on Batman rather than the Joker. It seems to me that if you're gonna call a movie "Batman," then you should focus on the title character rather than the villain. But who am I to say? I'm sure that a lot of others enjoyed it very well for what it was. But it's still a good movie, regardless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's version is a good attempt at making a Batman movie, but it's not the perfect bit of film making that some people on IMDb make it out to be and the Christopher Nolan version is much better.Batman in this movie is a mysterious vigilante, with many people, including the mayor and the police unsure what to make of him. At the same time gangsters were powerful in Gotham, one of them being Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson). Already the film differs from the comics because it gave the Joker a real name. After an unsuccessful raid at a chemical plant Batman was unable to save Napier's life. However, after falling into a vet of chemicals Napier became the Joker and takes over the crime empire of Gotham and does sadistic acts against the civilians of Gotham. At the same time Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) starts to have a romantic relationship with Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) and showing that he dislikes the pretends of wealth and wants to live a simple life. As the film develops the Joker ends up doing a number of criminal acts and Batman has to stop him. The body court does raise during the films, especially during Gotham's bi-centennial celebrations. The film climax's with Batman and Joker fighting on the top of Gotham Cathedral, and finding out that Bruce Wayne's parents were killed by Jack Napier. This differs from the comics because Bruce Wayne's parents were killed by a random petty crock and shown in The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and Batman Begins. The filmmakers were trying to show that the Joker created Batman before Batman created the Joker.Batman was a good film, they were good scenes in it. I liked the begin when you see Batman straight away. In superhero movies now you have to wait to see the hero, e.g. Spiderman, Batman Begins and the Hulk. Most of the acting was good and Tim Burton has a good eye for set design, making Gotham seem a grim place. However, Batman doesn't seem to be real, and made during a time when superhero movies were seen as fantasy, and compared to now most superhero movies are trying to be made as realistic as possible.I have a few problems with this film. Firstly I didn't like it when the movie differs from the comics a bit, but I can live with it. My major problem was that I felt that the movie was still a little cartoony for my liking and does have some really stupid things liked poisoned make-up that TV presenters were prevented from wearing it and the Joker shooting down the Bat-Jet with a Smithen-Western with a ridicules long barrel. This movie was also an excuse from Nicholson to ham up his performance. I also felt that Keaton gave a decent performance, but I felt that he wasn't big enough or good looking enough for the role and that Christian Bale was better. However, the movie was good in attempt to avoid being like the God-awful 1960s show and was a good bit of film making, showing Burton's potential. It is still worth watching, as long as you avoid the Joel Schumacher version of the films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotham City was made for Tim Burton. His Gothic, unique style is the perfect setup for the film that started it all. There are a few scenes where the action or the sound feels a little too gimmicky and cheap, but these are very rare and don't really distract from the rest of the film aside from a few brief seconds. The casting choices have one incredibly perfect decision and one vitally poor one. Casting Jack Nicholson as The Joker was the best move they could have made (though it appears that Ledger is going to knock his performance out of the water). He adds another dynamic performance to his repertoire. However on the opposite side is the dreadful decision to make Michael Keaton the symbol of terror that is Batman. This geeky little idiot isn't right for...any role in a major film, let alone Batman. All I could think while watching his scenes was how much Christian Bale demolishes any other Batman in history. So overall it's certainly not Burton's best film, and it pales in comparison to Batman Begins and more than likely The Dark Knight but it's still solid fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark, dark superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a lot of ways, Tim Burton's 1989 film version BATMAN of the comic-book hero is the ideal interpretation of the Batman world. The film has a wide variety of elements that has been the mark of many great films over the years: action, humor, darkness, psychosis, colorful sets and scenery, and most importantly, a sense of pure fun and enjoyment, which is what movies should be about.Michael Keaton's Batman/Bruce Wayne characterization portrays the character as an avenging angel, a complex, dark, sad, lonely soul. Really, to this day I believe that Keaton is the best Batman in movie history. We already know why the character is like this: he watched his parents viciously murdered as a child and therefore was traumatized by the event and thus developed a need to act out on his innermost demons in an all-too-real manner by donning Batsuit, cape, and mask to fight crime in the streets of Gotham City, not just for justice, but to also take revenge on the type of scum and villainy that led to his parents' demise. Keaton completely embodies all the necessary mannerisms, emotions, and traits.Batman's nemesis in this film is Jack Napier AKA The Joker, played to scene-chewing perfection by Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is given a lot to do in this film, much more than Keaton, and totally makes the most of it. The Joker character has a ton of memorable, great throwaway lines ('Where does he get those wonderful toys?') that help to make this film a classic. I remember a lot of people saying that Nicholson 'stole' the movie and weren't crazy about Keaton's Batman when it came out. But it isn't his fault that Nicholson was given the majority of the dialogue and screen time. And, guess what? In hindsight and after the dreadful Schumacher continuation Batman flicks, NOW a lot of people think that Keaton is truly the best! But Keaton HAS ALWAYS BEEN the perfect choice IMHO.Bruce Wayne's love interest is reporter Vicki Vale, played by Kim Basinger. Basinger's Vale in this film may just be the most gorgeous character ever in the history of film. She is unbelievably beautiful in every scene in this film. Definitely adds to the scenery! What I like about the Vicki/Batman dynamic, as opposed to say, Lois Lane and Superman, is that Vicki Vale is not infatuated with or in awe of Batman, but scared of him just like every other Gotham citizen, which is a REALISTIC reaction!The extreme darkness of BATMAN in no way diminishes its entertainment level. It is a very entertaining film, in large part because it is a highly original telling of a comic book story. While it explores the superhero as a dark, tortured person, it does not devolve so deeply that it detracts from the plot and pace of the film. There are several key character interactions, but Burton takes the minimalist approach and only have these characters interact when absolutely necessary without talking down to or preaching to his audience.A good example is that, rather than overload us with one big scene of all Batman's "wonderful toys" where everything is spoon-fed to us, we get to see each gradually as the film progresses and only when the situation calls for it. There's a sequence of scenes in the middle of the film, which includes the first confrontation between Batman and Joker at the museum, that is representative of this plot device, and these scenes are at the core of what makes this movie so great.And, as alluded to before, it is a very dark film, even scary at times. Batman in a lot of ways is as scary and dangerous as the Joker, but you need someone who thinks like the Joker to beat him at his own game. And there are a lot a darkly comic moments that may not be so funny to everyone.The set design and art deco style used for the city landscapes and buildings, inside and out, are very unique and give the movie an otherworldly feel to it, almost it's almost happening in another time and place than the present, but yet the movie has a very modern feel to it. Also, special mention must go to Danny Elfmann's impeccably original score that truly provides a great background theme for the film's hero. Fine supporting work is done by Robert Wuhl (as Vicki's fellow reporter Alex Knox), the great veteran character actor Pat Hingle (as Commissioner Gordon), the legendary Jack Palance (as Napier's mob boss) and the distinguished Michael Gough (as Wayne's butler, confidante, and sidekick Alfred). My only complaint (and it is a very minor one) is Prince's music throughout the film. Although I'm a huge fan of Prince's music, it doesn't belong in a film like this and it is NOT stopping me from giving it the highest possible rating! That aside, I totally love this film and highly recommend to anyone who wants to be entertained by a unique interpretation of the superhero genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bashes 'Batman Begins' to Bits!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film represented a giant step forward in comic book adaptations, and, 19 years later, remains in the top tier of this peculiar drama. Key to this film's success is that, despite consider fan pressure (Tim Burton referred to them as 'DC fundamentalists,' a label that is still apt) to do otherwise, the director made sure that he had a quality film first, and a comic book adaptation second. Fortunately, Burton had enough of a sense of the true character of Batman to incorporate enough of that spirit into his own vision, so as to satisfy all but the most myopic of comic book fans.This film is unique among the many cinematic versions of Batman in various ways, but one of the most important is the fact that in the beginning of the story the audience does not see the action from the perspective of Batman or Bruce Wayne but from other characters. Nor does Burton provide a ham-fisted, histrionic, hit-you-over-the-head version of the origin story. Rather, a mystique is created and Batman emerges by bits and pieces.The key to the character is more often hinted at, or symbolized, rather than clubbing the audience upside the head for 2 hours and 20 minutes. You come to find that Bruce Wayne has a collection of bizarre suits of armor, you see a newspaper clipping regarding the murder of his parents, you learn that he keeps his Batman suit in a huge, impenetrable vault.This film conveys a sense of the absurd, of the Gothic, of exaggerations and of the larger-than-life. All of which are also found in the classic Batman comics. The special effects are good and hold up well, 19 years later. The illusion that Michael Keaton can really move like a ninja, wearing a 70 lb. rubber suit was achieved mostly by fast editing, which is more effective than the CGI crap you get nowadays, which makes everybody look like frickin' Spider-Man.Also, since most of the time you only see brief glimpses of Batman, it helps to maintain the mystique. Batman, when properly handled, is a very compelling character. But he is also an impossible character, and the harder you focus on him, the more you dissect him, the harder it is to ignore the absurdity of a grown man dressing like a bat to frighten criminals. Tim Burton and Michael Keaton gave us a plausible Batman, but wisely kept him somewhat at arms length, more often suggesting things, rather than saying them outright.The cast is good-to-great, even Kim Basinger, who was never that much of a master thespian. 1989 was before everyone was sick of Jack Nicholson, he was still turning out good stuff and his Joker is great. The guys who play Alfred and Commissioner Gordon are really excellent, as is Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent, DA. It's too bad that this movie turned out to be the height of Michael Keaton's commercial success. Prior to the release of this film, a lot of the fan-boys got their undies all in a knot thinking he'd turn out bad in the role, yet he played this Batman so well, it's impossible to think of this film with any other lead.</fullReview>

With all the doubt going on at the time about the Batman movie, casting Michael Keaton was a mistake etc. But it wasn't. As Tim Burton himself says, Michael Keaton seems like the kind of person that would have to dress up as a bat. Val Kilmer and George Clooney do not seem like that kind of person. Jack Nicholson is amazing as the Joker and he made it darker than the Joker was in THAT TV show. Kim Basinger is a very good leading lady in this movie (and she wasn't originally the actress wanted by Tim Burton!) And yes, Tim Burton faced a hell of a lot of slack for focusing too heavily on the Joker, but both Batman and the Joker are done credit here.Batman-the best superhero movie, about the best superhero (my personal opinion, as Batman has no super powers and is just an 'ordinary' guy.

		<fullReview>"Finally, a Batman film was made that was fairly close to his comic book roots!" That is what fans were proclaiming after they left the theater in 1989 after watching Batman. All of the other Batman films made before this one were always border line comedies, and they never were really true to their source material. Then in 1989 the fans were given this truly great film that finally captured the Dark Knight in all of his glory.Most know the story of Batman, so there really is no need to explain. The story includes typical superhero movie fare: the insane villain, the Joker (Jack Nicholson); the love interest, photographer Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger); and of course the hero himself, the Batman (Michael Keaton). This film did many things for the Superhero genre of films, mainly it proved that a serious movie about a superhero could be made and not be full of a bunch of corny jokes. Though looking back at it now, after seeing the many amazing superhero films produced in recent years, this film did have its problems. Now this is by no means a poorly made film, the directing is superb, it is definitely one of Tim Burton's finest films; as well the score by Danny Elfman is still the perfect Batman score; also the acting was amazing, Jack Nicholson in particular steals the show as the Joker; and all of the other stuff like art direction, cinematography, the script, special effects, etc., are all top notch. No, the problems lie in different areas.The main problem with the film is, although it is a serious take on Batman, it isn't really that deep of a film. It is by all means extremely fun to watch, but the characters are just very two-dimensional throughout the whole film. The other gripe comes in the character of the Joker. Now the Joker is my favorite comic book villain of all-time, but the Joker in this film has more screen time, and is overall a more interesting a character, than Batman himself. I mean the film is called Batman for crying out loud, they could of done something to of made him a bit more interesting, and of also of given him more screen time. Still, putting my gripes aside, this is a fun film, it is superb escapism, but if you go into it expecting more than that you'll be disappointed.Score: A 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotham City: dark, dangerous, 'protected' only by a mostly corrupt police department. Despite the best efforts of D.A. Harvey Dent and police commissioner Jim Gordon, the city becomes increasingly unsafe...until a Dark Knight arises. We all know criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot...so his disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. He becomes a bat. Enter Vicky Vale, a prize-winning photo journalist who wants to uncover the secret of the mysterious "bat-man". And enter Jack Napier, one-time enforcer for Boss Grissom, horribly disfigured after a firefight in a chemical factory...who, devoid of the last vestiges of sanity, seizes control of Gotham's underworld as the psychotic, unpredictable Clown Prince of Crime...the Joker. Gotham's only hope, it seems, lies in this dark, brooding vigilante. And just how does billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne fit into all of this? Pretty good superhero flick with good effects and direction. Although the story sinks a little bit of this film. This movie is a decent entry, although not too bad.Rated PG-13 for Graphic Violence and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate "Batman" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world where Batman was most popularly known as "Adam West in a costume", Tim Burton came along and made possibly the greatest Batman movie for it's time. Anybody who compares this to Christopher Nolan's 2005 masterpiece "Batman Begins" just doesn't appreciate what Batman really is? a superhero whose genre changes from series to series. He's always been a comic book hero since his first appearance in May 1939. But starting in 1968, Batman had a cultural impact with a campy television series that was generally well-liked, running two years with pretty consistent reception from both critics and audiences. And for twenty-one years, that's how the world viewed Batman -- Adam West assisted by Robin in whacky adventures, ranging from a surf-contest with The Joker to jellied-water in Gotham City's pipeline.Starting in 1980, Warner Brothers went through several different scripts for the ultimate Batman movie. It took them nine years to create the perfect Batman movie, but they did it. The darkest Batman story to date. And now, thanks to this film alone, the world knows Batman as something else? a superhero who is virtually timeless. This is also the first time a lot of people saw Batman without Robin.Tim Burton created a Gotham as ugly as possible, and a Batman who is willing to kill. And what better Bruce Wayne/Batman than Michael Keaton. The epitome of an underdog. Not handsome, but not ugly; not tall, but not short; not strong, but not weak. One could easily assume that a Bruce Wayne who looks like Val Kilmer, George Clooney or Christian Bale could easily be the man under the batsuit. What kind of secret identity is that? But with Michael Keaton, you can never be sure. Not only was Keaton's appearance fantastic, but the actual portrayal was splendid. "You wanna get nuts! Come on, let's get nuts!"Sure, with Heath Ledger playing The Joker in the "Begins" sequel "The Dark Knight (2008), people will say that Jack Nicholson is THE Joker. But it's actually The Joker who made this film questionable. Who ever said that The Joker is supposed to have a back-story or kill Bruce's parents? Not to mention how convenient it is that a man dropped in a bath of chemicals survives with bleach-white skin, green-hair, and a permanent grin.The film also suffers casting. Why not have characters who are critical to the franchise such as butler Alfred Pennyworth or Commissioner Jim Gordon be played by more well-known actors? Michael Cane and Gary Oldman are wonderful examples of this, from Nolan's series.Because the Batman franchise has gone from campy-comedy all the way to intensely-dark, it's so easy to criticize any kind of portrayal of the Caped Crusader. So, judge for yourself, but keep an open-mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid super-hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Batman is the first of several movies about the comic book super-hero. It mostly consists of Batman battling the Joker, a gangster that was physically and mentally transformed from a raid accident. The struggle also includes Vicki Vale, a photographer that finds herself in love with Bruce Wayne, Batman's normal life counterpart. The plot is straightforward but compelling nonetheless.The main strength of the film is Jack Nicholson's role as the Joker. He acts perfectly, with his powerful screen presence and good humor. He is such a charismatic character that its impossible not to like him. It got to the point where I wanted him to win the final battle. His gang is also an interesting bunch; they dance to music and laugh with him, but overall don't take things too seriously. Batman himself is acted fairly well by Michael Keaton, but seems to be a step behind the Joker.If you like action or comic book movies, then this is very much worth watching. It is above average and met my expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The decade of the 1980's ended with a bang in 1989, or should I say, a "Bat-Bang", with the release of the long-awaited movie "Batman". And was it worth the wait? Yes!I loved this movie from start to finish. And I still love it today. "Batman" is pure comic book classic the way the Caped Crusader of Gotham City was supposed to be. And The Joker was the man with plan from his dramatic first scene. This is NOTHING like the 1966-1968 TV series. It has a good portion of laughs, but it's played for mainly adventure, not humor.Michael Keaton, despite many people were upset over being chosen for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, did a fine job. I was impressed. He added more moodiness to a millionaire playboy who lived a dual life as a costumed vigilante of the night devoting his very life to fighting crime and avenging the murders of both his mom and dad.But the main star was (and still is) of this entire movie was Jack Nicholson. His performance at The Joker/Jack Napier was superb and can never be outdone in a million years by anyone. To insult Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker is shameless! He makes Cesar Romero look like a wimp. Those unforgettable quotes such as "This town needs an enema!", "Where Is The Batman? He's at home, washing his tights!" and "Ever dance with the Devil by the pale moonlight?" made Nicholson the best Joker ever. And praise Bob Kane for suggesting Nicholson for this role. I knew Bob Kane was a genius, but now he's really a genius. Nicholson's Joker was both funny and sinister all at one time.Kim Basinger was decent in her role as Gotham reporter Vicki Vale, but lacked a great deal of sexiness. She could've fared better had she been in "Batman Returns", but sadly (and perhaps thankfully) Basinger wasn't.Michael Gough played Alfred, Bruce Wayne's butler. I do admit he was played with the loyalty and kindness that Alfred has for his servant. In fact, his portrayal reminded me of my grandfather's love towards me when I was a kid. It almost caused me to cry.This movie had all the right stuff. And I will confess Robin was surely not missed. I know they waited until "Batman Forever" to add Robin to the "Batman" movies, but he was not needed the first time around.If you've not seen this movie yet, then you're missing a classic worth four stars and more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the first of the more realistic-looking superhero films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than a decade before X-Men injected some life into the superhero-film market, which was dying after several efforts which were tough to swallow, including the two entries into this very series that were done by Joel Schumacher, this film, with, among other things, a bat-suit that in appearance was quite a ways away from the of the sixties show, made comic book heroes more accessible for those bothered by the bright colors that tend to accompany such. It can be argued that Burton is not the most fitting choice, for a cinematic effort inspired by comics... but the film is entertaining, and he did a rather good job. His visuals, as usual, are what demand the viewer's attention; whether it is the Joker's face hidden in the shadows before the reveal, or the title character standing high above Gotham city, with the night sky in the background, and the Batsignal projected up in front of him, you can't help but be captivated. The humor isn't bad. The plot is good, and evolves fine throughout. The pacing is seldom uneven. The acting is great, Nicholson as the Joker is unforgettable. The film is perhaps more about him than the title character. He makes a magnificent villain, and Burton, probably not entirely sane, himself, brings out the lunacy of him and makes him terrifying. Tim brings the grotesque to the screen, yet again, and his Gothic style fits perfectly. Batman is not a light or bright character, he is not surrounded by cheery people, and his environment *is* bleak and depressing. The architecture of Gotham is excellent. The action is well-done, in spite of it being unusual for the director, and Batman's gadgets and vehicles are very cool(not to mention the items in the Joker's arsenal). Details hint at the comics, pure gold for the fans. I can't claim to be a fan, myself, I never have gone for DC Comics(yours truly is a Marvel man), so if there are obvious inconsistencies between the comics and this film that I don't mention or point out, that is quite possibly the reason(though I have read Batman comics, and I *dig* The Killing Joke, by Alan Moore, which Burton also cites as an inspiration, which is clear in an early scene). I recommend this to any fan of comic book films, the characters, Tim Burton and the others involved in creating this. The commentary track on the DVD released within the last couple of years, done by Burton himself, is worth a listen, as well. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest Batman - kids: watch this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My nephew told me that he has never seen the original Batman and I couldn't believe it. His idea of Batman was based on the later films, and I think it's a tragedy that Joel Shulmacher and friends corrupted this poor kid's notion of one of the greatest anti-heroes of all time. Being young, I think he thought that it was too old of a film or that he wouldn't be able to relate to the characters. I put it on for him and he went nuts over it! It really is a timeless classic that hasn't aged at all and if you haven't seen it, go out and get it right now!Tim Burton has a reputation for making dark films, in the best sense possible. I think he understands the look and feel of this genre of comic books more so than any other director. Watching his other films is funny because I never feel as though I'm watch Tim Burton's style of film-making, rather, I feel as though I'm looking at Batman's look applied to other movies. That's how in sync I think Batman and Tim Burton are: he was a director born to make this movie.I would say the same about Michael Keaton as Batman. I don't think he has ever been in a roll that suits him like this one. It's a shame that he hasn't found more that work with his sensibilities this way because he's totally amazing to watch and completely daunting and mysterious in this roll! He pulls off both the debonair Bruce Wayne smolder and the dark, driven, somewhat silently crazy attitude of a man that dresses up like a giant bat. Jack Nicholson is truly a spectacle. His performance borders the obscene and is at times totally frightening and powerful in its strangeness. He understood that the joker was even darker and less of a caricature, more of a total lunatic in real life. The atmosphere in Gotham City is brilliant and perhaps was Burton handles best. Unlike the other Batman films, he plays the city as a character. The buildings and dress styles look like they're from the 1930's, but the gadgets and technology can look modern or even futuristic. Gotham here crosses all of the elements of a classic old world city with the danger and dirtiness of New York in the 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought, "Why would anyone do Batman in 1989?" It turned out to be a strong, dark movie. Kim Basinger is Batman's girl friend. Jack Nicholson is the Joker. Critic Roger Ebert feels that Batman is mostly form with little substance. He feels that it is rich in atmosphere with very little happening. In a way, he is right. In retrospect, it is hard to recall the plot. Comic book movies have certainly had their day. I had trouble with the Batman logo. It looks like some kind of weird boomerang. Then I realized it is the image of a bat flashed against a cloud cover. Now I see there is going to be yet another sequel in 2008 called The Dark Knight. Beware of sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, but a bad Batman movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, this is a VERY good movie. But, that's about it, I have to say Burton butchered Batman. The Dark Knight Detective, The Bat Man, The Caped Crusader, whatever you'd like to call him. He did him wrong. Batman is not a comical fighter, as he is in the movie. I.E, when he fought The Joker, he says things like "Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight" He wouldn't say anything like that. ALSO, The Joker was done TERRIBLY. The Joker, dancing to Prince? No. The Joker has a twisted, sick, sadistic mind. Ex, In The Killing Joke, a 1989 Batman Comic Book, he shoots Commissioner Gordan's daughter, paralyzes her, strips her down, takes pictures of her battered naked body, and then shows them to Commissioner Gordan. The Joker doesn't paint over museum art, dance to Prince, or send Asian Kung-Fu goons with swords on his enemies. So, if The Crown Prince of Crime doesn't do that in the books, why should he do it in the movies? He shouldn't.Again, don't get me wrong, I love this movie and it's sequels, but I only like them as movies, not Batman movies. Tim Burton made the movie to comical, and that's not how Batman or The Joker should be portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Besides some terrible dialog, Burton delivers in this 89' blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When It was announced that Micheal Keaton was attached to play Bruce Wayne/Batman in Tim Burtons new Batman movie, many fans of the comics were outraged, believing that it would be a "spoof", much like the campy 60's TV show. It wasn't until the trailer for the movie was released that people knew The truth. Fans would go to the theaters just to see the trailer. Batmania was everywhere.So, this is The dark batman we've been waiting for right? The be all and end all? No.WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.Although its light years ahead of The 60's TV show in a sense of darkness, it still has its campy moments. Most of this is due to the fact that the Joker is the main villain, although some seems out of place, and just downright silly.The Joker, who was played well by Jack Nicholsan, had his origin story changed for this Film. Which works well for the type of movie this was.Instead of being an 30 something crazy lunatic, with no "definitive" back story, he is now a 50 something lunatic, who once worked for the gang.The Joker also kills Bruce Waynes parents in this movie, although Originally It was Joe Chill who killed his parents, as seen in Batman Begins. Again, this was done to fit the story of the movie, along with the tone, and it works well.Despite the change of Origin, the joker is still a crazy maniac. He still uses his joker venom, he still uses the television to broadcast his terror, and he still laughs.The only thing wrong with the take is the Jokers "flesh make-up", when he has it on, you wonder if your watching the joker or a very happy Jack Nicholsan.Batman, who is played By Micheal Keaton, is terrific. His voice is the best of all the other actors to don the suit. The suit itself is terrific, no bat nipples, and no silver. Just pure black, of course, with his trademark yellow bat-symbol on the chest.The Story is fast paced and fun, and it does very well to lead to the final confrontation of good vs evil.However, this film is definitely not without its flaws. Like I've said before, it can be very campy and sometimes downright silly, Such as the Joker dancing to prince twice.The real trouble lies within the dialog, mostly the Dialogue spoken By Vicki Vale, who is played By Kim Basinger.Since I don't want to get Into her dialog flaws (There is many) I will go into one of Jokers.Batman: Im going to kill you.Joker: You idiot! You made me, you dropped me into that vat of chemicals, that wasn't easy to get over, and don't think I didn't try.That line just seemed to straightforward for me, a simple "You made me" would have worked much better.Also, the MAIN problem of this movie is the amount of time we actually SEE batman. The film could have easily been called "Joker".We even get a full origin of the Joker, while we get nothing, except for the parents thing, with Bruce Wayne.Despite some shortcomings, this is a movie in which the pros outweigh the cons.Whether you are in you are 10, or 30, you will enjoy his movie. So if there is an off chance that You haven't seen this, pick it up, you'll have fun, trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding breakthrough of the Dark Night into cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman deserves great appraisal, as it emphasised more on the comic routes and dug the franchise out from a deepened grave that had been tunnelled by those cringing embarrassing and corny serials.Tim Burton was the perfect choice to direct, as he is the modern day master of Gothic cinema. As a result he brought Batman to a more darker level, which is exactly how it should be depicted, and his use of cinematography gave the film a surreal atmosphere and edge. This film would not have been anywhere as near as good if it was not for Danny Elfman's legendary score, which made the film bold, adventurous and climatic. To me this stands as is best score by far.The choice of cast, however, lost the film some credit and also gained some at the same time. Firstly, the choice of Michael Keaton as Batman has some pros and cons. The pros are that he did relate well to the character as he did provide a tormented, dark and yet serious portrayal. He also played the character of the millionaire Bruce Wayne convincingly and developed a well devised role as Batman by bringing about mysteriousness to the Dark Knight and managed to carry out believable action scenes. The cons are that he was not anywhere close to the characters frame and build (even if he did work out for two months) and his height (only 5'10). His presence also seemed too distant as he said very little throughout the film and played it with no sign of emotion. Jack Nicholson, even if he was paid a sickening some of money, played the Joker/Jack Napier exceedingly well. As his transformation from the serious criminal to a psychotic clown villain will remain memorable through the history of cinema. What made the character was the fact that he emphasised The Joker being psychotic and less as an entertainer, which was emphasised more at the start of the film and less at the end, which was a shame, but still the best portrayal of a Batman villain so far. It will always be Jack Nicholson's role. Kim Basinger's casting as Viki Vale, the main reason for this is that she is fit! as she did not provide much evidence of acting. Apart from providing the same pitch of pointless screams. Michael Gough developed a good presence as Alfred, but like Bruce Wayne showed little emotion. Comissioner Gordondid not depict the true character from the comic and therefore little emphasis was put upon him. Other characters, such as Carl Grissom, Harvey Dent and Lt. Ekhardt deserved more screen time.The design of gadgets, such as the Batsuit, the Batmobile and the Batmobile also deserves great appraisal.Three people therefore made the film for what it is: - Tim Burton - Danny Elfman - Jack Nicholson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Begins!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its been more than 15 years since Batman ravaged the box office and took in more than 400 million dollars world wide and it still holds up beautifully in the recent competition with other super hero movies. Tim Burton's Gothic masterpiece is still just that, a masterpiece. Even in spite of the now dated effects and Prince's very blatantly 80's soundtrack. Some still herald it as the best super hero movie and in my opinion that is not far from the truth.he story is not completely faithful to the source material. Batman kills people without any seeming moral qualms about it but the power of the film's style easily transcends the flaws that are indeed few and far apart. In short Batman (1989) rocks! Acting wise the movie is excellent with an all star cast that provides us with some great performances. Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in a controversial move by Burton and despite the initial uproar from the loyal fans he has since gained a very loyal following who names him as the best Batman even in these post Batman Begins days. This is not hard to agree with. Despite Jack Nicholson getting by far the most attention Michael Keaton does a great job in bringing Bruce Wayne to life. He balances the guilt and brooding melancholism well with the character's wish for justice and brings some of his comedic talent into the character as well giving him a lot of edge. Kim Bassinger, however, is mercilessly boring to watch. Sure she has some appeal in the looks department but lets face it. She was never much of an actress. The supporting cast does very well as well. Billy Dee Williams proves he can do more than back Han Solo up and Jack Palance's performance is truly unique. Michael Gough is also good and unflinchingly loyal as Alfred Pennyworth despite a relatively small amount of screen time. The shining star, however, is of course Jack Nicholson who proves himself one of the most versatile actors to this day with his tour de force performance as the Dark Knights ultimate nemesis, The Joker. He literally steals every scene he is in and in spite of his joking nature he proves to be truly menacing. It almost seems as though the rest of the cast is struggling to keep up with him because he is quite simply brilliant as The Joker. Heath Ledger has some big shoes to fill, even though I know Christopher Nolan's vision of The Dark Knight is drastically different from Burton's.In terms of how the film looks it is easy and perhaps a bit obvious to label it as Gothic which is of course Tim Burton's favored style. Its not only in the settings of the movie but also in the wardrobe and general make-up. The film has some incredible shots of Gotham with its towering spires and dark alleys and is always interesting to watch. The design of the Batsuit is dark to say the least and actually a little bleak. Luckily this was remedied in the sequel but it still looks great. The Batcar looks incredibly cool and is one of my favorite car designs for any movie I have ever seen. All the gadgets are in place as well and they all look great.In terms of storytelling the film is excellent. The flow is great and the advancement of the characters is very satisfactory and the birth of The Joker is one of my favorite film moments ever. What I feel the movie lacks, however, is any real character development for Batman himself. Even though Burton struck gold by casting Jack Nicholson as The Joker it was also Batman's unfortunate undoing. Despite Keaton's sincere efforts the film feels much more like a movie about The Joker than Batman. This is, in my opinion, a shame because as Batman Begins proved, Batman himself can be an interesting character. This is one of my only beefs with this otherwise excellent movie. The story works, however, and despite being a movie about a man who dresses up like a bat has a lot of credibility.All in all Batman is a great super hero movie. Easily still one of the best in the (sub)genre. Tim Burton's vision defies time and is still as entertaining today as it was when it was first released. Kudos to Mr. Burton and all other involved.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson as the Joker = PERFECTION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Original Batman Film by Tim Burton is an excellent movie. Starring Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, and Jack Nicholson; this film has outstanding acting on the part of its three main characters. Although it may seem so great with its top notch actors, there seems to be little other cast support in the film.Michael Keaton portrays Batman/Bruce Wayne and he does a terrific job with both characters. His Batman character is kind of shaky to me. I never really see the personality change for him from Batman to Bruce Wayne. Yes, it is there, but it is not that big a transition. Kim Basinger plays Vicki Vale, the female friend/lover of Batman/Bruce Wayne. And the master himself, Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Being a huge fan of the Batman Comics, the Joker is my absolutely favorite character. Although his story in this film is "different" from what is presented in the comics (which is OK since there are so many different interpretations of the Joker in the comics), Nicholson does a terrific job with the character he was presented with. He is funny, insane, and best of all, likable! You can not not enjoy Nicholson's Joker, you can't! It would be a sin to say you did not enjoy it! He can change the character so quickly from a free moving psychopath to a dead serious individual. Jack Nicholson as the Joker = PEFECTION! Although the three main characters have terrific performances, there is little support from anybody else. Pat Hingle plays Commissioner Gordon who is a small if not insignificant factor in the film to Batman. Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) has no significant role either. Both of these characters are important people to Batman and they are just tossed aside like nobodies in this film. Gordon does nothing as an ally to Batman and they form no bond to one another. Batman does not even seem as if he wants to work alongside the police. The role of Alfred Pennyworthy was fit OK but it was nothing truly special. Now, I love Jack Palance and I think he did a good job in Batman as Carl Grissom but I think he may have over-acted a bit. I think he may have been trying to play the character to hard and came over the top a bit. Robert Wuhl plays the reporter Knox who works alongside Vicki Vale. His role is nothing special either. There should have been some more good supporting cast instead of focusing so much on the big three actors.Burton does a great job in this film of creating Gotham City. His dark and Gothic setting is terrific which truly gives it the feel of a comic book and it expands the viewers imagination. The music is terrific (courtesy of Danny Elfman). The story is very good. Sam Hamm wrote a terrific screenplay with plenty of action, excitement, and tension. The fight scenes are great. I love the Joker's henchmen; they are nothing but a bunch of fools (except Bob)! Good film but could have been better. There needed to be better roles for the supporting cast, mainly Dent and Gordon. A terrific film though. It should be seen just to see Nicholson play the Joker. How did that guy not get an Oscar for this film?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Batman Begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton as a director has a certain style that us regular film watchers are used to. When we go to see a Tim Burton film we know we are in for a dark, Gothic style trip into the black comedy mindset of Burton. "Batman", however, is a very different Burton film. Unlike its sequel, "Batman Returns", this first film seems more like a film noir that could have been directed by almost anyone than a twisted Burton vision.Not that its not very good. "Batman" is a very entertaining romp that takes the character of Bruce Wayne out of his Adam West camp-fest and returns him to the darker beginnings of the graphic novel. Not that there aren't hints of camp in it - just take a look at Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker. Unlike the more over the top performance of Jim Carrey as the Riddler in "Batman Forever", Jack's is more controlled than you would first think. His Joker is a psychopathic murderer, as he should be. We get a brilliant origins story for the villain of all villains, though the addition of the crime of murdering Buce Wayne's parents does grate at times.As for the title character, Michael Keaton gives a very serious performance of a man teetering on the edge of his sanity. Remember Batman is not a superhero - he is a grown-man who dresses up as a bat. Therefore Keaton has to give a very real performance, and unfortunately, though I enjoyed it, this is given more gravitas by the very un-real performance of Nicholson's Joker.Kim Basinger, as the love interest for both foes, starts out as seen as a pair of shapely legs and gradually gets worse from there. She is constantly screaming during the middle of the film and really doesn't get a chance to do anything other than be the token female. This is, perhaps, one of the problems with the script of the film which, as previously mentioned, does hold a few problems, particularly towards the end; although the set pieces at the end are magnificent, and we do at last get a hint of the dark, Gothic Burton genre that we are more used to.However this all does not mean that any die-hard Burton fans should poo-poo "Batman" for, I believe, two important reasons: the first is that we must remember that "Batman" was still relatively widely known as the 60's camp fest. For Burton to reveal his true vision of the Dark Knight would, I feel, have been too much in the first film, and it works much better in the second when he was given more control. the second reason not to totally ignore this film is the wonderful score by Danny Elfman, one of the musts when making a Tim Burton movie. Heroic with a sinister twist in its marches, the only thing that really pulls it down is the addition of the rather rubbish songs by Prince. The end titles song, in particular, is awful beyond compare, and I warn you all now to steer clear of the music video for this song: you will go blind.On the whole "Batman", at times a very flawed film, does what it set out to do: it rescued the character from the jaws of camp hell. I don't think that, if "Batman" hadn't been made, Christophr Nolan's "Batman Begins" would ever have existed.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From start to finish- in my opinion this is the movie for batman lovers. Simply put: Keatons's the best Batman, Burton the best director in the franchise, and Nickolson steals the show as the best villain on the big screen.The opening title sequence has a terrific sequence of seeing the Bat symbol, with the camera investigating all its intricacies and then its there with all its glory the bat symbol...it fades to the bustling, dark misty streets of Gotham. Burton's portrayal of Gotham is terrificly atmospheric we follow an outsider family struggle and take a wrong turn into the cities underbelly where they get attacked by thugs. This leads to one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. While the thugs are counting their money, and discussing the stories they heard about this bat man legend going around, we see this menacing cape shape and then descending from a height Batman himself lands and puts his vengeance on them, leading Batman to hold the terrified main thug over the ledge who asks what he was, prompting one of the best lines in the movie "I'M Batman." Keaton's BAtman is simple, he under-acted the role, he had a mysteriousness about him, yet a mild-mannered Wayne and clearly withdrawn from the outside world. Keaton used his excellent grasp on humour and and spontaneity which left the audience always asking questions about the character throughout this is a perfect way to approach the complex character like Wayne/Batman, which served Keaton well in 'Bettlejuice.' The way Burton handles the Batman character is perfect, he's dark menacing and you're always wondering about him- obviously we know he's the good guy and the hero- but he has a lot of secrets himself and they aren't unveiled until later in the film, the audience can see through Vicky Vale's vantage point as she tries to deal with the Batman story and the troubled Bruce Wayne. Bassinger's Vale is one of the few stumbling points for this film. Her role in the first half of the film was well defined, yet when she became a primary character, this is where the film detracts. She soon becomes too simple screams and faints, and there is a terribly hammy scene where she inexplicably arrives in the bat cave and without blinking an eye she wants to know whether her and Bruce will try to love each other...firstly this ruins the genius scene previously in the move where we see Wayne attempt to say he was Batman before the Joker storms in. Whispering 'i'm batman' to himself. Now on to the star of the show Jack Nickolson, the Joker. Not only do i sometimes catch myself, saying some of the generously hilariously twisted one liners he says in the movie. "As my plastic surgeon used to say- if you have to go, go with a smile" Nickolson runs riot with the script and not only steals the show he is pretty much given free reign to take over the screen with his brilliance, i feel he is the greatest actor of all time, and he is just unbelievable in this movie. The set-pieces with Batman is everything you can want, and more- the gadgetry of the utility belt, Batmans martial arts training, the special appearance of the bat plane (*scene for batman lovers- when the plane fly's on the moon creating the bat symbol*)the fight scenes were tremendous and the exiting finale in the Church makes up for the fact the movie stalls three quarters of the way through, and a lack of substance in the script is made up for by the brilliant story telling, set, and acting special mention to the Alfred character, in the movie. To conclude, for the most part this is THE batman movie as far as i'm concerned, i feel the story about the laughing potion kind of stalled and the love interest stalled toward the end. However when Keaton was on screen and Jack Nickolson was going nuts with the lines- and the special moments like the end, where the phenomenal masterful score by Elfman leading up to Batman on the rooftop over looking the bat signal....makes this the definitive Batman and superhero movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who knew that *Mr. Mom* could make such an awe-inspiring, vigilante crimefighter? With gadgets formulated from watching Martha Stewart, a cape hewn from a reconditioned wooby and an unsurpassed knowledge of daytime soaps, Michael Keaton squeezed his distinctive lip structure into that sacred cowl and surprised everyone to become the Sean Connery of Batmen.Arguably the Second Great Superhero Movie ? after the Superman franchise tragically ran out of steam (halfway through Superman II in 1980 and then kept gasping lungfuls of air like a Devonian fish on land plodding forward on knuckled fins) - director Tim Burton, writers Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, and Batman Keaton deliver a tale part noir, part comicbook, all Knight.Set in a preternaturally devolved Gotham City, where shadows and steam curl over dank, criminal streets, we meet Keaton's Bruce Wayne in his early thirties (although he may just be 29 ? the Batman's agreed age through the 70s classic era of Giordano and Jim Aparo comics), the billionaire prince of Gotham, flitting about the rooftops in sawtooth vigilante garb, for what we presume must be his early outings, as a dimestore hood fearfully implores him, while being dangled over a rooftop precipice, "Who are you?" To which the caustic reply has been immortalized by Keaton, "I'm Batman!" There is thankfully yet no Robin, nor ? just as thankfully ? Batgirl. But there is the supreme essence of faithful manservantry, Alfred (Michael Gough), the exacting, doughy authoritarianism of Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) and the miscasting of Billy Dee Williams as attorney Harvey Dent. Robert Wuhl acts kinda stupid, Jerry Hall acts - kinda, Kim Basinger steams the screen with her sultry Vicki Vale and even Jack Palance hisses a cameo as a crime boss.And then there's Jack Nicholson doing The Joker doing Jack Nicholson. When Jerry Hall compliments him, "You look good," his drawled reply: "I didn't ask." Treat me like a bitch too, Jack! Treat me like a bitch too!! There are two aspects where this movie falls down. Firstly: Prince. An almost unthinkable indictment, coming from a person who has worshipped the ground Prince has pirouetted upon since his entrance onto the music scene, but his incongruous songs ? unlike Danny Elfman's epic score ? serve to diminish the movie's impact for some strange reason, especially noticeable in the museum-defacing and balloon-parade sequences.Second bug is the third act that plays like a second act. The lowliest point of the climax is the destruction of the batplane - this ingenious piece of weaponry, brought down by a bullet from a comically-long barrel. (Even in future Batman adventures, it is disheartening how his fantastic multi-million dollar gadgets are destroyed so offhandedly.) Then Batman hoofs it up some cathedral stairs, in pursuit of the Joker, whereupon The Joker, Batman's arch-nemesis of decades in the comic books, dies in a weak special effect.Tim Burton does a sincere job of rebooting the Batman image with this dark vision that yet retained its comicbook elements: the high-on-crack colors, the skewed angles, the slap-in-the-face stereotypes, capturing even the moodier modern comics (ahem! "Graphic Novels") of darker depths of dark depths of depth of suffering darkness. Whew! Need therapy much? As Bruce Wayne tries to explain to Vicki Vale, "My life is? com-PLEX." The franchise may belong to the Bob Kane Foundation, but the Knight belongs to Keaton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman. A good movie. A great return to the truly dark and wicked view of the comics, which pleased me greatly. The campiness of the show was just so..not..Batman, anyways. The characters were great. Michael Keaton was a great Batman, but it would have been better if they delved deeper into his character, to give him more depth, as the exact reason why he dresses up like a bat is still in the dark. Kim Basinger isn't exactly the best, but she was decent. The best however, is Jack Nicholson. Amazing, a perfect joker. He was and I think always will be the best Joker. But we'll see (The Dark Knight). The one problem I have is with the plot. Its basically Joker and Batman fighting, with something linking them together that seems sort of lame at times. However, all in all, this is a good movie, but doesn't come close to the brilliance of Batman Returns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no comic book geek, but to me Batman has always been a favorite fictional character of mine. Never stooping to Republican style crusades like the fight for truth, justice and the American way, he battles the real bad guys, those in our society who pretend to be something they are not (and no the irony is not lost on me). The ruthless CEO, the corrupt cop, the sleazy politician. In this, the original movie, corruption has overtaken Gotham. In fact in Gotham police and corruption go together like. . .Batman and Robin. . .or police corruption and the NYPD. Tim Burton, visual magician that he is delivers a decent adaptation that felt too sluggish for my own personal taste. I know that it is supposed to be dark and foreboding, and it is. But it is overlong, filled with padding, and indulges Jack who is all too happy to play Jack in face paint. The finale had all the depth of a fireworks display. Plus I have been spoiled, "Batman Begins" reigns supreme in my mind as the high and mighty dark knight of comic book movies, leaving this and every other superhero flick in its dust.The film is more of an actors showcase than I am used to from Burton. At its center lies Michael Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and there is something so perfect about his portrayal of Wayne. In him I see everything we want to be. Not just rich and selfless and able to bed Kim Basinger (three things the vast majority of people are not), but things on a more personal level. He's smooth and confident and charming. I love the way he is both the center of the city and a total recluse. While my apartment is busy being littered with pizza boxes, he lives in a mansion which means that somehow he has earned the right to be thought of as a dignified loner. Now he is much less of a butt kicker than new breed Batman Christian Bale, so we have to stretch our imaginations a little further during the fight sequences because Keaton's muscles are only suit deep. As far as Jack Nicholson as the Joker goes, I had as much fun as anyone listening to his hysterical laughter and watching him dance across the screen. I just worry that Burton felt as though if he filled the movie with enough Nicholson bombast then the rest would all fall into place. Sure he gets a few laughs, but you don't see the Joker you see Jack Nicholson overpowering the role.I know I'm weird for watching the second film before this one, but that is just how I roll. More than anything I missed the Penguin; he had such a vile presence that he elevated "Batman Returns." The set design is more restrained here. What felt cartoony in "Returns" here still feels over the top but not really Burton-ish. And while I ripped on "Returns" for having bad, corny lines I will admit I sort of missed them this go round. Of course I'll take humor wherever I can get it, but this being about a caped crusader I know what is on the menu. The plot, about the Joker's plot to poison the cities hygiene products with something that makes them smile like him and then die is sort of funny but nothing overly grand. Sorry but most comic book movies are kind of bad and I am adding this one to the pile. I have affection for it, but it was about one producers cut away from being a good movie. But who needs this one anyways, we have another Christopher Nolan Batman on the horizon. **3/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sets up the Batman myth well, but Michael Keaton falls far short as Batman. I was never able to buy into his performance. It was obvious from the beginning that Jack Nicholson's Joker stole the movie from the outset and carried it through to conclusion. I will give director Tim Burton high marks for establishing the look and feel of Gotham City, and Pat Hingle makes an excellent Police Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Gough is wonderful as Alfred, the butler any gentleman would love to have. What ruined this film for me more than anything was the ridiculous sound score by the musician formerly known as "Prince." The second film did not fare much better, even with the genius of Tim Burton behind it. Having said all of that, this film is still a very watchable entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing even remarkable about this film is Jack Nicholson. The production looks now very much outdated, so much so that I cant honestly say anymore what looks campier, it or the 1960s television show starring Adam West. But like the television show, its old-before-its time quality sorta doesn't really matter. Burtons world always has a fairytale cardboard reality to it, so you can overlook it for the most part. Its annoyingly colored in deep purple too, a la the bat costume, bat-mobile, et al. Its all done I'm sure to as closely replicate the comic book experience as possible. Its too much though, and it gets annoying. You find yourself gasping for some fresh air by the end of the film. Burton's very heavy hand and his very Burtonlike vapid storyline and dialog are all borne gladly because of one thing; Nicholson's unbelievable one man show. In fact, his performance utterly carries the film past the embalmed forgettable non-performances of the rest of the cast, with the exception of perhaps Palance. I don't want to sound harsh, i recommend this film all the way. In a strange sense all of the negatives of Batman meshed with the dark purple backdrop gloom and merely emphasized further Nicholson's brightly colored clown get-up and Richter scale ham-fest. Its movie magic as they say. Jack deserved more credit for this. It's the type of award winning acting that sadly never receives awards. Boo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BATMAN (1989) **** A crowd-pleaser. Here, Burton isn't fascinated by grotesques to the extent of making it darkly overblown (something that can't be said of the next film), maybe since he didn't want to risk turning off too many viewers...at least without introducing a sequel. Good attributes - Roger Platt's darkly-toned scenery and Jack Nicholson's maniacally perfected performance as The Joker, for note - adds to the movie's enjoyment. It takes an entirely different approach to the Batman tale than those of the 1960s, something that I appreciate. Though Michael Keaton underplays the title character, he seems to fit the cape well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God there was so much hypes around this film it went on forever. The amount of advertising must have been more than Jack Nicholson's record fee. This like the rest of th franchise has a bigger star in its villain role and the actors name appears before Batman in the opening sequence. The Gothic design of the city is its strongest suite. The actual story and the Joker are surprising light for someone like Tim Burton. I don't care about other people's gushing praise this could and should have been darker and it is let down either by Burton or the production studio fearing they would alienate audiences if they explored the dark heart of the comic creations. Marvel and Batman appeared in the 1940s at the time when psychoanalysis was at its most influential. However wrong Freud and his cohorts may have been about many things they did stimulate Marvel to produce a biography to their characters to explain why they were so screwed up and make them more sympathetic. Also Satre and existentialism had reach America and again explaining why Joker was the way he had become shows the importance of moral relativism and how people make ethical choices when confronted by violent and oppressive situations. Now that should have been in the film instead of just relying on brooding and Keaton's stare. The film is held back by the chemistry not being very strong between Keaton and thee heroine. But when has that existed in a Keaton film. But its still the best of a declining franchise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched the beginning credits, I thought of the crazy Batman TV show. I sat down, watched the whole thing, and realized this was a darker version of the hero we all know and love. And I still loved it. Tim Burton brings the bat to the silver screen in this first installment of an anthology (not including 2005's Batman Begins). The hero, played by Michael Keaton, faces off against the Joker, played by Jack Nicholson. If this film was candy, and Michael Keaton was played by a green M&amp;M, I would say this film would be a lollipop, the greatest candy ever created. Although you may think different about this film if you saw Batman and Robin first, just know this film is worth your time and money.A 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton is a genius! He has created the greatest movie of 1989, "BATMAN"! The cast couldn't have been better: Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier hence The Joker; Michael Keaton as The Caped Crusader; Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale; Pat Hingle as Commissioner James Gordon; Robert Wuhl as Alexander Knox; and the list goes on and on. This movie is so close to the DC Comics classic, the TV version was nothing more than a Q&amp;A sitcom. I liked the way the characters were played out, though there were some changes like Lt. Eckhardt(Bill Hootkins). He's the equivalent of Sgt. Bullock. Bullock was bad news to the criminals, but Eckhardt was just bad news. He worked for the crime boss Carl Grissom(Jack Palance). The Joker was very murderous compared to the TV version. He ices Grissom. He cheers up Antione Rotelli(Edwin Craig), permanently! And he writes off Vinny Ricorso(John Dair). Cesar Romero did a good in the TV version, but he was more of a circus reject to the big screen if he tried to be on. The action of the movie was non-stop, and the music score from Prince was amazing. I enjoyed every minute of it! A collector's must have, of all sorts. Watch it! Live it! Long live the Dark Knight! 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can remember as a kid that Batman was supposedly going to traumatise an entire generation of children. It was going to be so dark, so scary and so downright evil that youngsters nationwide were going to soil themselves in unison. Hell, the BBFC even came up with a 12 rating to keep the little blighters out of cinemas. But when you look at it now, and when you compare it to Batman Begins with characters tripping their tits off, it seems rather tame.One of the offending scenes was when we see the scarring on the Jerry Hall's face. According to newspaper reports and playground rumour, the sight was going to be so terrifying that your heart was going to spontaneously explode in your chest. But in reality it just looks like she's been lying on a pillow for forty-eight hours and her face has got marked from excessive snoozing. The other scene that was supposedly going to leave skidmarks was when the Joker fries a man with an electric buzzer. This was going to be so hardcore that you'd run from the cinema and seek out that lovely Gary Glitter chap for protection and support. But instead it's just very funny. I imagine that kids, little bastards that they are, loved it. Man gets burnt to a crisp? Wicked! And anyway, as far scaring the bejesus out of children, Batman can't really compare to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Melting faces and snakes crawling out of the mouths of skeletons? Mummy, I need a change of underwear! (And that got a PG rating. Go figure!) But how does the film hold up seventeen years on? Pretty well, actually. Although I do have to say that it pales in comparison to Batman Begins. This Batman lacks any real depth and none of the characters have more than two dimensions. This Batman is all about surfaces. But what surfaces they are. Burton's Gotham is a weird and wonderful place. It's like an unholy ménage-a-trois between the 40s, the 80s and German Expressionism. You've got to love that.The best piece of production design in the film has to be the cathedral. Architecturally it makes no sense whatsoever ? it looks more like a skyscraper than a place of worship ? but who cares? It looks absolutely stunning. And I also love the Axis Chemical Factory. It's as beautifully ugly as a factory should be.I also love the atmosphere of the film. The woods, in particular, when Batman is taking Vicki Vale to the Bat Cave, look great. They look genuinely creepy. And I love the way that Batman is introduced. Two criminals mug a family and then as they're counting their spoils you see Batman descend in the distance. It's a wonderful visual. And Keaton's "I'm Batman" moment is even better than Bale's. Sure Bale's got that cool growl, but Keaton gets to dangle a criminal off the edge of a building while staring with those manic eyes of his. He really does look psychotic.But unfortunately the film never really delves into Wayne's character. You get brief flashes of his madness, his social unease and you get a flashback explaining his parents' death, but it's rather tokenistic. I mean, Jack Napier is made his parents killer just so that the final confrontation can be made personal. And Wayne's relationship with Vicki Vale is also rather uninteresting. They get drunk, have sex and fall out. Plus she screams a lot. However, her character is redeemed in one act. Near the end, in a cunning ruse, she distracts the Joker by kissing him. Then she slowly goes downstairs. Of course Batman pops up before anything happens, but you've got to like a woman with a mind like that.But of course it's the Joker that makes the film so much fun. With his arched eyebrows and manic grin, Nicholson was born to play the part. One of my favourite bits has to be when he invades the art gallery and swats a bronze statue away with his hand. The joy on his face is priceless and I love that it doesn't cause him serious pain. And the Joker commercial, the hand buzzer killing and the Grissom murder are wonderful too. But he's also great as Jack Napier. I love the little scene with Jerry Hall: "You look fine." "I didn't ask." And he looks utterly deranged in his scenes with Eckhardt. If anything, Nicholson is more threatening as Napier.But what also makes the film is the music. It's a fantastic score. I especially like the title march and the cues in the woods and just before Napier shoots Eckhardt. It's just a bit of a shame then that you also have Prince music in the film. But it's not too objectionable, I guess. And it's appropriately used.A few more observations about the film: Michael Gough is great as Alfred (although it causes me physical pain to remember him in Batman &amp; Robin), the Mayor bears an uncanny resemblance to Ken Livingstone, I can remember the script almost word for word because I've seen it so many times ("He hung up!"?"Bob, gun."?"This is Renee on the newsfloor."?"Never rub another man's rhubarb!"), I fancied the pants off Kim Basinger as a kid, gun-wielding mimes are genius and apparently flimsy pieces of tin can stop bullets. But here's something else I noticed. The Joker is poisoning products, so people stop using anything that might have been contaminated ? cosmetics, health and hygiene products etc. As a result everyone looks like crap ? especially the news reporters. However, in the next scene you cut to Harvey Dent. Billy Dee Williams looks like a million bucks. He's groomed within an inch of his life. No damn Joker is going to stop Lando Calrissian from looking fine.</fullReview>

Danny Elfman's scoring of the film was great in bringing out the darkness and triumph of batman. jack Nicholson was the perfect choice for the joker and Michael Keaton gave a great performance as the batman/Bruce Wayne even though he was not built like a superhero, Tim Burton gave good reason for casting him. with a limited budget they still managed to give us a great film.</fullReview>

Now, don't get me wrong: I like the film, but it clearly shows, that Burton didn't have free enough hands to do it it truly his way, like he did with the sequel, which is in my opinion better film than The Batman is.The Gothic style is in its place, but the world isn't as quirky enough than it's in Returns, and as much as I like Jack Nicholson, I felt, that he wasn't appropriate choice to be Joker. His voice was brilliant, but he just didn't have the looks.Michael Keaton does great job as The Batman. He brings great depth to a man, who dresses up as a bat to fight the crime of Gotham city.The settings, costumes and special effects are all good in their own way. Some scenes look no where near realistic, but I doubt Burton never even tried to go that far. Only thing lacking, but in some places very visible, is the definitive Tim Burton atmosphere, that was fully present in the sequel.The Batman truly was a great start for a great character. Too bad, that the producers went downhill with "Batman &amp; Robin" and Forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one and only original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Batman Begins and leaving the theater with mixed emotions and thoughts I just desired to refresh my memory and wanted to see how Tim Burton and the original movie would look now, after the so - called Spiderman and X-men movie revolution.I remembered myself on that time, year 1989, 50th anniversary of the Batman comics. I was just so excited that Batman will get a big screen appearance after all these years of the old Robert Lowery and John Duncan movies or the Adam West and Burt Ward serial.I heard that Tim Burton would take charge as Batman director, and I was a bit surprised, throughout Beetlejuice was funny and entertaining I still was not convinced he is the correct choice. After that the news came out that Burton is hiring Michael Keaton as Batman, which resulted some nasty protest of Batman fans who knew Keaton only from comedies and just could not imagine him doing that role. The only thing I was sure was Jack Nicholson. I liked the most of his movies and really could see him in the role of the Joker.And finally after seeing that movie I was impressed. And not just by Nicholson, no, more by the taste of director Tim Burton and the conceivable performance by Batman actor Micheal Keaton. Nicholson, just like the Joker in the comics radiates with natural allurement and energy, perfectly mixing up brutal insane crime and black humor. On the other side we see a more subtle and serious Bruce Wayne. Keaton created a astound charge around his appearance, although corporal not looking like the prefect Batman, he captures Bruce Waynes/Batmans mental insecurity, secrecy and his duality.Of course I have to mention and praise Kim Basinger, who jumped in the last minute after replacing injured Sean Young and made a solid performance as Vicki Vale. The main roles are also uphold with great supporting roles and performances, especially Jack Palances(Carl Grissom) and Michael Goughs(Alfred).The biggest objection to this movie would be the plot, always considered as not very complicated and elaborated - reporter Alexander Knox joins forces with journalist Vicki Vale to discover the secret of Gothams new night creature - the mysterious Batman! Vicki soon gets involved with Bruce Wayne and comes unknowingly close to his big secret. Batman, alias Bruce Wayne, a lone and social clumsy multimillionaire tries not only to support Gothams justice leaders Comissioner Gordon and City attorney Harvey Dent but also revenge the death of his parents who in Bruces childhood where shot in front of his eyes...Gotham City fears of terror provided by gangster and crime lord Carl Grissom who controls the town. At the same time we follow the transformation of Grissoms Nr. 1 Jack Napier into the psychopathic Joker, a contrast to Batman. After resolving Grissom, the Joker takes charge in town. More drama is added after discovering that Jack Napier, now the Joker is the killer of Bruces parents and a final fight is initiated...But the plot is not that important, at least not in Burtons world, the master of visual effects and atmosphere. Gotham, a dark, massive, Gothic city with great exteriors as well as interiors, is the crucial element of this atmosphere, and Burtons vision. He used the comics just for basic material, adding a lot of his own imagination (and is responsible for this late confusion when it comes to who killed Bruces parents). Most people make the mistake and connect Burtons Batman with Frank Millers comics. But Burton adds his own style, or in his words:"a collective history of the character". Scenes like the museum scene, the final confrontation at the Cathedral or the ending(last) scene exactly picture Burtons vision. Great dialogs, a magnificent combination of Danny Elfmans unforgettable main theme and cool songs by Prince, excellent costumes and design, as well as the fluent dialog and some remarkable quotes(Joker quotes like- "I've been dead once already, it's very liberating"; "Never rub another man's rhubarb"; or "Tell me something, my friend. You ever dance with the devil by the pale moonlight?" or Keatons unforgettable "I am Batman") together surpass the absence of a persuasive plot or the deflection from the original comic book material, and form one of the greatest movie icons of the early 90ties.And now, after more then fifteen years, this movie still carries the same visual attractiveness and its irresistible and overwhelming charm! It is after all the fundamental movie, a backbone of all future coming Batman movies, the bad ones as well as the good ones. That also includes Batman Begins, impracticable without his precursor, the original 1989 Batman. It still works!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton + Batman= Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Batman was reinvented in 2005 with Christopher Nolan's Begins, Batman was revamped from the Adam West show of the 60's with Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, and Michael Keaton. The film is a blend of the 1940's serials and Frank Miller's style (ie Dark Knight Returns). Burton's direction is amazing, though his skill for action was lacking at this point. Roger Pratt's photography and Furst's design were landmark. Bob Kane himself said that when he stepped onto the set it was the Gotham he had pictured. The screenplay is good, far from great though...The Joker carries the movie more than Batman, but with Jack Nicholson deliciously acting bonkers and Michael Keaton's excellent, but subdued and brooding turn at Batman/Bruce Wayne that's a given. The most notable change from the Batman myth here is making Jack Napier/Joker the assassin who gunned down Bruce's parents. It rapes Batman lore but does make the final confrontation in the bell tower more personal. Keaton and Nicholson give the only performances that are really worth taking note of...Kim Basinger is a perfunctory love interest and Jack Palance has too little of a part to really give anything...special mention must go to Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth, who, in my mind, is the definitive Alfred. One thing this film has over Begins is the brilliant score by Danny Elfman, one of the most distinct comic book scores of all time (along with Returns). Batman Begins may be a better picture, but to me Burton's Batmans will always be better entertainment.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Tim Burton Batman movie is almost flawless. It combines the director's visionary edge with the complex twists and turns of the comic books (especially the ones by Frank Miller), and makes for a compelling watch.The only thing wrong with this masterpiece is that the whole "The Joker killed Batman's parents" story deviates to far from the comic books, and seems to be put in just as a piece of Hollywood drama.However, Batman remains the darkest superhero character of all time, and his story is now a legendary piece of film-making.There is a graphic novel called: "The Dark Knight Returns", so I believe that this truly shows roughly how "The Dark Knight Begins", despite the lack of the full origin story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Re-Thinking of a Classic Comic Book Tale with the Screen's Greatest Villain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1989 version of BATMAN was Tim Burton's dark re-thinking of the classic comic book hero. Light years away from the 1966 television series, this film goes to Bruce Wayne's roots as the comic book did and explains why Bruce Wayne became Batman in a way that was never really made clear in the television series. The film has a dark look and feel to it but it works for the screenplay and for Burton's ultimate vision of this character. Michael Keaton is quite competent in the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman and Kim Basinger makes a lovely damsel in distress, but the thing you walk away remembering about this movie is the extraordinary performance by Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier a.k.a. The Joker. Nicholson commands the screen in one of his most remarkable performances that should have garnered him the Oscar for Best Actor of 1989; however, he was not even nominated. This is a wonderful film (the three that followed paled in comparison,IMO)that is worth seeing, if for no other reason, to marvel at the show-stopping performance of Jack Nicholson as the Joker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about this classic - it's the film that brought Batman as we know him today to the big screen. Tim Burton does a fine job portraying the darkness in Batman, as he fights and battles throughout "gothic" Gotham City (which is in actuality New York City). Danny Elfman also deserves especial mention which his memorable score for this film - his theme for Batman will go down as one of the classic themes of all time, one that can be identified immediately even if someone just hums it to you. Michael Keaton also is the perfect actor to portray the Dark Knight, bringing with his acting the proper dichotomy that is required for the caped crusader. And who can forget the Batmobile (an ingeniously dressed up Dodge Viper). That said though, the film is hampered by little character development for Batman/Bruce Wayne (we won't know who Bruce Wayne really is until 2005's spectacular Batman Begins), and the main villain, Joker (portrayed by Jack Nicholson in a deliciously neurotic performance), is much more potent than Batman (in fact, you can even go so far as to say this film is about Joker NOT Batman). For this reason, I can only give an 8 out of 10 - a high score nonetheless for a superb and classic film that started the Batman film saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1989 Tim Burton got together a great crew (with one of the best art directors ever), got great actors and a good screenplay and made one hell of a film. After the bomb of a television show that was Batman you'd think they wouldn't give Batman another go, but then they started producing the darker books (the biggest inspiration for the film being the Dark Knight series from Frank Miller) and got people interested in doing a darker, more psychologically complex Batman film and they did it. This film gets most aspects of the film right. They got a more than exceptional actor Michael Keaton to play the title role and he gets it down packed, he looks like a man who needs to do what he does, you can feel his uncomfortable angst as Bruce Wayne sitting in his mansion knowing he belongs on the streets as Batman. Then they must have been blessed by the film gods by getting the only actor who could have played the Joker, the best actor to this day, Jack Nicholson. Only the Babe Ruth of films could play the Joker as the dark, over the top comedic psychopath we see in this film. Jack's fantastic (slightly overplayed) performance simply raises the film's likeness to the books all the more. Kim Basinger does a fine job as an original love interest for the Dark Knight, we see Batman as a normal person would see him, scary and mysterious. The supporting cast is brilliant with Jack Palance as Carl Grisham; Gotham City's biggest mob boss and Michael Gough as a perfect Alfred Pennyworth as the most exceptional. The art-direction and look of this film is taken right from the comics of Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb, Oscars were mandatory for this film's city and Batman's dark, faithful look. The only things that keep me from giving this film a 10 are the small quirks that are sacrilegious to the books. The Joker did not kill Batman's parents (this being crucial to Batman's motivation to wanting to kill the Joker) when he was a kid, it was a street mugger named Joe Chill, and Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the batcave was a tad unprofessional on the usually loyal butler's part. And the Joker, albeit perfect for the film's tone and a fantastic performance receives a bit too much screen time. Having Jack's name above Keaton's on the credits is almost accurate to his role, Keaton, although great in his role, doesn't get the attention he deserves in this film about Bruce Wayne and Batman (hence the title). But if there's only one of the first four Batman films you want to watch, it most certainly has to be this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Caped Crusader</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's kind of hard to believe Tim Burton needed the success of Beetlejuice to convince the money people at Warners he was the right choice to direct Batman: totally faithful to the comics it may not be (even writer Sam Hamm has said the film's major twist was a bit of a stupid idea), but before Christopher Nolan resurrected the Caped Crusader after Joel Schumacher had effectively killed him, Burton's vision was the closest anyone had ever come to the real Batman - dark, brooding and oddly cool (just like any other film made by the director).Unlike Nolan, Burton doesn't find it necessary to tell the character's origins, save for a brief flashback: when we first meet Bruce Wayne/Batman (Michael Keaton), he's already a fully formed vigilante, going out at night to strike fear into the hearts of Gotham City's criminals, making the job easier for Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams). When he's not busy fighting crime, he hosts parties to maintain his playboy image, not letting anyone but his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Gough) get a glimpse of what's really happening inside his head.Things are about to change, though, as a new breed of crook is preparing to strike. More specifically, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), the former henchman of mob boss Grissom (Jack Palance), is back from the dead after being apparently killed, and the incident that almost cost him his life has made him a different person. As he puts it: "You can call me... Joker!". Madness has a new name, not to mention a new face.Burton's first reason for accepting to make the movie, as he himself is happy to remember, was his love for extreme characters - outsiders who aren't completely understood because of their quirks, possibly even some insane personality traits. In his own way, Batman is crazy, and placing him against something even crazier, namely the Joker, is the only way to cope with all the weirdness surrounding him. And the weirdness isn't just in the characters, it's everywhere, thanks to Anton Furst's magnificent, Oscar-winning production design, the other aspect close to the director's heart: one of cinema's greatest visionaries, he saw this as the chance to make a difference in the superhero genre, visually as well as tonally, and the result is a landscape that reeks of postmodern film noir, much like the comics by Alan Moore and Frank Miller which were used as inspiration.Still, the spot-on mood wasn't enough to silence one of the nastiest pre-release rumors: that by casting Michael Keaton in the title role, Burton was aiming for something similar to the '60s TV show. Of course, all the naysayers would have needed was to take a look at Keaton's excessive, outstanding work in Beetlejuice (again as the titular guy) to understand he had that bizarre something that made him perfect for the part (in fact, he's still the second best on-screen Batman, after the recent, brilliant Christian Bale). No such doubts were expressed regarding his co-star, who even received top billing and a big chunk of cash despite playing "just" a villain. Then again, Batman creator Bob Kane was the first person to recommend Nicholson for the job, and it is quite impossible to imagine anyone else playing the comics' greatest psycho (we'll see how things turn out in the Batman Begins sequel). Hell, how many actors can boast a Golden Globe nomination for playing a character like the Joker?Long story short: it has a few flaws (one silly plot point and some lack of psychological detail), but Burton's Batman can still be proud of its status as the movie that made the Dark Knight respectable on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive, but lacking the x factor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film tells the beginning of the Dark Knight's career, and his battle with the Joker (Jack Nicholson). Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is trying to balance out his relationship with Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) with the commitment he made to his parents after their death.Keaton gives it his all, but he reduces Wayne to a brooding loner, while only paying lip service to his playboy lifestyle. This is a huge error, as Wayne was always a complex character who could never be pinned down to one particular image. Another problem is that he's not on screen enough to justify the film being called 'Batman.' However, the action sequences are handled excellently by Tim Burton who captures Gotham City perfectly in the industrial,Gothic imagery, and it's a nice twist to have Nicholson the murderer of his parents, but it's not explored enough. Although it has been superseded by Batman Begins (2005) it's still highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Toss-up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...between this Batman film and BAtman Begins. Both a strong "first" movies,both have solid imagery,and both are well cast.I suppose this film sticks with me in that Tim Burton's eye for the absurd and vivid set the tempo for ensuing Batman films(allowing Joel Schumacher to run the series into the ground overdoing it)and the use of Prince music,which can be rather hit-or-miss,is spot-on here.When you boil this one down,this is actually more of a genesis(or a "reinvisioning" of a genesis) of a Batvillain. In this case,the Joker,for whom is embodied by the cool,collected and sinister form of one Jack Napier(Jack Nicholson,showing that scenery-chewing can always be fun and stylish). Batman is already established in the dark,unforgiving world that is Gotham. He is,of course,millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne(Michael Keaton,understated here,as per necessary). The love interest is blonde,vivacious and ambitious reporter Vicki Vale(Kim Bassinger,screaming her head off here). Gotham is now under siege by a vengeful Joker,who seeks to turn the city into a horde of freakishly smiling corpses through various chemicals.Burton,no stranger to hits and misses,makes the most out of this opportunity,scoring on lighting most notably. Or,more specifically,the lack thereof. I recall after I saw this in a crowded theater in mid-summer 1989 that when I went outside after the film was over,my eyes were so darkened and readjusted to the movie that the bright summer sunlight hurt like a bastard on my retinas! It's no mistake that the whole of the film has a sparsity of natural light,so as to portray the darkness of God-forsaken Gotham and the playground,battlefield that the criminals and the Caped Crusader engage engage battle on. The supporting cast--Robert Wuhl,Tracey Walter,Billy Dee Williams,Jerry Hall and JAck Palance in particular--are mostly doing cameos here,with Palance's probably the best of the bunch as a rival crime boss.This film works on large or small screen. I suppose it probably means more to me since I saw it when I was much younger and was more impressionable. I cannot say that this one is better than this summer's Batman Begins(for which I recommend as highly as well),but it is not inferior,either. More of a pop/rock treatment of a comic epic,this film is a nice compare and contrast to other comic book hero films AS WELL as other Batman movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the first four films without a doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to consider this Batman to be the best of the four movies that came out between 1989 and 1997. Ever since seeing Superman: The Movie as a kid, I yearned for seeing Batman: The Movie and it wasn't until the summer of 1989 that this movie was released. I was 17 years old and would be a high school senior that fall. I saw this movie opening night and when I first got a VCR, Batman: The Movie was the first movie I bought on VHS. I also couldn't wait until the superb film score soundtrack by Danny Elfman was released. Danny Elfman scored the best Batman theme I've ever heard in this movie.I really don't approve of casting a well known celebrity as Batman. Although if I have to compare the three actors who played the Caped Crusader, Michael Keaton was the best of the three. He captured the darkness of Batman and the moodiness of Bruce Wayne. Although Michael Gough looked nothing like Alfred in the comics, he had that grandfather like feel to him. My favorite scene with him was his reminiscing about Bruce as a kid in the kitchen with Bruce and Vicki. Jack Nicholson I felt was the best thing about the whole movie altogether. He was born to play the Joker and had some of the greatest lines. My favorites are: "This town needs an enema!" and "What are you laughing at?!" Jack Palance was superb as Carl Grissom and I agree with Tim Burton that he was the only man who could have been Jack's boss. I loved the Batmobile, the Batwing, and the Batcave. Wayne Manor was also very elegant looking. This is the only one of the four Batman movies where Gotham City looked like a real city in comparison to the sequels. I would have preferred it had they filmed on location in New York like they did for Superman. All I have just described is what I liked about the movie. But I have to say that as a DIE HARD Batman fan, I found something wrong with each of the four movies. This one is the only one with the fewest complaints. Here are my grievances. 1: Tim Burton's first Batman film lacked action sequences. After Batman's first appearance, we don't see our hero very much for a while. Not good. This movie needed more of Batman. 2: Robert Wuhl as Alexander Knox: Reporter for the Gotham Globe. His scenes and especially his scenes with Vicki Vale bored me to tears. 3: Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon. I seriously could not believe that this pudgy man was the Commissioner. I've always been at a total loss why they could never find a man with silver hair and a mustache with glasses for the role. 4: Harvey Dent. I didn't mind Billy Dee Williams in the role. He did great. But I wish they could have brought him back as Two Face later on. 5: Mayor Borg. I could not stand this guy. Borg gets my vote as worst mayor of Gotham City. 6: Bob: The head goon of the Joker. Something about him I didn't like. 7: While I love the Joker, I felt he upstaged Batman in this movie, but then again, all the villains did in the four films.In closing, I felt this was the best of the four films. Now comes the shocker. Batman: The Movie can't hold a candle to the likes of the newest release, Batman Begins. In comparison, Tim Burton was good, but not nearly as good as Christopher Nolan with adapting Batman from his true comic book roots. So I feel that Batman: The Movie is the second best Batfilm behind Batman Begins. And Michael Keaton is second best compared to the likes of Christian Bale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman -- A character developed in the early 20th century. The second character after "Superman" to gain his own comic book.. After becoming such a backbone in DC comic history, how could they NOT make a film adapting his greatest triumphs? A simple concept like this, has two places to go: it can become a simple nightmare or a dream-come-true for long-time fans. On the silver screen, the Batman found his two-hours of fame to be the latter.This super-hero film revolves around Bruce Wayne, living out his Gotham nights as his alter-ego: the Batman. Batman, a masked vigilante who fights crime, without the aid of super-powers or magic rings.After a brief introduction to our star, we meet vicious mobster: Jack Napier (Nicholson), as he attempts to raid one of his gang's largest assets: Axis Chemicals. During this raid, the Batman begins one of his first and most definitive long-term assignments.During an attempt to break-up a fierce fire-fight between Jack Napier and police, Batman sends Napier flying into a vat of toxic chemicals.. Which sends Napier to a burning grave.. Or does it? The rest of the film revolves around Bruce Wayne's juggle between his love of photographer Vicky Vale (Basinger) and his monstrous struggle with Jack Napier's deformed alter-ego: The Joker.However, the big story behind this movie wasn't the screenplay, as much as it was the casting of noir-style-director: Tim Burton.Burton (Sleepy Hollow), takes the helm of the second mainstream super-hero film, having little-to-no knowledge of the Batman himself.. But using his mentality and film-sense, Burton creates the perfect hybrid of original creative material and inventive, more "personal" character origins.This strategy led to a multitude of events. The majority of which became essential to the success of this dark, creative, re-imaging of The Batman.The first of Burton's creative accomplishments (and possibly the largest) came to life with the big-screen adaptation of the noir-nightmare that is: Gotham city.Along with this, Burton was able to take one very serious character (Batman) and create two very distinct and separate personalities (Batman and Bruce Wayne. Which, to be fair, can mostly be attributed to the fine acting efforts of Michael Keaton.However, no invention goes without its flaws and Batman is no different. One of Burton's short-comings comes with his imaginative connection between Batman and The Joker. In this re-imaging, Burton tweeks the original origins of both characters. While creating a nice tie-in, and a superb conflict-point, this is (even to this day) one of the hottest issues between fans of the Batman comics and fans of the "Burtonman" films.A few other side-issues that viewers may have are the pace, flow and general feeling of the film.. If you've seen any Burton film, you'll know what to expect.. But even a non-Burton fan (like myself) can see through some cinematography-related issues and enjoy the essentials of the movie itself..My advice? Even if you're a comic lover or a complete stranger to the printed-page: take this film as it was meant to be.. A film ABOUT a super hero, as opposed a film ADAPTING a super hero.. I believe you'll take more enjoyment from this film, sitting with this perspective.So go ahead, take a risk and Dance with the Devil in the pale-moonlight: with Tim Burton's: Batman.</fullReview>

These sections seem to be more of a showcase of Jack Nicholson's comedic talents than anything to do with the story, and a star vehicle is the last think 'Batman' should have been. Thankfully, Nicholson himself is more than worthy of the challenge of tackling the disturbed, almost pantomimic Joker. Rarely descending into ham, Nicholson simply owns the frame. However, Michael Keaton is also good as the Caped Crusader, and convinces as a normal guy...a rarity in superhero movies.~ 7/10 ~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully dark and provocative action packed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people were dismayed to hear that Michael Keaton was chosen to play the lead role in the Hollywood big screen remake of Batman, after all he was best known as comedy actor and hadn't had many serious mainstream acting roles until that point.But Keaton was about to show his critics that he was more than qualified for the part. Playing a remarkably restrained and wonderfully thought out dark portrayal of batman Keaton was quickly accepted by hardcore Batman fanatics to be the ultimate Bruce Wayne.Keaton's Batman was a dark and deep character; a man tormented by the tragic murder of his parents which he witnessed when just a little boy.Keatons Batman was obsessed with avenging his parents murder by fighting crime and making the dark streets of Gotham safe.And for its worth Keaton's Batman is still the best, Val Kilmers batman was well intended but no where as good and George Clooney's attempt at the part is simply laughable in comparison.The whole atmosphere of the film is complimented by Jack Nicholson on blistering form as the Joker,Batman's ultimate nemesis. Jack Nicholson is playing , well, Jack Nicholson but its a role he was born to play. Again the Nicholson followed Keaton logic of deepening the role and showing various sides to the character.This was no longer comic book stuff - this was for real, no "Blam" "Biffs" or "holy Cows" in sight - this was Batman grown up! And what thrilling viewing it was.But despite being that brilliant Hollywood blockbuster, it still retained that child like excitement you can imagine a schoolboy felt when reading the original comics.The film is enthralling, exciting and wondrously atmospheric. It has to be one of Tim Burton's masterpieces. The cityscapes and soundtrack are simply spell binding.It Will become a classic.Burton wasn't chosen to direct any other Batman films due to a disagreement with the films management team which is a great shame as Batman was never the same again.The final scene of the movie brings the whole atmosphere, darkness and power of the film together. Vicky Vale gently strolls up a dark alley accompanied by an epic soundtrack into Bruce Waynes car. The Chauffeur Alfred explains that Bruce Wayne may be late.The camera pans away to reveal Michael Keatons Batman defiantly standing high on a dark roof top looking out toward the great Batman symbol stamped on the sky before him.Batman will forever be the Guardian of Gotham City and this iconic scene ensured that Batman became one of the best loved Big Screen Superheros alongside Superman.Keaton reprised his role in the sequel "Batman Returns" but the magic had started to drain away, and Keaton knew it was time to jump ship. Val Kilmer was drafted in to revitalise the ailing syndicate but Batman was quickly turning into more of a laughable cartoon like film rather than the dark mysterious atmospheric well produced predecessors.There was talk of a new batman movie in 2005 with Keaton and Burton being re-united but as yet a rumour is all it seems to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"..if you got to go, go with a smile." -- Joker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great tragedy to the Batman series occurred when Tim Burton and Michael Keaton left to pursue other ventures. A once vibrant Gothic tale of an estranged super-hero turned into a campy piece of crap. Batman was becoming like the 1960's series. While I like Adam West and the ludicrously hip series, the originality and darkness of the Gothic novel influenced movies was gone. Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever and then Batman and Robin hath destroyed one of my favorite characters. Nevertheless, even if the sequels deteriorate and degenerate even more, there will always be Batman.At the core of this movie is Michael Keaton. Before, I saw the film I questioned the casting of him, but in retrospect, it was a brilliant decision. He is a character that is believable as a man violently thrown into the fray early as a child. After watching his parents become the victim of a brutal crime, Bruce Wayne creates a schizophrenic personality to combat the evils in the world. Possibly to cover up his guilt of not being able to save his parents. Keaton is perfect as a balding, small, slightly shy business man Bruce Wayne and the angst ridden Batman. The worst casting would have been to hire a pretty boy to play Batman.In order for the movie to succeed there has to be a vile and virulent villain. Enter Jack Nicholson. He said he took this role for aesthetic reasons. I believe they were to rompish in his role while collecting a huge paycheck. That is what is noticeable from his performance -- he is having fun. His Joker is one of the great screen villains of the past two decades.The Joker was once Jack Napier, henchman of Carl Grissom. Grissom sets-up Napier to be arrested, over a girl, and Batman was responsible for tossing Jack Napier into a vat of bleach. He survived; however, not intact. His soul and skin had been bleached. Jack was dead, and Batman's nemesis Joker was born.Grizzled character actor Jack Palance plays Grissom in another great supporting role. He even outshines Nicholson in one scene where he grabs him and says "Your my number one, guy." On paper, it does not seem like much, but on the screen it is a fabulous scene. The look on Nicholson's face is priceless.When I first saw this film in the theater, the scenery and special effects awed me. I went by myself, because I could not find any companions and spent the evening emerged in this Gothic tale. Gothom City is a dark and doleful town with skyscrapers that reach way atop the atmosphere and look part of a Kafkaesque nightmare. Anton Furst won an Oscar for the production design and Danny Elfman's has a terrific score. While some of the atmosphere is not translated onto the small screen, nevertheless the brilliant and brooding direction of Tim Burton is still relevant. Most of Burton's material is fodder for my cinematic appetite. Ed Wood and Batman Returns are among my favorite movies.Other characters include the love interest (Kim Bassinger) and comic relief (Robert Wuhl). Both are common elements in 'super-hero' movies and are a bit clichéd in this movie though both are acted well enough. Michael Gough plays the magnanimous butler Alfred and I believe he is the only actor in common among all four Batman films. He is always fun to watch. The goons are cast well and are a motley crew. There are two excellent fight scenes, Schumacher cannot film a fight scene, being on par with most Hong Kong flicks.There are two Batman films to watch: Batman and Batman Returns. It would be nice to think that there were no other sequels, like thinking that Peter Sellers did not make a film after Being There, but alas there were. However, they can never take away Batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the Best comic book film ever made, the best of the Batman franchise anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is a brilliant piece of cinema. An exceptional adaptation of the popular comic book makes for an exceptional film, which excels in every aspect of it's production. From the performances to the special effects to the set design this film shines. Michael Keaton plays Batman and Bruce Wayne equally well, and so far he has been the best candidate for the role. Yet as good as his performance is he is outdone by the support cast. Kim Basinger plays Vicki Vale with a passion and the interplay between the two is seamless. Though Jack Nicholson steals the show as the Joker. His performance is as fun as it is mesmerizing. There are moments captured on camera with the Joker which will stick in everyone's mind. Such as the parade, the walk through the art gallery and Nicholson asking the famous phrase "have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?" The plot is well formed, the film moves along at an good pace, and there is barely a scene which you will not adore. There are only two faults. The beginning of the film is slow, though the rest is so action-packed right up until the final scene it is of no importance. And the method that the Joker uses to take down the Bat-Plane is not only non-believable it is downright ridiculous.Nevertheless Tim Burton as made a masterpiece here an it is arguably the greatest comic book film of our time. I recommend any fan of the genre to go see this along with anyone who would enjoy a couple of hours of unrelentless fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is an amazing movie by an amazing director. Tim Burton really has a special touch when it comes to making movies. The plot is pretty thin, but it makes up for it with a great cast and special effects. Jack Nicholson plays The Joker, the main villain of the film. He kindaoveracts and takes some spotlight from Michael Keaton, but he is still good. Of course Michael Keaton plays Batman and does a spectacular job. In my opinion, he is the best Batman ever. Val Kilmer is not bad, but Keaton is still the best. Kim Basinger plays Vicky Vale, a photographer who is the love interest for Keaton. She's pretty good, but there are minor flaws to her character. Also, the great Jack Palance plays a minor role as Carl Grissom, the crime lord associated with Jack Nicholson's character. It's a small role, but good nonetheless. The music was done by composer Danny Elfman and Prince did some other music. Danny Elfman brought a lot of depth to the film by using characters to his advantage. Prince, of course appealing to the younger filmgoers at the time, created simple pop songs that also worked good with the film. If you haven't seen this movie, I advise you to go quickly to your nearest video store and rent it for it's a movie that has been in my video collection for a long time. I give BATMAN four out of five stars.</fullReview>

This is by far the best Batman film there is. Tim Burton did great in directing this movie and it puts him as one of the darkest directors with an incredible imagination. Batman is one of his best films ever made. If only they could've made the other sequels to Batman as good as this one, this could've been one great series. I highly recommend this movie if your ever bored on a Saturday night. Hedeen's outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton created a masterpiece when he made this film. He made a Batman film that kids and adults could watch and love! With the non-stop action, and the all star cast, this film could not get any better!Right when the film starts off, Batman is a super hero, the only thing is that the town is just beginning to know about him. He starts off just helping capture robbers, and then running off before the cops can ask him who he is, then he moves onto bigger things. Jack Napier, a local mobster, is transformed into a white faced freak because of Batman, and he wants revenge. He goes crazy, and wants to kill Batman and everybody else in Gotham City. So now, Batman must fight the only person in Gotham who might be as strong and powerful as he is? THE JOKER!With this great movie, comes an awesome cast: Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne AKA Batman, Jack Nicolson as Jack Napier AKA The Joker, the beautiful Kim Basinger plays Vicky Vale, a photographer who has the hots for Batman, and Jack Palance, who plays the leader of an organized crime ring.I love the way they have Gotham City set up, it is like nothing I have ever seen. This is without a doubt the best Batman movie ever made, and no matter how many series they make to retell the Batman legacy, there will never be a Batman film that can be better then this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best one out of all 4!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was far by the best. It may have the been the very gloomy setting in this version or it might have been Jack Nicholson as The Joker but this movie was great. I did have a couple of problems with this movie, one was that I think they took too long to create The Joker. But, I do understand trying to build Jack Napier up to make it a better movie, I understand in that regard. But Jack Nicholson as The Joker is a superb performance and that's why I think if they would have sped it up he would have had more screen time as The Joker. I have said it since I was very small and still believe it, Jack Nicholson deserved an Academy Award for his portrayal of Bruce Wayne's/Batman's first nemesis The Joker. Jack Nicholson had a chilling laugh as the joker and a chilling grin. For Michael Keaton I am already a fan of his and he did superb in this also. He plays Bruce Wayne/Batman and does an excellent portrayal of him also. Out of all of the Bruce Wayne's his is far by the best! I give it 10/10 Stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am only commenting on this movie because I can't comment on Batman Begins.I am beyond excited that the Batman franchise is going to be re-vamped once again and return to its earlier, darker roots. I am also interested in seeing if Christopher Nolan and Christain Bale can make a film better than Burton's 1989 version.I believe to this day that Batman (1989) is the definitive version of Batman. The campy sixties show while humorous to watch today probably made Bob Kane turn over in his grave several times. Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin probably made Bob want to rise from the grave and strangle anyone involved in those films-and they shouldn't be called films.First of all Tim Burton is one of the greatest Directors of all time. Some criticize him for being too quirky or relying too much on visuals. I argue that his style combines the fantastic, escapists kind of feel necessary in going to the movies, with the engrossing meaningful and artistic side that makes film-making a modern art. There is also no Director, not even Spielberg, who can make a scene scary, funny, romantic, sad, and exciting all at the same time. Edward Scissorhands is Burton's greatest triumph and there is no better example of his ability to combine all emotions into one or two shots.His seriousness and quirkiness create a world in Batman that combines every element that originally conceived the character. The first Batman comics were dark but still had somewhat of a campy feel to them. They were comics after all. Burton and Michael Keaton-who is the best Bruce Wayne/Batman ever to grace any screen-effectively combine the campy elements of all comic book heroes with the deep, psychological issues that make Batman not only the most believable super hero, but the coolest and darkest super hero of all time. He is a real man who faces real problems. Batman (1989) shows this through Wayne's struggle with Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger-really the only weakness of the film)-and of course the constant torment of his parent's death. The other thing that makes Batman the greatest comic book hero is that it is actually important that no one learns his secret identity. No one cares if a twenty-year old loser freelance photographer is Spiderman. Spiderman 2 proved this when half of NY saw his face in the middle of the film, one of that movie's many ridiculous faults. And it really doesn't matter if a mild mannered reporter turns out to be Superman. But Bruce Wayne, a well known businessman who is the most admired face in Gotham, if it turned out that he was The Dark Knight that would not only devastate his personal life and career, it would shock the city and the world.And getting back to Superman, he's an alien who has all the powers in the world and only one weakness. I love Superman, but relating to a guy in a blue leotard who crumbles at the sight of a little green stone, and always fights for truth, justice, and the American way isn't the easiest thing in the world to relate to. I'd like to have all those powers, but I never will. I don't want to have some of the anger and loss that Batman does, but I always will. We all will and therefore we can all relate. Many who love comics love them because they want to have super powers and that's understandable but eventually that shallow desire will fade with age. Batman is a constant because he could exist if someone put the effort into it. And if one forgets how easy it is to relate to the character and just looks at the facts: By day, he's a billionaire play boy who could have any woman he wants, by night, he's a dark avenger dressed in black who looms on every rooftop and stalks evil in every form all to drive his personal need for revenge-what's cooler than that?Well, I apologize for the rant. This should be a review of the movie. Burton gives us a dark world in Batman that comes right out of Kane's earliest comics and he also gives us the campy elements of random sword-wielding bad guys jumping over fences, thereby giving us a definitive Batman. But, even as we see thugs jumping out of places they couldn't possibly be, we are so engrossed in the world that we believe it, and who doesn't want to see Batman give a roundhouse to the jaw anyway.I've said enough. Batman (1989) will always be the best Batman film, except for maybe Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, a movie based on The Animated Series that will never get the credit it deserves. Music, shots, acting, action, humor, drama, excellent writing, it's all there. It is the best comic book movie for one reason: It's NOT a comic book movie. It's a drama that just so happens to have Batman as its main character and that makes it not only a great film, but also the perfect homage to the character. I hope Nolan and Bale can win me over just the same. I think it's possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great as a movie, not so great as a Batman movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you had asked me about this movie five years ago. I would have said that this was one of the greatest comic-book movies ever made. The musical score was amazing, the Prince soundtrack was funky, Tim Burton's Gotham perfectly dark and a script filled with gadgets, witty dialogue and action.Having just re-watched the film yesterday, my opinion has changed little. The Prince songs sound dated, the action sequences look cheap but generally it still stands up as a great film, especially when compared to some of the junk that comes out these days.However since then I have read a lot of Batman comics and graphic novels, both old and new and some things just don't sit right.When I first watched this film aged ten. I had been raised on the 60s Batman TV show. While Jack Nicholson is great as The Joker, the script doesn't come close to showing how truly psychopathic he is. The character, while having great one-liners seems campy rather than crazy, for instance when The Joker vandalizes the museum to the tune of "Party Man" by Prince, with dancing hence men and purple gas it resembles something from the TV show.Batman himself also seems strangely incompetent. This is the "world's greatest detective" we are seeing here, he seems easily out-witted and behaves out of character (taking Vicky Vale to the bat-cave?) and his gadgets, which great do not seem very reliable (bat-wing is shot down with a handgun?).Don't think I dislike this film. Michael Keaton is easily the best actor for Batman and Jack Nicholson puts in a brilliant performance with the material made available to him.If you have never read a Batman comics in your life, go see this film as soon as possible, you'll love it. If you have you'll still have a blast, just try to ignore that nagging feeling in the back of your mind that something is not right!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie for every BatFan! A Must See! It included all of the elements Batman is known for, and the most popular and well-known criminal, The Joker, who is played by Jack Nicholeson. This movie is the 'darkest' of this series, but the best movie for authenticity, and storyline. The others are all about comic lines at the right places, and fight scenes. This movie may be frightening for children though, so be forewarned. Jack Nicholeson and Michael Keaton work marvelously together and put together one heck of a movie. The Batman is at his finest in this movie. This movie also lets you explore the BatCave, and The BatMobile and other BatGadgets better than any of the other movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You can call me... Joker. And as you can see, I'm a lot happier!" -The Joker (Jack Napier)Batman is dark, entertaining, and in some ways funny. The plot of course concerns Batman, with a secondary life as a billionaire who tries to rid crime from the streets of Gotham. Soon, a mysterious Joker (AKA Jack Napier) and his thugs work they're way up for fame as a vigilante. Once Joker offers to give the citizens of Gotham plenty of money, the citizens turn on Batman and start trusting Joker. Now it is up to Batman to stop the Joker, and confront his past where Jack Napier murdered his parents.This is one of the best superhero films ever made. Michael Keaton gives a very worthy performance as Bruce Wayne (Batman), and Nicholson is excellent as The Joker, earning a whooping 60 million for his role. Tim Burton does a great job of direction and the whole design of Gotham is exactly the way I wanted. All in all, a great film and getting more memorable as years go by.9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best superhero films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was completely obsessed with Batman as a 4 year old kid. He was my idol. While this isn't the case anymore, I still think that Batman is one of the best superhero films ever committed to film. It looks a bit dated next to the more recent Spiderman and X-Men movies but it's still a lot of fun to watch.Batman has a number of strengths. It's well directed by Tim Burton who delivers some great action scenes during the film. He also keeps the movie flowing well, never letting the pace drag too much. The acting is also top-notch. Michael Keaton was great as Batman! Even though he was basically a supporting actor, he still gives a good performance. I doubt that any other actor will handle the Batman role as well as he did (Val Kilmer and George Clooney didn't!). Even better than Keaton though was Jack Nicholson, who flat-out steals the movie playing the maniacal Joker. It's not the first time Nichlson has given an over-the-top performance so he has no trouble carrying his part. Kim Basinger also gave a decent performance as Vicki Vale, although the romantic subplot between her character and Bruce Wayne wasn't made believable. Anton Furst created an excellent set-design, which is one of the most striking things about the movie; Gotham City is turned into a bleak, grim crime pit in which good is nowhere to be seen.Batman isn't exactly without it's problems. The most obvious is that the Joker is way too central to the scheme of things. Not only does the character get more screen time, but he's also much more interesting than Batman. The script is a bit thin as well. I was certainly drawn into the action but at the same time I found it difficult to tell what was going on.If you can ignore the few errors, Batman will really entertain. It's a great adaptation of a classic comic book hero. If you can only watch one Batman in the series then this is definitely the one to see!Star Rating: 4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secret of Bat appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superman talks trash about being a pacifist, but he ends up defeating evil with a well-timed punch - just like any other super hero. Batman talks no trash about pacifism whatsoever; he's like Rudy Giuliani gone rogue, cleaning up the streets of Gotham without exhibiting a whit of sympathy for his tormented foes. It's this honesty and consistency that makes Batman so much more popular than his flag-waving compatriot these days. Ours is a generation that likes to see our super heroes kick *** without making apologies.This movie is suitably dark to suit the no-nonsense persona of the Dark Knight; the sets and costumes all look exactly right, contributing to an oppressive, film-noir like atmosphere. Sadly, the intrusive romance drags it down; Basinger is frankly woeful, and Batman actually works best without a girlfriend. He's just too brooding and ultra-masculine to be doing any serious wooing. Whereas Spider-Man and Superman have famous love interests, Batman usually goes it solo, or at best he flirts with a super-villainess while he hurls Batarangs at her. So, Vicki Vale could go.Nicholson is of course great as the Joker, but his gangster alter-ego is crushingly dull. "The Killing Joke" featured a much better (and even more cinematic) origin for the character. And why on earth does this mighty villain turn into a patently unconvincing cartoon at the moment of his death? I guess they couldn't drag Nicholson into a bluescreen studio to do a proper fall.All in all, not bad, but not a classic either. Burton is dying to inject his usual brand of carnival freakshow mayhem into this movie, but he stops short. The sequel, "Batman Returns," is more honest. In that film, Burton plays with the formula in a way that is not necessarily more faithful to the comic, but more faithful to his own interests, and the result is a follow-up that actually tops the original.</fullReview>

While trying to stop the man responsible for his parent's deaths (which triggered him to fight crime), the villain Jack Napier falls into toxic chemicals but emerges as The Joker: an insane criminal who is bent on destroying the city.The look of the film captures the hero's lifestyle perfectly, with it's dark shadows and bizarre buildings. This is a common theme in Tim Burton films and is one of the things that make his films unique. here, although, it becomes a little excessive (although not NEARLY as excessive as "Batman: Returns"). The performances are all quite good despite Jack Nicholson going a little over the top. But we might not focus on his performance as much if Tim Burton had realized the film was called "Batman", and not "Joker". The Joker gets way too much screen time when the relationship between Bruce Wayne and his girlfriend could become developed. Clearly Burton thought that the bad guys were more interesting, when he should have realized Batman was suppose to be the main attraction.The special effects, while they're still exciting, are unfortunately a little dated. The first sight of the (best) Batmobile will still send cinematic shivers down your spine!All in all, the film is still entertaining, but there was no where near enough screen time for the Bat.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive Batman of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BATMAN C-126min (1989)***1/2 D:Tim Burton. Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Bassinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough, Jack Palance, Jerry Hall. The blockbuster fantasy epic is a dark, intense variation of Bob Kane's comic book of The Dark Knight of Gotham City is in a battle of wits against the Joker. Still packs a wallop after all these years with it's Academy-Award winning set design and Danny Elfman's dark terrific score and there's a lot more to love about this film.BATMAN was never influenced by the campy 60's T.V. series but by the dark, revisionist graphic novels of the mid-80's by Frank Miller but the prime influence of this film was the landmark graphic novel, the groundbreaking "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller in 1986. The casting of The Dark Knight caused a major controversy in the fan community during that time with Michael Keaton, a light comic actor brought to play the Caped Crusader. Fans objected to it but Keaton delivered a dark, great performance as billionare- playboy Bruce Wayne, and the mysterious dark, grim vigilantie masked Batman and Jack Nicholson certainly delivers as the Joker.BATMAN no doubt influenced Hollywood into massive media campaigns of various franchise films and turned the comic-book film genre into dark, cynical films we have today. Prehaps the most memorable aspect of the production is Anton Furst's Academy-Award winning art direction which he turned Gotham City into an urban hellhole and alongside Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" and Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" as one of the cinema's most atmospheric places ever created. Burton specializes with the mood dealing with art direction, photography, and the visuals of turning Gotham City into a 1940's urban wasteland. Alongside that is Danny Elfman's terrific score as he vividly creates an atmospheric, dramatic score dealing with a vigilantie scaring criminals in an underworld of crime atmosphere.BATMAN is one of the better adaptations of to date since Richard Donner's "Superman" of comics. Burton creates a city where crime and danger always rule in this film and and that grim, masked hero always defeats the world of crime in this film and is quite possibly even by today's standards it's distinction as the darkest Hollywood blockbuster to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despites its problems, Batman is still extremely entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *** out of ****. The past four years have been a comeback for superhero movies. Since 2000, we have seen X-Men 1 and 2, Spider-Man, Hulk, Daredevil, and coming this summer Spider-Man II. But probably one of the most successful of these superhero movies is the first Batman. However, even though it earned 200+ million in 1989, it may be the most misunderstood of all the superhero movies. The reason some people are put off by this film is the dark tone of it. With the exception of Hulk, no superhero film that I have seen is as dark as Batman. But the tone completely fits with the movie. I mean the story of Bruce Wayne is a tragedy. What other way would have been suitable? Absolutely none. One of the advantages of having a darker film like this is that Tim Burton is the director. Arguably his biggest strength is his visual sense for films. That is fully on display here. Batman is loaded with atmosphere. It also has an extremely memorable gothic set design. It is really disappointing that after Batman Returns, Gotham became a sunnier place because it is much more memorable as dark place. The acting is a bit of a mixed bag. Michael Keaton turns in an effective performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Out of the three actors who played Batman, Keaton was definitely the best. Jack Nicholson, who received a whopping 60 million for his role, is very impressive as the joker and has the films strangest line ("Ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight"). However, Kim Basinger was the least impressive of all Batman's love interest. She gets plenty of chances to scream but when she acts she is clearly horrible. Her screaming actually becomes grating after awhile. In fact, another weird flaw of the film is that there is basically no reaction when she finds out Bruce is Batman. The film also does go on a little long. This happens near the end. Theres no doubt it is extremely entertaing. I do not think it is the best superhero film or the best Batman film (I sort of prefer Batman Returns). But Batman is definitely worth watching and possibly worth having on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe I grew up with Michael Keaton as Batman...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Born in 1983, I was unaware of the shock that fans had over Michael Keaton being cast as Batman. Therefore, I was able to enjoy him in this film without hassle. I must admit I was actually shocked to find out that some of his earlier efforts were in fact comedies (course I was only 7 then). Keaton did a surprisingly good job of balancing the everyman millionaire with the dark avenger of night, but I also must admit that he is overshadowed and eclipsed by Jack Nicholson's over the top Joker. Jack's always fun to watch, even if he does coast on his Jack persona sometimes.Like most superhero films, "Batman 1" covers Bruce Wayne/Batman's origins and sets him up against his most well known foe, the Joker. The plot isn't always clear though in where it's going. Bruce's romance with photographer Kim Basinger kind of slows things down and takes away from the more interesting and complex story that is Batman. Meanwhile, the Joker's exact goal is unclear except that he wants to turn Gotham city into an even bigger hell hole than it already is, and naturally Batman stops him. The fight scenes lack a certain energy, save when one of the Joker's thugs magically appears in the alley fight with two swords. Then there's a rather embarrassing scene in the Wizard of Oz like church tower when the Joker's thugs just show up out of the wood-work to attack Batman and one of them, a big black guy with sunglasses, just starts beating the crap out of Batman and Batman makes no effort whatsoever to fight back, except for kicking the thug in the shoulder and banging his head into a bell twice. That scene always bothered me; when exactly did it become OK for one of the most famous comic book heroes of all time to just let a low level thug kick his ass? Well, Batman did send the thug falling to his death, so I guess I can live with it.Some have called this film a spectacular black comedy, and it may be the only superhero film to deserve that title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was the Summer of 89</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aah, the summer of 1989, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Licence to Kill and the big BIG film of 1989.... Batman. This film was huge, hyped up all year in the media, with stories on just how much Jack Nicholson was getting paid to play the Joker and was Michael Keaton really going to be playing Batman! That was the biggest shock to me, I couldn't really see Keaton as Batman but he proved me wrong as he was great as the caped crusader. Also I was brought up on repeats of the 60's Batman show so I wasn't prepared for the darkness of the films as I never read the comic, but still I stood in line in my new Batman t-shirt with the oh so cool redesigned Batman logo on it on the first nights screening, and it was a long line there was no doubt in my mind that this was a massive film. But was the film any good? Yes, it is without doubt a great film, I appreciate it more now though than when I first left the cinema on that summers evening of 1989. I think Tim Burton was a great choice to direct Batman, I only wish he directed all the others that followed and not just Batman Returns as the last two were terrible. Also I wish Keaton made more as in this film he makes a perfect Batman, plus Nicholson steals the show as the Joker. Kim Basinger won the role as Vicky Vale after original choice Sean Young couldn't appear and she does a fine job of screaming and looking great! This film is long overdue a proper Special Edition DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every Decade has its memorable movies, and the 80's had Star Wars (Episodes V and VI), Aliens, Die Hard, and Indiana Jones, among others. This movie was definitely a great movie. Everything came together to form an almost perfect blend to create the comic city of Gotham. The acting was great in all parties, the music was terrific, the cinematography was awesome, and the visual effects were outstanding. The Bat mobile chase, axis chemicals explosion, and the vandelization of the museum, were all memorable scenes. But nothing was as insane as the man himself: Jack Nicholson. He's one of the most gifted actors ever, (12 academy award nominations) and was the best comic villain ever (Made AFI's Top 50 villains.) WB spent a lot of money on this project and put it all in the hands of director Tim Burton. A gamble, maybe, but did it pay off? I think so. This is even today probably his best movie and his first really dark movie. His Dark knight makes the old batman obsolete. This in my opinion is the best comic book movie ever made, and is still visually impressive today. The plot was deeper and more meaningful then other movies of the genre. Unfortunately all of the sequels got steadily worse. Batman Returns was almost as good, but Batman Forever wasn't nearly as good, and Batman and Robin just stunk. Danny Elfman composed a brilliant score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly, and I think its one of his best scores. It probably is the best super hero score. I haven't seen enough super hero movies to tell you. Hopefully Mr. Burton makes some more super hero movies, but until he does we still have the best in the genre! How it is so low on the IMDB is a mystery to me and I hope it moves up the ranks some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year was 1989, before the internet rumors or information was available. People found out about this devilishly clever film through the almighty, "TEASER". That used to be the way films made thier first impact on a viewer - and Batman did not dissapoint those who had been waiting for the long awaited "Batman" film. No Adam West, no "BLAM!" or "WHAP!" . . . just a very fine director and a phenomonal cast, which included Jack Nicholoson in one of his best in recent years. A dark twist on Batman and a very evil Joker, make for one very interesting movie. This is by far the best "comic-to-film" peice, that has splashed on the big screen. The first Batman in this series, I give a very big "thumbs up".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great superhero movie, one of the greatest in the genre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!In a city overridden with crime, a man who lost his parents to a mindless street crime, is carrying out a life long vendetta against criminals. This man, of course, is Batman, and it isn't to long before he meets his arch-nemesis, the Joker.As a bit of a sucker for superhero films, I am usually easily pleased with films from this genre. Batman, however, is easily one of the more impressive films based on a comic book hero that has ever been made, and probably, that will ever be made in the years to come. Although I have never been a large reader of the Batman comics, this film seemed to capture the essence of the character that featured in the few books that I did read, and added a lot more.Firstly, credit must go to Tim Burton, whose vision of Gotham City is incredible, which seems to combine elements of realism with a darkness that complements the city's Dark Knight perfectly, unlike the Gotham City of Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin, which looked just plain ridiculous.The stars of this film, namely the actors who play Batman and the Joker, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, are almost perfect in their depictions of these classic characters, especially Nicholson, who truly was the star of the show. Keaton was also good as Batman and alto-ego Bruce Wayne, although his performance was somewhat shadowed by Nicholson's performance, that was complemented even more with virtually every good line given to the Joker. Not that this was a bad thing though, as Nicholson delivered them all perfectly.Kim Basinger as Bruce Wayne/Batman's love interest was also a good choice, although her performance was not a great one compared to the two leading men. Supporting characters of Commissioner Gordon, Alfred, Harvey Dent, and Carl Grissom were also well performed by Pat Hingle, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance, respectfully.The storyline of this film is not extremely great. It doesn't need to be. Centred on Gotham City being threatened by the Joker and the people of Gotham City not sure on whether or not Batman is good or evil, it features several confrontations between Batman and the Joker, from the first creation of the Joker when Batman fails to save Jack Napier from falling into a vat of chemicals, to the final battle atop Gotham City Cathedral. The grand master plan of the Joker's also doesn't seem like anything any sane, or even insane criminal would try to do (launching gas into Gotham's streets to kill thousands of people with no money demand or anything similar), but hey, this is based on a comic book, and if anything, makes the Clown Prince of Crime just that little bit more evil.Danny Elfman's score for the film is the final gem in the crown of this film, which must have come close to being nominated for an Oscar. I remember humming the main theme for Batman for days after first seeing it. It complements the characters and situations perfectly and the main theme should have a place as one of the most distinctive movie themes of all time, along with themes such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones.With all said and done, Batman is a classic film, not like The Godfather, or Citizen Kane, but a classic in the sense that it is great entertainment with a great cast, that can provide enjoyment for people of most ages, provided that they have a sense of imagination and are willing to let themselves be taken on a great ride of a film. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Accept no other substitutions.What is arguably the best Batman movie ever is indeed the best Batman movie ever. Take your classic Batman franchise... add a little Jack Nicholson... a little Micheal Keaton... and a little Tim Burton. Voila!You have BATMAN: one of many similarly titled movies that is actually worth watching. Burton's Gotham is a very dark and visually stunning backdrop to this twisted tale of the Dark Knight. Adding to the rich, multi-layered atmosphere of the movie is Danny Elfman's haunting score... which unfortunately (like all of Danny Elfman's other compositions) is very under-appreciated. And the cast? Allow me to be repetative... it's the best of the best. I cannot say enough about Micheal Keaton's fantastic portrayal of Mr. Wayne, and as far as JACK goes... his turn as the Joker is freakin' classic. To quote the devil himself: "Never rub another man's rhubarb!"It's one of MY top films of all time. It should be one of YOURS too. *menacing look*A definite 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One reviewer down below said, "all style, no substance"!!! Talk about shooting a shotgun and missing the whole barn!!Let me tell you what you missed. This film is analogous to World War II. It's an American-British alliance forced into despicable fascistic behavior in order to crush the Axis powers. You might have heard of this name, Hitler?????? Nicholson's Joker's television takeover "I am not the terrorist, Batman Is" speech is lifted directly from the same speech that Hitler made over the radio 60 years ago referrring to a terrorist named Winston Churchill. This world has gone out of scale and human beings have been reduced to cartoon figures, overwhelmed by the out-scale world they built not realizing what was happenning. Joker embraces this new fascistic world of evil and gratification. Batman copes with it, never understanding why young Jack Napier wasted his parents for no more than a whim. Art museums are supposed to be art museums, not privileged snooty restaurants for the well connected. The media is SUPPOSED to take sides against evil (Robert Wuhl), not be fascinated by it (Kim Bassinger). Police Commissioner's are not supposed to be familiar with the dice tables. This film is fascism vs. fascism in a world gone out of scale. Only the tormented Batman lowers himself to his enemies level (exactly what WE did in WW-2) so as to defeat him and then afterwards, try to reclaim his humanity. The film also works as mass entertainment. "What kind of a world do we live in where a man dressed up as a Bat steals all of my press?" This is a cinematic Masterwork up there with Citizen Kane and best of John Ford. Sorry some of you didn't pick up on that. You missed it.Your loss, not ours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an avid comic book fan...I highly anticipated this movie for several months when it came out in 1989. When I saw it on opening night, it was the biggest disappointment of my movie-viewing life. Why am I writing about this now? I read a recent article that called Batman one of the best superhero movies ever. What is wrong with some people?In my opinion, this movie ushered in an era of movies with all style and no substance. Tim Burton is an awful, overrated director that should be forbidden from making another superhero film without strict supervision from the producers. Anyone notice how he also screwed up Planet of the Apes? How did he get a rep as a good director???Where do I start with the flaws of Batman? How about top billing going to Jack Nicholson/The Joker? Hello!!! This is a movie about BATMAN!!!Yet the Joker was in the forefront of this movie. No attention was paid to how Bruce Wayne trained his mind and body to become the Dark Knight detective. As shown in this movie, all it takes is some money to develop a few cool weapons and an armored suit to become Batman. Anyone could do it.The movie actually bored me. Batman's appearances were so few and far between that I remember nearly falling asleep in the theater. Michael Keaton gave a decent performance as Bruce Wayne, but was still miscast.To prove that his horrid direction was no fluke, Burton followed up with the even more horrendous sequel, "Batman Returns". For great comic book adaptations, check out "Spider-Man", "Superman", "X-Men", "X-2", "Blade", and yes, even "Daredevil". "The Hulk" is also much better than this drivel. Hopefully, Warner Brothers will start the Bat-saga from scratch and give us the real take on the character. Just don't let Burton near the set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the failure of the last two Superman movies in the 1980's, all was lost in comic book movies until Tim Burton decided to revise the franchise in his latest version of Batman.Crime is up in Gotham City, the cops are too late to arrive on the scene and yet a creature who dresses like a bat is killing all of the thugs in the corrupt city. Michael Keaton brings the darkness of Bruce Wayne, a new take for a comedic actor whose work included Mr. Mom and the title character of Beetlejuice. He does a descent job and trying to bring the likeness of the Wayne character even though Burton doesn't give too much detail about how the playboy billionaire starts out.Jack Nicholson is the heart and soul of "Batman" as the villain Joker (A.K.A. Jack Napier) a sadistic criminal who likes to torture people for laughs and giggles while raging a war in Gotham City. His henchman are clowns and thugs who wear glasses and leather jackets while delivering the punchlines as if he was born to play this title.Kim Basinger is the damsel-in-distress, Vicki Vale, a new reporter for Gotham City who has heard the rumors about the Batman terrorizing the city. In one scene, she's Joker's hostage and is rescued by the caped crusader before realizing that the hero is not what he seems to be.The set designs are truly amazing where not only does Tim Burton try to bring a dark side in Gotham compared to the campy TV version along with mixing an 80's atmosphere with 1940's gangster clothing. Danny Elfman's score is truly amazing as it is one of the most thrilling and engaging in a Tim Burton film along with the special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keaton lent a lot of emotion to the role, and broods with the best of the, and Burton worked fairly well to work the cinematography to mask Keaton's smallness while in the suit, as well as create a dark atmosphere appropriate for a Batman movie. That aside, I could never make full acceptance of Keaton as Batman. As a staunch Bat-fan, the main reason I like him is because of the tenacious work he put into becoming who he is. Without a sense that he "Trains his body to physical perfection" (Detective Comics #33), the integrity is missing in the role.Danny Elfman's music is stirring and intense, Nicholson's Joker was superb, but the afore mentioned weak points leave me to call this (and the other live action Batfilms) an underachievement.Burton called himself justified because he felt that a muscle man need not dress up as a bat to scare criminals, but only wear a ski mask---but I know enough about the criminal world that street punks aren't respecters of person. He said that Keaton was the only actor capable of giving the character emotion--a bold statement coming from a journeyman director with only two feature films under his belt who just happened to have worked with Keaton before.I really feel that because of this warped vision of my favorite fictional icon, that I've been cheated out getting Batman as I know and love him. My only hope is that Chris Nolan's project gives me that very thing.</fullReview>

It is a bit dark which of course happens when Tim Burton is directing however the film is not a Tim Burtonish as Batman Returns and has not much of that Tim Burton sets like in his other films mainly because Warner Bros didn´t want it which I agree with because this films is perfect the way it is.

		<fullReview>While this movie was leap ahead for comic book movies (and the comic book industry) it is so flawed when standing on its own.Jack Nicholson getting first billing should be the first clue. This movie is basically structured to tell the story of a criminal, Jack Napier, whose criminal past catches up with him when one of the victims of his crimes comes back for vengeance. The story of Bruce Wayne becoming Batman is only the secondary story here.While this movie did prove the general public that comic books were not just a reflection the 1960's camp version of Batman, it's no wonder Michael Keaton got out when he did. He was just sick of being a title character who was being overshadowed in his own movie.</fullReview>

Batman is not just a guy who runs around in tights and plays tennis throughout the day. He is a tortured soul who avenges the death of his parents vowing the words "Never Again". He used his resources to become the best at everything to hit back and remove the criminal element. Sure some artistic licensing was in the movie with Joker killing his parents and so on but it captured the feel which inspired the Batman animated series which has since spawned a new age of superhero cartoons without the campiness. With great performances from Nicholson and Keaton it is still one of my faves.</fullReview>

WB spent a lot of money on this project and put it all in the hands of director Tim Burton. A gamble, but did it pay off? I think so. This is even today probably his best movie and his first really dark movie. His Dark knight makes the old batman obsolete. This in my opinion is the best comic book movie ever made, and is still visually impressive today. The plot was deeper and more meaningful then other movies of the genre. Unfortunately all of the sequels got steadily worse. Batman Returns was almost as good, but Batman Forever wasn't nearly as good, and Batman and Robin just stunk. Danny Elfman composed a brilliant score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly. Hopefully Mr. Burton makes some more super hero movies.</fullReview>

He has once again proved that he a magnificent actor. This movie's success is directly attributed to his veteran superstardom and performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is what I call a great superhero flick. I remembered feeling brutally robbed after seeing Batman Forever in the theatre (to this day I still cringe whenever I see Jim Carrey in his green spandex), and needed an emotional "healing" so immediately I rushed to my local videostore to rent this definitive version of our caped crusader. Tim Burton deftly combines style with great character drama, and I believe this is why the movie was such a big success.While everyone instantly knew that they had a winner in Jack Nicholson after seeing his antics onscreen, it was Michael Keaton's brooding performance that won the hearts of fans. Forget Val Kilmer's stupid pouts, and forget George Clooney's lack of one. Keaton was the underestimated underdog as almost everyone didn't expect him to pull off the role of Bruce Wayne so well. While a natural like Christopher Reeve is every inch the dashing Superman, Keaton's appearance is much more deceiving. He is not tall, his hair is curly, and he doesn't have a big superhero jaw. But boy, when he puts on the costume he literally BECAME the very persona of the dark knight. His voice has just the right tone, and his eyes glares through his mask like a hawk on a prowl for street thugs. What can I say, except that I heard Dave Letterman had once said on TV about Keaton "Well to me, he is always going to be THE Batman," this sums it up quite well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was dark, action-packed, and visually stunning art direction of Gotham City. Michael Keaton the best Batman of all. He's way better than Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and Adam West! Kim Basinger was beautiful as Vicky Vale and of course The Jack Man! Nicholson was funny and outstanding as The Joker. He and Keaton stole the movie! Tim Burton does a magnificient job directing Batman! He creates a darkly wonderful world for this movie and makes it not only a cool superhero movie, but a great movie! I cannot wait for "Batman 5", which the director is for sure to be Christopher Nolan (directed Memento and Insomnia). I'm glad that he might direct.

		<shortDescription>THIS BEST MOVIE EVER MADE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm Batman!" And yes, he was. Michael Keaton proved thousands wrong (including this webmaster) with his dark, brooding portrayal of the Dark Knight. Director Tim Burton brought the Bat back to his original dark form in this terriffic film.Set in an ageless time period, we find a crime-ridden Gotham City that is overran with mobsters and street punks. Two reporters, Viki Vale and Alexander Knox are hot on the heals of a story on the mythical "six-foot bat." Meanwhile, high-level mobster Jack Napier, the "number one guy" to boss Carl Grissom, secretly plans on stealing away the boss' job--and his girlfriend. When Napier's intentions are discovered, Grissom plans a set-up at Axis Chemicals. Tipped by the crime-boss himself, both the police and the Batman move to capture Napier and his gang. While trying to escape, the Batman corners Napier and through accident and fate, Napier falls into a vat of acid...and the Joker is born!The Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, soon falls for reporer Vicki Vale; as does the Joker who is now waging an assault on Gotham. The Joker has planted a nerve toxin, "smilex," in everyday grooming products striking terror throughout the city. The Batman soon discovers the secret of the Joker's plan and supplies it to police and the press--thus saving the city. Revenge on the Bat now becomes the Clown Prince of Crime's number one goal.When Bruce discovers a dark secret in Napier's and his past, a final confrontation between the two is on.Overall, Burton does a great job bringing Batman back "to the dark." Up until this film, many people's idea of the character was the 1960's TV series. The picture does have its' problems. Commissioner Gordon's relationship with Batman is never developed. Batman is shown shooting guns from a plane and killing--something that he would actually never do. At times, Batman is a secondary character to the Joker. And to the horror of many fans, Vicki Vale is let into the Batcave and discovers Bruce's secret.Burton's direction is classic Burton: dark, off-beat, and moody. Nicholson is great as the Joker--a bit over-the-top at times though. And Micheal Keaton does a great job in "both" roles: Bruce and Batman. He plays Waye as constantly depressed and always seemingly preoccupied. With the body-armor costume and camera angles, Keaton's does well as Batman--although he seems a bit physical slight at times. Overall, a very good movie for both Bat and movie fans.MOHAMUD score: 5 out of 5 StarsRemembering BATMANI first heard about this film in a mall bookstore, reading some sci-fi mag, in 1988. I was about 22 years old and still in college (DAMN! Has it been THAT long?). I remember reading that Jack Nicholson would play the Joker and Micheal Keaton was signed to be Batman. And I was p***ed! My first thought was that it was going to be like the old TV series. See, I liked Keaton. I had been a fan of his since NIGHT SHIFT. But I just could not see him playing The Batman. Anyway, I filed it away in the back of my mind and went about with my business.Then sometime in the spring of '89, I just happened to be watching ENERTAINMENT TONIGHT, and I got my first glimpse of Keaton as Batman. I thought, "Damn, he looks pretty good!" The costume was WAY cooler that I had thought it would be. So I started thinking that maybe he could pull this off. Then the whole protest about Keaton playing Batman hit the media. But at the same time, Bat-hype and Bat-mania began sweeping the country. There were Batman tee-shirts and toys, etc. everywhere you went. I got on the bandwagon and bought a Batman tee--and I still have the thing! The build-up for the June 23rd premiere was growing like a tidal wave.I graduated college in May of '89 and got a coaching/teaching job in Houston. As happy as I was to have my first "real" job, I had bats on my brain! I could not wait to see this movie! So, on the evening of June 23, 1989, my then girlfriend and I head on over to the local mall/theater to catch the early everning feature. The freaking line was HUGE!! Luckily, it is being shown on two screens. So we are waiting in line, chatting with the people around us, blah, blah, blah. That was fine and good--I wanted to get my ass in that seat and see this damn film!! The line starts to move. We make it to the box-office window. I get our tickets. It is ON!!We sit down in the theater and watch the trailers, the concession stand plugs, yada, yada. The eternity! Then the screen goes black. The first sounds of Danny Elfman's theme starts to play. "A Peters-Guber Production...A Tim Burton Film...BATMAN!!!" Yes! I was finally watching the movie that I had been waiting months to see! I was a kid again. And that is what I love about Batman. It doesn't matter that I am now 30-something. That I have a job, kids, resposibility. When I put in that tape or DVD, I AM a kid again! And now with my kids, I am passing that on to them. Both are Bat-fans!Anyway, back to '89 and the film. I loved it! I thought Keaton did a hell of a job and Nicholson WAS the Joker. I ended up seeing BATMAN about 5 times that summer. I got the video later that fall. I must have seen this film well over a hundred times! But when I slip it in to watch. And I hear that theme start to play. I AM a kid again! And isn't that what life is all about? THIS MY FAVE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film just before my first year of junior high. Boy was I impressed. I remember being mesmerized by Jack Nicholson's Joker (especially since I had read Batman The Killing Joke and A Death in the Family only weeks before). Nicholson is just an amazingly talented man and I believe he is the only actor could portray the Joker so effectively. At the time I also liked Keaton's Batman, but later I thought it just doesn't seem plausible that he has the physical skills that Batman's supposed to behave. Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale was great. It should be noted that her character was also based on another of the comic's female characters, a lady by the name of Silver St. Cloud. Basinger's character would in fact have been called Silver but she hadn't been in the comics since the late seventies, so they called her Vicki Vale, the name of a character who had been appearing recently in the comics. The sets, props, and special effects were all great for 1989 and Tim Burton and the late Anton Furst did a masterful job in bringing to life a dark and menacing Gotham City. When I first saw it I would've definitely given it a 10. Today I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Best Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In today's world, we are now in the midst of a super hero movie revolution. We have seen comic books such as Blade, the X-men, Spider-Man, and now Daredevil made into movies. And while most of these movies are great (with the exception of Daredevil because I haven't seen it yet), there is one movie in particular that came out in 1989 that stands head and shoulders above the rest of the pack.Batman is a dark movie with dark characters in it. It isn't light-hearted nor are there amazing CGI fighting scenes as there are in Spider-man. However, there were four main people involved with the movie that really made it work.First, the director Tim Burton. Burton is a dark director with a distinct vision of the world that makes his style easy to separate from the rest of Hollywood. If Batman were directed by anybody else when it was made, it would have bombed miserably. With Burton at the helm, the audience was not only able to witness Batman take on the Joker, but they also got a good look at the psychology of good vs. evil. This was an approach that works with Batman because when the utility belt and bullet-proof costume are taken away from him, Bruce Wayne is an ordinary man with no super powers like those possessed by Superman and Spider-man.Second and third, the actors Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. While Keaton gave a great performance as the psychologically scarred caped-crusader, Nicholson stole the show with his rendition of the Joker. Could anybody have played these roles any better? Keaton's private and reserved approach to playing Bruce Wayne was well done, and Nicholson is just his same brilliant self throughout the movie. This duo had a great chemistry that could not be repeated with other actors in the three Batman sequels.Forth, Danny Elfman. The music that was composed by Danny Elfman gave the movie itself a dark sound that helped set the tone for this dark movie. Elfman and Burton have worked together on many projects before and after this movie, but it is Batman that remains one of the best works for both men. Elfman's somber musical tone not only reinforces the dark aspect of the movie, but in some cases, it stands out on its own.With the presence of these four people within this movie, there is no doubt that Batman will withstand the test of time as being one of the best superhero movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Real" Connection between Batman and Lord of the Rings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok this review is going to be a little weird but I think you might understand what I'm trying to get at. Today as I was watching the Two Towers at the movie theater I had a thought that just quickly popped in my head. A little kid was crying in the theater durring one of the scarier scenes and needed to be escorted out. I thought to myself this is not a kids movie and then I remembered something that kept me from getting too upset: "the film is based on a story that was intended for children." Despite the fact the film maker, Peter Jackson, chose not to spoon feed us a ton of sugar and rather present the material in a mature manner. The manner is not perverse or disturbing but thoughtful and intelligent. I'm convinced that this film maker at one time asked the question: how could this story work in a 3D world, captured on film.The feeling I get when I see the Two Towers is the same feeling I get with the first BATMAN. What Tim Burton, Sam Hamm, and Peters and Guber set out to do in the first Batman was to answer that same question. In fact for me Batman was the bench mark in which I judged other fantasy films. Batman was different from its sequels and other comic book films. The hero and villain appear more mythical than comic and despite the surreal surroundings the villainy was real, the emphasis on evil was real, and the problems that victims suffer in its wake was real. It made me as an audience member feel that despite the fantastical location and extreme wardrobe I could relate to the hero. Batman was not portrayed as the typical super rich athlete that had nothing better to do than fight crime, which later became the angle the in the film series, but as a man who just happened to be rich and was dealing with mental problems that a grown man might have if his parents had been murdered at such an early age. He was a hero for an age less innocent. Even though Batman was intended for youths the film maker, Tim Burton, did not let that be a factor in his portrayal of the story. It was too bad that he went overboard in Batman Returns wit the macabre and caused WB executive to go another direction with Batman Forever.There was a real balance in the first Batman, between the fantasy world and real world, that worked. That balance is present in all four star fantasy films since the late 80's and is present in the Lord of the Rings movies. The characters' challenges in that film, are no more fantastical than they were in Batman or for that matter in the world we live in today. There is good and there is evil and despite it all anyone with a will and a good heart can stand up and fight. It is when film makers remember that everyday reality they are able to make a connection with their audience no matter how imaginitive a world is. That is what Tim Burton did in Batman and that is what Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Superhero film to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burtons Batman is a shining example of what a superhero film should be. Forget trying to win the kiddies over with the stupid 'futuristic but still 1930's' cartoonish feel that has dogged the last few Batman films. Burton goes for the guts, with a dark and evil world inhabited with a psychopathic mad man who wants to kill as many people as possible and only an equally disturbed 'hero' to save the day. Let me say this only once, Tim Burtons Batman is NOT a kids film.Burton brings his quirky dark look (as seen in many of his other films, for example, Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow) to town in this feast for the eyes. The ears will also be treated with a superb dark soundtrack by the brilliant Danny Elfman. The casting is also good. Jack Nicholson especially gives a great over the top performance as the psychopathic killer known as the Joker, whist Keatin prooves that he really is the best Batman.After the success of Batman, Burton directed the sequel 'Batman Returns', which was also a fairly good movie. Things went downhill from that stage on, with Batman being turned from a dark and exciting film franchise into a childrens comedy with no real clue what it was doing. They should have quit when Burton did. The last two movies ruined the Batman name.In short, Batman is well worth the watch. So is Batman Returns. The two non Burton Batman films are absolute sh*t.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to sum Batman up in one word, that would be it - fantastic. It is, without a doubt, the best Batman film there has been, and credit must go to the director Tim Burton for really capturing the essence of the story. In all the other Batman films, bar Batman Returns, the whole image that has been presented has been over the top, and just like a comic book. Now, I know that this is how Batman originated, but that was not how he was supposed to be seen. Batman, as a superhero in general, is dark and sinister - a force that we do not understand, who appears in places that are unexpected. He is mysterious and Tim Burton is able to capture that in this film. His direction is faultless and that, mixed with the superb music score really helps to bring the idea of Batman and Gotham City alive.Michael Keaton must be one of the least likely of Batman's. His whole image is not one of a superhero, and yet, in my opinion he is the best there has been. He brings an innocence, and yet obvious intelligence to the character. We are able to distinguish between the hero side and the Bruce Wayne side, however, they are not so removed from one another it is unbelievable. He is powerful but not in an arrogant way, in short, the perfect image for Batman. Kim Basinger is also a worthy mention as she plays her part very well, adding to the film tremendously.However, although both Keaton and Basinger do superb jobs, the climax of the film for me has to be Jack Nicholson as the Joker. I am not normally a Nicholson fan, but in this film he never fails to bowl me over. The way he plays such an infamous and well established character is amazing, and the Joker is easily one of the best cartoon villains of all time. I cannot think of anyone who could have done it better. The way he moved, spoke and his general persona was flawless, and the way he delivers his lines never fails to amuse and astound me. If you want to see an example of acting at its best, this is it.In short, this movie is nothing short of fantastic and I recommend to anyone who likes a sense of adventure, humour and a good old fashioned battle between the very good, and the pure evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole point of Burton's Batman is lost on too many people. Some are looking for a complex( in style and presentation) unorthodox look at the caped crusader's tales which 'challenges' them whilst some are sadly looking for a piece completely loyal to the original comic books. The former got something like what they wanted in the good but prentious and 'less-fun' sequel whilst the later ( complaining about trivial aspects like 'the Joker never killed Batman's parents' and 'we are never told the Joker's real name' etc) will never be satisfied. Thankfully Burton decided to cater for the majority and combined his flair for the macabre and liking of dark gothic sets with 3-dimensional characters, adult violence( in that death is often the result of a violent confrontation unlike in the comic-books)and a grandiose look at Gotham City. Nicholson produces a career defining performance as the Joker( they've been looking for a way to bring the character back for years with the sequel baddies proving no where near as effective.) Keaton, a surprise choice for the lead role (taking into account that his previous role as the title character in another Burton picture -'BeetleJuice' had suggested abilities more suited to portraying the Joker)gives a splendid showing as the dark, and even sinister Batman/Bruce Wayne. Basinger as Vicki Vale, Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon and Billy-Dee Williams as Harvey Dent are also well cast. The big surprise though is Michael Gough as butler Alfred. In this understated role he shares the acting plaudits with Nicholson. However Mr Nicholson overshadows everything. Even the scenery. The producers must have really been gutted that they killed him off, especially considering how popular the character became. Did anyone else notice how similar the role of 'Two Face' in 'Batman Forever' was to the Joker? And finally to finish - What the hell happened to Vicki Vale in the sequels. The most annoying aspect about the three Batman sequels, the last two in particular, is their complete lack of respect for the concept of continuity. Anyway my rating........8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best of all the Batman movies because it portrays the character of Batman as the dark vengeful character that he is. There are many qualities that make it a great movie to watch. One feature is the cast which consists of Michael Keaton as the mysterious Batman, Jack Nicholson as the insane Joker and Kim Basinger as Bruce Wayne's love interest.The film is supported by an outstanding music score done by the talented Danny Elfman who has done many very memorable music tracks. This movie is nothing like the colorful television series of the 60's and is very loyal to the comic book, Tim Burton brings a new dimension to the Batman character by showing him as a human who is seeking revenge against any who commit crime.The scenery for this movie is great since it shows the darkness of the world Batman comes from. I feel this is how Batman should be and not like the version from the later films. Overall everything comes together in this movie, direction, cast, music and setting to create a truly magnificent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not quite good enough to be a mainstream classic, but better than a lot of movies, "Batman" is one of Tim Burton's most enduring films. While it has some dated model work, the overall pace and plot are very well done, especially considering the source material.Michael Keaton, as some have remarked, is about seven years too old for the role, but he plays it well nonetheless. Jack Nicholson, is, quite frankly, the Joker. I mean, look at his performance in "The Shining" - he brings the same incredible mayhem here. He goes over the top, yes, but the stinking character is supposed to be crazy. Kim Basinger is appealing, but ultimately forgettable, and Michael Gough (especially after doing every movie) __IS__ Alfred (he is also the voice of Cain in Diablo - SWEEEET).The animated series, of course, is better than any of the movies and live action stuff, so see Batman the Animated Series now!</fullReview>

Unfortunately this movie begins to fall apart about half way through and suffers from what I believe is the downfall of all the other Batman movies, that is the movie is more about the villain than Batman. All the Batman movies became a showcase for big name stars to strut their stuff as the villain and we never really get any character development of Bruce Wayne/Batman or to delve into his psyche, motivation and past. If Warner Brothers had handle this right they could have had an ongoing series of Batman movies, like the James Bond series.</fullReview>

I saw this film in full glory. I lived the hype, the excitement. I had no doubts in my mind that Michael Keaton would do a good job (was i the only one?). Batman blew me away. From its amazing begining, to the transformation of Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) into the Joker, until the Flugelhiem Museum scenes, and the amazing "Showdown" ending, Batman is an excelent treat.Its good to look at, but it doesnt seem to explore the main character (Bruce Wayne/Batman) and what makes him "tick", which is a shame, because it does try, but its main emphasis is with The Joker. The movie really does revolve around the Joker, and its a real shame, because Batman is used a support character in a lot of cases, and we rarely get to see him during the "much to be desired" middle section of the movie. Nevertheless, BATMAN shines as bright as any movie ever made. People will always compare BATMAN to its sequels, but in truth, this movie will always be a one of a kind piece, that captivated the world. Everytime i watch this film ,and the opening credits begin to roll, im transformed into a kid again, and that's what the movies are all about.****OUTOF*****Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant start to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1989 signalled the celluloid return of a popular comic book character, Batman. The new movie was intended to ignore the camp comedy of the popular 1966 TV series, and reinvent the Caped Crusader as the dark vigilante of the comic books. The Batman in this movie has no Robin and is a very brutal and no-nonsense figure. He was to remain like this for two movies under Tim Burton, before being lightened up considerably under new director Joel Schumacher.Set in the beleaguered, crime-ridden town of Gotham City, "Batman" begins with a clueless family wandering up the wrong alley looking for a taxi after a night out at the theatre. They are duly mugged by a pair of ruffians. As they go through their stash in a rooftop hideout, Batman (Michael Keaton) descends from the sky and dishes out some much-deserved punishment on the two of them before vanishing into the night.Meanwhile, city hoodlum Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) is set up by his boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), after sleeping with his girlfriend (Jerry Hall). During a raid at a chemical factory, Napier struggles with Batman before falling to his apparent death in a vat of acid. Napier survives, his skin white, his hair green and his face a permanent grin. He becomes the Joker, as he kills Grissom and takes over his criminal empire."Batman" is the most well thought-out of all of the Batman movies. The editing and plot are coherent and easy to follow, the sets are grim and daunting, and the music (from the start to finish) is pitch-perfect for the picture and wonderfully accentuates every scene. The action set-pieces fast-paced and exciting, with a brilliant finale atop a 1,000 foot tall cathedral.The performances are something of a mixed bag. Michael Keaton's much overlooked performance as Batman, and his alter-ego millionaire Bruce Wayne, lends a subtlety and depth to the picture. By the end a bruised and battered Batman has the audience on his side. Jack Nicholson, unfortunately, really overdoes it as the Joker. He's perfect at playing the sadistic villain, and has a really memorable wild cackle, but his character lacks a human dimension that would really round him out. Kim Basinger is adequate and does have some chemistry as Bruce Wayne's love interest, reporter Vicki Vale, but she could have been sexier and alot less shallow. Robert Wuhl, as Vale's fellow reporter, is here largely as comic relief but although he could have been funnier, his prescence brings an appropriately lighthearted touch to the picture. His best moment, though, is when he is being serious, as he reveals to Vicki Bruce Wayne's tragic childhood. Micheal Gough lends a kindly dignity to the role of Bruce Wayne's faithful butler.Director Tim Burton makes a good first stab at his first "Batman" movie. He would better himself in the sequel "Batman Returns" before leaving the series. In spite of a few flaws with acting and characterisation, "Batman" nevertheless emerges as a solid, coherent comic book picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I see this film I realize how well done it is. It does have it's occasional flaws, but over-all, it is excellent!!! I find it very hard to believe that Jack Nicholson agreed to do this role, but I'm very glad he did. Jack Nicholson was fantastic as the Joker! Michael Keaton also pulls off one of his best performances to date. The supporting cast was very good as well: Pat Hingle, Michael Gough, Kim Basigner, Robert Wuhl, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter and everyone else.Like I said in the title, this film is definitely my favorite Tim Burton film to date. He made a fantastic world for Batman and kept him dark and mysterious they way he ought to be.The story in this film is pretty good, with a few minor things that didn't sit well with me, but all in all, the story was actually quite good. The props in this film are amazing! The batmobile and the batwing are nothing less than beautiful!If you are one of the few people on this earth that has yet to see this film, I strongly suggest that you see it! I hope that you enjoy the film relatively close to as much as I enjoy it. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warner Brothers remakes the old "Batman" saga for this 1989 release starring Michael Keaton in the really hard to cast title role. Keaton makes the best Batman but that doesn't mean that his "Batman" films were good. The storyline is weak and Jack Nicholson goes way over the top (and not successfully) as Batman's main nemesis, The Joker. Only a minor improvement over Adam West's original 1966 silliness. Keaton's 1992 sequel, "Batman Returns" is the best of this series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Knight reigns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If, by some odd chance, you haven't seen this movie, you are missing one of the most fantastic pieces of movie-making done to date. While the movie has its flaws, it catches the original spirit of the comics in that Batman is a dark hero and Gotham is a dark city. One is born of the other and it only stands to reason that Batman's dark side shadows the that of the city which he patrols. This is dark movie, of dark subjects, of the criminal underworld in a city where even the good guys aren't so good. What really makes this work is that Batman, despite all his apparent power, is still human underneath, and his motivations are explored to a small degree in order to give this impression, something the following Batman films all fail to do (though the fourth film makes a meager attempt to do this). Keaton as Batman first strikes one as a gross case of miscasting, but in the usual Michael Keaton style, he proves there is nothing he can't pull off. Perhaps one of the most underrated actors Hollywood has ever seen. The cinematography is absolutely amazing and, of course, one can't forget the Batmobile. Watch this movie for Keaton, Nicholson, Gotham City, and the Batmobile. That's all you need for this to work. Pywrit scale of 1-10, this one gets a solid 8.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new standard bearer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Batman came out in 1989 I was not pleased. As an eight year old Indiana Jones fan with a penchant for numbers, I could not understand why this new Superhero movie was faring better at the box office than the fabulously entertaining Last Crusade. While the third installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy is still one of my favorites, it didn't compare to the experience I would enjoy later that summer. Somehow I had missed all the hype that was built up for Batman, and I didn't have any inclination to see it at all. One evening my Dad and I went to the movies to see what I thought would be Ghostbusters II. I can still remember him telling me that he was reversing that decision as we pulled into the parking lot. "I heard that Batman is a much better movie" he said to a very unimpressed kid pouting in the passenger seat. From my point of view I had never read a single Superhero comic, let alone a Batman comic (and never have since), but I knew I did like Bill Murray, Slimer and the rest of the 'Busters and wanted my way.Well score one for my Dad, because by the five minute mark I was hooked. From Keaton's first screen appearance as the Dark Knight I knew I liked this dude in the black suit."Don't kill me man!""I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favour. I want you to tell all your friends about me.""Wh-What are you?""I'm Batman."I was mesmerized throughout the whole film. From that introduction right until the final showdown in the belfry. The movie is dark and desolate yet has some great funny lines mixed in and is entertaining through and through. The set design and the cinematography are top notch and unique. The acting is very good, (except for Kim Basinger, but I think she sucks so I'm probably being biased). The score is great, as it perfectly matches the tone and mood of the film. The songs by Prince seem a little dated now, but aren't terrible. Tim Burton's unique perspective and direction is also on display here and is a resounding success. This is what I'm talking about when I refer to Batman as the standard bearer for comic book movies. People debate about which is the best Superhero movie of all time. Is it X-men? or is Superman better? Batman is always mentioned near the top of the list, but there is far from a consensus decision. But, since it was released in 1989, every single comic book adaptation I have seen since has been noticeably influenced from its style and mood. None of the other contenders can claim to have had such an impact on the genre. Overall I give Batman a 9/10 and it still stands up today as one of my favorite movies ever. I've always thought to properly enjoy Batman you would have to be somewhat like him; a little dark, a little introspective with a yearning to be a hero buried somewhere deep inside. Flashback again to 1989 and my Dad and I are leaving the theater with a big grin stuck on my face. "Dad, this is the kind of movie that you want to see again right away. It's got to be way better the Ghostbusters II." - and it still is. Thanks Dad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did this movie gross so much at the box office? Why do I have such fond memories of this movie, and watch it now with a corny look on my face? Well, I guess its just a combination of things. I suppose my first memory of batman would be holding the comic in my hand, and reading the dark stories of a scum leaden society, saved only by the angel of the night. When I first heard it would be coming to the screen, I was almost unable to get myself to see it. It couldnt live up to the standards the comics had given me. Well, compared to the campy Batman of the adam west days, Tim Burton and Michael Keaton brought us a successful comic book movie that actually captured the theme of the comic, rather than simply riding on its coatales. And Keaten? Beatlejuice as batman??? And the wonderful Jack Nicholson doing one of his craziest roles as the joker. Jack seemed like he was taking his character from the shining and giving a cartoony shine. I guess this movie gives me such fond memories because of the direction comic movies are going. And just because it was corny and absurd, doesnt mean that it wasnt good. In fact, this movie was one of the first good comic book movies, and that is why it'll always have a place on my shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman and Batman Returns were excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who wish to shun Tim Burton's vision in Batman and Batman returns, i would like to offer a rebuttal. Gotham City as Burton sees it, is often considered one of the most creative, dark, imaginative and beautiful cinema scapes in mainstream Hollywood film.It's truly cinema gothic, and psychologically fitting to the early comic book nature of batman. Michael Keating was an excellent Batman and his vulnerability lent a lot to the realism of Bruce Wayne. Jack was also (in my opinion) the only one who could have played the joker and well worth the wait in filming schedule to have him.There is a reason this film was THE top seller for Warner Bros and on most coffee mugs and badges around the world... It's a very very good watch! More than Goths and comic lovers (who already appreciate Burton's darker vision and meticulous misenscene) can see his talent in showing the dark night, DC comics Batman in his spectacular world.The likes of Mark Canton have been quoted as saying that batman was his favourite film of all time, trust the professionals, and please at least give it a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first and best of the ongoing Batman series is so much fan that one is almost disappointed when the project collapses under its own weight in the last fifteen minutes. As you all know (and if you don't shame on you) Bruce Wayne is a millionaire who sits atop of Gotham City but at night he rids the city of crime as he transforms into Batman. But when Batman drops Jack Napier into a poll of chemicals The Joker is created, a make-up wearing villain out to take over the city. Michael Keaton is rather droll as Batman and Kim Basinger is wasted in her role as Wyanes love interest. But the true joy come from Jack Nicholson, perfect for the role of the Joker. Nicholson instead of taking his character so seriously that it becomes uninteresting he plays his role so slapstick that he is rather chilling. Director Tim Burton had a fabulous vision of what Gotham City should be like and he does a wonderful job at giving the whole thing a comic book feel. But there is one big flaw that is noticeable and like the sequel that is that Burton is making things so big and beyond belief that he looses sight of the task at hand , Batman. Where the heck is Batman? We spend most of the film following around there Joker and getting incite into the problems Gotham is facing that Batman seems to be put on a back burner and not made a prime comedy like one would expect. The climax is very corny and so over played that the film lacks some of that punch that reeled us in at the beginning but the performance of Nicholson will keep you from having to use the fast forward button until the credits role. One other problem that I must point out is that I don't like how Batman is portrayed as a criminal and not a super hero, being a fan of the old live action show with Adam West and the kids Saturday Mourning Cartoon and never having read the comic I have never seen Batman in that sort of light and it was a little off to me. Although Burton's wild portrait of Batman is not as disturbing as what was to come from Burton in this series it is still bound to disturb more than a few bat fanatics and is far to violent for children but is still a treat for all fans of the dark knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film from the '80s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's dark and stylized direction of the classic comic book makes the great script by Sam Hamm into a brilliant film. The story doesn't waste time explaining Batman's origins, but gets right down to buisness. Jack Napier (AKA the Joker)is about to get double crossed by his mob boss (Jack Palance)at a toxic waste plant. His unexpected run in with Batman leaves him with violent mood swings and a clown-resembling face as a result of falling in the waste. He soon battles with the, unknown to his beloved city then, Caped Crusader in the dark Gotham City. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances (and he was certainly paid enough!) of his career as The Joker. He plays his role out so over the top, that it makes for one of the best heavies ever on screen. As the original (for the film series, that is) and best Batman to date, Michael Keaton was a perfect pick. His off-beat and complex characterization is nothing short of amazing. Even now, in 2002, after adaptations of "Spider-Man", "The X-Men", "Blade" and many others, "Batman" remains the best comic book superhero adaptation to date. It is an entertaining, fun and smart stylization of the comic book that could only have been made so skillfully by none other than Burton. After three sequels, it also remains the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Batman series has always been one of my favorite movie series. They arn't perfect films, but they are entertaining, and that's what movies are supposed to be in the first place.The first thing to do before watching a Batman movie is to throw away most realistic logic. If a movie being illogical and unrealistic angers you, then there is not a Batman movie out there that won't give you a migrane. The fact that the movie takes place in Gotham City, a city that has the look, wardrobe (most of the time), and vehicles of somewhere of inbetween the 1930s to the 1950s yet has the gadgets and technology of tommorrow, should tip you off that this is a fantasy world. Of course the whole billionare who runs around in a bat suit kicking the butt of villans should make you realize it's a fantasy too.The movie in itself is one of the first feature films directed by Tim Burton, and is dark, but it doesn't have the look we really associate with the Tim Burton movies of today. Compare this film with Batman Returns and you'll see what I mean. But Tim went with the notion that Batman is a villain that strikes fear in villains, and sometimes the citizens of Gotham. This is more entertaining than the "beloved hero" Batman we see in Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin.The actors are good. I like Michael Keaton as Batman, which all you really need is a good chin and a gruff voice to pull off, which he does. But I'm not convinced with him as Bruce Wayne, not like he doesn't play Bruce well, he just looks more like a family man than a rich playboy. Jack Nicolson as The Joker was a fine performance, he pulled off being a person who loves to loves to kill in elaborate comical ways. I'd put him as my 2nd favorite Joker, behind Mark Hamill's rendition. Kim Basinger was the only person who got on my nerves...only because she screamed at everything, which got old real fast. The absolute best performance is Michael Gough as Alfred, not like it's the most important role, but he is exactly how I envision Alfred in real life.The plot is something you would easily find out of a comic book, fun and unrealistic, but entertaining all the way. It easily suffices as a path for these characters to interact within Gotham. Other cool features of the movie is the Batmobile, probably the coolest movie car ever, and the wonderful score by Danny Elfman.This film is action packed, full of humor, and fun for all Batman fans. I highly recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was only six years old when I watched this movie. I didn't go to many movies when I was that young but when I saw a trailer for this one I begged my parents to take me. They did and I loved the movie! At the time, I didn't know who the stars were or who the director was. What six year old does? Of course I thought the movie was the best thing ever made. I can't give you a review from when I was six years old, so I watched the movie again last night and here is what I have to say.Tim Burton's Batman is incredible. It is one of the best superhero films since Superman. He takes the life from the comic and puts it on the screen with great flair. Gotham City is dismal and dark as it should be. The casting is brilliant with great screen gurus such as Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton. They give an incredible performances as the villain and hero. I have to say that Nicholson as the Joker sounds a bit strange to me. I love him as a kid but now that I've watched it again I love him even more. He brings the madness to the screen and the characters rage to life. Tim Burton has really outdone himself with this movie. While, I was unimpressed by Kim Bassinger's performance, I do have to say that it was fair. She was just starting out and this was one of her first big films. I also want to comment on the brilliant casting of some great Hollywood legends like Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, Pat Hingle and Hammer Film star Michael Gough. Each infected every character with life. With Danny Elfman's incomparable score, you have a hit! This movie will go down in history as one of the greatest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First and easily the best Bat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the help of a starry cast, an inventive script, a bucket load of hype, as well as his own dazzling imagination, director Tim Burton turned the camp, colourful, iconic superhero popularised by the 60's TV show into a dark, menacing and ambigious mystery avenger. The result was a winner and led the way for three less impressive and increasingly weaker sequels. Michael Keaton is perfectly cast as Bruce Wayne, the shadowy millionare, who becomes the fixation of photographer Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger), whilst Gotham City is left dumfounded by the mysterious Batman and (soon enough) dumbstruck by the evil Joker (Jack Nicholson). Keaton is a solid presence but like the following films, the big star is the villain thanks to a gloriously, all-out performance by Nicholson. The film itself is a dazzling mix of genre; the comic-book, the gangster flick, film noir and the climax in a massive Gotham cathedral is more than reminicist of Hitchcock's Vertigo. A clever, thrilling and successful big-screen adapation, easily the best of the series</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He's violent.He's vicious.He's borderline psychotic.And that's just the hero.This, for me is a good start. Add in Jack Nicholson's rather more psychotic Joker, and you have one happy little film fan.This film is well written, well directed and well acted- Tim Burton seems to have a knack for dark, menacing films (Sleepy Hollow, anyone?).He put these two fantastic titans into a believable backdrop of a city in crisis, and then promptly had them destroy bits of it. Good stuff.Batman also has some pretty funky gadgets in this film- ranging from the belt-mounted grappling hook to the portable aerial-slide gun, he looks like he's in some kind of "Who has the best toys?" competition with James Bond.And of course, the Batmobile. I want one of these things. If they ever go into full production, my name will be 1st, 2nd and 3rd on the list to buy one. It just looks.... right. There's no other word for it. A dark, menacing hero needs a dark, menacing car, and this is it.All in all, a deliciously dark film- I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what can i say,to put it bluntly this is a brand new look at batman and i love it. without the faintest doubt this is the best of the four batman movies. although gloomy and psychological it has its comic relief with the joker. michael keaton is the best batman to date and jack nicholson added colour and occasional comedy to the movie, despite being psychologically unstable. with other great performances from kim basinger,pat hingle and michael gough, this truly is a visual masterpiece. to sum it up the film has a tremendous plot, a terrific atmosphere and sensational performances which justify a man wearing a cape and mask and saving the world. 8.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is this scene in "Batman" where the joker dances to Prince and is later followed by Batman popping out of nowhere and rescuing Vicki Vale. That scene was pretty cool!This Frank Miller-ish first Batman movie is truly the best in the series so far. The film takes place in modern times but everyone is either dressed in `40s cloths or the cloths of the time. At the peak of an enormous crime wave the city is forced to cancel it's 200th anniversary. Nevertheless the Joker (Jack Nicholson) is up to his old tricks again while Batman (Michael Keaton) is on his trail. Which leads to many surprises and thrills.Directed by Tim Burton in what is by far his greatest picture, his direction is brilliant and thanks to Anton Furst in his Oscar-Winning art direction they create a world never seen before on film. Michael Keaton is great as Batman/Bruce Wayne and he is by far the best Batman ever. Though Keaton reached perfection with the sequel. Jack Nicholson is brilliant as the Joker, his performance deserved an Oscar Nomination and composer Danny Elfman who delivers his best score ever as well deserved a nomination or even an Oscar for that matter. Finally final credits go to screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren who did a great script which is faithful to the comics and to Bob Kane's original vision.Still Burton gets the most credit, he not only did a great job directing but also contributed a lot to the story with sequences which weren't even in the final shooting script. Now Kim Basinger who plays Vicki Vale does a somewhat B-movie performance and doesn't have a lot of chemistry with Keaton but then again she did look very sexy in this movie and when it comes to the chemistry part I guess that was a smart decision because Batman only has chemistry with Catwoman and Thalia.****out of**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman. Batman. Every time I say it, I get chills. This is by far the single best comic adaptation ever. Superman pales in comparison. The X-men is too special effects driven. Captain America; The Phantom; Dick Tracy; not even in the same league. Now Blankman, that was a funny movie (hey, I have a soft spot for really stupid schtick).Michael Keaton was the perfect choice for Batman. Not just a face or body, and not just a big name to carry a movie, but an actor who I feel can really play his parts in a way that make us think he isn't acting. And of course, Jack. I almost believed he really was the Joker. There just aren't any words for that performance. It's a shame he wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar, because this was the single best villian in movie history, and believe me, I've seen most of them. Tim Burton is excellent as always. Just think of his other works like Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow. He is the Master of the Dark when it comes to movies. And the combination of Danny Elfman and Prince was just awesome. Easily one of the best movie soundtracks ever. Only Batman Returns comes close to being up to par in the series. And only the recent Spider-Man comes close to being a good comic-movie (thanks to Tobey Maguire, another excellent casting choice for a superhero). People like Keaton and Maguire help us to relate to the characters in the movies, because they just seem more human than the HUGE names that headline other movies today.For those of you that frown upon Batman, stop regurgitating what you read in bad reviews. Film critics are too often concerned with every movie not being the next Godfather. And all of you comic-devotees; give it up. Movies are NOT comics. They are adaptations. Things have to be left out or twisted around a bit to make it work for the screen. Otherwise, why not just read it? Besides, what can compare to the Batwing in the full moon?Even now, I too, often wonder, where does he get those wonderful toys?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tim Burtom Masterpiece, The Best Comic Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is simply the best comic-book film of all time. Tim Burton does a masterful job, as does Jack Nicholson ( Joker ). Who would of though that Michael Keaton was the absolute perfect choice as Batman? The scenery and mood is similar to that of "The Cabinet of Dr. Calagari", and one would guess Mr. Burton took note of that very famous German Expressionist film. The cast is superb, as are the special effects. Danny Elfman delivers a splendid soundtrack, which includes a excellent version of the Batman theme song. This movie was better than Spider-Man, although Spider-man was a very entertaining film. The mood that Burton creates makes Gotham City very dark and haunting. Fans of the comic book are sure to adore this great film. Quite Simply, the best comic film ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Be in absolutely no doubt - THIS IS A GREAT FILM. The 1989 Tim Burton 'Batman' has become a modern classic and the template for future comic-book-come-movie efforts such as 'X-Men' and 'Spider-man'. This film's standing is of course hightened by the mighty hash Joel Schumacher made of the last two films. Burton picks up where the Superman series left off and re-invents the genre. Burton implements the brilliant gothic style we've come to expect from his other films, such as 'Beetlejuice' and 'Edward Scissorhands'. Burton reunites with Beetlejuice-star Michael Keaton. Keating hangs up his striped suit and dons the black tights as the caped-crusader. The casting in this film is quite excellent. Keaton is brilliant and portrays Bruce Wayne/Batman in a moody and emotional way that is so effective it even covers up the lack of any kind of acting talent in Kim Basinger (as Wayne's love-interest, Vicky Vale). The legendary Jack Nicholson is simply excellent at the psychotic Jack Napier/Joker. Kudos also goes to Britain's own Michael Gough as Wayne's trusty old retainer, Alfred. Of course, Gough would later be the only good thing retained in the Batman dynasty after the series was placed in Schumacher's bungling hands. Thankfully, Gough was spared the humiliation of ever having to don the cape and tights himself, as Alfred was often prone to have to do in the original TV series. Although the old man playing Alfred in the original looked a damned sight better in them than Adam West.This film is brilliant and, in light of the Schumacher debacle, a classic. The cast is wonderful and the story-line is also good. The setting and the characters are dark and gothic and lacks the stupid unrealistic nonsense of the last two films. Watch this! It's the original and best!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reference super-hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman" is simply one of the greatest movies of all time. It managed to rescue the movie industry from completely losing the audiences to VCRs. With "Batman" people began to realize the big difference there is in experiencing a film in a theater and in a living room. "Batman" put an end to the not-so-good filmmaking of the 80's and marked beginning of the return of the audience to the movie theater.Now that the super-hero movies are back (Spiderman, X-men, Ghost Rider, The Hulk, etc.) it's time to look back and compare to the reference. So far, only Spiderman comes close to being a runner-up as the best super-hero movie ever."Batman" benefits primarily from Tim Burton's vision of the character. In the movie he's displayed very much like his comic book version. Dare I say, it even helped to re-define his personality in every other media: TV shows, toys and even the comic book itself. Secondly, Jack Nicholson plays the Joker to perfection. I remember he was quite scary when I first saw it (in a movie theater of course)."Batman" will remain to be one of those movies that you can see over and over again. I have lost count personally. It would be really nice to have a more complete DVD with better audio and video (how about a SuperBit DVD?). But why stop there? I'm sure that everybody would love to see "Batman" in the big screen again; now with all the re-mastered editions of great movies and all...Meanwhile, go get it, prepare a bucket of popcorn, turn the lights off, sit back and enjoy the ride. The "Batman" experience still lives in the heart of every cinephile.</fullReview>

In the movie he goes from a murderous psychopath, to a murderous psychopath with a white face. To anyone whose read the comics, this film only works as a nice looking action film and nothing more. Nicholson was great with what he had to work with, which was a more psychotic version of TV's Batman's Joker, but had they taken a cue from the comics and actually told a semi-decent backstory it would be on par with the earlier Superman and the later Spider-Man and X-Men. Watching this movie again reminded me of just how shallow a story we were willing to accept in the mostly mediocre 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but wasn't faithful enough to the comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is certainly a good movie, by Hollywood standards. But when measured up to the comic book version of Batman, it isn't very faithful. First, the Joker never murdered Bruce Wayne's parents in the original comic storyline. Tim Burton probably added this plot twist to give Bruce more of a reason to hate the Joker. The Joker also is tall and skinny in the comics, whereas Jack Nicholson portrays a short squatty Joker. These minor irritations aside, I feel that there is a greater issue at hand. Tim Burton seemed to manipulate the true character of the Dark Knight himself and turn him into something that HE liked. Therefore, in the movie, you get a Batman that is still dark like the original, but also human, as is evident with his love interest in Vickie Vale. The comic book version of Batman is incredibly cold, unforgiving, and relentless... and doesn't have time for love interests. Read Frank Miller's 4-part series "The Dark Knight" and you will see just how cold Batman really is. The movie made Batman seem too human. In reality, or at least in comic book reality, Batman is an insane, haunted vigilante who takes absolutely no crap from anyone. Otherwise a great movie, Batman only partially does the comic book version justice. But comic books aside, Batman is a definitely a well-done movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman was always a fav of mine and when I saw this film for the first time he still was. Upon further viewings of this film though I find this film too dark and with almost no story. God I would hate to live in Gotham City. I don't think the sun ever shines there. Mind yo I think there are only two scenes shot in daylight anyway. Sure the Joker is a nut job, but I remember him doing criminal acts for his own gain. I fail to see the point in gassing a parade. I liked some of the performances. Keaton while wouldn't have been my first choice made a rather good Batman. Jack as the Joker. Well Burton nailed that one. He is great. Gives the impression of being crazy, but still aware of things. Infinately better than Jim Carrey's Riddler. I mean there is going over the top and then there is what Carrey did which I found just plain out stupid. Kim Bassinger well I must say that I thought she was in a horror film what with all her screaming. This would be my favourite of the series, but considering the story I can't say I enjoy this movie all that much. Too dark. If you want to see a film about Batman rent the animated film Mask of the Phantasm. That is what a Batman film should be like. Story driven not a showcase for costumes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Goth (Tim Burton) gave us the definitive superhero movie in 1989. With the exception of the notion that the Joker murdered Bruce Wayne's parents, the pieces all fit snugly together: from the retro production design (which brought to mind everything from METROPOLIS to the Fleischer SUPERMAN cartoons) to the superb cinematography (which practically drips darkness) to an unbeatable cast (to a player) to nothing-less-than-brilliant direction (Burton has yet to disappoint this viewer). Unlike the pathetic televersion (which was based more on the unintentionally hilarious second movie serial than the comics), Burton's BATMAN is true to the spirit of the source material. In fact, the body armor worn by Batman in the movie comes straight from BATMAN #1. (Some of the early BATMAN stories actually echoed the adventures of the original Dark Knight himself, THE SHADOW, and featured a rogue's gallery to rival DICK TRACY's. Which supports my contention that comics are simply pulps with pictures.) One wonders why there isn't a live action TV series in the works, yet. BATMAN would be a natural.</fullReview>

This 1989 blockbuster is full of heart and energy most blockbusters lack today. Micheal Keaton is convincing as batman and Bruce Wayne as he brings a comedic edge to both characters ("C'mon let's get nuts"). Nicholson steals the show as the joker because he ultimately gets most of the screen time but that's all right. The only problem I had with the film was Kim Basinger's character Vicki Vale. Most of her dialouge were in the form of screams and half of the time she was fainting. Other characters lacked screen time and character development. The score is Elfman's first classic as it is both catchy and epic.

		<shortDescription>The Gold Standard For Superhero Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's ever been a better superhero movie made, I haven't seen it. This is Tim Burton's ambitious, moody, dark, macabre masterpiece.Against all odds, this movie works. It's fabulous. It set a new standard for superhero movies. No, scratch that, it completely redefined the genre. Think about how many superhero movies since have built their entire look and feel from this movie. The atmosphere, the sets, the music, the action sequences--all of them risky, all of them revolutionary, all of them fantastic.A huge amount of credit must go to the casting. Michael Keaton, against all odds, turns in a knockout performance as both Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter ego, Batman, and is especially effective at showing the human side of the man who hides behind a mask in both of his disparate life roles. Kim Basinger, who was the emergency choice for the part after Sean Young was injured in pre-production, turns in a fine performance as Vicki Vale, the photographer who uncovers the truth about Gotham City's billionaire playboy. And Jack Nicholson...yes, Nicholson chews scenery. Yes, he's over the top. Yes, he's loud and boisterous and obnoxious. He's SUPPOSED to be. That's called "good acting". Try to imagine anyone else playing The Joker. Time's up.But more than anything else, the first Batman succeeds where the other movies fail because it is a much simpler story. One hero. One villain. One woman between them. The three characters play off each other exceptionally well, and the movie stays focused on the triangle of interaction and doesn't allow itself to get sidetracked by too many villains or too many star turns. Burton kept a tight rein on this production, and it shows; the movie moves at a brisk clip, and the sequences lead logically into each other to make a coherent whole.If this movie isn't in your personal film library, add it immediately. It's the gold standard of superhero movies.</fullReview>

Batman is well aware of his mortality and has plenty of his gadgets to save himself at those moments that sporadically pop up--"where does he GET those wonderful toys?!"

		<fullReview>The plot:A Dark Knight known as Batman who is really billionaire Bruce Wayne, begins to wade war on crime in a city known as Gotham City, but finds that he has to defeat a menace called Joker who is a dead villain.Good Points:Pretty dark and atmospheric. Jack Nicholson is fantastic. Script's funny and put just right for a comic book creation.Bad Points:Kim Basinger screams a lot.The view:A brilliant adaption of a comic book character with designs for sets and actors up to high standard, this is really good and should be called a classic and not just an attempt to make money of merchandise(although that's what happened). Great dark but a bit violent fun. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the superhero genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is perfect. I watched it twice in the week, and I can find nothing at all to stop me from giving it a perfect 10. Michael Keaton is the Sean Connery of Batman, no-one else could replace him. Gotham City comes to life in this movie, and one can really be sentimental for its citizens when the Joker gases them at the bicentennial parade. The biggest problem it faces is that it's not for the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best of the Batman movies. Everyone knows the story so no need to recount it here. When this movie came out there were huge lines for it at the theater I went to and the first time Batman comes on screen the audience just roared---never experienced that at any other movie. I heard at one point that Mel Gibson had been offered the role of Batman but turned it down because he didn't want to do another fantasy hero, after having just done the Mad Max movies. I had also heard that Bill Murray, of all people, had been offered the lead. Adam West, the TV Batman, apparently had demanded the role but was way too old of course and he turned down the chance to do a cameo as Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father. Jack Nicholson was of course fantastic as the Joker and steals the movie. When he dies it will be one of the three or four roles that he's best remembered for. I thought his casting in the lead was a bit of a gesture to the old TV series. The actors playing the villains in the TV series were always much more famous than those playing Batman and Robin----Cliff Robertson and Frank Sinatra were two Oscar winners who starred as Batman villains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was probably the best one. It is a dark, painful, intriguing look into the mind and soul of a once innocent child. Now that child is a man who vows to destroy all those who prey on the innocent. Tim Burton (the director) creates a movie which chills the soul. He is much better than Joel Schumacher (Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin). Michael Keaton is the best Batman/Bruce Wayne. This movie is very violent. It is a realistic movie for adults (a lot of fighting. Jack Nicholson is excellent as the Joker. You'll enjoy this movie from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark, brooding adaptation of the popular comic book series stars Michael Keaton as a man leading a double life. On one side he's billionaire and media playboy Bruce Wayne, on the other he's mysterious caped crusader Batman who prowls the night trying to keep the city safe from the criminal underworld. His chosen role as the mysterious hero leads him into conflict with The Joker, a frighteningly psychotic villain who's bent on taking over the city. Elaborate set design, high-tech gadgets, and memorable songs make this a comic book experience quite unlike any other. Keaton gives a beguiling performance as the hero, but without a doubt he's outdone by Nicholson who goes for broke as his manic adversary. ***</fullReview>

My God that was stupid.3)Kim Basinger cannot act her way out of a wet paper sack.Enuff said.4)Since when was Harvey Dent a Black Man ???

		<shortDescription>The Comic Book Hero Get's his First Big Screen Movie...Since His Last in 1966!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Welcome to Gotham City. It's filled with criminals and crazys. Two such thugs decided to jump a yuppy couple and mug them. But they pay the price when Batman shows up. The citizens of Gotham fear him while the police try to cover him up. We all know that Batman is in fact billionaire Bruce Wayne. But everybody in Gotham doesn't know that; one night, Crimeboss Carl Grissom sends his men to rob the Axis Chemical plant. The head of the operation would be Jack Napier, a guy who likes playing cards and wears a purple suit. At the plant, Jack kills Police LieutenantEckhardt, and Batman holds Jack over a vat of chemicals, now I don't know if Batman purposely dropped him or his grip slipped but one way or another, Jack fell right into the toxic waste. That night, Bruce Wayne was having dinner with Vicki Vale, a woman from the press who's taken an interest in Wayne...And Batman, so has a fellow pressman named Alexander Knox; that same night, in another part of town, Jack Napier was getting plastic surgery and apparently something went wrong...With hilarious results. Because Jack was laughing. He went to Grissom's hide out that night and killed him. Jack changed his name to Joker. He had green hair, red lips, and white face, also his face had a big grin on it, due to the surgery. The Joker starts terrorizing Gotham by bumping off "former associates" and putting his own deadly chemicals into local products, causing people to die with a big Joker grin on their faces. One night, Joker invites Vicki Vale to the museum, he did it using Bruce Wayne's name. At the museum, he and his men start defacing sculptures and paintings. It's funny when one guy paints green hair and red lips on a sculpted head. It's Batman to the rescue! He saves Vicki and they jump into the Batmobile! Joker's men follow close behind. Batman really gives them a workout, then takes Vicki to the Batcave where he finds a pattern behind the Joker's chemical operation. Bruce Wayne has something terrible in his past: his parents were murdered right in front of him by a gang. He remembers the gunman well, it's Jack Napier! Speaking of which, the Joker announces he will dump millions in cash on the town that night, and so the 200th birthday celebration of Gotham takes place, but then the Joker tries to kill everybody with his Smilex gas. But it's Batman to the rescue in his Batwing. The climax takes place on the roof of a tall church. There's a big fight, then as the Joker tries to get away, he falls to his death. So once again Gotham City is safe, and Batman gave them the Batsignal so if evil does lurk it's ugly head again, they can call him. This movie is pretty good. It's a dark one. This movie also reveals who the Joker really is. His real identity was never revealed before. I mean we know the Penguin is Oswald Cobblepot, the Riddler is Edward Nygma, Two-Face is Harvey Dent, Mr. Freeze is Dr. Victor Fries (Freeze), but the Joker never had a real identity. Now he does: Jack Napier. I recommend this movie. It's good. So is it's sequel!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KEATON IS THE DEFINITIVE DARK KNIGHT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly the best Batman film ever.Michael Keaton is the true Caped Crusader. It's a shame he quit after Batman Returns. Like Christopher Reeve in Superman, Michael was born to play Batman.I enjoy Batman comics. As some of you are probably aware Batman made his debut in Detective Comics 27 in 1939 and he was a dark character. He took no prisoners back then and wasn't afraid to take a villains life. There was no Robin back then to brighten things up and Batman truly struck fear into the villains hearts in Gotham.However in the 1960's both the comic Batman and the small screen Batman became very camp. No longer did Batman strike fear into the hearts of villains.He became a comedy character. Then came the 1960's series (which was enjoyable if you're in the mood)starring Adam West. This adaption of Batman was the one most people adhere to.Villains like the Joker were no longer psychotic killers-they were played mainly for laughs.Anyway, I remember in 1989 how several people thought that the new Batman movie was going to be too dark. If you were brought up on the 1960's show, it probably was but if you're a fan of the original Batman from 1939 then this film was a blessing. Tim Burton brought Batman back to his roots.Robin was not in this film which was actually a good idea as it gave us more time to explore Batman's origins. And Keaton played the part of Batman (and Bruce Wayne) very well. He was moody and very brooding.Jack Nicholson (always good at playing psycho's) played an excellant part as The Joker. In the 1960's show, the Joker was just a clown who wasn't really that threatening but Nicholson portrayed the Joker as a psycho. Again, the original comic book Joker was a psycho. In a comic book story from the 1940's Gotham City's Police Officers actually had to provide round the clock protection for a man whose life was threatened by The Joker.That was how sinister the Joker was.Nicholson brought the Joker back to his roots and played the part very well-he managed to give my sister nightmares.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) This is a great Batman film. The sequel was good but the subsequent films after that were not as dark as this. There are some great scenes. My favourites are where there's a three way battle in a chemical factory between Batman, the police and the criminals. Batman is just scary in this scene as he swoops down to take out the bad guys. The other great scene is where Batman confronts the Joker at the end.This was a superb film that never got the credit it deserved. It would be really nice if Michael Keaton returned one day to play an ageing Batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never cared for this film. Although the character of Bruce Wayne and Batman aren't supposed to be nice guys, I found them to be repugnant characters with no appeal whatsoever. You may argue that they're not supposed to be appealing, but I disagree. I've seen many characters in several movies who were nasty guys but had appeal. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in the Godfather films is such an example. Michael Corleone is a hideous man, yet he came across as a man you love to hate. Hell, you don't have to look further than Nicholson in this very movie. He's evil, he's mean, but he had appeal. Keaton's Batman and Bruce Wayne had no appeal and were ultimately very boring characters. If I could come up with one word for Keaton in this film: tightass. Michael Keaton is a good actor, but I found myself cheering for The Joker throughout the film. Jack Nicholson steals the movie right from under Keaton's feet.To say nothing about Kim Basinger's insipid Vicki Vale. Vicki spends the entire movie screaming her ass off at any little thing, but when she falls off a skyscraper, she doesn't utter a peep. And speaking of Vicki Vale, her romance with Wayne was laughably bad. And what's up with Billy Dee Williams as the future Two-Face? Originally, I liked Billy Dee in the film, but when I found out he was the future Two-Face, I'm wondering how he got cast as Harvey Dent. Technically, there's nothing wrong with Williams or his performance as the still-good-guy Harvey Dent. In fact, I enjoyed him very much. It's just that I can't see Williams acting like the evil Two Face in any future sequels.The movie isn't without some value despite the failure of Keaton and Basinger. The sets, costumes, music and tone of the film were just right. Nicholson was fun to watch as was Jack Palance and Tracey Walter. And credit to Keaton, he improved his performance considerably in Batman Returns by giving a brooding performance with a more laid back approach. And it worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From today's point of view it's a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been making a habit of turning up my nose on a motion pictures that are based on a comics. Usually it's a handy warning sign that the movie is going to be something awful, something so naive and unbearable that it makes me wanna cry. When it comes to "Batman" I have to admit I make an exception. It really is something different, mostly because it simply doesn't even look like a very childish movie even though it clearly should be one - even the basic idea of "Batman" is a silly to start with. "Batman" is not only watchable for the older audience, it's not even suitable for small children. I'm not so sure if Michael Keaton was such a magnificent Batman, though. I think he is a superb actor with lots of great talents when he is in the right movie and he has a favorable chance to use them. But maybe he played his role as Batman too gesturelessly. Of course on the other hand role called for it: that's part of being this dark and thoughtful character who has dedicated his life to fight against crime because his parents were murdered. Luckily there was someone that stealed the show from Keaton. Jack Nicholson is having the time of his life as Joker. ("You can call me Joker...and as you can see, I'm a lot happier!") He's an ideal choice for this role, just like I couldn't think of a better bloke to play The Riddler than Jim Carrey in Joel Schumacher's "Batman Forever". "Batman" has a fine script, stylish action, good acting especially from spectacular Nicholson and visually fantastic settings - thanks to director. I have to say this one is a real classic and one of the finest movies of Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic Fantasy/Crime/Action/Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10/10 Everyone I know has at least heard of the Batman franchise. It's just something that happens witn trilogies if they are original enough. This is. Directed excellently by Tim Burton, starring the Great Nicholson and Keaton, this film patches together better than high quality silk. The plot is basically when Batman has a relationship with journalist Vicki Vale and at the same time battles hitman-cum-psychoclown "Joker". That's all, but if you look at better plots (I write mediocre plots) you will find it more likeable. The acting is terrific. Nicholson, well, He plays a great role as the Joker and film students should take notice on his sadistic humor/laughs; Keaton plays Batman/Bruce Wayne superbly unlike what some peoplethought of This comedic actor at the time. Basinger plays a good role as Vicki Vale, a photographer journalist; and Michael Gough does a fine job as the butler of Bruce Wayne. The soundtrack, done enterily by Prince, goes off fine. Songs like "Batdance", "Trust", "Scandalous" are held off on repeated listenings for myself. Actually the whole soundtrack. It's slick, ultra-fast, dark, and excellent. The music score, done entirely by Danny Elfman, is just as good. Much more darker really. This is probabley better than his work in "Nightmare Before Christmas", but that's a different story. The writing is fantastic. A lot of sadistic humor by the Joker is added by the one and only Sam Hamm. Examples (with spoilers, do not read this list if you wanna be suprised): -The Joker laughing menacingly while running in his ex-boss' (from his hitman days) office shooting the life out of him. -Reading a blood-stained newspaper on the desk of his dead boss after killing him -The Joker taking a quill and darting it into an orator's throat during an outdoors press confrense with mimes all over the place and suddenly a shoot-out -The Joker using clownish balloons to gas off the crowd -Creating a killing chemical-ish substance that kills off a TV news reporter on camera with a smile on her dead body -After the substance kills the reporter, a commercial to buy Joker's killing product cuts in from unknown sources starting with Joker's ex-boss' dead body tied up to a chair ("He's been using spandex!") and then having the Joker on a beach with women saying "Love that Joker!" while saying "And remember, put on a happy face!" while at the same time laughing wickedly with an animated head of his spinning slowly on a purple and yellow bullseye trying to hypnotize who is watching the commercial -Entering Vicki Vales apartment with a present (which she opens later and faints to find them dead flowers), putting his ex-lovers porcelin mask on the top of a fireplace, saying what happened to her then shattering it intensionally by quick-jabbing it trying to make it look like an accident -Killing almost an entire restarant's worth of people with a purple gas (and one of the elderly couples there die with their face smeared in their pie), and playing a lively Prince song after so ("Partyman") -Vicki Vale throwing a shot glass full of wine into Joker's face with him hopping from his seat screaming "God! I'm melting" until fianally revealing his face, with all the makeup dissolved to Vicki, she lets out a scream, and Joker says "Boo! Hahahaha!" -The Joker having a noisemaker (psuedo-Joker laughs) in his breastpocket go off automatically after plummeting to his death from the churchtower (OK, you could look now) The directing is dark, and atmosphere, and atmosphere. Unlike the sequels which got progressively worse this had ATMOSPHERE. Thank you Tim. It's also well shot. Believe it or not, it was shot in a single studio in the UK. Don't ask me how they fit all those sets into one studio though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman: a commentary on pain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman contrasts two characters to show that the sinful state of the world effects everyone; it's how you are effected that makes the difference. We see in the film that both Batman (Michael Keaton) and the Joker (Jack Nicholson) have suffered life-changing events that effectively cause them to take on the attitudes they do. Director Tim Burton clearly shows the moments that changed each of the character's lives. After Bruce Wayne's parents die, Wayne focuses his anger towards preventing and helping victims of violent crime. As Batman, Wayne takes revenge on all those who commit evil to others while at the same time applying a healing balm to his own emotional wounds. We see in Batman the idea of justice for the oppressed, an idea often expressed in the Hebrew Scriptures. Jack Napier's transformation comes after being betrayed by his boss. The betrayal was so damaging because Napier believed he was respected and trusted by his boss. So after Napier becomes the Joker, we see that his anger becomes his very nature. He lives his life so that others will experience his pain. The movie is very much about coping with hurt. In a fallen world there is pain and injustice. Although understanding is often never found, it is important to know how to continue to live. The Hebrew scriptures give us a pattern for living, `Do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.' (Micah 6:8)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no question that this was the film to see in the summer of 1989. Complete with Kim Basinger, impressive belt-gadgets, the batmobile, an apparently insane joker (masterfully projected by Nicholson), and the dark, brooding figure of philanthropist millionaire Bruce Wayne (Keaton), it promised to be a highly entertaining film. Indeed, the first installment of the series is perhaps the most carefully planned out, with director Tim Burton focusing the movie on the darkness that dwells within the hero of the film, how he is a vigilante with capabilities far beyond the realms of the misplaced and easily-foiled footsoldiers of the Gotham police, and how he has a prestigious lifestyle which defies normal logic, at least when one considers that Wayne is not seen working a single day in the flick, only to emerge at night as Gotham's dark savior. Yet, Bruce Wayne is complex (self admittedly), and has much turmoil in his personal life. A loner at heart, he retains the services of an elderly and undoubtedly British butler, Alfred (Gough), who keep him company, but lacks the presence of a female in his life, or any person at all. He also appears to have a shattered childhood, with both parents having been murdered by another character who takes the spotlight in the film. As a result, the film is decidedly dark, with solid browns, beige overtones and some powder white/black shades on the clothing of the cast (the film is supposed to be set in the 1940s or 1950s, yet there are many anachronisms which conflict with this theory). The sequel to the film had a much more jubilant Keaton, who gladly took in the catwoman into his castle and permitted her to lick his paws clean. Perhaps this is why this film, the first in the series (which became more and more ill-conceived with each sequel), is arguably the best. The film has many climatic moments, some will actually make you shudder with surprise since most of the film is dialogue-based and is run at a low-tone (with the glaring exception of the joker, who steals every scene with his antics). The film's use of the singer Prince for much of music in its scenes demonstrates how Burton intertwined the modern-day mode of fashion in conjunction with the film's time span, probably the 1940s-1950s. Anachronisms aside, it is entertainment for the whole family, though the kids may nod off during the first half of the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it, the world needs superheroes, even if they're only in comic books or up on the silver screen. And it's something everybody needs, though many won't admit it. But if you've ever reached for a highball after a long day at work, or felt the blood drain from your face after seeing the latest figures from Wall Street, or even revisited in your dreams the days when you were so scrawny and little that beating you up was the sport virtually practiced at your school, you want a superhero. Someone to avenge all the wrongs perpetrated upon you by the world and those in it. Well, take a deep breath and relax, because salvation is at hand, via the magic of the movies, with `Batman,' directed by Tim Burton. Millionaire businessman Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) has a secret, as well as a secret identity; one born of the other. His psyche scarred by a traumatic childhood experience, Wayne has devoted his life to fighting crime. But more than that, to putting things aright; and he has the means, the ability and the wherewithal to do it. Donning a black cape and mask when a situation arises, he becomes Batman, the quintessential avenger and rectifier of misdeeds. And right now in Gotham City, his services are needed. The entire city has fallen under the shadow of an evil man, the Joker (Jack Nicholson), whose tidal wave of criminal activity seems unstoppable. Unabated, it may signal the end of the Gotham everyone knows and loves. Their last and best line of defense is the man everyone knows and no one knows; the one the Joker is about meet face to face: Batman. Lifting his hero from the pages of the comic books which spawned him, director Tim Burton has infused him with the breath of life, transforming him into a very real, three-dimensional character. Pure fantasy? Yes. Escapism? Absolutely. Terrific entertainment, with perhaps a subtle message included? You betcha! Burton approaches the story from a very real perspective, rather than as merely a live version of a comic book character, and it works. Splendidly. It is, in fact, the difference between this being nothing more than a cartoon with `live' actors, and being a well crafted and delivered motion picture-- which is exactly what it is.  Creating an atmosphere conducive to the realistic approach he takes, Burton grounds even the most fanciful elements of the film by steeping them in that same sense of reality. The audience is called upon to suspend disbelief to a certain degree, of course, but Burton supplies all the tools you need to do it. And those who use the tools he offers will be rewarded with a rich and riveting experience. It's easy to scoff at an effort like this, and there will always be those who consider themselves `intellectually' above it, but such an attitude is nothing more than self-serving and indicative of an overblown ego and a decided lack of imagination. To those individuals I would say: Look for the metaphor; therein lies the message, enlightenment and maybe even a good time. A gifted actor with an innate penchant for comedy, Keaton left no doubt as to his versatility and his ability to do solid drama with the film `Clean and Sober.' Here, he draws upon his considerable talents to create a character that is credible and believable, and he does it by playing to the man, rather than to the `bat.' And it's the reason his stands as the definitive portrayal, miles ahead of the interpretations of those who followed him in the role in the sequels, Val Kilmer and George Clooney. Accomplished actors, Kilmer and Clooney nevertheless failed to achieve the success Keaton enjoyed as Batman, and it's because they opted to play to the bat, rather than to the man, especially Clooney. By directing their energies-- and the attention of the audience-- to the fantastic aspect of this two-sided character-- to the `bat'-- they compromised the integrity of the reality and lost that edge that made Keaton's portrayal so believable. To put it another way, Keaton played him as a man whose extraordinary motivation and determination enabled him to accomplish extraordinary things; Kilmer and Clooney played him as a superhero who also just happened to be a man. Jack Nicholson gives a memorable performance as the Joker, creating a character whose extroverted, demonstrative nature plays well against Keaton's understated presentation of Batman. It gives a sense of fire and ice to the film, tempered by Burton's atmospherically dark mood (which is established in the opening frames and continues throughout to the very end). Nicholson, who generally plays his characters from a point of introspection, gets a chance to really open up and let loose as the Joker. It's a role he seems to be having a good time with, while at the same time keeping it real and reflecting the vision that Burton realized with this film. The supporting cast includes Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale), Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox), Pat Hingle (Commissioner Gordon), Billy Dee Williams (Harvey Dent), Michael Gough (Alfred), Jack Palance (Boss Grissom) and Jerry Hall (Alicia). A film that works on a number of levels, which accounts for the universal appeal that made it so successful, `Batman' has an engaging, enduring quality that fulfills a need within us all; that need to vent and be sated in the righteousness of justice. It can be enjoyed as simply a good guy versus bad guy movie, or in the deeper sense of Good versus Evil. However you take it, it's a film that you'll appreciate more with each additional viewing. Like a good wine, it gets better with age. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is in my view Tim Burton's best film. It is better than the other three (which I hated except for Batman Returns).Bruice Wayne(Michael Keaton) is a millionaire who goes out every night to fight crime dressed as a bat (I know it sounds kinda' corny but see it and it looks cool). One night during a chemical factory raid a gangster named Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) falls into some chemicals and is mutated into Batman's greatist foe: The Joker. Wayne discovers that as a young man The Joker killed his parents, who he has vowed to avenge.This is Burton's best film. It has great preformances by Nicholson and Keaton, an exelent score, good sets, cotumes, directing, and story-telling. This is one of my all-time favorties.I give Batman 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Batman cometh, Joker's wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the idea of making Batman dark, and tough. I remember being disappointed when I was young, upon realizing, after a few (OK, really one) shows, that Adam West's Batman was a satire. I wanted the real thing. I recall reading a commentary, in anticipation of Batman I, in which the writer disparaged the camp of the 60s show and referred to "all those pinks." The writer had wanted Batman to be "tough, and street." I too, and I also wanted him to be dark.In this movie, the first of the Batman series of the '90s (very slightly imprecise), the viewer certainly gets that. Some thought the darkness was overdone, with too much gothic imagery, and I agree. Perhaps fewer gargoyles and things like that, and less pomposity, more mystery, might have helped. But Tim Burton also presented a psychological profile, with some self doubts and awkwardness, rather than an infallible superhero like 50s/60s TV superheroes, and this is commendable; in fact, to do otherwise might have been unacceptable. A totally clean image it isn't. As love interest Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) says to Batman (Michael Keaton): "You're not exactly normal."Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast as The Joker, and he is clearly the best villain, better than any in the next three. As he virtually always does, Jack plays himself. Aside from that sarcasm, who could have done that "wait until they get a load of me" line better? Does he steal the show? Arguably, but the Batman character needs a solid introduction, and he gets it. However, a negative, as in Batman II and (Val Kilmer in) III, is Keaton's monotone. It really seems it is more pronounced than West's monotone; why can't he talk like a normal person?The Joker is for sure a very evil villain -- in fact, absolutely nefarious, horrible. And yet also very funny. Kim Basinger as Vicki acquits herself rather well in the first half compared with her performances in some of her other flicks; in fact, she is quite good. In the second half, she is more prominent in screams than anything else.The initial scenes were powerful, and funny, with Mayor Borg; it seems NYC crime went down starting with the release of this movie. Batman I was basically interesting and entertaining. But there is the sense that Burton, and the script writers, fell somewhat short on the Batman character. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original &amp; dark film noir classic - an action masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The explosively acted, supremely enjoyable action blockbuster that dominated the 1989 summer box office, "Batman" beat the impressive, more established competition like "Indiana Jones &amp; The Last Crusade," "Lethal Weapon 2," and "License To Kill" (James Bond flick)."Batman" is very dark, spooky, and interesting - it gives appropriate and accurate enough background, pleasing both Dark Knight comic book fans and newcomers to the genre. It stars Michael Keaton (fresh from director Burton's hilarious supernatural thriller "Beetlejuice") as our hero: a vengeful crime fighter whose secret identity, Bruce Wayne, is a rich socialite. Early on in the film we take a trip into Wayne's huge mansion, which scores points for the film with campy secret entrances to an amazing control center and a holding dock to several bat-vehicles. The true star of any superb action film, though, is always the villain, and in "Batman" this is very true. Jack Nicholson plays The Joker with every bit of scene-stealing sarcasm and classical tension that he's shown in his more contemporary and dramatic flicks. Nicholson is hysterical as the ill-fated criminal who falls into a vat of chemicals, only to emerge as a clown-faced megalomaniac who tries to wreak havoc upon Gotham City (a noir-ish takeoff of New York City). Starring as the love interest caught between Batman and the Joker (and a compelled newspaper writer) is the stunning Kim Basinger, who immediately begins to dig under Wayne's skin."Batman's" action sequences, stunts, and art direction (which won an Oscar) are all superb, with good acting, writing, and direction to round the film out. In my opinion, the only minor flaws in "Batman" are that bits and pieces of the film are slightly boring and overlong (parts in the interior of Bruce Wayne's house) and some of the characters are too one-dimensional and unexplained (Jack Palance's Grissom and Robert Wuhl's Knox, especially). Otherwise, the film succeeds admirably, especially with Danny Elfman's score and songs by 80s pop star Prince. Also, the ending is a satisfying and unique finish to a fun movie.Tim Burton's "Batman" is a thrill ride through a dark world. It rivals (if not surpasses) the bright, cheerful "Superman" in the category of best movie adaptation of a comic book series. Note to Parents: there are some very suggestive themes, a bit of foul language, and some scary and violent scenes. I'd recommend this film to anyone: fans of other Batman media sources, action movie fans, or people who like a slick, well-made movie. Rent this hit soon - you'll enjoy it.JLevin's Final Rating: 9 out of 10 dollars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the picture that started it all. Is there anyone who does not like this picture better then all the following? Better yet, anyone who dislikes it above all others? Well, if you have not before heard of one who does, now you have, that is right boys and girls. This movies is worse then all the rest. Why? Lots of reasons to be explained later. First, however, I would like to embark on a short journey to explain just why it is sooo popular. It consists of two solid reasons the first of which can be applied to most first movies in a series. It is the first of it's kind, first born, so to speak. Someone has to be first in order to have a second and this is the one that happened to be it. So what am I saying? If another like Batman Returns was the initial grain it would be loved to bits as well? Yes, that is exactly what I am saying, so just admit it already! The other reason is that Jack Nicholson happened to be in it and, as anyone can tell, it does not take grand acting abilities on his part to play a joker. He is, shall I say, a natural at it. Now that that is over why don't I go over the not-so-good points? Besides the shoreline being boring and childish, the one bad guy rather then two does not work as well to peek interest. The helpless maiden in distress is irritating beyond belief. Batman movies are soo much better with fisty girls rather then little pillow maidens made of glass and blond hair. Lastly, perhaps this one would have been better had it been made a bit later because as it is, it looks old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to applaud a movie that takes something as far fetched as a costumed superhero and makes it believable in realistic surroundings. That's why I think the Michael Keaton Batman movies are so superior to the later films in the series. The campiness of that live action tv cartoon is quickly forgotten as we see what Batman would really look like in our three dimensional world, but you have to think, if this darker and more grim figure had popped up in the Sixties or the Seventies, might we know who he was with that comedic visage of Adam West as Batman trapped in our minds. This is the best role that Michael Keaton has ever done, both in costume and as Bruce Wayne, and the movie that made us forget Jack Nicholson's catch phrase from the Shining. A lot of kudos also have to go to Jack Palance, quite possibly the only man who could put Nicholson in his place. All the men are augmented by the masterful direction and vision of Tim Burton and a script that takes the viewer to the same height that the first Superman did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason I can see this movie everyday of the week and I won't get tired of it. I consider it one of my favorite movies and while not the Batman that we know in the comics it was still very entertaining and true to the original comics from Bob Kane. The Joker was very funny in it and while Batman wasn't that fleshed out it was still amazing everytime he showed up on screen and Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale was one of my first crushes. I first saw this movie in 1989 and I still watch it today and while the original scripts were an improvement over what was filmed I still love it. Next to "Superman II" and maybe "Blade" this is quite possibly the best comic book movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Influential Film based on a graphic novel that sets the stage for more dark themed graphic novel based films such as The Punisher(1990), The Heroic Trio(1993), Saviour of the Soul(1993), Blade(1999), and The X-Men(2000). In the hands of Tim Burton, the Batman series were good with their use of brooding visuals and outlandish landscapes. Once they went into someone else's hands the Batman series became silly and stupid. Jack Nicholson gives a flamboyant performance that takes away the subtle turn by actor Michael Keaton as Batman.Michael Keaton does the best job of all the actors who portrayed the Caped Crusader in the four Batman films. The church seen in the climatic sequence with Batman chasing The Joker is a replica of the church from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo(1958). The scene even rips of the famous chase of the main protagonist in Vertigo(1958). One of the films weaknesses is there never seems to be any kind of chemistry between Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale that works with the same emotions of Lois Lane and Superman in The first two Superman movies.The director was mightingly influenced by the mood and style of Mario Bava and its apparent in the film's set designs and art direction. A Bava picture that possibly inspired Batman(1989) in its feel and looks is Diabolik(1968). Jack Palance is in the film for too short a time to make any sort of impression as Boss Carl Grissom. Not as emotionally involving as Superman the Movie(1978), Batman(1989) still has enough visual punch to make it last as a closing chapter of the 1980s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson Steals Spotlight from Keaton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to see Michael Keaton wear the Batman outfit when I first saw the film because I was used to him being in funny films. After a few minutes into the film I became used to the idea of Keaton as Batman. In my opinion Michael Keaton of all three actors that played Batman in films has to be the best of them all so far. Unlike Superman the Movie(1978), Batman(1989) did not make the casting choice of picking an unknown actor to play Batman(1989). Jack Nicholson made headlines when starring in Batman(1989) because of the then large salary he was making from the picture. In the beginning of the picture his character of Jack Napier seems like a variation of Charlie Partaine of Prizzi's Honor(1985). His characterization of the Joker is so flamboyant and wild to the point of pushing Batman's antics to the sidelines. Nicholson's performance's as The Joker makes him the best villain in the four Batman films.Kim Basinger puts on one of her raw very good performances as Vicki Vale. Her part was originally written for Sean Young who got injured doing a scene that didn't make it into the final script. Robert Wuhl does an alright job as journalist Alexander Knox. Jack Palance and Jerry Hall are in the film for too short a time to make any kind of impression.The designs of Batman's Gothem City would influence the looks of many later Scifi/Graphic Novel motion pictures. In one way Batman(1989) was more influential to other Comic Books adaptations into films than Superman the Movie(1978) was because of the former's stylistic themes. The soundtrack for Batman(1989) is as good as the soundtrack John Williams did for Superman the Movie(1978). Gothem City in Batman(1989) combines the look of Fritz Lang's Metrpolis(1926), Ridley Scott's Blade Runner(1982), and Terry Gilliam's Brazil(1985).Mario Bava has influenced many filmmakers around the world especially the director of Batman, Tim Burton. Perhaps no one has been influenced by the visual style and use of colorization of Mario Bava as has been the case with Tim Burton(Dario Argento although influenced by Mario Bava has a style that completely his own). This influence can be seen in the way Tim Burton uses bizarre set designs to depict a strange dreamish landscape that doesn't seem real. The Mario Bava picture that I feel was visually stylisticly responsible for the look and mood of Batman(1989) is Diabolik(1968).Although I think that Batman(1989) is a very good film and entertaining as well its still not in the same realm as Superman the Movie(1978) for three reasons. First, there is almost no chemistry between Batman/Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale as there was with Superman and Lois Lane. Second, Batman(1989) fails to reach the grandeur of Superman the Movie(1978) on many ideas and themes. Three, Superman the Movie(1978) contained a three dimensional story that made the viewer interested about what happened to the main characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's 1989 remake of Batman is in my opinion the best "superhero film" ever made. The Batman series and movies from the 60's which starred Adam West in the role as the caped crusader always had a comedic approach however the new Batman was very dark and dead serious.I love the design in the film and the closing scenes in the clocktower is truly a masterpiece. Michael Keaton was brilliant as Batman and Jack Nicholson, who's never done a bad performance, is excellent as The Joker.I reckon the new Spiderman film will not reach the heights that Batman did, after seeing the trailer i dont even know if i want to see it. The only downside of Batman is the soundtrack (by Prince) it's all very 80's but maybe it suits the crazy Joker, but I dont like it. Overall I rate Batman as a 7/10.* Good film * Great Design * A daring and very successful project!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best comic book adaption to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSITION ON MY TOP 100 FILMS (2001): 100. Tim Burton's Batman is certainly the best comic book adaption to date, and "Batman" is probably the best comic out there. Burton was a perfect choice for director, I can't think of anyone who could pull it off as well. Jack Nicholson is great at his OTT best as the Joker, whilst although Michael Keaton seems like an odd choice to play Batman, it is difficult to imagine anyone doing it after seeing the film. Burton's dark, moody style makes this feel very like the Dark Knight comic books, and every scene is beautifully shot. Many have critisised Burton for putting nothing into his films but visuals, but that isn't true. Although Burton is better at visuals than anything else (this is a movie after all, not a radio show), the script is good, and all the actors involved give it their best. The best of the Batman films (much better than Schumacher's feeble attempts), I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys the dark style of the comic, or any fan of Burton's work, which I have been since I was about 7 and I first saw this film.90% - ***** (out of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film did a good job of depicting Batman as he was originally envisioned by his creator. Rather than the campy feel of the 1960s television show, this Batman was dark and brooding - a riddle wrapped up within himself. The film's dark setting helps to transform the viewer into Batman's world. A world filled with subtle motives and strange people. In Batman's world, things are not as they appear. Most of what we see is window dressing for the common folk to understand us.Even though Burton does a decent job of trying to communicate Batman's world to the audience, he still throws in a few conventional plot twists and predictable lines to make this offer palpable to general audiences. All in all, a good effort with some fine performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've ever read any of my other reviews, you would know that I am a huge Tim Burton fan. For me, this is the perfect movie! My two favorite actors are Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. My favorite director is Burton (Lucas is in close second), favorite composer...Danny Elfman. The only thing that could make this movie better for me would be Olivia Newton-John as Vicki Vale. (HUGE Olivia fan), but Kim did an all right job.I tell you all of this to let you know that I am partially biased to this movie, so there's very little bad I could say about it.Burton's view on Gotham was incredible. I love the fact that the entire movie was dark, except for the Joker, whose bright colors and white face really stood out. The score by Elfman was, I feel, his best ever. His Batman theme actually made me forget about the campy 60's "Batman" theme (which is classic, but not made for Burton's Gotham) I believe the theme ranks up there with some of the greatest movie themes of all time...Star Wars, Jaws, Psycho, Godfather.Keaton was by far, the best Batman in any of the movies. Let me rephrase that. Anyone can play Batman (George Clooney?), but Keaton was the best Bruce Wayne. Okay, so the story wasn't the greatest story of all time, but remember that you're watching a movie based on a comic book. Do comic books have great stories?Overall, this is my favorite movie of all time. I know that seems weird considering all of the other great movies out there, but like I said, it had everything that I could want in a movie...except Olivia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton never has disappointed me (with the small exception of Mars Attacks!). Batman, in my opinion, contains some of his best work to date. The way Gotham City is portrayed was so perfect. A cold, dark, gray and dreary city. Michael Keaton was a good choice as Batman and really pulls it off well. He may not have been a look-a-like for Bruce Wayne in the comic, but he made up for it with great acting. But the real prize is good ol' Jack! Whoa! What a performance!! Jack Nicholson is superb as the Joker. I would have to say the Joker is one of the all time best movie villains just behind Darth Vader. I still laugh in all of the Jokers' scenes and I've seen this movie at least 50 times! Kim Basinger was average as Vicki Vale. The rest of the cast was good as well. Danny Elfman is my favorite composer and this score was the one that really made me realize how wickedly twisted yet so surreal his work is. The main theme was so good they even kept using it in the trailers for the last 2 (which were stinkers). The story isn't that outstanding, but it's not trying to be. This was a movie based on a comic so it was suppose to be simple yet fun. If you love Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Jack Nicholson or Michael Keaton I highly recommend Batman. All of the just mentioned people shine in this great action-packed comic adaption of Gotham's dark knight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the live-action versions of the Dark Knight, BATMAN is the one that comes the closest to working. While still not entirely faithful to its source material, it's been accepted by many Bat fans as the best of the live-action films. Michael Keaton may have seemed an odd choice for the part at first, but he does a great job. The way he portrays Bruce Wayne and then does a complete role reversal as Batman shows his talent. And he does have that dark look to him that also makes him a good choice for the part. Of course, Jack Nicholson must be mentioned, for he's as over-the-top as possible playing the Clown Prince of Crime himself, The Joker. He must have had a blast doing this film; it's quite obvious. Moving at a brisk pace, director Tim Burton brings his unique style to the film. It's a shame the sequels are on a steady decline, because this first film is so good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they call it "Batman"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was probably called "Batman" because of the continuity required of the franchise, but it is "Batman" in name only. The movie should have been called "The Joker". Why? The Joker got the most screen time! Plus, he got the best lines, and he had peaks and valleys in his character which made him entertaining! Batman/Bruce Wayne as the hero was virtually an afterthought. His best lines weren't NEAR as entertaining, and the characters were as flat as Kansas. The Joker was flamboyantly insane, and you enjoyed every minute of him. B/BW's insanity portrayal that was all but implied was limited to close-ups of his stony visage, sharp pivots and monotone dialogue delivery(probably due to the fact that Michael Keaton was paid less than Jack Nicholson. Jack was paid $80 million, an actor's wage so high it holds a world's record. At that rate, Jack had better pour his heart and soul into the character, and he did). All in all, it was a good movie, but its priorities were skewed.SPOILER HERE---That last scene with the Batwing was stupid. Batman had tons of machine guns, missiles and advanced sighting technology. It ALL missed the Joker, who was in a stationary, wide-open, "free target" position. What's worse, the totally unscathed Joker shot the *moving* Batwing down WITH ONE BULLET from a small handgun that had primitive line-of-sight aiming. Wayne's rich, but he's not dumb when it comes to technology that supports his anti-crime vendetta.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have seen this movie over 35 times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic, touching, visceral movie which has no rival yet in the Batman series. This one has incredible depictions of madness by the Joker, and a Bruce Wayne by Jack Nicholson which makes us care more for the man behind the mask and not the hero. Kim Basinger makes a very good love interest, and the triangle formed gives us a totally diferent experience in the Batman world, just like only Tim Burton could make it. The gothic feel of "Edward Scissorhands" is here constant, which gives us a director's trademark which stands and puts this movie in a position far beyond the one of the comic book adaptations. Original work in all departments, standouts by the art directors, and Danny Elfman with a rousing Batman march.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson and Keaton star in the ultimate Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS-This film is a far cry better than the rest of the sequels put together!The most weight of the success of the sequels going to Batman Returns that was good but paled in comparison to this first and finest installment. The art direction is unbeatable and the story was very dark, brooding, but exciting and entertaining all at one film. I believe this is one of Nicholson's finest performances as the unforgettable Joker and Keaton is the best Batman to ever grace the screen (although I love Val Kilmer-but he just wasn't Batman to me). Jack Palance makes a brief but memorable Grissom and the city is a Gothic fairyland all in it's own. I thought Basinger gave an alright performance, but I believe many actresses would have fit the bill as Vicky Vale. What I liked most was the story line of the Joker killing Bruce's parents and how Bruce must face this evil clown who in one stroke took everything he ever loved. Then he realizes he must deal with this and then face him! Excellent thriller, action flick and story of revenge and betrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Batman yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best Batman movie to come out. Tim Burton's dark sceneries help contribute to a much more entertaining and realistic film then the other three batman's. Micheal Keaton plays an outstanding dark and gloomy batman, and on the other side and calm rich man. Jack Nicholsons performance as batmans arch nemesis "Joker" is by far the best enemy batman has faced in the four movies. Nicholson does a great job of playing a sick and twisted villan, with some added humor. Kim Bassinger looks her finest in this movie and does a good job of playing Bruce Wayne's "lady" of this film. Batman is my top choice of the 4 movies that have been made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second great comic book adaption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over ten years after the world was inspired by Superman, and subsequently disgusted with its three sequels, Tim Burton released an unflinching look at the Dark Knight, Batman.This film stands alone as THE greatest comic book adaption of our time. The characters are full and real, the sets are dismal and perfection, and the acting is amazing on all fronts. There is not one instance of the film flinching from its gut wrenching story. There is honesty in every character, yes even in Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance as the Joker, that hits home several ideas about reality. Batman, a comic book hero for over 40 years, is just a little less insane than the Joker.This film introduced most of us, children then, to the idea of a story being "dark" in more than just lighting. It stands as a testament that, not only can a comic book adaption be marketable, but it can also be a truly great film.Even though its sequels are some of the worst on record, they cannot take away from this true masterpiece.</fullReview>

The movie zooms along at a steady clip, while managing to mix in serious drama, and themes such as fate, and duality.

		<shortDescription>There will never be another Batman like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a bit bias to this movie. I never try to be bias to anything, but certain movies are a bit nostalgic to me. I grew up watching movies such as Predator, Terminator 2, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Star Wars. I also grew up with Batman. This Batman.This is the way Batman was intended to look: dark, big, and dramatic. No other Batman movie has ever come this close to being good. When I tell people, "Batman is a great movie," they look at me as if I am crazy. Most people don't remember this movie. It has JACK NICHOLSON as the Joker, in one of his best performances. It has MICHAEL KEATON as Batman, who was born to play the role as Connery was born for Bond and Arnold was born for the Terminator. As for Kim Basinger, I am not a big fan of her. Her only point is to be the love interest. I wish that they had elaborated on the Joker and Bataman and cut her out completly. They could have put in a smaller lady for the bat, but people want to see Batman and the Joker, not Kim Basinger. And if you do want to see nothing but Kim, go rent I Dream of Africa and tell me how nauseous you feel afterward. Ten years later, the special effects are still pretty cool (though some have dated). The movie is dark, which is smart because the darkness covers up many of the wires on special effect crap. You Roger Ebert people out there will not like this movie due to the lack of light. But this is Batman's environment. The night.This movie also has some of the most memorible quotes and scenes ever. The scene where the Joker is getting his first peek at his plastic surgery and is thrown into a fit of laughter is genius. Quotes like, "Wait till they get a load of me," and, "Where does he get such wonderful toys?" are classic.I love the Batman character. He is the most human of all the superheroes because, well, he's human. He has no special powers. The only thing he has is a bunch of money. A whole bunch of money. I like him because he faces real criminals and real problems. In the comics and TV shows he faced gangsters and thugs. I consider him to be a detective in a cape. My favorite super hero of all time is still Spawn (though the movie is horrible), but the Bat is a close second and will remain in my heart due to my Batman childhood.If you haven't seen this movie, see it now. Sure there are some logic holes. Sure some of the effects have dated. Sure Kim Basinger has as much point in this movie as a bagel has in a meat factory. But the movie is not only the best Batman movie ever, it is also one of the coolest movies ever.8/10(Note: I am bias to this flick, so don't blame me if you hate it)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good interpretation of Batman and his best known nemesis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time it was made, this was the best interpretation of the Batman legend outside of the print medium. Since then, both Batman Returns and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm have proven it can be done even better. But this doesn't detract from a fun, action-filled movie without any of the camp from the old tv show. Of course, the main reason to see the movie is Jack Nicholson's excellent portrayal of The Joker. And long-time comics fans should be happy with the return of Vickie Vale, played very well by Kim Basinger.The movie contains some "liberties" with the classic Batman mythos, including The Joker's real name being given as Jack Napier and the idea that he murdered Bruce Wayne's parents. But even in the comics little details like this change every five to ten years as the stories are updated for new audiences, so complaints about this are truly picking at nits. Overall, this is a great adaptation of a comic book classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What makes this film the best of the Batman movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Joker!Simple!The Joker is what really makes this movie. Without The Clown Prince of Crime, this film would be rubbish. And I don't think that they could have picked a better actor for the part. Jack Nicholson performs flawlessly as gangster Jack Napier, and his alter ego The Joker.Perhaps one of the most memorable scenes in the movie is that of the dinner date at the Art Gallery. The exstatic face on The Joker as he enters was enough to set me off laughing, what with his ridiculous grin, and the stupid purple artists hat he is wearing. But then, he and his hoods begin to dance away to Partyman whilst ruining the artwork therein. The best part of this scene is undoubtebly the part with the statuette. The Joker looks at a small statuette on a raised display box. The statuette appears to be some sort of dancer with her arms out to either side and one leg up behind her. The Joker begins to imitate his pose, hopping on one leg. He then draws his arms across his own chest then flings them outwards, knocking the statuette off its stand. I was in tears watching this happen as it looked so ridiculous for a villain.Some of the quotes from The Joker, and Jack Napier, will stay with me for a long time, here's some of the best ones:"Can somebody tell me...what kind of a world we live in...where a man dressed up as a BAT...gets all my press? This town needs an enima!""And where is the Batman...HE'S AT HOME...WASHING HIS TIGHTS!!!""Jesus!" (This was said by Jack Napier when he first saw Batman in Axis Chemicals. It made my friend and I wonder just what kind of religion the people of Gotham City followed, since they recognise giant bats as Jesus :-))"Why didn't anybody tell me he had one of those...things!""We've got a flying mouse to kill...and I wanna clean my claws!""Grease them now!?!?!?" (Said by The Joker, pretending to be Jack napier in front of a group of crime lords, to a dead crime organisation member. It wasn't really what he said, just the ridiculous expression on his face as he pretended to receive an answer from the dead man!!! :-))"Beauty...and the beast. Anybody else calls you beast...I'll rip their lungs out!" (Said to Vicky Vale as she and the Joker dance at the top of Gotham Cathedral)Overall, a really good dark movie with good performances from all actors. Another good choice was Jack Palance as the role of Carl Grissom, Jack Napier's boss. He's got a really cool voice, and it went well with the gangster setting, as did Nicholsons too! Michael Keaton was definetly the best Batman, miles better than both Val Kilmer and George Clooney for the films second and third sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Humor, Dark Knight, Dark direction... The darkest Batman of all! Batman is a revenger, that is what Burton wants us to think, he revenges crime, but he can't live without it, he couldn't exist without it. "You made me, i made you! Ha ha ha!" Joker is right! This film is the best comic adaption ever, Superman was for kids! The Crow was good too, X-men is just good, Spawn sucks! Ofcourse without a proper script, Batman would be like it's sequel dumm but good! The direction is outstanding? Maybe, but what sends Batman on top is its art direction: A dark city, many dark spots where crime is hide... Big buildings, Dark people! But can Batman bring the light? No! Why not, because he doesn't have it! He can fight crime but he doesn't care if people will survive or not, or he does... He soul is deeply hurt and he is always in a bad mood! That's what makes this batman the best and the darkest.The perfomances are outstanding, the whole cast acts brilliant. Take Jack for example(Bad example though...) he acts madly, like a proffesional madman! Mike(Batman) acts good, he is the best batman of all(Goerge Clooney is nice too). Basinger sometimes flat sometimes very good, but Pfeifer was better(in the sequel). About Joker's Helpers now, they are really good and i think they have set the rules for the rest of the sequels, they will die for their boss, they are as mad as he is.To finish with, i would like to comment the great sense of humor Joker has! Black and really, i just say that: "(he)was feeling hot today!".</fullReview>

He includes humor, romance and action to this film about the greatest comic book hero of all-time. An incredible cast and a powerful music score make this one of the best comic book hero films.

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has a gift for mixing darkness with humor.In this film, he began a series of Batman movies that take us into the dark psyche. The title character is the good-bad guy who may be as demented as his foes. Atmosphere, sets, and music give the proper ominous tone to a very strange, comic, epic, and tragic confrontation between Keaton and Nicholson.The movie plays like manic OEDIPUS REX with wonderfully funny lines and sight gags punctuating the drama. Where else can you see the hero unload a whole machine-gun magazine and miss, only to be taken down by the villain shooting one bullet from a heck of a phallic pistol?The film is great dark fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I had reservations when I heard Batman was to be played by Michael Keating. I could only think of Beetlejuice which I hated. How wrong I was! When he has the costume on he is superb. I liked the 'hard' edge to it and the costume was even beater in Batman Returns. I can't fault the Batmobile and Batwing either.What really makes the film for me is the score by Danny Elfman. It's one of my favourite soundtracks ever - thank God there's no Prince tracks on it. The main theme is excellent and the music where Batman takes Vicky Vale to his Batcave is also excellent. It's right up there with John Williams' Star Wars and Ennio Morricone's Spaghetti Westerns scores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman the movie is one big roller coaster ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember when this movie was released in 1989. In the Cinema, I was in awe of the start of Batman. Two robbers had just stolen from a small family and are discussing the possibility that there is a man dressed as a bat terrorising crims all over Gotham City. In an instant in flys this awesome figure being discussed and scares the hell out of the robbers. Knocking one of them out, he lifts the other to the edge of the building. The robber pleas `Don't kill me man!', the reply `I am not going to kill you, I want you to tell all your friends about me!', in a panic the robbers asks `Who are you?', the answer given, `I'm Batman!'. So starts one of the great movies to end the 1980's.Batman is about a Dark Knight, who after witnessing his parent's murder as a kid, takes it upon himself as an adult to rid Gotham City of all criminal activity. While Gotham City also has a new criminal in town, the homicidal maniac known as the comical Joker! Also in Gotham is award winning photographer, Vicki Vale whose trying to work out who is the mysterious Batman? So, can Batman stop the Joker from ruling Gotham City?Now in a film such as this, I would usually talk about the good characters first, yet this film is different. The role of the Joker, played Jack Nicholson, was in my opinion brilliant. Some of his scenes were just fantastic. But I can also appreciate that some people think this role in its way ruined this film. Some of the best scenes with the Joker were when the Joker appears on TV, meeting Vicki Vale at Gotham Museum and at the 200th Anniversary of Gotham City. Actually one of the standout parts of the film is when the Joker stands and waits for Batman to fly near him in the Batplane. As it gets near the Joker reveals a huge-long Gun. This was great. One other part of this role which I loved and that other's might hate is the Joker's ridiculous laugh. I thought it was great, and say that it was Nicholson's own laugh. I hope if the Joker comes back in another Batman film, that Jack Nicholson can play the role which he was made for. I also heard that Nicholson was paid over $80 million dollars for this role. Worth every penny in my view. This film wouldn't have worked without the correct choice in the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton was perfectly casted as Batman. As Bruce Wayne he was the true millionaire type, yet in the Batsuit his whole character changed and just the way the Batman character needed. Keaton bought two mood swings to the film which I liked. Unfortunately, Keaton has done some bad films in his time. Movies such as Mr Mom and Multiplicity were utter garbage. I'm glad he got this role and that he got it right. Roles which were of less focus on this film, were also great. Alfred, the butler of Bruce Wayne was played by Michael Gough. Again perfect casting made this role. Gough, like Nicholson as the Joker, was made for this role. Without him, the other Batman films would have been even worse then they are. The beautiful Kim Basinger was great as Photographer Vicki Vale. She is very attractive to the eye and not a bad actress. Her role as the love interest for Bruce Wayne was a pleasant part to this movie.The set for this Batman was tremendous. Alot of the credit for this needs to go to late production designer, Anton Furst. He designed the Gotham City props, the Batcave and the Axis Chemical plant (from an old industrial plant). Another incredible part of this film was the amount of gadgets Batman had. His belt buckle, Batmobile and Batplane were outstanding. This was all possible thanks to the genius of Furst. I have seen the original Batmobile up close and it is a great piece of Automobile. Credit also needs to go to Director Tim Burton. I believe he got the `Dark Knight' just right, with the perfect feel to it. He added what he thought was needed. Batman's creator Bob Kane, would have been proud to see that his ideas from comic book sketches as a teenager so many years ago, would decades later become a cult hero like this on the big screen.The original Batman is my favourite of the four Batman films, I loved it. Nicholson might have stole the show, but his character required him to do this. Movie Reviewers also agree with me: -`The Movie Of The Decade (1980's).' - Erik Preminger, KGO-TV/San Francisco-`Fours Stars, Spectacular Entertainment!' - Jack Garner, Gannett News Service-`A Triumph. You Can't Take Your Eyes Off It.' Peter Travers, Rolling StoneWhat more do I have to say? If you haven't seen this film watch it ASAP!!!!!Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It changed my perception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman was the first film I remember standing in line for. By the time I got in the theater, it was packed. The grumbling and chatter of the audience continued on into the previews, but when the opening credits came on the screen, everyone went silent. It was then when I became completely blown away.The look and style of the film was like nothing I had ever seen, or could imagine. It was truly a sensational vision, a mixture of dark, gloomy, and very bleak. It was like something out a dream, part sci-fi and part film noir. I still get amazed just by seeing the set designs, cinematography, and visual effects no matter how many times I watch it.There is such a startling contrast between the hero and villain, but it is the hero who is covered in darkness. I was raised on the campy TV series, and seeing Batman as the Dark Knight both startled and exhilarated me. I always hear people complain, but I say Michael Keaton was perfect for the role of Batman, because the real job of acting was portraying Bruce Wayne. I never felt more sympathy for a movie character than I did with Bruce Wayne.It was one of the few movies I ever lost myself in. For me the line between realism and fantasy blurs here, and what a joy that is to see. That is what I feel movies are meant to do. Batman showed me the meaning of movie magic. The entire look and style is groundbreaking, especially for a mainstream movie. Once the movie starts, I can never take my eyes off it til the credits role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will forever in my mind be a milestone in my life. I was 9 when this movie came out, and it was the first movie to make me take notice of a director and a movie score composer: Tim Burton and Danny Elfman. This will always be THE Batman of the movies, not the flashy schlock which Joel Schumacher thought would do justice to the Dark Knight's image. Michael Keaton is the only one to play Batman with any conviction. Jack Nicholson as the Joker, is the epitome of a villain you love to hate. I think I saw this move 5 times in the theater. Although the FX might look a bit dated, the movie still stands the test of time as the best Batman movie ever. You can see that every Batman spin-off, whether it's on TV or the big screen, is trying to capture the feel of Burton's Batman (including ripping off Elfmans great score). I'm awaiting the release of Batman: Year One directed by Darron Aronofsky (PI, Requiem for a Dream), and I hope he does the series some justice with an original, gritty take on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good spin on an old classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton gave the masses back their musing, moody and mystifying crimefighter, from the 1960's series that totally camped out the original story line. Camp is fine and usually fun, but lordy, there are limits.Michael Keaton is appropriately subdued and somber and Kim Basinger is fabulous. Jack Nicholson got into the role like "Sherman's March to the Sea." It would have been a rancorous challenge to find someone else, who could have filled those waffle-stompers. Given Nicholson's reputation for offbeat roles, and his strong work ethic, this was no puffy, stale and half-hearted performance. He truly embodies the underworld's psychotic version of Bozo. When you throw these folks in, with a veteran cast of character actors, you really can't miss. The sets are gloomy and audacious in effect, the special effects are impressive (and not over-used, even the butt of some tongue in cheek dialogue). The music runs from bassy orchestral to funkish pop. The editing is superb, keeping paces between the drama and action, with hardly a glitch.All elements considered, a pretty satisfying movie. The cast looks to have had a good time, and the movie didn't break the easy taboo of taking itself too darn seriously. Best, of course, if seen on a large screen, but don't let this discourage you from trooping off to the video kiosk of your choice. Recommended. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Comic Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. I loved the original "Superman" film, and last year's "X-Men" was another fortunate blessing, but this was the film that reignited "Bat-Mania", which has survived pretty well this past decade plus.Tim Burton "got" the overall feel of what Batman is about. I remember scoffing when I heard that Michael Keaton was to play the Dark Knight (This was "Beetlejuice" and "Mr. Mom", remember). Now I look back and think he was the best choice of all the actors ever to play the title role. And they couldn't have gotten a better person to play the Joker than Jack Nicholson. The only other Batman/Joker pair that could have possibly done it better (at least in voice alone) would be Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill from "The Animated Series". Michael Gough played a good Alfred (and later became the film series only saving grace), but Kim Basinger was overall pretty average is this film, Jerry Hall gave a wooden performance, and as much as I like Billy Dee Williams, Harvey Dent was a white guy. Unusual casting choice. But Nicholson? He had the Joker's mania and cruel sense of humor down. Batman wasn't really given as much definition as he needed until the second film.What made the film so memorable, however, were the fantastic gothic sets mixed with the Joker's flair for dramatic color, the sleek Batmobile (still one of the best looks around), and Danny Elfman's incredible score. Tim Burton added his touch for focusing on the strange and twisted, especially the kind found in people's psyches. For a dual personality like Bruce Wayne/Batman and even the Joker, it worked well, and Burton loves to find these niches. Even in the fantasy setting such as this, Burton gave the film an air of seriousness that, despite a man running around in a rubber batsuit fighting an evil clown, the film needed and later had taken away in the third and even moreso the fourth film. "The Animated Series" has remained Batman's only saving grace, mainly because of it's wonderful team and Burton-inspired designs.Warner Bros. should have given Burton whatever he wanted to have him continue the film series. It suffered horribly after the second film, and hopefully, they'll get it right again with the next film. But this is a great classic, which provides great visuals, an unforgettable villain, cool "toys", and of course, the best hero soundtrack since "Superman". Just try to forget about Prince's "Bat-Dance". Eeesh. Commercialism.For some reason, this film struck me as really funny when I heard it once in French. *shrug* Who knew?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When cartoonist Bob Kane first imagined Batman in 1939, this movie is no doubt basically what he wanted to convey with ink and paint. Tim Burton's foray into the world of the Dark Knight is the best in movie history, and possibly all history as well. It is at once cutting-edge and yet charmingly old-fashioned: dark, cynical, and starkly realistic; yet steeped in romantic fantasy and eternal good vs. evil themes. Jack Nicholson is funny, compelling, and oddly sympathetic as The Joker, a tortured clown-man whose smile masks grimmer purposes; and Michael Keaton gives a stellar performance as the black-clad title character. Kim Basinger and Jack Palance co-star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Joker, not enough BATMAN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When making a movie called BATMAN, one would expect several things. First, young Bruce Wayne's parents are shot, and he vows to avenge them. Then, he devises his method of vengeneance and becomes a creature of the night. Eventually he meets up with a evil villain, the Joker, but is triumphant and saves the day. It is good that Tim Burton and Sam Hamm were original enough to defy expectations, but by doing so they missed out on giving us a movie about Batman. What they've done instead is created a movie that should have been called THE JOKER. Batman is a fascinating character, and he deserves to be the focus of his own movie. I also understand that there's an iron law that states all action movies must have a love interest, but Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale was only necessary to the plot as (a) cabbage (a character who has to have things explained to them so the audience might understand plot details better) and (b) bait. Batman's a loner. A girlfriend would just get in his way, so the love relationship between Vale and Batman is rather silly, but being bait works better if its the hero's girlfriend. Having Vale and Batman together is a dramatic dead-end, which might be why she wasn't in the sequels. Despite the flaws, BATMAN is a good movie and captures the mood and style of the comics (even if it does get details wrong).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dark, wild, and spooky adventure about the Caped Crusdaer (Michael Keaton) who dukes it out with the dangerous and funny Joker (Jack Nicholson) with Gotham city and a beautiful photographer, Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) are hanging in the balance.Director Tim Burton knows how to make a film of any genre fun to watch here. This film and his most recent one, "Sleepy Hollow" would make terrific examples. He never tries to get fancy with the camera and he lets the story unfold slowly.Besides the film and the memorable performances given out to perfection by Keaton, Nicholson, Basinger, and Michael Gough as Alfred, the butler. Composer Danny Elfman stirs up a great musical score and Anton Furst, who creates an unforgettable production design (and won an Oscar for his effort).Kudos to Burton, because he is a genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of you got it, some did not. So let me tell you whatyou missed. This film is analogous to World War II. It's an American-British alliance forced into despicable fascistic behavior in order to crush the Axis powers. You might have heard of this name, Hitler??????Nicholson's Joker's television takeover "I am not the terrorist, Batman Is" speech is lifted directly from the same speech that Hitler made over the radio 60 years ago referrring to a terrorist named Winston Churchill.This world has gone out of scale and human beings have been reduced to cartoon figures, overwhelmed by the out-scaleworld they built not realizing what was happenning. Joker embraces this new fascistic world of evil and gratification. Batman copes with it, never understanding why young Jack Napier wasted his parents for no more than a whim. Art museums are supposed to be art museums, not privileged snooty restaurants for the well connected. The media is SUPPOSED to take sides against evil (Robert Wuhl), not be fascinated by it (Kim Bassinger) until the evil Joker comes to claim his prize. Police Commissioner's are not supposed to be familiar with the dice tables. This film is fascism vs. fascism in a world gone out of scale. Only the tormented Batman lowers himself to his enemies level (exactly what WE did in WW-2) so as to defeat him and then afterwards, try to reclaim his humanity.The film also works as mass entertainment. "What kind of a world do we live in where a man dressed up as a Bat steals all of my press?"This is a cinematic Masterwork up there with Citizen Kane and best of John Ford. Sorry some of you didn't pick up on that. You missed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman(1989) brought a new era to the film industry's perception of how to bring super heros to the silver screen. Tim Burton's masterful wizardry assisted this transition and is most responsible for setting this precedent (which some chose not to follow, and paid greatly for it) Michael Keaton is The Batman, and keeps Bruce Wayne and Batman separated understanding their unique styles and characteristics, fusing them into one being. The result will mark one of his greatest performances alongside Beetlejuice. Jack Nicholson brings the Joker to an all new level, resurrecting him from a hooting, skipping, bad-doing clown, to an artistic, psychological profile who is intelligent and gets his kicks by kicking others. A great performance not to be missed! Kim Bassinger is of great interest, and Michael Gough is Alfred Pennyworth. This film has become THE standard for all future films transitioning super characters from the books to the screen. (except for Joel Schumacher who ruined the legacy of the Batman ever returning to the screen...but we won't go there yet...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"there is only two differences between hell and gotham city, hell is hotter then gotham city and in gotham city one of the demons fights aside the forces of good". this quote from the DC comics of batman shows the intension of the director Tim Burton by making this movie. Batman is not a hero, he is a creature of the night with a tormented past and soul that crusades in a dark gothic city fighting the slime and vile criminals. to achieve this gold Tim Burton creates a gloomy and dark atmosphere, where gotham city looks gloomy and creepy and characters look also dark and gothic with tormented souls. Batman has a dark look and style, created by the master of environments Tim Burton. this movie also have another good thing, the amazing joker, played by jack nicholson that show us once more what a great actor that he is, giving us a much alive performance. is this movie all good? of course not, it has it's downsides. michael keaton and kim basinger give a very static performances and the action scenes and the plot could be a lot better. in short batman it's a good movie, maybe the best in the series, but is not for all tastes because of it's visuals, they are dark, gothic and gloomy, much like Tim Burton is. The batman is not a conventional comic hero, he is a demon that fights other demons on a city that is hell on earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has everything a Batman movie should have. Firstly the Dark Knight himself IS dark! He is not portrayed as some lycra clad buffoon spouting out ridiculous one-liners! Secondly Batman/Bruce Wayne is an intelligent and yet disturbed individual, which anyone would be if they had seen their parents murdered in front of them as a child. (It could be safe to say that the character is bordering on psychosis). This is the Batman I am familiar with from the classic DC comics of the eighties. Unlike Superman, Batman doesn't search the city trying to bring justice to the world, he does it to try and rid himself of the demons that haunt him. This was excellently shown in Michael Keaton's portrayal of the man. Another great point (of course) was Jack Nicholson as the Joker; could ANYONE else have brought the Clown Prince of Crime to life in such an effective way? The only downside to the movie was...erm...not much really. Unless you count Prince being on the soundtrack, but that is a minor matter after all. A great film which can be read on many different levels!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is by far my favorite movie, and has been for quite some time now. I don't expect others to share my enthusiasm for it, but everyone should realize its greatness in one way or another. I don't think there's much questioning the fact that Batman is the best movie of the franchise. The next three wouldn't even come close to achieving the same grandeur of classic good versus evil comic book heroism as the first.But to truly do Batman justice, one must look into the atmosphere created by the incredibly talented Tim Burton and his amazing cast &amp; crew. Most notably, there is the acting of Jack Nicholson. He makes the Joker a true bad guy...a psychotic but nevertheless effective crime boss. Then there's Michael Keaton, who's somber and morose demeanor perfectly demonstrates Bruce Wayne's life, a life torn by childhood tragedy (unlike good ol' Mr. Clooney, who wants us to believe that the character of Batman is "hot stuff"). Kim Basinger...Grrrrrr. Top it off with Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, and Michael Gogh, and you've got a set of professionals, not a slew of show-offs (can anyone say Tommy Lee Jones? What about Arnold?).Anton Furst designs the greatest (and ironically the most conservative) Batmobile ever, as well as a breath-taking, academy award-winning Gotham City. Danny Elfman's score is amazing. In fact, I place the theme to Batman as one of the greatest "classical" pieces ever.So how does this all fit together to make one of the best movies ever? Critics said the action scenes were lax, and the movie was just too dark. WHAT DO YOU WANT, EBERT? MALTIN? The action was downright realistic. And what, do you think the war on crime takes place in sunny fields of lavender? The point is that the movie is a realistic depiction of a fantastic comic book series. When you look at it, every element of this movie is perfectly accurate to what would actually happen. Batman is dark and refined because his parents were killed when he was a child. The action scenes are limited because normal people can't leap, bound, and travel at mach 1 like some people wish. Etc., etc.Okay, I'm on the threshold of digression. Just do yourself a favor and watch this movie again. Hell, it was the 14th highest grossing movie of all time for a REASON. If, after taking all of the aforementioned factors into consideration, you do not find this movie to be truly magnificent, at least try to understand how it can be the favorite of a young, conservative, adult male like myself.Long live Burton and the first and finest installment of the Batman franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw "Batman" in the summer of 1989, I was utterly enthralled. By the hype and advertising. I even bought the damn Prince soundtrack, even though I hated Prince back then. Of course, times have changed - now Prince is just fine and this movie has deteriorated with every viewing. Not only is everything about the Batman character from the comic book (before the revisionist post-film writers got a hold of him) utterly gone, the acting is horrendous (on ALL fronts) the story makes no sense, and it is, above all else, BORING. Of course, compared to the other films in the series, it's "Citizen Kane." To list just one of the many examples of anti-Batman like behavior, Batman would never drive his car into a warehouse, drop bombs and drive away. What is he, the UN? The Elfman music is just lovely, sure. But what we have is a movie that is all style and no substance. Batman comes across more like Iron Man - or a pre-frowning-90s-twentysomething Iron Man - and all of the other characters (including Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent, whom they apparently kicked to the curb for Tommy Lee Jones a little later in the series) are ridiculous and if they bear any resemblance to their comic book counterparts, it's in name only. "Bruce Wayne"s decision to reveal his identity to Kim Basinger and Alfred's decision to just let her into the Batcave afterwards remain two of the most puzzling oversights in script history. I am constantly amazed at the kudos given this film. Tim Burton is a fine director, sure, and this film SHOULD have been good but is bad at EVERY turn. My God, people, watch it again! And oh yes, when I saw this in the theater eleven years ago, the showcase had printed "The Joker" on my ticket stub. Perhaps that was a mistake, or perhaps that was a way to clue the viewer in that Batman has a supporting role in his own movie. I understand the next film in the series is going to use Frank Miller's "Year One," which, while a fine story, is also completely revisionist Batman history. I suggest that anyone who has a sincere interest in the Batman mythos, read the 70s and 80s comic books, up to "The Dark Knight Returns" and stay as far away from these cinematic stink bombs as possible.</fullReview>

Staying pretty loyal to comic book origins (except that of the Joker) he adds his own Bruce Wayne somewhat lost without the mask of Batman to keep himself focused. Sets are darkly gorgeous and soundtrack is to die for by the wonderful Mr Danny Elfman. Only complaint is that bulky suit which no-one, I mean no-one could possibly fight crime with.Although lacking characterisation of Batman Returns this is a blockbuster with brains.

Jack Nicholson is better here than he's been since the Seventies. He inhabits this role and gives it just the creepy, outrageous quality that it needs to work. Even more impressive is the fact that, unlike most actors, there was no way for him to research this role. Think about it? How many psychotic men who think of murder as a work of art do you know of? Thankfully, not many. Yet he takes this outrageous character and, by some magical feat, makes him believable. Micheal Keaton (a fine actor who is never given his due) is a perfect fit in the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman, giving the movie just the grounding touch that it needs and providing a nice contrast to the Joker. Bruce is subdued where the Joker is larger than life. Bruce is the ego to the Joker's fascinating ID. Tim Burton's macabre sensibilities are perfectly suited to this film, as is Danny Elfman's remarkable music. One of the best scores ever written. A remarkable picture.

This is one of the darkest movies I've seen on many levels. The whole look of Gotham is dark which reflects on its characters. Despite being a comic book movie, it is very disturbing and shows very twisted people with dark sides to their personalities. The look of the world that Burton creates is impossible to duplicate. I'm glad that they made this movie the way they did because i feel that the Batman story is supposed to be disturbing and about revenge more than about a glamorous hero.

		<fullReview>X-Men,Superman,Blade,The Crow. Yes,all great films but they all fall short in comparison to Batman,the finest comic book movie of all time. Notice I say this one, because the 3 sequels all began to get progressively worse. I can't honestly say one bad thing about this film. Micheal Keaton as the Caped Crusader/Bruce Wayne is the best ever to grace the role. His eyes,facial expressions and dialogue truly give meaning to the deep,lost,sad soul that is Bruce Wayne. Kim Basinger as Viki Vale is outstanding as the photographer trying to get a story who becomes Batman's love interest. And last, but not least is Jack Nicholson's portrayl of the Joker. Now I've seen all of Jacko's work(The Shining,As Good as it Gets,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,Hoffa,etc....),but this in my opinion was his most satisfying role to date. What he brought to the Joker's character is unreal. He gave the performance that truly reminded me of the way the Joker was presented in the comics:deranged,crazy,humorous,dangerous,and always compelling. The scenery is top-notch from tim Burton and Danny Elfman's musical score gives it the deep,dark feel that is Gotham City. I remember standing in line at midnight at Wal-Mart waiting for this movie to be relased so I could by it. Do yourself a favor,and purchase it yourself.

		<shortDescription>Burton's Bat is the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: This may contain spoilers!!!Batman has quite a legacy, that's for sure. It spans many years, through the means of comic books, novels, radio shows, several TV series and films. But it was Tim Burton's vision of the Dark Knight that was introduced to modern audiences and has been so successful. And Batman is a great film.Burton moves away from the camp television series to a much more surreal, darker Gotham City, a place riddled with crime and corruption, where the police have no control over criminals. Enter Batman, played with brilliance by Michael Keaton, an almost psychotic protector of the peace. Keaton plays his dual role of Batman/Bruce Wayne very well, giving the Bat a mysterious sense about him and making Wayne the slightly clumsy millionaire that he is. Jack Nicholson plays the Joker magnificiantly, enjoying his performance and stealing many scenes. And Kim Basinger goes along for the ride, screaming when required. This dark film reflects the comic book rather well and is the by far the best Batman movie to date (Returns is good but the flavour quickly diminishes during Forever and those following it). Tim Burton's direction is apparent and brilliant (as always), and is sadly missed in the later sequels. This is one of my favourite movies and will always be, could never grow tired of it. The ascent of the cathedral and battle at the end is superb, as is the whole film. Excellent stuff!!!</fullReview>

After watching Batman again, there is no doubt that it is still the best comic book movie. it's not the greatest fil m of all time but it has some real good elements. Instead of the lame-ass Batman's 3 and 4 which relied on stupid fantasy violence and lots of oveblown special effects, "batman" relizes on some solid acting, terrific scenery, and some cold blodded violence to make it worthwild. Jack Nichilson is so superior to other Batman villians that it's not even funny. Who can ever forget "Where did he get all those wonderful toys?" They have yet to find a true Batman but after a slow start Michael keaton proved he was closest to it. The butler was also very good. The one weakness was Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale. She wasn't horrible but we only saw a couple scenes of the real eroticsm that Nicole Kidman showed a lot of in #3(one of the few things I liked about that movie) The backround is mind boggling and really sets the tone for the dark setting of the movie. There aren't many lights and glitter in "Batman" because well it's not really a movie full of light and glitter. And finally the thing I hated most about the future Btaman's is all the stupid non-realistic fantasy violence. There was a little of that in "Batman" but a lot of it was dark real and at times even a little scary(Several scenes had to be cut in order to get a PG-13) Kids may be interested in the movie but I don't think it's appropriate for anyone under 10. However, the violence and setting show that the movie can be powerful and realistic. The movie ends the way you expect it too but a lot of other things were in doubt for a while during the movie.If you want to see another Batman, #2 wasn't bad. I thought Keaton overall was better and Michelle Pfifer was tempting and most of the dark elemnst still existed. The real weakness to #2 is Danny Devito was a terrible bad guy. However, avoid #3 and 4 at all cost *** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman" was a comic book based movie that created a lot of unexpected franchises: a cartoon (that was based on the movie that was based on a tv show and a comic... whew), a bunch of roller coasters (all of them in Six Flags parks), and some of the usual ones: action figures, all sorts of collectibles and a lot of sequels.But Batman as a movie is an amazing work of art, and a very fun movie, too. From Gotham city's dark and depressing buildings, down to the classy Batmobile, this movie is an amazing display of artistic sensibilities. The soundtrack, by Prince, is one of the most intelligent and complex collection of songs for a movie, while Danny Elfman´s score is dramatic and forceful.The actors are also superb. Michael Keaton shines as the Caped Crusader in a way no other actor has ever done in this role. He has the exact degree of lunacy and anger in his character, while his alter ego is suave and intelligent. The Joker, as played by Jack Nicholson is the best actor of them all, with scenes that blur the line between comic book and movie making. Witness, for example, his concealed desperation when Batman is preparing his final attack and he (SPOILER AHEAD) kills his right hand man in a fit of rage, while staying completely in character.The pacing of the film is also very, very good. Anyone that is not familiar with the history of Batman (a very strange thing, indeed) will feel comfortable watching this movie, which explains the facts in a quick way to the viewers before starting a deep psychological exploration of the main players (Batman and the Joker) and the motivation behind their actions.Although this film was followed by 3 (!) sequels (Batman Returns, Batman Forever, Batman &amp; Robin), the only one worth watching is Batman Returns. Although it is not as good as the original, it is still a nice movie, and it has the distinction of being the first movie encoded with the now ubiquitous Dolby Digital system for surround sound. The rest of the movies are completely worthless; director Joel Scumacher manages to take everything that was right in the first two films and make it look bad. Really bad. And forget about Val Kilmer and George Clooney; although physically they might make for better "Batmans", they simply never manage to get into the character. Worst of all, in the sequels 3 and 4, they take the inmensely beautiful Batmobile and made it the most ridiculous thing on wheels since the Weinermobile. This, alone, should be a reason for never showing those fiascos of a movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Batman of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you make a film that is sure to bring in loads of money at the box-office and could lay the groundwork for a major franchise, you want to do it right. By spending a lot of money on some stunning visuals (but mostly on Jack Nicholson), Tim Burton and Warner Brothers made Batman, the #1 hit of 1989 in the US.The story should be familiar to almost everyone: millionaire Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) lost his parents when they were shot by a maniacal gangster long ago. Now, he has decided to don a costume and use new technology to fight the crime that has enveloped Gotham City. While, on the trail of boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), Batman runs into the path of his vicious right-hand man Jack Napier (Nicholson). In a fight at a chemical factory, Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals and is thought dead. But he survives, and the chemical has left him with a twisted smile and a ruthless persona: he is now The Joker. He soon takes over Grissom's empire and terrorizes the city with the chemical. With the government officials helpless, only Batman can save Gotham. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne persues a romance with beutiful photographer Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), who is constantly caught in the crossfire between The Joker and Batman.The best thing about this movie is the atmosphere. Tim Burton and art director Anton Furst have created a unique and appropriatley gothic, industrial style for the city, which becomes a great advantage in making it more of a character. This couldn't be done if the city was a real one, like New York for example. But by creating an all new city from imagination, all kinds of possibilities exist. The film also feautres some snazzy vehicles and tools for Batman, like the sleek and lethal Batmobile to the jet he uses to thwart one of The Joker's schemes.Credit should be given to writer Sam Hamm for keeping the characters true to their comic book origins. Bruce Wayne is not the proud symbol of freedom that Superman is. He is a tortured soul, fighting against nightmares of his parents demise and the terrible crime of the city. Keaton plays the role quite well. On the other hand, The Joker is a madman who the audience could easily like if he wasn't so vicious. In fact, the people of Gotham are more taken by The Joker's stylish fashion and his lunatic antics than dark and brooding Batman. Nicholson steals the show with his performance, which may be one of the few problems with the movie.The few problems are these: Nicholson is terrific to watch, but he overshadows the title character and Batman seems to be fighting for screen time. The rest of the things are more of a given for summer popcorn flicks: Basinger is weak as the love interest, some things occur for no reason (but you remember them as some of your favorite scenes), and why does Wayne have to hang like a bat?The series went infamously downhill when Burton became less and less involved. But the original is still the best and quite a good comic adaptation. A fun and exciting popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2nd only to Superman as the best comic book film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even thought my favorite is Batman Forever, this is the best Batman film of them all. It's a great introduction to the characters in the world and the many different levels of the superhero. If you haven't seen it the plot is very simple, Gotham City is being over run by crime. They then hire in a new D.A. who campaign is to rid out all the crime in Gotham City. But stopping him from this is Jack Napier a.k.a. The Joker (Jack Nicholson). There is also a rumor about a Batman (Michael Keaton) that is fighting crime but no one knows who he is or if he's fighting for good or for the Joker. Tim Burton is the only director that could pull this off. This whole film has his name on every shot. The dark colors are deep and very visual. The story has lots of dark undertones and mysterious backstories. There are extremely large amounts of action and we get to see Batman use a lot of very cool toys. Michael Keaton is great as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He's dark, mysterious, tough and can fight. But this film belongs to Jack. He's the best villain I have ever seen. The man is sick, twisted, violent and funny. Even though I was rooting for the bat I really liked the Joker and I was hoping he would come out on top. Kim Basinger plays the duel love interest in Vicki Vale, a photographer for the local paper. She does the woman in distressed very well and she does scream a lot. If you can't get out to X-Man go rent this to feed your taste for a classic superhero action film. Batman has everything that a comic book film needs action, adventure, a taste of the impossible, a great superhero, a twisted villain, and a beautiful love interest. If you haven't seen this you really should be kicking yourself, right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about there being Batman movie, I was thinking cool, who are they going to get to play Batman. Well, while I was thinking about Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell, or even Harrison Ford, the WB was signing Michael Keaton. Wait a second, isn't that the guy who was in Mr. Mom? Well, obviously that is why I merely watch the movies, and the guys who know what they are doing make the movies because Batman's opening weekend gross was the most to date at that time. All much deserved. Michael Keaton was joined by the always talented Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Although Michael Keaton was a great Batman, he was only a meager Bruce Wayne. While Keaton's delivery of his lines while behind the mask were great, his Bruce Wayne was a little too geeky for me. But with the help of Ms. Vicky Vale played beautifully by the sexy Kim Bassinger, and the flawless acting of the Joker, Batman gets a much deserved 10 stars. Tim Burton brought the "Dark Knight" title back to the Batman series, and silenced his critics with some great sets, and snappy catch phrases.</fullReview>

Tim Burton's direction and the gothic atmosphere give the film an exciting and original style that marks this movie out from all others.

However, the film would not be complete without Danny Elfman's music score, dark and gothic music that blends in perfectly with the on-screen action. Prince's songs certainly deserve a mention and help to add a "funky" twist to the film. A magnificent version of Bob Kane's immortal creation! 10/10</fullReview>

The Joker is probably the most mysterious of all the Batman villains so the task of making him come alive would be extremely difficult and Tim Burton, the screenwriters, and Jack Nicholson's portrayal are superb. It's true that Keaton isn't easily to picture as Batman but compared to Kilmer and Clooney, he is the best in my opinion. But this movie gives me yet another reason why Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Biggest Blockbuster Of All Time. And The Darkest Movie Ever Made.The Best Movie Of The 80's Decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is by far one of my favorite movies ever, in fact Batman may be the best movie ever made. Batman is more than just a movie about a superhero, but a tribute to the German cinema particularly for the use of expressionism a stylistic movement crafted from German film. Director Tim Burton does a great job directing Batman as he is able to skew one's view of the world. Views are entirely different from one another, the views react against realism, turns to inner emotional reality. Examples: atmosphere, environment of the film includes costumes, and characters example Batman-Gotham City. This film is much closer to graphic art with sets painted, the costumes and arts are made realistic then surrealism blends every aspect of the film. Tim Burton is simply a genius for his dark moody directing along with his use of expressionism. Speaking of arts it is only fitting that the film's villain The Joker (Jack Nicholson) relates to the world of art as a homicidal loveable killer clown. And speaking of Jack Nicholson he gives a killer performance as the scene stealing Joker. Nicholson gives a performance of The Joker that simply blows others off the screen, particularly Keaton it's rare that a villain in a movie is more idolized than the hero character of Michael Keaton (Batman), but this is the case. Batman is simply an empty shell without Jack he fits the image of the Joker perfectly, he was brilliant nobody can mess with Jack he provided incendiary demonics with impish harlequin flourish, Nicholson's over the-top performance as the Joker cemented his reputation as the best actor in Hollywood ever. Batman is a film to view as much as you want you will never find it dull due to the action pacing plot and humor pumping black heart comedy, and Jack Nicholson in any movie is well worth a watch many times. This also is the best of the Batman movie franchise, due to the placement of Batman's first and most liked but evil villian the Joker (And just to mention once again a guy named Jack.) Keaton is only average as Batman , but much better than the stiff Kilmer or overrated Clooney as the public later came to see. Finally Batman is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton did an excellent job of remaking the comical 1960 versions of Batman. All the actors were very well selected and I was very glad to hear when the movie was to be released that Prince wasn't selected to be Batman/Bruce Wayne (what a laugh that would have been) much to Prince's disappointed. Michael Keaton was the best out of all the Batman's and no one but no one could have played the Joker as good as Jack Nicholson. If you have never seen the first Batman film then it really is worth watching because the acting, Cinematography , atmosphere and music is very "Batman like" all the way. Its a shame that all the other Batman films turned out to be such flops because I truly believe that they could have been more careful with the way they made the sequels .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll say the positive things first: Jack Nicholson is GREAT inthis movie, providing a nice mix of menace and camp. Gotham City looks quite good through Tim Burton's lens.Now, the criticisms: We are given no reason to care aboutthe characters. When Alfred reminds Bruce that Vicki Valeis "special," I want to yell out "WHY?!?!?!" The character isa cardboard cutout: she has no particular attributes, nospecific personality. She just *is*. Of course, maybe sheseems special in comparison to Bruce Wayne, played more like a large rock than an internally hurt man. Keatonis a better actor than this, so I can only blame the script orBurton - probably both. Tim Burton tends to be a bettervisual director than person director, especially when thecharacter isn't already "self directing" in the script. Anddon't get me started on Knox, the reporter. He's a lovablegoof character - which is fine in its place. But supposedlyhe's some gifted reporter (gifted enough that a respected,serious photojournalist wants to work with him on the Batman story), and I'm sure that Knox couldn't write acohesive sentence.Of course, underneath it all, this is just a comic book cummovie. Perhaps it doesn't bear a serious film criticism. Fair enough. But even then, this film doesn't hold up. Themovie looks like and acts like a comic book, from cameracuts that reflect panel drawings to the tenor of the dialog. Fine. Burton succeeds in this endeavor in a technicalsense. But there is a fundamental problem with this is thatmovies need more fleshing out than a comic book allows. Panel to panel, the reader connects the dots in his ownway. A movie doesn't permit this so easily, so when thenarrative is left as sparse as the comic, the film feelsincomplete. An already used but ideal example is the relationship between Bruce and Vicki. In a graphic novel, itis best left to the imagination that the characters developtogether and find out what it is that is so... "special" abouteach other. In a movie, we turn ourselves over to theexperience too much to create that separate world as thefilm happens. Thus, what we're left with is a strainedmoment - after Bruce and Vicki have just ONE date - whereVicki asks, "Are we going to try to love each other?" Ofcourse, the line was asked so flatly, Kim might as wellhave asked, "Do you want crackers with the soup?" But Ican't blame her - there's no relationship for her to react to.Blah. Looks good, great job Jack. Those two elementsearn it a 6/10.</fullReview>

The comic series of the struggle of Batman's one man war on crime is played out in a bit of a shortened, but still sweet, film version. Michael Keaton plays the tormented Bruce Wayne to a tee, and Jack Nicholson does an excellent job as the homicidal and hilarious Joker. And Kim Basinger does a pretty good job as the romantic interest as well. Tim Burton's style works perfectly for the world of Batman. Gothic towers spiral up and obscure the sky. People are as depressed and realistic as they would be in a real city. And Gotham City shines in all its sin as it should. Burton's dark style fits in well for a dark story, and sets the mood well, but he makes one tragic mistake that will anger any comic fan: Batman doesn't kill! That's where I back off a bit. Other than that, a great, exciting film. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BATMAN has a late 1980's art deco look that is badly dated now. When I mean art deco, I mean the horrendous Joker fashions, that were in vouge' for about six months after the release of this film. The film's look is rather dated, however the film can't decide who's story it is. This should have been titled JOKER: THE MOVIE, because it was hardly about BATMAN. I mean the film is titled after the character played by Keaton, yet he gets the backseat to the villian! Yet, Keaton is by far the best BATMAN.( Originally, BILL MURRAY was being looked at as a possible Bruce Wayne... that just would not have worked!) The film as a whole is not bad and helped to quell the lingering stench of the Adam West/Burt Ward tv series from the 1960's. Jack Nicholson is good as the Joker. The film is mildly campy, but this does not harm it. If you are a fan of the comic book, or a fan of FRANK MILLERS incarnations of BATMAN....then the dark retro 40's look and tone will be up your alley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and definitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that no matter how many "Batman" films are made, nor how many directors take the helm of the franchise, it will never be possible to disregard this first film.Tim Burton - who I will admit is one of my all-time favourite directors - makes some bold choices and manages to create a great film. The first of these is casting Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and the Batman. Not only an older man, but also not exactly action-hero material; you know from the outset that this is not going to be either a big-budget effects film nor a mindless return to the Sixties television series, which was fun but hardly worthwhile.The second is the darkness Burton brings to the screen. Though he was to go on and make an even darker film with his sequel, "Batman Returns," both his vision here of Gotham City and of the Batman's perennial arch-nemesis, the Joker, are dark enough to really make this film a return to the way the Batman used to be. The Joker is funny, yes, as he ought to be, but he is also menacing. The scene where he confronts Boss Grissom is masterful.The only negative comments I have about the film relate to the time when it came out. Using Prince music was rather misguided, though one can hardly blame Burton - directors aren't supposed to be clairvoyant when it comes to musical taste. Kim Basinger turns in an excellent performance as Vicki Vale, but her costumes leave a lot to be desired - again, a problem because of the film's 1989 release. These only stand out because the film is otherwise so classic and stylish. I can't help feeling that some 1940s costuming and music would have suited better.Still and all, this is the definitive Batman film, the one to which all succeeding incarnations of the Batman must be compared. See it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can still remember when I went to the movie theater at the local Mall to see Batman when it was first released back in 1989. The anticipation was frenzied to the point that there was ridiculously long lines which stretched out the door and onto outside; you could actually feel and sense the anticipation in the air and throughout the crowd. I remember speculating whether or not the movie would be worth all the hype; as it turned out it was. Another point of note is that sadly in todays modern Hollywood, the spectacle of big release films is nothing like the days of yesteryear. Batman upon release back in 1989, still had it.The original and first Batman in my opinion is by far the best of the lot. The casting and plot comes off perfectly for a comic book to movie adaptation. Although subject to intense debate and scrutiny actor Michael Keaton I feel was made to play the Capped Crusader with his dark, lifeless eyes glaring through his Batmask. Keatons whole ambiance and conviction perfectly mimicked what one would've envisioned for the role of Batman. Jack Nicholson was also perfect as the Joker. It's hard for one to forget Nicholson's wicked grin and oddly sarcastic humor which perfectly portrayed the Joker to a tee. They both set a certain tone for this movie that somehow brought the comic book to life on screen. I remember when the movie began it felt as though you were in a different world when viewing Gotham City on the big screen. Gotham City's brilliant architecture was splendidly vivid and displayed an on point Gothic style. Even the inhabitants of the city down to the clothes they wore, were authentic and blended well. I mean the visual scenery was something I certainly noticed, and it came off as dark and eerie; just what one might expect for the Batman movie. I've noticed that the reviews of this movie throughout IMDb all use the adjective "dark" to describe the tone of the film and it's a justified acknowledgment. In transforming the comic book/TV characters to the movie, Burton was able to pull casting off very well. Commissioner Gordon was just as you expected him to be from the comic and TV series, Vicki Vale plays a background role in the movie but seems to "fit" just right, and Alfred performs well as Bruce Waynes butler who has a special relationship with him stemming from childhood. Also we were all waiting to see the Batmobile or as the Joker would say "the toys, those wonderful toys". The whole movie was filled with clever gadgetry and machinery. The Batmobile lived up to its billing as a sinister ride that shot flames of fire from the exhaust as it rocketed along the Gotham streets. The Bat cave was an intriguing and dark locale where Bruce Wayne was secretly transformed into the mysterious Batman. The smaller nuances are the things that make the first Batman memorable to me, like the scene where Vicki Vale wakes up in the middle of the night and sees Bruce Wayne hanging upside down from a pole like a bat, the scene where a bullet ricochets off of Batmans glove and wounds Jack Nappier, wickedly defacing him, ultimately transforming him into the wickedly grim faced Joker. The first scene of the movie where we see Batman for the first time and he lifts a disbelieving thief off his feet and tells him to alert his other crooked friends that "I'm Batman". The fight and action scenes in the movie were also great and packed some suspense. Also take note of Burtons use of grand statues and mannequins throughout the movie, like the collection Bruce Wayne kept in his mansion which drew the admiration of Vicki Vale and newspaper reporter Knox. The various gargoyle statues that were on the buildings throughout Gotham City,these added to the effect and environment of the movie that helped draw the viewer into the comic book vibe. I feel the the first Batman was definitely a triumph for Tim Burton. The other films that followed the first Batman failed to continue on the true nature of Gotham City and its characters, although Batman Returns comes close. To me Batman stands the test of time as a well casted and directed film that brings the comic book to life. It certainly will always be one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most groundbreaking film of the late '80's-early 90's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening credits to the end this film will keep you enthralled. With such wonderful toys as his 10,000 volt joy buzzer to his deadly Smilex gas, Jack Nicholson steals the show as the "world's first fully functional homicidal artist", the clown prince of crime, The Joker. Michael Keaton stars as Batman (the best Batman in the history of the character). With Danny Elfman's haunting score this dark, funny, polished interpretation of the DC comics hero will be burned into your mind forever; it has changed not only the way we look at the superhero but movies in general.This being the biggest dark blockbuster in the history of film concreted Tim Burton's soon to be legendary directing career. If you liked this, other films I'd recommend are: Batman Returns (1992) (the only good sequel), Edward Scissorhands(1991), The Shining(1980) and Frankenstein (1931).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never truly appreciated Batman until recently. I always knew it was the best of the series, but I was never completely sure why. So I watched it, and found this could possibly be one of the best performances Jack Nicholson will ever give in his life, as the joker. He simply lights up the screen with a truly sadistic grin and laugh. Also, Michael Keaton has fun as Bruce Wayne, perhaps the most boring character in the movie! It has wonderful action scenes, including great car chases, explosions, and fight scenes, all with a breath taking climax at the local Gotham church. Goood watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making no attempt to be different, I must comment on this masterpiece by the king of Gothic design, Mr Tim Burton.The casting was perfect, and I can't understand why Michael Keaton did not want to continue as Batman, I think it is his greatest role. We are introduced to a new Alfred, Michael Gough, which is just as risky as a new Batman because he is so well known, but Michael with all his experience pulls it off nicely.The fight scenes are choreographed well, as in Batman Returns (see my review on that one too) and Jokers colourful henchmen provide a good balance to Keaton's dark and brooding hero. Jack Nicholson is in sparkling form as the Joker, and the quick gags make for entertaining set-pieces throughout. It is a tribute to his character that the following films need two characters to make the film go the distance, but he manages it alone, and with not a little style.A great film with a great sequal, but lets not talk too much on what happened after that.Neil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good thing about the casting of Michael Ketaon in this movie is that he is completely unrecognizable when in his Batman suit. He goes from being this little playboy millionaire into this brooding dark warrior that kicks everyones A$%^$. Unlike the less memorable sequels, of which number 4 was the worst (the sexual tension between George Clooney and Chris O'donnell is even more intense than that which is between David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in the X-Files), Batman 1 is more in the grain of the comic book than any other superhero film.Too much can be said about Burton's direction and Nicholson's performance, but watch this movie as opposed to numbers 3 and 4 simply because if there was any realism aspect to these films, its at its heighest in number one, and is downgraded to nothing in number 4.</fullReview>

Recommendable to anyone over the age of 10, since the first time I saw this one, I was 7 and was still in my Batman TV series mode (but what did I know back then).

		<fullReview>The first movie of the Batman serie is great! First of all, the acting is great(Jack Nicholson is great as the Joker). Second, this movie has (unlike most of Hollywood movies being produced for the general audience) a style of his own, which is that of director Tim Burton, who has put with his design team a great Gotham City, incredibly dark and fascinating. Burton gave to this serie of movies a great first movie... Sure, it's only an action movie, but it's better than almost every movie in that category. A big 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

The plot isn't that interesting but there is great acting and a lot of action. However, the film does seem to lag on and on. Not a kiddie movie like you may think.The story is about a rich guy named Bruce Wayne who is out to kill the guy who killed his parents (the Joker). In the meantime he has sort of a relationship with a reporter named Vicki Vale.5/10 stars(If you are wanting to watch a good Superhero movie with lots of action and a great story, watch SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (1978), or SUPERMAN II (1980).)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best live-action Batman movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say that the animated Batman movie, Mask of the Phantasm, was a little bit better, but this is the closest chemical perfection that the live features got. I liked the Returns and Forever, but I thought that Returns was too surreal(the success of this one gave Tim Burton enough leverage to use his weird personal style on all films he did afterword.) Jack Nicholson steals the film as the Joker, playing him very much like his character in The Shining. As for Michael Keaton, he gives Batman just the right amount of angst and menace, but that mask does make his face look fat in some scenes. From an action standpoint, the car chase, the fight with the swordsman, and the air attack are particular standpoints. My only gripe would be that I think the Joker's end should've been more ambiguous. There is a scene near the end of the film regarding him that was intentionally designed to be open to interpretation, but it doesn't match the ambiguity of Catwoman's fate in Returns. All in all a good film that's closer to the "real" Batman than the sixties tv series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where does he get those wonderful toys?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of things happened with this box office hit. Lots of movies tried to copy the comic book trend, and though SUPERMAN and its sequels came before it, everyone looked at Tim Burton's BATMAN as the blueprint. It was less campy, darker, more gruesome, and so inventive and visually sophisticated, you almost believe Michael Keaton can go around kicking butt in a fetishistic batsuit.Oh, and if you ask me, Michael Keaton is to Batman as Sean Connery is to Bond. He was the first and the best. All the others are weak, laughable imitations. I think if Bruce Wayne was as charismatic a character as James Bond, Keaton wouldn't have left. But that's just what he is, opaque and recluse. Yet, you have to give Keaton props for attempting to put life in a tortured soul. Look at the scene when he approaches Vicki Vale and Knox in the Arsenal Room, his seduction of Vale, or the strange scene where he as Wayne freaks out against the Joker at Vale's loft.But to say Michael Keaton is the star of this episode is a joke. Jack Nicholson is a mischievous little demon here, looking REALLY good in makeup and making every A-list actor think twice before they reject a super villain role (he was probably the inspiration for Tommy Lee Jones in BATMAN FOREVER). Nicholson makes the Joker more than a cartoon monster spitting out puns and jokes, he makes his character psychotic and gruesome even while he's being hilarious. A "homicidal artist" he describes himself.I think all the grim atrocities are mostly from the brain of Tim Burton, who also gives us a great-looking Gotham City. He gives us the 40s noir of the original comic book crossed with the late 80s-early 90s gore and spectacle.Still, I don't think this is the best BATMAN. It's more like a blueprint of the better sequel, BATMAN RETURNS. The Joker is the best villain, but Kim Basinger gives us a wimpy and boring love interest. One minute she looks sophisticated with her hair tied back and sporting glasses, but then she turns into a bimbo who screams or faints every other minute. Batman doesn't get his equally adventurous and mysterious and sexy love interest until Michelle Pfiefer's Catwoman (prrrrrrfect!!) in the next one. But like DR. NO before GOLDFINGER, we wouldn't have BATMAN RETURNS without BATMAN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery Film Meets the Superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is one of the most influential action films. Tim Burton with help from Warner Brothers changed the look of the superhero movie from the bright colors of Superman and the Batman TV series. Batman takes place in the dark bowels of the city (some of the best sets I have seen). Parts of it look very real, like one of the old detective movies such as Chinatown. Bruce Wayne even wears a trench coat. On top of the realism, Batman goes to the heart of what a superhero is. After all it is a being that takes the law into its own hands. This is the heart of the story. In contrast to this seriousness, Batman has a very colorful enemy, the Joker, superbly played by Jack Nicholson. He simply chews up the screen. Good supporting performances include, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance. With great music, a good script and adequate special effects this is one of my favorite action films.The choice of Michael Keaton for the role of Batman was very controversial. Keaton looks like an ordinary guy and to me that is a great idea in that his rage and anger can transform him into something very powerful.In some ways Batman looks like a sci-fi movie. The sets of Blade Runner and Batman are similar. Unfortunately now in almost every bleak future sci-fi movie the star of the film turns into a superhero whether it makes sense or not. Total Recall started this and The Matrix is just a continuation.Batman has the best blend of realism and fantasy. We are clearly shown that Batman and the Joker are cartoon characters but they are in an exciting, gritty world. All the elements of film making are masterfully put together to create an excellent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I was quite sceptic about this movie,but after finally having seen it I have to say:Truly magnificent! This is by far the best Batman-thing ever caught on film.Better than any campy men-in-tights-TV-series,dumb spin off-cartoons or boring movie-sequels(I'm talking of the post-Burton ones). Burton is the only one who is able to create the dark,insane atmosphere that is needed for a Batman-movie.This movie recreates the original Batman -the vision of his creator- in a skillful and honest way.This film almost reminds me of a film-noir and definitely isn't the right stuff for people who like happy family-entertainment. The costumes and the make-up are brilliant,as well as the Bat-Toys.Furthermore we get to see one of the best villains ever,brought alive through the unbeatable performance of Jack Nicholson.Every minute with the Joker is superb.The only criticism is,that all the other characters(including Batman) get totally blasted away through his performance,which doesn't mean that Keaton did a bad job.As a Batman-movie it gets 10/10,as a movie compared to others it gets 8/10.</fullReview>

The action is not stop and pulse pounding all the way to the end. This is the movie that made Jack Nicholson (in my opinion) the superstar that he is today for his engaging performance that keeps your eyes glued.

It's a fun ride with great action, cool plot, amazing sets, and of course Jack Nicholson as the Joker. He was funny and mean at the same time. The plot is cool. It has to deal with Batman dropping Jack Nicholson in a huge thing of acid. His face then gets formed into a huge smile. He then terrorizes Gotham and tries to kill Batman because of what he did to him. It's a cool ride that doesn't let up until it's over. The climax is on a TALL church and it's a great ending. It's a really good adaptation of a classic comic. If you like your blockbusters huge and actionful, than get this movie. I'd love to get it on DVD but it has no extras at all. Oh well, that's what you get for dancing with the devil by the pale moonlight. Batman: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Bob Kane first imagined Batman in 1939, THIS is what he had in mind! Burton's foray into the world of the Dark Knight is the best to date, and maybe the best of all time. It is an epic, like Homer's Iliad or STAR WARS, and you can't watch it without being pulled into the intensity of it all. It is a story that's been told many times before, but that never gets old: One man vows to rid the world of evil. Jack Nicholson is funny, contagious, and oddly sympathetic as The Joker, a tortured clown-man whose smile masks darker purposes; and Michael Keaton gives a stellar performance as the black-clad title character, who doesn't know whether he is a savior or a monster. Kim Basinger, Jack Palance, and several others also contribute to the story, but they are mostly dwarfed by the two titans as they battle for control of Gotham City. There are so many breathtaking scenes that one can't help but break out in goosebumps while watching it. It is Batman as he was always meant to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman, the original out of the dying series, is a very good movie, unlike the atrocious third and forth films. That's all that can be said. Batman was portrayed stunningly by Michael Keaton, still the best Batman, and Kim Bassinger's character was far from pointless. But they weren't the ones who stole the show. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the evil Joker, was by far the best portrayal of any comic book villain. His over the top performance fit the character SO well. No one else could ever be as good as The Joker as Jack Nicholson was. And of course. Who would be in charge of such a great movie? None other than the best director of all time, the exceptional Tim Burton. He has never disappointed me in any of his movies, and I've seen them all. His vision of Gotham City was so beautifully done in the movie. It was also done quiet well in the only good Batman sequel, Batman Returns. I don't know why everyone says that this movie has SO many mistakes in it. It's a fabulous movie. Sure, some of the scenes may have been a little too over the top ("He stole my balloons!"), but what comic book movie doesn't have some over the top scenes in it? All in all this movie is definitely worth watching, and is by far the best Batman movie to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I wouldn't mind making a dark film for a change" thought Burton. `It'll have to have Keaton in on it, before he goes off the ropes and resumes making dire films again' he concluded `and I'm pretty sure he'll still work with me after Beetlejuice.'`I liked Batman stuff Frank Miller did a few years back. As I recall, he wasn't wearing tights which was good for a change' he pondered. `Perhaps that would make good material for a film. We couldn't have Superman in it though, someone else owns the rights to that one, but everyone knows the Joker, and he was always my favourite' he surmised. `Oh, Nicholson hasn't done anything for a while, he would probably be up for it. Great.' What a fantastic opportunity Burton had set before him. When Miller reinvented Batman in 1986 it was only a matter of time before someone came along and put his dark images on the silver screen. This film certainly owes more to Millers dark realisation than to the 60's tights and bat-shark-repellent era and Bob Kane's original images.The result is a fabulously well executed film, with compelling performances by both of the main proponents. Clearly the best comic book conversion to date, and far better than the sequels though the series has not got much life left in it because of the trend for killing the bad guys; something that rarely happens in the comic world because of the plot problems that it creates. The feel for Gotham is captured excellently. Locations are brilliant and effects are kept at just the right level to provide a backdrop for some delightful storytelling. It puts the other films in the series to shame, and questions the morality of making them in the first place. Possibly should have had more focus on the inner workings of Wayne and Napier, but the balance was roughly fair nonetheless. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Batman movies by a country mile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its time, Batman was a superbly dark tale, which managed to make a star out of Michael Keaton, and a whole boat full of cash for the Joker Jack Nicholson. When compared to Batman &amp; Robin, this is a cinematic masterpiece.It was probably director Tim Burton's finest hour, managing to really bring to life the seedy Gotham City. It's a shame they took a different tone with the other movies, because in doing so, they took away a great deal that made Batman such an exciting movie to begin with. At the time it probably was a strange choice by casting Keaton as the hero, but out of the 3 Batmen, he is far and away the best, managing to give a depth to the character that Val Kilmer and George Clooney failed to manage. Far and away Keaton's best role, he never really made it 'big', opting for some offbeat thrillers, and occasional dodgy comedies.Films based on comics are usually hit and miss affairs (take a look at Spawn for the prime example of how these types of movies can go horribly wrong), but this is probably the best comic adaptation to date.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman boasts one of the best looking Gotham's ever committed to film. The oppressive architecture, massive spires that try to escape from the gloom and doom. Michael Keaton is perfectly cast as brooding hero Batman and equally brooding Bruce Wayne. What makes him the best, is the way he separates the two characters. Watch him as Batman and look at his eyes. He's no longer the billionaire playboy, but a dark, lone figure fighting his war on crime. Jack Nicholson goes delightfully over the top as The Joker. Come to think of it, don't know if there's anyone else out there who would be capable of playing The Joker other than Jack. That laugh, that sinister smile all played with demonic glee. Danny Elfman's score brings out the right amount of mystery and mood and the art direction is perfect. Kind of a melding of Fritz Lang's Metropolis and a myriad of other designs. Tim Burton's dark vision of Gotham City and its' winged defender remains the best interpretation of Batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the Best Batman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes the original Batman better than its sequels, and better than most action films is that the plot dwells into the psychology of its title character. The purpose in doing this is simply and brilliantly to define the mystery that surrounds him. With director Tim Burton's style and Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman the audience is able to sympathize with the hero with only a limited amount of information. The scene that stands out the most to me is not one that contains all the fist fights or pranks (although those are incredibly fun to watch) but the one scene when Bruce Wayne/Batman goes to the place of his parent's murder to pay his respects to them by placing two red roses on the cement. This brief moment in the film provides the simple notions of a son's sorrow, love, and rage, which is the fuel that fires the Batman.However, in the sequels that followed, this important aspect either got blurred by other character's complexities such as Catwoman and Penguin in Batman Returns, or it was sugar coated as it was in Batman Forever, and in Batman and Robin.The only other adaptations that successfully dwell into Batman's existence are some of the early episodes of Batman the Animated Series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a lot of people, I was worried when I heard that Tim Burton was going to direct BATMAN and that he had cast Michael Keaton in the title role. I also wasn't all that thrilled with Jack Nicholson being cast as the Joker (too short and fat). To my pleasant surprise, this was a very good comic book adaptation. Bob Kane served as a technical advisor, so he did have some input. Highlights for me: (1) First appearance of Batman on rooftop. (2)Batman stalking the crooks at Axis Chemical plant (although the shootout was a little unbelievable). (3)Getting to first see the Joker's face when he kills his boss. (4) First appearance of Batmobile. (5) "You're a vicious bastard, Rotelli, and I'm glad you're dead!" the Joker tells the charred remains of a man that he has just killed. (6)The final shot. Kim Basinger does a good job as the love interest. On the negative side, there is the aformentioned plant shootout. We could have done without Jerry Hall and I would have liked to have seen more scenes of Keaton as Bruce Wayne to get more into the head of the man behind the cowl. I'd say this was my second favorite out of the modern Batflicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton is the right man for "Batman"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who accuse this film of being plotless are obviously not right in their minds. This film is not only exciting and visually stunning, it's a great blastoff for the "Batman" series, which sadly deteriorated into kiddie crap over the next three films! Keaton is Batman, and Jack Nicholson is DEFINITELY the Joker! Roger Ebert said this film was "depressing", and gave "Dick Tracy" a four-star rating because it was less violent and more kiddie oriented. Mr. Ebert, I respect your reviews and I think you are one of the world's best critics, but, you made a bad choice! This is a great film, and it should be appreciated as something more than a "plotless" box-office treat! Tim Burton is obviously the right director for this kind of film, because he has a keen eye for set detail and technical precision. The dark, endless skyscrapers reminded me of Fritz Lang's "Metropolis". Danny Elfman and Prince have woven a riveting and powerful score of music and songs, all of which fuel the scenes in the film. "Batman Forever" was good, but when I tried comparing it to it's predecessor, it simply did not measure up! Plotless and pointless would not be the words I would choose to describe this film! I'm not saying that this is one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a masterpiece on both the auditory and the visual level. I have given up the notion that the sequels will ever live up to it's originator, although I liked "Batman Returns". My advice, don't listen to the critics! See it and judge for yourself. You will probably like it very much!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was overrated. It was certainly better than its three successors, and it wasn't that bad in itself. But there were still a few things wrong. Bob Kane, Batman's creator, didn't approve of Tim Burton's direction. Neither did I. The action sequences and fight scenes are boring. Some, like when the Batmobile destroys the chemical factory, have nothing to do with the story. Michael Keaton didn't make the best Batman, either: He was wimpy, and the stuntmen had to take care of all his scenes. And how about the end? Joker seems to know that he killed Bruce's parents, which is impossible, because he DOESN'T KNOW BATMAN'S IDENTITY!!! But there were some things I liked: the part where Joker kills the guy with his hand-buzzer, or the part where he shatters the TV with his extend-arm boxing glove. Now THAT'S inventive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest comic adaptation for the screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the comic book adaptations for the screen, this Batman is probably the most faithful, in addition to being easily the best film of the bunch. The movie captures the soul of Bob Kane's comic: it is dark, complex, and raw, something the later films of the series were unable to accomplish. Keaton is a nearly perfect Bruce Wayne: he's brooding, mysterious, quirky, and driven, torn between his duty as Batman and the possibility of a normal life. Nicholson, in perhaps his most overlooked role, is brilliant as the Joker. In addition to displaying the Joker's wackiness and absurdity, he also shows that the man is truly a psychopath, and he goes from amusing to shilling in a breath. The plot is classic Batman, and the action really has the feel of a comic book. Perhaps the most impressive feature of the movie is Gotham City, always gloomy and forboding. Director Burton, one of the finest in the industry, has created his masterpiece with this film: it is brilliantly shot (watch for the drive to the Batcave!), wonderfully acted, beautiful in appearance, and compelling in plot. Batman the comic was not Spider-Man, and this movie takes that into consideration. While the latter installments of the series unfortunately took a more whimsical, colorful approach to the subject, Burton presents the dark, gritty Batman that Kane intended. This is probably the most entertaining movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

The Joker is the all time best Batman villain and Nicholson produced a really funny and brilliant performance.( I did like the Riddler also, though.But maybe I'm biased 'cos I love Jim Carrey?)

		<fullReview>Batman was one of those movies that as a kid I watched and went `that was so cool'. Nearly 10 years on it still delivers. Tim Burton's Batman is a slick stylish movie that makes what could be argued as the best Comic (Superman, The Crow and Blade are contenders to that crown) to Film translation ever. Focussing on the dark and gritty themes framed beautifully by Tim Burton's eye for dark on lights. Michael Keaton who despite almost public outrage when picked to play Batman turns in what has been the best Batman portrayal from 3 other actors to try the cowl and cape. Jack Nicholson as the Joker is evil and malevolent if not perhaps a tad over the top and Kim Bassinger doing Vicky Vale, a tool character, who is constantly in trouble and screams/squeals at every given opportunity. The movie is intelligent and forthright with its development, it progresses nicely with good pace and timing that is well suited to the feel of the film. The movie doesn't play down to us too much and keeps it relatively simple to follow so it doesn't lose the younger viewers. Whilst keeping it gritty and the content adult oriented enough to keep the older members of the audience interested. The sequels did not seem to keep to this mindset; they appeared to want the younger audience more. I guess because you can sell more action figures to them. The Action sequences unfold in a comic book fashion with typically big hits, but in clever development our hero doesn't trundle though the villains like a freight train. Sure he kicks ass but we are made to see that he is only human and he bleeds like the rest of the characters. This is what makes Batman quite special, he is only a man. The film feels a bit constricted because it is shot mostly on specially constructed stages so you end up seeing the same locations again and again, from different angles but you are usually having too much fun to notice or care. Batman is all good basically, and is definitely worth a look on video or adding it to that increasing video library.</fullReview>

Keaton is excellent and the best Batman to date (others include Val Kilmer and George Clooney), Nicholson has a wild time as the Joker and Basinger provides a 'good enough' love interest.

		<fullReview>Batman of 1989 is the movie that made the Dark Knight a believable dark vigilante and it still has a massive fan base! It also had a lot of distinction as a flick by itself, for instance, at its time ,was the most expensive movie ever made in the United Kingdom ,it was the first movies that Warner Brother funded of the DC comics and its success regenerate the superhero movie genre and it spawned the DC animated universe, which include Batman the animated series(perfection) ,Superman the animated series, Batman Beyond ,Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. In short this one important movies in history. And today in honor of the Cape Crusader I will start reviewing all of his movies and boy the are a lot of them. For real of all the meta humans, aliens, superheroes ,villains, anti-heroes and anything in between he is the poster boy of the DC universe,because he has got the best series and movies! I think that he deserves it ,for he is awesome character and my favorite comic book superhero. For real when I was a kid, I tried to wake up at weekend in order to watch Batman (2004) in 6:30 and it was awesome.The story it's simple in the crime streaked Gotham a new crime fighter comes in to the news ,Batman and after wards (spoilers) he has a new threat to face ,the Joker! Now Micheal Keaton is a good Batman, don't get me wrong ,but his suit though cool, it was a bit cheap, as for Nicholshon Joker.. this man just plays the same guys every time himself!! He didn't even try, now that is either lazy or terrifying. As for the go to mean of transportation the Batmobile is good and nothing more. Not that I dislike, for I can see why almost all the interpretations of Batman have a vehicle like that from this movie apart from the Nolan trilogy, but by toady's standards it doesn't hold up so well.My last analyses will be to the troubles for the Warner was trying to make the movie from the early eighties! And after 1986 when Tim Burton agreed to directed it, he had to face in order to get this horse running. Firstly he was trying to make the movie for over three years because he was adamant in putting Keaton a comedian to such a serious role and only when Nicolschon came in ,while taking a huge part of the budget, they gave the green light. One other issue was were to make Gotham and that's why the production when to England for there ,they find the needed space.In summary is it a good movie, yes ,it is the best movie ever no for at times it is heavily dated and don't very faithful to the comics. And yes I know that Burton took elements by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's The Killing Joke and Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns ,tell me one Batman movie that it doesn't have elements from those two and Batman Year One. Nevertheless I recommended to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is basically a flawed film, but for readers too young to remember, Warners corporation smothered the picture in hype, using the power of its various media subsidiaries and corporate interests to let us, the world, know that THIS was the greatest movie of the year. Greatest movie of the decade, according to one critic who's words appeared on the VHS box.Batman is terrible - this is the truth about the film, and nobody admitted it sooner than Tim Burton. Whilst the hype machine made (very) heavy going of the films classic cast (Jack Nicholson! Billy Dee Williams! Jack Palance!) and tried to fete Batman with some kind of cultural capital, dating back to Bob Kanes misty, beatific creation of the "classic character" in 1939, Burton openly admitted that the film was basically a major marketing event, but had a poor script and didn't quite click after viewing.I couldn't agree more with Burton's view of this almost-blockbuster, as the movie doesn't have a functioning story. Nowhere in the film does the dramatic conflict between Nicholson's Joker and Michael Keaton's Batman feel like it has any real legs - an odd twist involving the Joker inflicting poisoned cosmetic products on the citizenry feels more like subplot material, and Batman himself is somewhat on the peripheral of the story, frequently watching events unfold from behind a computer screen whilst his own inner life is largely impenetrable. Lack of good back-story, characterization and most importantly a really developed sense of dramatic conflict make this one of Burton's shallowest films, and except for his 2003 film Big Fish, they've all been too shallow to truly sink in.Produced in the midst of a screenwriters strike, the film mostly tries to "make it" on production values - and very good production values they are; each glove, hat, backdrop, brooding noir streetscape and crooked, cartoonish mobster is perfectly dressed and lit. But the fact of the matter is, production values don't make a great movie: quality writing, acting and directing do. In hindsight, the excellent "Batmobile" design and Danny Elfmans powerful score create more character and dramatic purpose than anything that actually happens in this movie, and should be commended for the considerable talent on display.Lastly, try to put out of your minds the image of third world slave labour industrial sites, fifteen hour days, poverty wages and poor safety standards - they're the people that are putting together the billions of toy items for Mattel and companies who are the real profiteers here, and should be held accountable for their poor human rights record instead of hiding behind slick propaganda like Tim Burton's Batman picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father of the Superhero Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is arguably one of Tim Burton's finest works to hit the silver screen.It delivers both as a superhero film and motion picture. The superhero genre had officially been introduced to mainstream media by the one and only Tim Burton. With a initially worrying casting of Michael Keaton, who at that time was known for his comedic roles and didn't look convincing enough to the fans to play the suave billionaire Bruce Wayne, the film didn't exactly feel like something to anticipate for.The silver linings however, were the casting of Jack Nicholson, known for his iconic performance in The Shining and the presence of Tim Burton along with Danny Elfman as the composer.After the release, everything changed.Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson stole the show, Danny Elfman created one of the most iconic scores of all time, Michael Gough was fantastic as the butler Alfred,Gotham was nowhere realistic, The Batmobile and Batcave looked amazing and Kim Basinger was the perfect damsel in distress.Though suffering from parental backlash for the thematic material, the film fared well with critics and fans alike.Many noticed the fact that Tim Burton spent more time designing the art production and the Joker than the eponymous role.What special about this film is that Burton didn't even read a Batman comic before making it and it isn't supposed to feel realistic compared to the Nolan trilogy.The film opens with a family being mugged by two crooks and then later being bashed and intimidated by Batman followed by a iconic "I'm Batman!".A corrupt police cop named Eckhart then investigates the case and then is revealed to be working with Jack Napier, the main antagonist portrayed by Jack Nicholson.On the other hand,Alexander Knox, a usually ignored reporter constantly tries to prove that the Batman exists and is then aided by the beautiful Vicki Vale, portrayed by Kim Basinger.After a run-in with Batman, Napier falls in a vat of chemicals and then becomes the Joker.Michael Keaton was the perfect Bruce Wayne, with the correct amount of suaveness and funkiness.Michael Gough was arguably the best Alfred a Batman audience has ever seen, giving a memorable performance with wit, care and a amazing English accent.But the main credit for the film's success other than Burton's direction goes to Jack Nicholson, for a awesome and iconic performance with terrific one-liners and jokes such as my favorite, "You ever dance with the Devil in the pale moonlight?".Epic.The climax was amazing with the now-famous Battle of the Freaks and the revelation of the Bat Signal.Overall, Batman is one of Tim Burton's and 1989's finest pictures with iconic performances, score, production design and a great deal of enjoyment.It is truly the Father of the Superhero genreGrade-A Score-9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent enough start for Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman first came to the big screen in 1989 and was a huge success. People went crazy for the dark approach, the spectacular visuals and Jack Nicholson's magnetic performance. No-one really knew what to expect, seeing as Burton had only directed two feature length films, and the casting of Keaton (who was noted for his comic roles) caused a fair amount of controversy at the time. Unlike most films of the 80's Batman still holds up pretty well. Is a classic? Well no. It does have some big issues and parts are very daft, especially in comparison to the Nolan films. Yet it does have some really good stuff going on and as the first big film version of Batman it is a very impressive piece of cinema.Story: The gloomy Gotham City is being watched over by a mysterious vigilante known as Batman, terrifying criminals and worrying the police force. Batman is really millionaire Bruce Wayne, who pursues journalist Vicki Vale and trying to keep his secret hidden. Elsewhere, small time crook Jack Napier gets horribly disfigured in a gun fight and becomes the Joker, taking over his boss' criminal empire. Joker intends to cause havoc around Gotham and it's up to Batman to stop him. The story isn't bad as it flows well and has a lot of really good set-pieces. The villain plot to take over is a bit simplistic, but it is done well and the Joker is a lot of fun so it's not too bad. The main issue is the lack of focus on Batman, he never gets enough screen time and isn't looked into much at all which makes it a wasted opportunity.Batman/Bruce Wayne: Michael Keaton was a controversial choice, but he does a good job overall even if he is much better as Batman. He cuts an excellent Batman, he looks great in the suit, he has the mysterious tone down and even his voice is perfect. You believe that people will be scared of him. His Bruce Wayne is a bit iffy though. He's not bad and is interesting to watch, but he doesn't feel like a playboy and he comes off as too awkward a lot of the time. He is too small and not good-looking enough to be that convincing in the role, but to be fair he makes it work which shows how good an actor he is. Villains: Jack Nicholson knocks it out the park with a wonderfully entertaining performance as the Joker. It is a role where you can go over-the-top and be silly because it works, and Nicholson takes full advantage of this. He also knows when to tone it down if need be and he can be really menacing at times too which adds some dimension to the role. I think Nicholson balances out the silliness with threat seamlessly and he really is the driving force of the film.Support: Kim Basinger does a good job as Vicki Vale. She is very believable and plays up the charming aspects nicely, though she does scream way too much and doesn't really do that much. Robert Wuhl appears every now and then as fellow journalist Knox, he is mostly comic relief but he is enjoyably laid-back in the role. Michael Gough isn't much like the comics Alfred, but he gets down the sweet fatherly figure brilliantly. Pat Hingle is decent as Gordon and convinces you he's a weary, good-hearted cop. Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance have nice little roles, but aren't given too much to do sadly.Action: The action scenes here are more of the old school, classical mould and are actually really good. The firefight in the chemical plant is excellently done and a highlight of the film, part gangster heist and part superhero battle. We get to see Batman beat on a number of criminals throughout which is always fun and shot effectively. The climax with the Batwing looks cool, but is a bit silly. The fight in the bell tower with the Joker's thug is enjoyably brutal too.Music: Danny Elfman's stirring, atmospheric theme sets the mood and still sounds magnificent. His score has the perfect balance of atmosphere and bombast, with wonderfully Gothic and kind of 'gangster' film undertones. It fits the film to a tee and makes things seem even grander than they are.Production: The visuals the film has are excellent. The film has a great gloomy, Gothic and at times resembles a classic neo-noir which is really striking. The map paintings by Anton Furst are also fantastic, especially at expanding the city. While places like Wayne Manor and the Batcave look great. The costumes are great, the grimy Batsuit looks fantastic and the Joker's gear is effective too. Like all the Batman films the writing can be a bit clunky. The climax feels very rushed into and too much is glossed over at times. As said, it would be a lot better if Batman had more going on as can feel like the Joker is taking over things at times. Plus the Joker being the killer of Batman's parents was and still is stupid. People will also have problems with Batman killing people and some campier moments like the Joker dancing around to Prince.Conclusion: Batman is probably the best of the original four films on the dark knight. The world that Burton creates and the characters that inhabit it are really interesting. There are some really strong elements like the noir tone, Jack Nicholson being a ton of fun, Keaton as a convincing caped crusader and the excellent score. It has issues of course as some of the writing is overly silly and Batman is never given enough screen time. It's not as solid as many make out, but it is good entertainment and a strong start to the Batman films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very overrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1989 Batman movie is OK and nothing more. The only thing standing out is probably Michael Keaton as Batman.I know this movie isn't for fans of the Dark Knight Trilogy, which I can reassure you that it isn't. Honestly, this movie is a more cheesy take on Batman. People say it's dark, I say it tries to be. It comes across as more of a cheesy superhero movie.I know it was great at the time, but you have to admit the movie looks really dated now. Batman's costume is still intimidating, but it looks like plastic. Jack Nicholson's Joker is REALLY over-the-top, and I'm not even comparing it to Heath Ledger's Joker.Kim Basinger is good as Vicki Vale, however. Tim Burton's direction is OK, not very subtle, and more in your face than it should be, for a Batman movie.Overall, the movie IS good, it has an OK plot, but there was SO much that could have been done better. It's better than two notorious Joel Schumacher films that came after it, but there is no way I'd call it the definitive Batman movie.HOWEVER, would I call Michael Keaton the definitive on-screen Batman? Yep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Think It's Better Than The Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, don't get me wrong, I really like The Dark Knight. But, in all honesty, I still think this film is the superior Batman flick.There's a motherload of things to like in this movie. Michael Keaton is considered by many to be the best Batman to date, and he portrayed Bruce Wayne pretty well, too. What made his Wayne so perfect in contrast to people like Christian Bale and Adam West is that you'd never suspect that Keaton's Wayne was Batman. Bale seemed a bit off in his performance as Bruce Wayne and Adam West's Wayne and Batman are nearly identical. Keaton's is so... STRANGE that you'd never be able to picture him in a batsuit.Jack Nicholson played a sufficiently twisted Joker, though I'd be lying if I said he disappeared into the role like Heath Ledger did. Despite that, he was always a delight to see and every scene he was in felt straight out of the comics. Vicki Vale is a nice character, who while not given much to do is still an good character.And then there's Bob, played by Tracey Walter. Oh, how does one describe the awesomeness that is Bob? Well, he's basically the Boba Fett of the movie: he never really does anything, rarely says anything, but his interactions with Batman and the Joker will make him your favorite character by the movie's end. Hey, there's a reason he got his own action figure.The only two downsides to the film are Batman's killings during the third act, as well as the fact that they turned his fight against crime into a revenge story. In the defense of the killings, the original comics had this trope, though they fixed it in good time. Remember, also, that Batman killed Harvey Dent in the Dark Knight. I can't really defend the second major flaw, though, as part of what makes Batman is the idea that crime is anonymous, and by making it personal, you rob Batman of an integral part of his backstory.Despite all that, I still think this movie captured Batman near-perfectly. It didn't need any political themes or long discussions on the nature of society or what Batman stands for to be awesome, nor did it need bright colors and hammy acting to be fun (hint, hint, Schumacher). It just had to give us some great acting, some delightfully dated action pieces, and grimy-looking props and sets to be awesome. It's the closest adaptation to the comics (the better ones) that I've seen to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, how do I even describe how big a deal this movie was at the time it was released, particularly to kids my age. The marketing was massive. Everywhere you looked there was the bat logo on something. Every other kid you saw (and many adults) had one of those cool black Batman shirts. Every time you turned on the TV there was a commercial for the movie. I can't think of anything else like it from my generation until maybe Jurassic Park and even that was different.It's a spectacular movie. Tim Burton crafted a darkly Gothic world with fantastic sets and special effects. The designs for the Batman suit, the Batmobile, etc. were unlike anything else that had been seen at the time. Yes, it was inspired by the darker tone the comic had taken a few years prior, but for the most part this is all Burton. It would be a hugely influential movie, reigniting interest in comic book and superhero properties. It would also lead to the excellent Batman animated series in the '90s, one of the best cartoon series ever. I have to chuckle at another reviewer saying this was too dark and violent to be marketed to kids like it was. I was a kid when I saw it and the only thing I remember disturbing me about it was Jerry Hall's face after the Joker disfigures her.Danny Elfman's score is so good he would mine it again and again for the next decade. The acting and directing are superb. Much is made of Michael Keaton being outshined by Jack Nicholson. It's hard to deny this and that's one of the things that makes it inferior to the Superman movie. But still Nicholson is so good and so much fun that you don't notice or care that much until you've rewatched it many times and are in a more critical headspace. If there's a significant flaw with the film, it's probably Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale. She's there solely because they felt Batman needed a Lois Lane. She brings little to the movie, except to be the pretty damsel in distress and to put out on the first date. Oh I know a lot of people might point to the Prince music as the film's weak link but that didn't bother me. I actually kind of like it. The supporting cast is excellent, also.Just so much fun to watch. It's interesting how opinions change over time, often back and forth. This movie was widely revered until the Nolan movies came out and there was a lot of putting down of this one, saying the newer film were better. But now after the Nolan films have passed, I see a lot of people looking back on the Burton Batman films with renewed admiration. I certainly do. I feel like this movie has stood the test of time well and will continue to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Father of the Modern Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton could be called the "Father of the Modern Batman," being that hardly a movie since about the Dark Knight doesn't owe its look and feel to his semi-comic reimagining, the 1989 masterpiece of dark comic opera. The Academy Award it received was well deserved, as a new darkness around the caped crusader seemed to erupt from the streets of Gotham and engulf him, and us, in a new and twisted aesthetic, as if the dark heart of mankind had finally showed itself across a city landscape, and revealed us for what we are, irrevocably corrupt and twisted inside. Tim Burton's vision revealed the power and inevitability of the Batman character to a modern audience, showing us the need for his uncompromising and furious battle against evil. Batman is a modern day, latter day, end of the world parable that foreshadows the coming end of the age, the irrevocable twistedness that is the soul of mankind, and (to wax philosophical), the coming judgment of God over sin. Along with Jack Nicholson's inspired performance as The Joker, what dark and beautiful spirit fired Danny Elfman's imagination then, to raise Tim Burton's dark and tragi-comic vision to a sublime operatic stage, with a score that captures and holds the attention with the force and power of a moving train. The score alone is worthy of this unique staging of a classic character, of which, the lack of Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score remains one of the great mysteries in the history of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty-five years ago, I went to a local theater with my Dad and Brother to see this film. At that point in time, I had never been a fan of Batman. Up until then, Batman had always been viewed as campy and silly, But when myself and everyone else saw the film in the summer of '89 all that changed! After seeing the film, I became a hardcore, die hard fan of The Dark Knight! Had it not been for this film, I never would've picked up a Batman comic book, I would've never became a fan, and I would've never given The Dark Knight the respect he deserved. Although some have regarded the Nolan films as superior, this film will always have a place in my heart. The City of Gotham has become infested by crime and corruption. Evil mobs dominate and rule the city, but a figure of hope emerges from the shadows, to set Gotham free from all evil, and protect its innocent citizens. Michael Keaton portrays Batman and his alter ego, Bruce Wayne, Jack Nicholson plays Batman's arch- villain The Joker, and Kim Basinger plays Photo Journalist Vicki Vale. As far as performances go, none of them are bad, some could have been better, but no one gives a bad performance. Keaton gives an excellent performance as Batman, as does Nicholson with The Joker. Basinger gives a fair performance with what she's given. Vicki Vale's only function in the film is give Batman someone to save. However, seeing as how that was the only thing female characters did in superhero films of that time, it can be forgiven. The film has plenty of action scenes to keep you on the edge of your seat! The Batmobile is an outstanding, spectacular, vehicle, and the design of Gotham City is beautiful! This movie always takes me back to that part of my childhood and leaves a smile on my face. When I came out of the theater that night, I forever became a Batman fan. It was one of the most fun times of my childhood, and it left me with a high anticipation for a sequel that would be as great or surpass the previous film. Sadly, it never came.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dark Knight of Gotham, the outlawed protector of Gotham city must defend it from the homicidal clownish prince of crime, The Joker. One of the best of the Batman films but in my opinion not the best batman films. Dark and Gothic in its presentation. Its a very alluring film that many comic book fans argue as one of the greatest in its genre. Good acting, a gripping story with a decent pacing. This film like all other Tim Burton films has the same Gothic feeling as all of his films, The action is decent as is the iconic score by Danny Elfman. One can argue that this film has aged somewhat but it still hold and resonates a certain charm with first time viewers as well as repeated viewings. A wonderful first installment that would gradually slip into a downward spiral emulating the old Adam West Batman TV show from the 60's. A fantastic film that i cannot recommend enough as a staple in the comic book genre. The first Batman film is a wonderful opening entry into the Batman film franchise one in which does its creator Bob Kane and DC comics proudly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Tim Burton Saved Batman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time where superhero movies are considered by critics as golden opportunities for directors to make their film a dark, poignant thriller that adults will love as much as children, it's hard to believe that back in the late eighties, that idea was almost completely frowned upon by critics and concerned parent societies. Back when even PG-13 had to be family friendly. So when Tim Burton directed this film, critic and parents were mostly polarized. Don't get me wrong, it made over 411 million dollars at the box office, which is almost a billion dollars by today's standards, but this was the first time a Batman film had been dark and edgy, the way that we're used to it being today. And it sure does hold up pretty well. The story line is very adult and intense, the acting is good (especially from Jack Nicholson as the Joker), and Tim Burton is great at producing the films sets and atmosphere. If I were to give one complaint, the pacing of the movie could be better, especially near the climax. Other then that, I say see it.</fullReview>

I could not wait to see this movie.Today people take superhero movies for granted, but back then there were not a lot of them out. Not like today. I really got into Batman during the summer of 1987. So my fever for Batman was in full gear when this movie came out.When I finally saw the film boy it did not disappoint. I was blown away, and didn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. I actually had to go see it twice the same summer. It was one of my most memorable movie going experiences.I still throw in the DVD, and watch it once in awhile now. I'll admit it has aged, but not too badly. However it's still one of my favorite Batman films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have been in the wrong mood to watch this film, a tired and mostly uninterested one, because I was extremely disappointed by it. Perhaps I wasn't keen because I'd seen and adored the Nolan trilogy so much, and thought that was the only way Batman should be done. Perhaps it was just too camp and over the top for me. Honestly, it could have been any of these, or a combination of them and various other things, but I just didn't enjoy this film very much.The film does work on a few levels, however, and it is these that I want to focus on, because there were some positive parts. Firstly, the film is pretty dark for its time, although nowhere near the levels of "The Dark Knight". The Joker's violence is pretty grim and stands out in a film which is made up of a lot of flair. The Joker's character itself is probably the best part of this film, and Jack Nicholson shines in the role. Having seen Heath Ledger's performance a number of times, I expected to be disappointed by Nicholson, but I felt completely the opposite. He added a completely different side to the Joker, going for violent sinister rather than psychological sinister, and I do think that they worked as well as each other. A lot of the action in the film is engaging and fun too, especially some of the Batman fight scenes.Now for the main problems in the film. Michael Keaton's take on the "Caped Crusader" was, to me, fairly uninteresting and felt like it had been completely masked by Nicholson's brilliance. I did enjoy Danny Elfman's score, and think that it was much better than Hans Zimmer attempts for the recent trilogy, but it was Prince's contribution which annoyed me the most. For a film which was trying to have at least a bit of seriousness among the dark comedy, the overly campy songs that filled the movie destroyed some of the darkness, being too lively and upbeat.The main problem in reviewing this film is that it has a remake which, for once, is far superior to the original, and now has such great renown that it's impossible to see one without comparing it to the other. I do wonder how I would have judged the film if I had never seen the "Dark Knight" trilogy, but I imagine my view would be fairly similar. And if this is supposed to be the best (or second best in some opinions) of the originals, I honestly fear how bad "Batman and Robin" must be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Keaton Was A Fine Choice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back in 1989, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the pick of comedic actor Michael Keaton to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, and if director Tim Burton would turn this into a farce, as they had "Beetle Juice" the previous year, but those fears were unfounded, as Mr. Keaton was properly complex and brooding as Billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose secret identity of Batman enables him to clean up the corrupt streets of Gotham. His chief nemesis is Jack Napier/The Joker, who is the opposite of him; extrovert to his introvert, evil to his good, but there turns out to be a deeper connection than either man realizes until the end...Magnificent production, very detailed and Gothic take on Gotham, a mix of 1930's and 1980's styles. Fantastic action, and solid script make this a winner, even if the soundtrack by Prince is a bit incongruous to the setting. Otherwise, a triumph.</fullReview>

Michael Keaton is a great Batman, but who really steals the show is Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Nicholson defines the Joker.

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie in theaters as a child with my father! Jack Nicholson played an outstanding role as 'The Joker,' a.k.a. Jack Napier. It seemed very realistic due to the fact that there are people like 'The Joker,' who later killed his boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) for setting him up at a chemical factory. At the factory, Batman (Michael Keaton) had his first battle with a major criminal after fighting petty criminals for a month. Tracy Walter who played Bob, the Joker's sidekick, deserved to be placed as a starring role. Due to the fact, that he was in far more scenes than Grissom. During this movie, Bruce Wayne a.k.a Batman falls in love with a news photographer Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger). Batman vows to defeat this Joker who thrives off of killing people with poisonous gas. In conclusion, Vicky Vale's life becomes endanger when the Joker becomes obsessed with her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious Batman Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Beetlejuice" director Tim Burton takes the legendary DC Comics costume-clad crime-fighter in the opposite direction from the ABC-TV interpretation of Batman. "Batman" constituted a major step in the mediated evolution of this literary character. Unlike the earlier incarnation of the Caped Crusader in the ABC-TV 'live-action 'series and respective big screen epic with Adam West, "Batman" resembles the actual comic book hero. Batman solves crimes alone in Burton's third feature-length film without the assistance of a Robin at his side. Meanwhile, Alfred absorbs the slack as an archivist when he isn't chauffeuring Bruce Wayne around the block. The casting of diminutive Michael Keaton as the enigmatic champion of justice goes against the grain. The woefully miscast "Mr. Mom" actor had never starred in an actioneer like "Batman." Happily, Keaton looks better in his Batman outfit than any of the earlier Batman leads, and Burton and his scribes exploit the suit to full advantage. You see, the Batman outfit doubles as a suit of armor as well as a disguise as opposed to the attire earlier Batman actors wore and then tucked away in either a satchel or a filing cabinet.As Batman's unflinching foe the Joker, Jack Nicholson has a field day with the role. Literally, the Joker is green with envy! Nevertheless, he lacks the contagious lunacy that Cesar Romero brought to the role. Like Batman, the character of the Joker emerges as a larger-than-life criminal. In the screenplay contrived by "Never Cry Wolf" scribe Sam Hamm and "Beverly Hills Cop 2" writer Warren Skaaren, a trigger-happy hoodlum named Jack Napier murders Thomas Wayne and his wife in cold blood in October before the eyes of their traumatized young son Bruce. Years later, treacherous, big-time mobster Carl Grissom (Jack Palance of "Shane") tries to sacrifice Jack to the local authorities because he is romancing Carl's moll. Nevertheless, despite a fall into a huge vat of chemicals at Axis Chemicals that alters his physical appearance, Jack eludes both the Gotham City Police and Batman. Napier mutates into the infamous Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime, and orchestrates a reign of terror on the eve of Gotham City's 200 year celebration. He tampers with various cosmetics so that models die. Bruce Wayne discovers the Joker's aptitude for chemistry and works out a solution. Meanwhile, he takes an interest in Vicki Vale. He invites her out to Wayne Manor and they spend the night together. At one point, Alfred regales Vicki with stories about giving young Bruce's riding lessons and a gray pony. Predictably, Batman counters each of the Joker's moves and saves the day. Not only does Batman brandish the Batmobile for the occasion, but he also swoops off into the skies in the far cooler Batwing, a plane shaped like the Batman emblem.Dark and murky, "Batman" emerged as the first of the realistic Caped Crusader epics. Nevertheless, nothing really sensational happens in "Batman." Sure, Batman tools around in the Batmobile and the aerial counterpart the Batwing. Indeed, a fight occurs in a belfry high above the city. Basically, "Batman" hasn't survived the test of time. The photography doesn't enhance the action as much as it obscures it. Furthermore, the mise-en-scene doesn't look as cool. Although Keaton lacks the stature required for the role, he delivers an adequate enough performance. Anton Furst and Peter Young received a well-deserved Oscar for Best Art Direction and Set Decoration. The Batcave looks enormous and baroque, while the architecture of Gotham City creates an atmosphere otherwise lacking in the uninspired screenplay. The rest of the characters do little either. For example, Vicky constantly screams at the least provocation as she is either attacked by the Joker or rescued by Batman. The Batmobile doesn't look as cool as the one in the Adam West &amp; Burt Ward series, but it looks closer to what the original Batmobile.Burton's "Batman" qualifies as an above-average actioneer, but Christopher Nolan's trilogy will always overshadow all other Batman adaptations. The irony here is that Jack Napier created Batman when he gunned down Bruce's parents, and Batman created the Joker when he forced him to take a plunge into those chemicals. Indeed, Nicholson's performance and character overshadow Keaton in every respect. He emerges as a green-haired bad guy with a streak of vengeance. Not only does he kill Grissom for setting him up, but he also tries to kill Batman. Burton doesn't make things easy for Batman. Right off at the start, a street hooligan pulls a pistol on the Caped Crusader and shoots him, but Batman's armored suit absorbs the bullet. Essentially, Burton retells the costume crime-fighter's origin. Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough of "Konga") serves as Bruce Wayne's butler and confidante. Initially, everybody considers Batman a criminal, but our hero changes their minds by the ending. In the meantime, Bruce falls in love with award-winning photographer Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger of "Never Say Never Again"), who is collaborating with another news reporter, Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl of "Arli$$") on a story about Batman. "Batman" lacks any incredible stunts, and the entire production appears to have been confined to a huge sound stage around City Hall and the Monarch Theater. The Joker being able to gun down the Batwing with one bullet from a Smith &amp; Wesson .22 short is asking a mite too much. In an earlier version of Hamm's screenplay, the Joker used a tank to take down the Batwing. Prince's songs are abysmal as usual.Altogether, "Batman" boasts moments, but it suffers from a muddled screenplay, lackluster action, and poor casting. The Joker doesn't have a real goal. He spends his time constantly trying to one-up Batman, and the two are rivals for Vicki Vale's affections. Batman doesn't so much kill the Joker as the Joker dies from another plunge-- from a church steeple. Meanwhile, Burton ushers the franchise into an adult dimension, dealing with Batman's bizarre psychological disposition, principally the murder of his parents. Danny Elfman provides some signature music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's "Batman" is sort of like Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" both not all that in touch with the comics much and both very cheesy but adds there own style to it a bit. In fact I wouldn't be shocked if both these directors are not even fans of comic books or don't read comic books. But they both know how to direct and at least try, and for the most part they tried and succeeded. It's not cheesy as the past Batman TV shows or the really old movies with the pow and the blam when something gets hit. However it still pretty darn cheesy, especially the acting which is comical and yet gives off this "Dick Tracy" vibe. But some audiences might dig this comical noir style. Tim Burton is known for his dark Gothic style with some over the top elements and that style is brought to this film. This movie is sure outdated now but I can see why some audiences might have really got a kick out of this movie in the past. It has almost all the right elements for a lasting childhood memory even if the style of it is dark. Michael Keaton is good as Batman, but didn't really buy him as Bruce Wayne. Although some might disagree. But Jack Nicholson did a amazing job as the Joker. I mean Heath Ledger version is still my favorite and I consider him the best villain in a movie so far. But I can really understand why audiences put these two Jokers together. Cause Jack Nicholson's Joker also leaves a mark, different from Heath's version. But he is still ominous and you just don't know when he will snap or strike. Or at least how he will execute his actions. His performance was spot on and his delivery was excellent. This one also gives the origin of the Joker, may not stick close to the comics but it's passable I guess. Doesn't come off as anything special though. Also some parts has plot-holes or just plain doesn't make any sense. Also Commissioner Gordon is in this but you hardly notice him, in fact if they took him out of this movie it wouldn't have made a difference. So basically his character was a complete waste. Also Batman is known as the world's greatest detective but there is hardly any detective work in this from him. Or at least it's not much hands on. Overall it's outdated and very cheesy but for fans of Batman it's most definitely worth checking out.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Billy Dee Williams, Pat Hingle, Tracy Walter and Jack Palance star in Tim Burton's 1989 action film based on the D.C. comics. This begins in Gotham City, where a boy and his parents get mugged by 2 thieves who soon face a bat-like vigilante, Batman (Keaton). Meanwhile, a psychotic criminal, Jack Napier (Nicholson) leads an operation to rob a chemical plant and becomes face to face with Batman who drops him into a vat of toxic waste becoming crazed clown, The Joker. Basinger plays photo journalist, Vicki Vale who works with reporter, Alexander Knox (Wuhl) to get a story on Batman and becomes romantically involved with billionaire, Bruce Wayne whom she learns is really Batman. Bruce discovers that Napier is the man who killed his parents when he was a kid and faces him. Williams plays Harvey Dent, Hingle plays Comissioner Gordon, Palance plays Carl Grissom, Walter plays Napier's right-hand man, Bob and Michael Gough is excellent as Bruce's Butler, Alfred. Keaton is my favorite Batman/Bruce Wayne, Jack is terrific as the Joker and Danny Elfman's score is great as usual. This is one of the best comic book films that's also one of Burton's best I recommend.</fullReview>

He becomes a bat.Enter Vicky Vale, a prize-winning photo journalist who wants to uncover the secret of the mysterious "bat-man".Jack Napier, one-time enforcer for Boss Grissom, horribly disfigured after a firefight in a chemical factory...who, devoid of the last vestiges of sanity, seizes control of Gotham's underworld as the psychotic, unpredictable Clown Prince of Crime...the Joker.Gotham's only hope, it seems, lies in this dark, brooding vigilante. And just how does billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne fit into all of this?..compared to Nolans vision, the film can be deemed as camp, but compared to the later films that followed this particular route of the Bat, It's a very dark and brooding movie.This was the movie that really set the bench mark for so many things. Crazy merchandise, Crazy salaries, and the sense that something really special was happening.For the most part of 1989, you could not avoid the fact that Batman was approaching, and thank the lord back then there wasn't any Internet or Downloads, because the only thing we heard about this was in magazines.It's a totally Burton movie, with a great cast and Keaton is great as the titular character, pulling off the feat of playing a playboy/tortured souls.But Nicholson owns the film, and he knows it. At times when you watch him, you forget that he was Jack Torrance/Jake Gitties/Randall Macmurphy, as his Joker is insane and one of the most fun characters ever put onto film.The only problem with the film is lack of story, I was hard pressed to find what the Joker wanted. It was a case of Batman having a fight, Joker saying a one liner.It shouldn't work, but thanks to the beautiful sets, amazing soundtrack, and classy editing, Batman remains one of the best blockbusters ever released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Batman Film Still!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great overall comic book feel to the movie, great dark scenery. Keaton and Nicholson were both fantastic! Also people may argue this movie looks dated but it still looks great! Nicholson was the perfect Joker and still is. He was born to do the role. Perfect fit. Keaton was a great Batman even though some may argue. He did a great job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman which many of the latest Batman actors have had trouble with. Doesn't have the intense realistic effect like the Dark Knight does, but thats why it is the perfect Batman film. It has such a great comic book look to it. Also am I the only one that thinks Kim Basinger still looks hot? :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jack Nicholson master piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wont' deny I had my bag of doubts before watching this movie. Primarily because I had first seen The Dark Knight and to me it is the apotheosis; so what's the point in watching an older Batman-Joker tale, which would be sub-standard anyway to the Nolan-Bale-Ledger master piece- right? Well not quite so; You see I forgot to include the factor called Jack Nicholson and the results he could introduce in the equation! So after seeing him deliver a great performance, I am glad I did not succumb to my doubts. Before saying anything further I must mention that it will be unfair to compare Batman on point to point basis with The Dark Knight; Movie technologies have quite obviously advanced to a different realm in the ensuing 19 years gap and Christopher Nolan is far more visionary and complete director than Tim Burton ever could be. But the point where comparisons can converge has a painted grin spread all over it. The grin of the Joker! It's fair to say that Batman is all about Joker and nothing else. Remove him and everything collapses; Keep him and you have a compelling reason to not leave your seat for 2 hours. The jolly mad murdering maniac dancing in the purple suit conveniently dominates every scene and though the movie is liberally spewed with him, he is never one time too many. Regrettably there is nothing much substance beyond it. The story line is an one-dimensional fairytale ? a knight on the quest to save a maiden from a demon and accomplishing the scripted task at the end; There are no surprises and no twists, which is good in a sense or Michael Keaton would have completely disintegrated in coping up with them as he couldn't cope up being Bruce Wayne and Batman in the first place. His performance was like seeing the engine of a Mini Cooper trying to run Mercedes in one scene and McLarren F1 in another. No wonder, long before the end I had completely sided with the Joker and his gang. It's difficult to support a batman with a hunted, pitiful, afraid demeanor who seems eager to hand over his vigilante duty on silver platters if only the director had permitted him to do so. The rest of the cast just form the background. They are there because Tim Burton did not think it appropriate for the movie to just have solo performances of Jack Nicholson- although I hadn't been complaining. It's in these finer points that the Dark Knight kills Batman. It's a dark and grim tale with a wonderful cast. There are so many characters who, despite the incomparable Ledger, live their imprints indelibly. Harvey Dent is not only limited to TV interviews, Albert 's only job is not serving drinks to his master, Gordon is a man who shows the strains of running a police department in a corrupt town, and why even little Gambon doesn't like to hear he can't give a nickel to his grandma! Of course the biggest differentiator is Christian Bale- who looks every bit as Bruce Wayne and Batman as he was made to enact these roles. Take a look him in his luxurious apartments and restaurants and he does seems to own them. Take a look at him as Batman and he seems the vigilante he has set himself out to be. This is a quite a long review now; but I can't close it without comparing the performance of the central character in each of the them- yes, I am talking about the Joker. The Joker of Nicholson is a murdering maniac, with a genius in chemistry and one who likes to kill for the fun of it. He is a man who has given himself to idiosyncrasies for deliberate theatrical effects, and he loves to flaunt his madness before an audience. In fact, his madness at times appears to be a consciously fake facade, adopted due to a history of attention deficit syndrome. The Joker of Ledger on the other hand is a character dipped, smeared and fried in evilness. He is not only genius but an intellectual genius- a self confessed agent of chaos, but too intelligent to conform to his own self descriptions; Murder is not fun for him, nor a weapon of intimidation; it's just a means to grab and hold power; His obsession is not women, it's achieving a supremacy he sees himself destined for. His rivalry with Batman is not about enmity; it's simply a medium to demonstrate his own superiority over the most superior of the forces. He is a true psychotic who was born the way he is; there is nothing acquired, nothing enforced, nothing pretentious; he is the a guy who enjoys in being what he is. And that's why while Joker of Batman dies, the Joker of Dark Knight lives on; (how ironical though it is that in real-life just the reverse happened)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main problem with this batman is that it is probably to close a representation of the comic books, plus there's the little thing of having a brilliant actor like Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne playing the role better then anyone else ever had done (and will), Kim Basinger is really worth giving the high hard one to repeatedly here to, combine this with jack Nicholson's performance as the joker which was accurate to what a comic book super villain should act like i'm guessing, the stunning art direction and production design and the fact that the bat mobile looks amazing group this with Tim Burton's excellent direction and you get a well paced rich and full movie going experience, this actually could get someone into the batman comics or comics in general seeing as the world created in this film is so interesting, the problem with this film is though is that it's not the dark knight, the dark knight has Christian bale (probably the worst actor to make it into the a list) playing a really bad interpretation of Bruce Wayne and an even worse one as batman (don't like the voice) you have Katie Holmes or Maggie Gyllanhall in place of Kim Basinger great move because having a serious actress in an adaptation of a comic book is really that essential which is exactly why I would like to see Robert De Niro playing captain America when it gets made, plus the street lamp lit streets of new york look so much better then Anton Fursts Gotham city, plus that movie also features heath ledger as the crow. In my opinion the dark knight is c**p i also like batman returns and i don't give a s**t if people do think it is to dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman A Decent Comic Book Film But With Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start off by saying that at least to me, "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight" by acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan (Memento and The Prestige) are the best films based on the popular comic book character. I decided to go back and watch the Batman movies by Tim Burton which honestly weren't the greatest compared to the two most recent films from Nolan. Director Tim Burton does an okay job of making this movie back in 89 but some flaws weigh it down which I'll get into later. Jack Nicholson does a good job as Jack Napier who eventually becomes Batman's arch enemy The Joker but I felt he went too over the top at times. I didn't think he stole the movie like some other people apparently did. Nicholson turns in a decent performance but I for one thought the late Heath Ledger was much better as The Joker in the Dark Knight giving audiences a creepy, mysterious, sinister, and charismatic villain who was unpredictable and he most definitely lived up to the tile of Batman's arch nemesis. Nicholson wasn't as scary as Ledger but he makes you occasionally chuckle with his dark humor. Michael Keaton does what he can as Bruce Wayne/Batman but I was surprised at how little the movie does focus on him because it's mostly about the Joker. Keaton does what his role requires I guess but I still think Christian Bale is the best actor to play Bruce Wayne/Batman hands down. He had a lot more to work with than Keaton and was overall more effective in the role. Keaton didn't bring the kind of presence Bale brought to the character but he turned in a decent performance none the less. Kim Basinger is okay as reporter Vicki Vale but she did get a little annoying sometimes mainly because of her almost constant screaming in the film when she's in danger. Basinger is a decent actress but this isn't her best performance no offense. She like Keaton does what he role requires I suppose though. The rest of the cast are so-so because none of them are memorable. The action sequences are well executed but they're missing the wow factor like the ones in "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight" which were fast paced, exciting, and intense compared to this movie. I felt the story focused too much on Nicholson's Joker with Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman getting cheated out of some much needed development and screen time. The dialog was cheesy at times and many characters like Commissioner Gordon, Harvey Dent, and Alfred to name a few got the short end of the stick since they merely show up for only a handful of extended appearances. I thought Bruce Wayne's relationship with Alfred and Gordon was much better developed in "Batman Begins" because the three actors (Christian Bale, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Gary Oldman as Gordon) had genuine chemistry in their scenes together which always helps make a film better. I also preferred Aaron Echkarts performance of Harvey "Two-Face" Dent in "The Dark Knight" over Billy Dee Williams. He's barely in this one at all and wasn't given as much to wok with as Eckhart. Williams is okay in the role but nothing special. Another thing is that Batman doesn't kill he has morals but in this movie he does and that just didn't seem right. Tim Burton's Batman really isn't that bad of a movie don't get me wrong it's just not that great when the title character takes a back seat to the villain. Overall Batman is a decent movie based on the comic book character but none of them are even in the same league as "Batman Begins" or "The Dark Knight." Those films at least centered a lot more on Bruce Wayne/Batman than Burton's making you care about him. They also explained why he'd dress up like a bat and fight crime which the others only hinted at but never fully explored. I recommend you see those two films by Nolan if you're a fan of the character because this movie could've been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice reinvention of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to look back now on Tim Burton's "Batman" for several reasons. One, we've seen a lot more from this director than we had at the time it was released. At that point, he was a guy who had done "Beetlejuice" and "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure." Now that we've seen quite a lot of film from him, it's possible to look back at this film and find some of his common visual and thematic concerns. It's also interesting to compare this film to some of the newer attempts to reinvent the Batman character.The character dynamic is a bit weak, especially compared to the newer films. Michael Keaton's Batman is left a shadowy figure, his past and his motives more obscure than the Joker's. While the connection between Joker and Batman becomes painfully clear with the inevitable flashbacks, you never really feel that the two characters have a strong connection on film. Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale is much worse, feeling like an arbitrary imposition on the film at almost every point. It's no surprise she was dropped from the sequel.Burton did a good job of matching his visual style to a slightly more generic and conventional comic book style, managing to bring a new kind of punch to a superhero movie. I think he was the first director to really make a personal superhero film. I do prefer the second film however, where he seemed to feel more comfortable and where more of his personality works its way onto the celluloid.The main reason to watch the film was, and is, Jack Nicholson's delicious over-the-top performance as the Joker. It might seem strange to people who have seen Heath Ledger's Joker in the newer film to realize that at the time this first "Batman" film came out, Nicholson's Joker was considered very dark and dramatic compared to Cesar Romero's version on the TV show. Based on Burton's previous comedies and the bizarre casting of Keaton, a lot of people were afraid that this film would be very goofy. At the time it was praised for being very dark and very moody, but compared to these newer films Burton's "Batman" falls right in step with his Gothic comedy routine.The pace and style of the movie is very modern I think; some things that seemed really outlandish and original in this film have now been digested and become relatively normal commercial fare, particularly the narrative ellipses. Unfortunately the music by "Price" tends to date the movie needlessly.All told, this is still one of the most satisfying comic book movies for people like myself (and director Burton) who don't really read comic books. Job well done, and a good setup to an even better sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A slightly dated but still enjoyable superhero movie thanks to Jack Nicholson who seems to be really enjoying himself. After about thirty minutes, you realize that the filmmakers forgot to add a real script. Most of it looks like it was made up during principal photography. Michael Keaton is good (wonder what he could have done as the Joker...) but missing for most of the film's running time as the Joker hogs the limelight. Kim Basinger is average while Michael Gough is excellent as Alfred. The action scenes have dated and are only modestly enjoyable now. Worth a watch at home thanks to Jack! Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes indeed. I have grown up watching this movie and have loved most of the things about it. This is the best batman movie before the Nolan era.Micheal Keaton, well after Batman Begins Christian Bale for me became the definitive Batman. Keaton is good and certainly is better than Adam west, Val kilmer and George Clooney, but he does not embody the character physically, and does not have a "Batman look" to him as much as Bale. I certainly hated the fact that the Bat costume was too heavy and that he could't turn his head (Lol). As for Bruce Wayne Keaton did a good job but he lacks in a good play boyish look and the way i see it Batman and Bruce are the same guy so if i thought the Batman was OK than that means the same for Bruce.The movie however is made up for the masterpiece performance by one of Hollywood's finest Jack Nicolson. Man did he pull off a hysterical yet creepy joker. Move over Ceasor Romero Jacks joker has moved you over aside by being a much more intertesting character. Joker's origin story has been told in the movie as the main plot, (Its kind of weired considering that the movie is called Batman?). Scene after scene Jack will please you with his fine performance.Kim Basinger is one of th most sexiest woman ever. She brings a certain glam and charm to the dark and broody atmosphere of the movie. Yet she will annoy you as much as Wille Scott did in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Her character Vikkie Vale is given much screen time then needed. Shes in the movie for too many scenes. She becomes a main character for both protagonists Batman and Joker. I would've preferred if they were a little less scenes of her in order to bring more tension in the duel of Batman and Joker.Gotham City has Tim Burton all over it. The director has really given a dark, dull setting to gotham with all golam looking skyscrapers and a heartless look. This is excellent as it represents a perfect city look where a guy like Batman will strike out.The direction,script,screenplay have all been pleased. But what certainly stands out is Danny Elfmans soundtrack(discarding Prince as his two song 'Partyman and 'trust' were awful). Elemans Batman theme is very iconic and cant be beaten, that is one thing were Batman will stand out from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight the iconic batman theme.Another honorable mention is the stylish bad ass look of the batmobile and Batwing.If your a Batman fan and you have not seen this movie than Shame on you. You will be doing yourself a favour by watching this great fun packed movie. Also if your a jack Nicholson fan see it as much as the joker is one of the top 3 best performances in his career.</fullReview>

Burton's take is much more cartoonish, and Jack Nicholson's Joker is more funny than scary, but it's a stylish movie with magnificent production design, and until Christopher Nolan, Burton's film had a nice long run as the definitive version of the story.Who would ever have thought that Michael Keaton would be well cast as the caped crusader, but he does surprisingly well.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comparison of those who played Batman in movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Actors: Bale, Kilmer, Keaton, ClooneyBALE: He's leaps and bounds ahead among them all. No need for comparison. No need to explain.KILMER VS. KEATON: The real Issue. Kilmer had everything correct about him except one: he was in a Bad Movie. One simply canNOT refer to Bad scenes in a Badly scripted Bad Movie by a Bad Director to explain why the actor was not good to play his character. I understand, Kilmer could have never replaced Bale, but he would have easily replaced Keaton (who even though was a good Batman, WAS a wimp Wayne). Even if we forget that Keaton was the least good looking and had the least physicality required for an ideal Wayne/Batman respectively, we still cannot forget that he never had the ideal Wayne magnetic personality to attract females. He was a plain idiotic wimp as Wayne. Whereas while Kilmer was definitely muscular/handsome of the two, his was unfortunately limited by the Bad Movie itself that he worked in, that did no justice to the character of any roles in it, least of all Batman. Also, we can't forget that Kilmer did play a very good playboy-Wayne of whatever the script allowed him to. That is what is important (where Keaton failed). Because once you're inside the caped costume, it does not matter who is inside it, because nobody's going to recognize you anyway. So the character that must be given more priority is of 'Wayne' where one can't hide behind a costume. Remember, Kilmer was a good Wayne/UNDERUSED Batman in a bad movie by a bad director. Keaton was a good Batman/wimp Wayne even in an overall OK movie by a very good director. Even worse was that, unlike Keaton who got two opportunities as Batman under the very good director to prove himself as Wayne and yet failed on all points as Wayne, Kilmer never got a second chance to prove himself as Batman even though he had proved himself as Wayne, no... not even under the same hellish director. MY POINT: If the physically strong, play-boyish Kilmer was that good as Wayne under the hellish Schumacher, imagine how great he could have been in costume (Batman) under the very good Burton. CLOONEY: As for 'Batman &amp; Robin', every thing was wrong about it and so was Clooney who only played 'himself' both as Batman/ Wayne. And he will always be remembered for that. Anyway, except when the movies are called 'Syriana', 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', Clooney is all 'himself' everywhere. No Surprises here. I seriously hope they destroy all records/sources of that B&amp;R-crap.My Ranking: 1. Bale 2. Kilmer 3. Keaton. Clooney? Who Clooney?(P.S.: Believe me, as the tag-line of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' goes : 'It's Nothing Personal.' None of these four actors is my personal favourite. I love Denzel Washington.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Batman' is a watchable yet flawed super hero movie saved by Jack Nicholson. Jack is at his hammy best as he chews up the scenery. He is front and center in a film that seems to be all about him. The poor Batman (well played by Michael Keaton) is but a mere supporting actor. He is barely given any back story, and the script assumes we will support him simply because he's the Batman! The Special Effects of this film were state of the art for their time although they appear slightly ordinary today. The film begins well and has more than a touch of noir about it. Somewhere around the half way mark, Burton pulls back and concentrates on action and spectacle. The result is solidly entertaining yet can't hold a candle to Nolan's magnificent vision of Batman (see 'The Dark Knight').Bottomline: 7/10 Watchable yet seriously flawed super hero movie saved by Jack!</fullReview>

The hype was so great that many people said the film just couldn't match up to it no matter how good it was. Nicholson's Joker was the centre of attention. Overall it was Gotham City that was most impressive. Tim Burton always comes up with the goods on the visuals and the set design. Michael Keaton was fantastic. The story and script should have been better written. Had the impression that there were ideas tied to together with long gaps between. As a blockbuster it remains one of the better ones. But the new ones by Nolan are greater than Burton's earlier vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deals with its basic good guy, bad guy routine in a noir inspired world well but the film never gets to the level of anything spectacular.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think Batman is the truly great film that everyone seems to think it is. Yes, as a superhero film it is a lot more sombre and certainly more constructive than recent comic book efforts and the latter Batman films but on its own, it is a nice to look at and somewhat entertaining film that falls short due to sloppy execution of good ideas. I like the fact that the only green screen you'll get in this comic book effort are the background long shot city effects, but for the 1980s perhaps this is all they could do. I also enjoyed the essence of noir that the film carried in its shapes and shadows on the walls (there is a nice example in an office when the blinds create a shadow) and the city of Gotham is a towering and intimidating spectacle.But although Batman contains the essence of noir, it doesn't follow through enough to be labelled as one. Sure, it has its ditsy blonde woman in Vick Vale (Basinger) who is along to be looked at, rescued and nothing much else. It has its moody anti-hero in Batman/Wayne (Keaton) who has a foot in both camps of vigilante and Gotham's rich and famous and yes, it carries that element of crime and that feeling of criminality. There is also the fact the film feels as if it is taking place in the 1940s (the golden era of noir in Hollywood) what with Tommy guns and pinstripe suits here and there. But nothing ever goes beyond the point of a visual example.So what actually is this film? It's an on and off love story that is cute and nicely unfolded with the two meeting; meeting again; going on a date; dealing with domestic issues such as one half of the relationship lying; going through a tough time and then breaking off completely, although Wayne as Batman must still rescue Vale. But it is nothing much more than that and in that sense it is nothing more than recent efforts 'The Holiday' or 'The Lake House', which were better because they didn't need the hero to rescue said love interest from the clutches of a villain. The problem is that Vale is just too loose. She seems smart and educated enough to be in a job with a newspaper but when it comes to being independent or strong-willed, she needs men to aid her. The finale in a high tower as a (dark) knight in armour must rescue her from the hands of evil is ludicrous and a centuries old method of story telling.So apart from an iffy love story which I'm sure was as familiar then as it is now, what do we have in terms of story? Well as perfect as you like, the hero's past tragedy has something to do with the villain involved which is done interestingly in this film and, like the love story, is unfolded nicely when all is revealed but it's nothing more than a visual example. What I cannot understand are the inconsistencies and general humorous/evil mentality The Joker (Nicholson) is supposed to possess. Jack Napier starts out like any other criminal in a 1940s noir with his suit, bodyguard and ties to both the underworld and the police but we spend very few scenes with this character. Instead, we get the incident that transforms him and suddenly he's someone else. What I can't understand is why the event that changes him would transform him psychologically as well as physically. Napier's mental state is one of a psycho which is established through past newspaper readings but he is calm and unfunny in his presentation of himself; once he becomes The Joker, he suddenly relegates himself to the level of a clown, merely because he looks like one which is just silly. There are scenes in which the balance to what's a musing to us, him and generally disturbing that blur the boundaries. Scenes such as the hand buzzing, the balloon parade and the museum defacing ? is this supposed to make us laugh or is it supposed to fill in time over a weak, centuries old story.Then there is the sub-plot that appears and disappears involving The Joker. He develops some sort of serum that makes you laugh, smile broadly and then die which he infects somewhere in Gotham City. So, all of a sudden the film is about germ warfare? What else does The Joker do? Part of the reason I liked Batman Returns so much is because the villain (Penguin) integrates himself with the people; polluting and conning people as he moles his way in and eventually runs for mayor. He has something to do but here, nothing much happens and Joker's idea just acts as a reason to further ensure love and trust between Wayne and Vale. But Joker's inconsistent motivations don't stop there; he is in love with Vale from the moment he sees her and yet his Museum proposition is to deface her as she becomes his own ? why change her face if she's already stunning in your opinion? Maybe he's just insane but why should we have to suffer through silly narrative-drives because of it. There are parts of Batman that are reasonably good and Keaton anchors the film down with his downbeat and depressive approach to Batman. But the film is more about The Joker ? he is more energetic; does more and appears more often. Batman/Wayne is there to fall in love and foil the baddie when required, simultaneously getting his own revenge in the process. Everything is executed well but there's not a lot here to execute in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Moments But Overall Misses the Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On Superman's first major appearance in the original 1979 movie with Christopher Reeve, the "man of steel" saves Lois Lane from plummeting down 900 stories from the top of one of Metropolis' skyscrapers and becoming a human pancake. Lane asks the inevitable question, "Who are you?" Superman's reply is simply "a friend". That's what Superman would say. He probably would not call himself "Superman" lest to seem too aware of his own super magnificence, and thank god he didn't flex his arms like the ridiculous TV show of the 1950's. Fastforward 10 years. In the film "Batman", a similar scene occurs at the opening with Batman apprehending some down-trodden baddies. The baddies ask the same question as Lois Lane, but the answer was "I'm Batman". Almost any other response would have been superior such as "I'm your worst nightmare.", "You don't need to know my name.", even "I'm Bozo the killer clown." But replying "I'm Batman" really was a tip-off that the script still needed serious work, a problem that continues to plague many films produced under the corporate Hollywood system. Having Batman say "I'm Batman" is sort of akin to Dracula saying "I'm the Count!" or worse "I'm a Vampire!" proceeded by a cruel Romanian laugh.The problem with this movie is that it couldn't quite decide if this was going to be Frank Miller's "Dark Knight", which was more akin to the early 1940's strips by creator Bob Kane, or the campy 1960's show with Adam West climbing up buildings and meeting the likes of Jerry Lewis or Dean Martin on the way up. If it was trying to be like Miller and/or Kane, it wasn't mysterious enough. If it was going to be like West, it wasn't silly enough. Certainly Jack Nicholson as The Joker is the inevitable casting choice, and since Tim Burton was at the helm, it seemed like a movie that was aiming for the dark overtones of a Miller and/or Kane story. However, the mystery surrounding the Joker and Batman wasn't quite there.The main issue is that the movie lacks focus, as if the screenwriters had not quite thought the story through and realized what the themes should be. Miller's "The Dark Returns" may be the best Batman story since Bob Kane, and it certainly is a hard act to follow. Unfortunately, much of the movie is kind of a mess when you see it with a more critical eye. And I never quite felt for the characters in the way I did for the first two Superman movies.Still, if you have never seen this movie, it is definitely worth a viewing. There are definitely some great moments. Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale is outstanding, and her relationship with Batman (and the Joker) is worth the price of admission. (Ever notice how DC comics' leading ladies' names are often alliterations?) And of course, even with a mediocre script, Nicholson as the Joker is a performance not to be missed. He is one of a few actors on the planet that make a sub-par script seem better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, I didn't like it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a movie by Tim Burton, I expected a lot more. Batman, as it is greatly portrayed in Batman Begins, is a sinister, dark, gloomy, Gothic hero, and so are their enemies, like Joker. I didn't like anything about the movie, except for Jack Nicholson acting. He did a great job, although that's not the Joker I expected. The soundtrack by Prince is awful, the very colorful scenes and the very unrealistic sets as well. So, I recommend Batman Begins, but not this Batman. Burton can do better, and Batman deserves it, he's the most accurate personification of a human super-hero, a two-faced, two-hearted man, divided by evil and good. The bat within the man. Not a good movie if you like more sinister heroes like Eric Draven from The Crow. It might just be a question of taste, I don't know. Wacth it anyway. I gave it a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit it. I saw Batman at the theater with all my buddies. I'm far from being a movie critic, but Batman wasn't a good movie. At least not as good as most people think it was. I liked it because it was Batman. Everybody was talking about it and I was a nerdy teen-ager who wanted to be part of the crowd.After the other Batman movies came out I realized something that isn't and wasn't talked about very much. How can you mess up a comic book movie when it has already been written for you? what kind of vision does a director have, to change something that has been proved to work? AND you can't kill the JOKER, the PENGUINE, TWO-FACE? and so on because they are Batman's no 1 nemesis. (STUUUUPID) Why don't you just go ahead and kill Alfred or Comm. Gordon? To me it's the same thing.I liked Keaton as Batman, but it took a long time to stop thinking about Beettlejuice and Mr. Mom and realize it's just a movie. Anyways until BEGINS came out, The "Mask of the Phantasm" was the best Batman movie out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burtons Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to give you mine opinion of all the old Batman movies, starting with this one and ending with Batman &amp; Robin.The first Batman film by Tim Burton from 1989 was good. The Dark Knight (played by Micheal Keaton) battles his archenemy: The Clown-Prince of crime known as the Joker.I'm a big fan of Batman and the whole mythology around him that has been developed and sharpened to perfection during almost 60 years. So when you take one of the best characters of all time to the big screen you have to be careful.Thankfully, Burton is a master when it comes to make weird and dark movies. So Batman wouldn't be any problem, would it?Burton made his version of Batman and, even though it isn't my version, it is a nice interpretation. All the good stuff are there: The batcave and batmobile, Old trusty Alfred, Gordon, Dent and of course The Joker. And best of all is the vision of Gotham City. This dark, Gothic city with gargoyles on nearly every black building that rises to the sky. Oh, yes. We surely aren't in Kansas anymore, Toto.But, and this is a big but, Burton fumbles very much with the mythology and characters. Batman and Alfred are all right, but Gordon get's to little screen time and Joker is almost ruined. Now, it is very hard to ruin the Joker. After all, he is one of the greatest villains of all time.But this psycho-clown is in Burtons hands more of a clown and less of a psycho. And Jack, who is a great actor, just can't do the character justice. And what's even worse is that he steals the show entirely from the main character: Batman. This is a good movie about the Joker, not about Batman. That is what keeps this movie from a higher score. It's got the mood right, it's got the settings right. But it failed on the most important thing: the characters.So 8 out of 10 for Burtons first try on the Dark Knight. "Where does he get those wonderful toys?" The Joker</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a childhood favorite of mine. We watched this movie over and over and over. I bet I have seen it 30 times and it was still exciting as I watched it again the other night. I am watching all of Tim Burtons movies and this is the third feature film he directed.When Burton filmed Beetle Juice he finally showed us the Tim Burton trademark look and it was nice. However, when he did BATMAN he had to focus more on bringing this comic book legend to life.In Batman we see many of the costumes and such that have became familiar in Burton films. We get to enjoy the beautiful use of color and sets that Tim is famous for. I think the direction was less artsy simply because it had to focus on the action and characters and let the stars shine and the director simply direct. If the name had not been attached I would not have been able to guess it was even a Tim Burton film.The movie was great. Keaton as Batman was great. In the earlier 80's I would've found it hard to believe that the MR. MOM/ GUNG HO star could've pulled off such a gig. In Beetle Juice Keaton did a great job and I gained a whole new respect for him. He lived up to it again in BATMAN.All of the actors did a great job and I am a die hard fan of Jack Nicholson and him doing the joker was absolutely perfect. They all did a good job, it was a wonderful film and we all went out and bought the BATMAN shirts and toys and playing cards and don't try to deny it we all had the soundtrack and were bumping Prince from our speakers for a while there.7/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman From Comic to Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I'll explain the reasons I like Tim Burton's Batman. First of all it finally brought the frighting and menacing Batman. Not the 60's Batman that was so pointless and stupid I found Batman boring and just another kiddie show/cartoon. With this Batman we get to see a darker being who fought more realistic villains. Jack N. was the best choice for Joker ever. It's sometimes hard to tell if it was the comic that made Jack's version of the Joker, or if it was Jack's version that made the comic's.Now the bad parts. I really did enjoy seeing the dark side of Batman, but I mean it was just too dark at times. I think Batman seemed more like a vigilante then a hero. Also I think making the villain or the alter-ego the star of the movie is bad. Bruce Wayne should be the star. Batman and Joker should take a back seat. Jack N. being the star of the movie is boring when seeing him do something that Batman doesn't have anything to do with. Another thing was Micheal Keaton. I do like him as Bruce Wayne but Batman's a different story. As a rich guy, yeah it's believable. But if I saw Micheal Keaton wearing black rubber, I wouldn't fear him, I'd laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so he doesn't have any powers but that doesn't matter, he is one of the greatest heroes out there. This movie is great still. PLUS ITS THE ULTAMITE REVENGE STORY(you don't find out the Joker killed his parents until the end).OK so its a little out-dated, Batman is short(height wise), and yes it does show the villain more then Batman. But if you get past all that you can realize how amazing this movie is, I personally think its the best in the series, even better then Batman Begins. If you people cant get past these things then respect it still, like Superman, its the same problem. YOu cant watch the 1978 Superman and not expect perfect picture, graphics, sound, and color.But out with the bad and in with the good, Jack Nicholson played an amazing Joker(you CAN NOT watch this movie and not like Jack Nicholson) for starters. None of the other movies not directed by Tim Burton, especially not Batman Begins, can compare to Danny Elfman's WONDERFUL music. Jack Nicholson and Tim Burton shared with the world their dark humor. The Joker even had his own little saying("You ever dance with the Devil by the pale moon light?"). And if I do say so, I thought the death sense were pretty cool.If you at least give this movie a chance you will eventually come through and see that Batman is one of Tim Burton's best yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the greatest Batman movie of all time. Batman Begins cant hold a candle to this movie nor Christian Bale to Michael Keaton. As a matter of fact Batman begins destroys most of the things this movie established. But Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne just as he should be. He's a man with a darkside--an inner conflict he believes he can resolve by by bringing justice to criminals everywhere for injustice anywhere. And his Batman portrayal is even better than that of Bruce Wayne. Hes what established Batman as my favorite super hero. As Batman hes calm and relaxed in the face of peril and as opposed to using all these ridiculous martial arts moves so strung out in movies today he just calmly and assertively incapacitates opponents with minuscule effort showing that he is capable of much more force if necessary (one of my favorites is his signature backhand...I always wanted to do that). Jack Nicholson is great as first a gangster and then as the joker. Its like the role was made for the man...its the best role I've ever seen him in. All the other supporting actors are fantastic especially Michael Gough as Alfred (one of my favorite supporting actors in this movie) and Tim Burton does a great job of directing and creating a dark and grim Gotham City. So if you want the same old tiresome garbage seen over and over again with little acting go see Batman Begins...but if you want a great movie see Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton directed this Batman movie after Batman had been turned into nothing more than a cartoonish comic book character due to the old Batman TV series rather than as the complex comic book character he really is. Burton focused on the dark images connected with the character and the expository background that went into making Bruce Wayne - Batman. His film Batman succeeds in bringing this left for dead character popular again for the initial reasons he was popular. Does the film succeed on every level? No way, but it DOES have a lot going for it. Burton always brings humour to all his films, and Batman and Batman Returns are no exceptions. These moments of humour tend to break the mood and atmosphere of each of these films from being truly dark - a problem corrected rightly I believe in the newer Batman Begins. But in these films the humor works much of the time, and I cannot imagine anyone else playing the Joker as well as Jack Nicholson - who let's face it makes much of this film work. It is Nicholson's eerie, erratic, comical portrayal of a man descending into insanity that carries much of this film with his high-energy performance and his endless stream of one-liners - many that work very well. Add that to Burton's dark tendencies in lighting scenes and Gothic settings and his wicked sense of humor along with a quality cast of performers like Billy Dee Williams, Jack Palance, Pat Hingle, and the lovely Kim Basinger and you have the makings of a highly entertaining film. Michael Keaton is an adequate Batman(like him much better than anyone else that played him afterward except Christian Bale). Keaton plays him conservatively wisely. Burton also is one to bring back the heroes of his cinematic past. He gives Michael Gough a chance to show millions(I always knew how good he was)who he is and how good an actor he is in a role as Alfred which would bring much deserved celebrity to Gough. I know there is a lot of discussion wanting to say one Batman is better than another - and I do believe the newer one comes closer to embracing the true spirit of the comics, but I like both films for different things. Neither is perfect, and both are very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An enjoyable and fairly well-paced film that looks so dated - it reeks of the 80s from the silly glasses, through the dialogue and to the inappropriate use of Prince's music. But the real problem with the film (and I thought so on first viewing back when it was new and fresh) is the smothering presence of Jack Nicholson - his Joker just eats away at the film with every appearance rubbing against the mood of the piece. Keaton is a good Batman but his dark and moody presence is overshadowed and made to look weak by Nicholson's ridiculous overacting. Kim Basinger was better than I remember and most of the supporting cast did well enough...given the competition! A less overpowering Joker and a more timeless feel and this would be a classic - as it is it's little more than a passable couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is a really good film and i do like it, but it isn't the best. In my opinion, this the second best Batman movie i've seen, the first being Batman Begins. The dark atmosphere, the acting, the design of Gotham city, and the overall story of the movie is great. It was the first movie that really took the franchise away from the campy TV series and it was very good. Jack Nicholson's performance as The Joker was also good, but it was kinda over the top. Michael Keaton played a good Batman/Bruce Wayne. But this movie has a lot of problems with me. First off Batman dosen't kill. I can understand killing the Joker, but come on. Second, the Joker is not the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents. It was Joe Chill who was the Killer in the comics. If you don't believe me, look it up. It wasn't the Joker! Third, the Batmobile looks cool with the machine guns built in towards the movie, but Batman isn't supposed to use guns. He doesn't like them. Fourth, this movie is called Batman and therefore shouldn't have more scenes of the Joker than the Title Character. Fifth, Jack Nicholson is a great actor (one of my favorites) but his Joker is too old and a little over the top. Even though Mark Hamill did the Joker's voice only in Batman TAS, he's a much more better adaption of the character. And lastly, what's with the Joker trying to wipe out the whole city towards the end? Sure it's twisted, but to the Joker Gotham City is merely a stage in which he performs. By doing that he was killing his audience. What's he going to do, move to Metropolis and get on Superman's nerves? Overall, it's a good movie, but nothing compared to Batman Begins.</fullReview>

But, I veeeeeeeeeeeeeery like Jack Nicholson as the Joker. He's good, but he always grumble in front of his TV, broke his TV and just little action. It can be count with my fingers. The Batsy is too old. WHAT IS WAYNE'S JOB?! Just murmur in his house. Think about his parents??? Crazy... The story is good, and freak. There are many goofs. Why the Joker should be dead? And the deadness is so crazy. He go with a smile. And what is a freak laughing thing in his coat (the things which found by Gordon)??? OK that's all I said. The Keaton's old Batsy, and VEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERY good Nicholson's Joker (I liiiiiiiike him!!! so much) and the 'good&amp;freak' movie. I'm sorry if I had mistakes in language or my comments.

		<shortDescription>Great film with a few issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the many fans waiting anxiously or Batman, ever since I first heard rumors of a film in the early 80's. The film met my expectations (for the most part) and exceeded some. It is not perfect, but it works quite well. It set the standard for comic adaptations, trailing only Superman the Movie, at that point. It had the dark, serious tone of the comics, while adding the nightmarish imagery of Tim Burton.Michael Keaton handles Batman quite well, despite the controversy surrounding his casting. He embodies the obsession of the character, although Bruce Wayne is weak as a character, a fault of the writing.Jack Nicholson dominates the film as the Joker. he establishes the traits first as Napier, which evolve into the lunatic Joker. His transformation was amazing.Kim Basinger is fine as Vicki Vale, but her character lacks depth and exists solely to be rescued. This problem is shared by all of the female leads in the movies, except the Catwoman.The remaining roles are fleshed out by wonderful character actors, like Pat Hingle and Michael Gough.The music was trendsetting, establishing Danny Elfman as a major film composer. He proved that he was more than a pop singer working in Hollywood.The designs were amazing. Gotham is part deco, part Gothic, and part nightmare. Anton Frst gave character to the city and to the amazing creations of the Batmobile and Batwing.Tim Burton captures the right balance of dark mood, humor and action. He presents a nightmare world of obsession and corruption. If he has a failing, it is his favoring weirdness over plot. This escalates in the second film, but is mostly in check here.The major downside of the film is that the Joker overshadows Batman. rather than being a twisted reflection of Batman's character, he becomes the centerpiece of the film. Batman is left wanting in the Joker's shadow. Also, the detective part of "The Dark Knight Detective" is lacking. The movies seem unable to portray the deductive skills of the character. Only the animated series captured this aspect. Finally, Vicki Vale is a particularly weak character, a trait shared with most of the female leads, including the latest film.Overall, the film is a triumph. The weaknesses don't detract from the entertainment of the film, but they do prevent it from nearing perfection. It would stand as the second best adaptation of a comic (after Superman), until Spider-Man came along. Now, if only the Prince music could be removed from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was released in 1989. Even though I was born that same year, to this very day kids my age older and younger love this movie. This shows it's impact on the super hero/comic book film fans. This is one of the reasons it classifies as a classic! Tim Burton did an extraordinary job with both Batman 1989 and Batman Returns, but this is the crown and jewel of the 2! Michael Keaton's portrayal as the Dark Knight of Gotham is dark, gritty and mysterious with a hint of humor to go along with it all. Jack Nicohlson's "Joker" meets my expectations of humor/psychotic character after reading the comics. Kim Basinger's Vikki Vale is magnificent! She plays that eager Journalist awesomely. Billy Dee Williams is very good in his performance as Harvey Dent.Danny Elfman's score is not only unique but masters the feel and aspect of the Batman Universe. The music captures the emotional, thrilling action and some comedic reference in the film. It is a must hear!!! The film looks great and sounds great with the new SE DVD's too! Even though I am used to the original VHS version, the film is great on DVD. Also check out the SE for Behind the Scenes Extras! All in all, this is an epic film based on a very wonderful comic and should be seen not only by BAT FANS but ALL!!!! Arbiter89 Hulme for JOKER!!!!!!</fullReview>

When his new look is revealed after falling into the vat of chemicals, you gasp and look a little closer. He too absorbs his character and perfectly portrays the evil, insane, egotistical and maniac character that is The Joker. Also, really big props to Jack for securing a good deal of the rights to much of the Batman paraphernalia - allowing him to walk away with a whopping salary of $60 million.A MUST see movie.

After seeing the newest Batman, I thought it would be a good idea to watch the originals. It was a good idea. It gave me a very good perspective at how bad some old people can make good films.Burton does a good job with the "Batman" storyline, but the "Bruce Wayne" stuff was very weird. What was the whole point of Vicky Vail, again? I think that Vicky was the most pathetic of all of Bruce's love interests. When the Joker was dancing with her at the end, she wasn't even fighting back! How pathetic is that??? Michael Keaton does a good job as playing the first Batman, but his performance as the billionaire playboy, Bruce Wayne, was not very convincing. He was falling too madly in love with someone too pathetic! He didn't look too handsome as Bruce either with his freaky hair. However, the supporting actors gave a very awesome performance. Gough as Alfred was the best casting choice they made in this movie! Jack Nicholson was very good joker and set the standard for all of Batman's future villains. Funny and yet depressed as well. He was born to play the joker.The storyline was okay. I didn't understand what the big whoop-de-doo about Vicky Vail was. Why does Batman/Bruce have to have a different love interest in every movie? Can't he just stick with one girl??? Another thing, the only bad thing about Keaton's Batman, was that Batman WALKS!!! The least he could do is run, like Val Kilmer. Couldn't he use one of his little toys and fly around the rooftops instead of walking down the street?! Come on! He's Batman, not a street-side vendor.On the plus side, it didn't have any dumb sidekicks like the last two do. And, Michael Keaton is WAY better than Clooney any day of the week.Overall, it's Batman. It's a classic. Just see it already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the original Batman series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs The streets of Gotham City are awash with crime. The citizens are finding it a daily struggle to stay safe. But there is hope in a new saviour: the 'Caped Crusader', Batman, who is increasingly becoming a mortal threat to the wrong-doers on the streets and wants them all to know it- "I'm not going to kill you-just tell your friends about me" he tells one unfortunate punk at the beginning of the film. But he's soon to be met with a new adversary- The Joker (Jack Nicholson) the clown prince of crime. Meanwhile, ambitious reporter Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) is digging deep into the Batman story, but she may be getting closer to it than she thinks- especially when she begins a romance with millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton.) A couple of decades after the campy, rubbery original Batman movie adaptation, breaking through director Tim Burton brought the DC Comics hero back onto the big screen with his own dark, non-campy slant on things. After just seeing the new Batman Begins movie, I felt it only right to start from, as I said in my last review, where it all began (indeed, from where another 'new generation' started to see it from) showing how the Batman franchise has endeared all generations of comic book lovers and, because of it's dark, distinctive appeal, will probably always have that something about it.If the movie made no other accomplishments, it set the tone for how other comic book movies should aspire to be. The strong, stirring soundtrack and zooming camera angles give the film an absorbing feel of a real comic book come to life. That's not to say because it's a dark film there's no light in it, and that comes in the shape, unsurprisingly, with Nicholson as The Joker. The real heart-and-soul of the film, in fact. Nicholson's always been one of my favourite actors, and here he really sets the show alight here. I'm probably being ungrateful, since when I saw it last night most of the scenes did seem to occupy him, but the scenes without him did seem to drag. Indeed, in one scene, where we are about to endure some tedious melodrama between Keaton and Basinger, he bursts in and quips 'miss me?', to which I could only reply 'er, yeah, actually.' But that's not to say he's the only thing to write home about. Keaton, admittently not the greatest of actors, does have a fittingly dark, calculated presence to him here, and in comparison to the future likes of Kilmer and Clooney, I sure know which one I'd pick. Roger Moore was always my favourite Bond, and Keaton's my favourite Batman, simple as that. I think this is a case of 'the original was the best' here.Overall, as the first movie in the series, this isn't the greatest film ever, but it definitely set the tone for future Batman movies to come and (I'm sorry to say) sort of washed the bad taste out of my mouth left by the over-crammed and not entirely satisfactory start of the new Batman series, Batman Begins. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burton's original Batman film is superb in many respects - a little rough around the edges maybe and inextricably weighted in favour of Jack Nicolson's Joker but nevertheless true to the bleak, occasionally ghoulish tone of the comics. Burton gets so many things right that its easy to forgive him for the odd lapse. Alright so there's songs by Prince, Kim Basinger and some instantly dated miniature work that seems out of place in a film with a budget this big but then you have Anton Furst's superlative collecting production design, an electrifying score by Danny Elfman and Nicolson's $60M turn as the Bat's Nemesis, overcooked sure but utterly captivating stuff. Poor old Michael Keaton by comparison is just left to look brooding and somewhat muted as the caped crusader but acquits himself admirably, especially given the fact that Burton is clearly uninterested in him. Occasionally there's the feeling that the scale of the project is just a bit too vast for the director and that he's punching above his weight. The story-telling on display here is not always coherent and certain scenes seem stagy and just so slightly technically flawed, such as certain wide shots which try and take in as much of Furst's beautifully rendered sets as possible, having tinny or poorly recorded sound. Mind you, that could just be my VHS tape. All in all this is sinister, twisted entertainment - a classic Goya compared to Joel Schmacher's childlike crayon scribblings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than your average comic adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are numerous reasons I believe DC Comics are better than Marvel comics. This is not the place to explore them all, however one of the central reasons is that DC's films will always be remembered as more than just comic-book films. Superman is fondly remembered as one of the greatest films of all time. And Batman by Tim Burton is remembered as one of the most Gothic, and grim blockbusters of all time.This film is not an origin story in the truer sense of the word. It doesn't show how Bruce Wayne, millionaire industrialist actually became Batman. Rather, it throws us right into the action, with a beautiful opening scene. Batman scares a couple of punks into submission before Keaton delivers the epic line, that practically torpedoed all memories of television shows starring Adam West: "What are you?" "I'm BATMAN!" The film's plot is quite thin and is more based around the rivalry of Batman and his arch-nemesis The Joker (played to perfection by Jack Nicholson) but the visual aspect of the film makes up for it.The only true downfall of this film is that Batman is not the main character. That right belongs to Jack Nicholson. This annoyed me somewhat, what with Keaton's scenes being so breathtaking (especially considering that there's such a small, slight man underneath all of that rubber!). Despite this fact, this is one of the better comic book adaptations you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this is the best Batman movie so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first Batman movie made and in my opinion the best one with the second Batman movie as the runner up. Whats my reasoning well the fact that Tim Burton's style of movie making and the Batman story match-up so well, dark and strange. To me the first Batman movie stuck to the comic story of Batman the very best. That is probably the biggest reason I loved this movie because me I'm a major fan of the Batman comics. I especially loved the way that Tim Burton portrayed Wayne Manor(Bruce Wayne's house) dark and spooky looking. This movie also had some fantastic acting. The way Michael Keaton portrayed Bruce Wayne was awesome, the best attempt so far. Then of course you can't forget Jack Nicholson's performance of Joker which was awesome too. But the person that pegged his character the best to me was Michael Gough as Alfred I mean you just, in my opinion, look at the guy and he's just Alfred no question about it. But overall this movie stuck to the comics and that was what I liked the best about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a good movie but has several faults. Micheal Keaton despite what everybody says was not a good choice, he is too stiff as Bruce Wayne and as Batman. Why and how Bruce Wayne became Batman is never explored in this movie which is a problem. For the most part Batman is a guest star in his own movie taking a back seat to The Joker whose origins are explained in this movie despite never being explained the the comics. Jack is excellent as the Joker giving what may be the greatest acting performance ever. The action and dialouge in this movie are great. My biggest gripe against this movie is the fact that Batman who never kills does kill the Joker which makes me want to ask Tim Burton what he was thinking. Burton does set the right atmosphere for a Batman movie which is dark, but for some reason in Batman Returns Burton went off the deep end making that movie too dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't live up to memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For whatever reason, as I child remember Batman being the greatest movie- nay, the greatest artistic CREATION in possibly the history of humanity. However, I watched it again recently, and not only does it fall well short of such high standards, but standards for a decent movie at all. Tim Burton's vision of Batman is fragmented, disjointed, and uninteresting. The title character remains virtually unexplored and we have little to no sympathy for him at all, making him the worst possible candidate for any kind of real hero. His romance seems bleak and distant, and we seem him more through the dopey, frenetic eyes of the media than anything. When the purpose of his war on crime is finally explained, we don't care about it at all, because, in truth, Batman is simply a co-star in this movie. Jack Nicholson dominates the screen. I don't say he dominates the screen as the Joker, because it seems to me that all he's doing is playing himself. I've heard people claim his character is Oscar worthy (this is garbage), but I think the real reason people liked him so much is that he's the first real goofy on-screen villain in modern superhero movie history, and no one can seem to get over that. He seems to be drawn more from the 1960's TV show than from the comics, and his over-the-top, borderline silly actions are unexplained and, again, we don't care about them. All of this culminates in an awkwardly placed attack on the Gotham Fair, in which Joker releases parade balloons filled with poison on Gotham's citizens while arythimcally shuffling about to Prince. The reason why he's doing this is again unexplained. We assume it's just because he's crazy, but since when has that ever been interesting? Tim Burton has turned Batman into his usual grotesque, introverted, and outcast-oriented movie. Dark settings, perverse stock characters, etcetera.We've seen it before. Chances are, we'll see it again. I grew up with Batman. I was addicted to the cartoon, reserving every weekday at 4:30 to see what the Dark Knight would do next. I went back to watch this movie after I heard they were making Batman Begins. I was disappointed with this movie, and decided to look into the classic Batman comics myself. As someone who has been freshly intoduced to the intricacies of Gotham, I can tell you that this movie is not Batman. It lacks the tortured, fierce, and borderline inhuman drive that makes this man do what he does, and instead turns him and his world into another cheap, superficial, and frankly boring product of the 1980's. I think this is why people still love Batman- because it's 80's nostalgia. But we love 80's stuff for the most part because it's materialistic garbage. If you watch I Love the 80's, you'll find they routinely skip over most things of artistic integrity. They don't talk about the great movies- they talk about Flashdance. They talk about Dirty Dancing. And that's the category Batman falls into. Right in there along with Flashdance and Patrick Swayze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keaton + Nicholson = one awesome movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is, without a doubt, the best superhero out there. Why? He's a dark character. Tim Burton is an artist, and he knew exactly how to bring the Dark Knight to the screen. This movie is really just amazing. It was my first favorite comic book movie. Michael Keaton is also a big reason this movie is so successful. He has a unique quality to each performance that makes him such a chameleon, a really effective, believable character. He is by far one of my favorite actors, and I'm not just saying that because he's Batman. A lot of his other work is really amazing stuff.Jack Nicholson - one of the best multi-generational actors in Hollywood today. His performance as the Joker - brilliant. His skill - unquestionable. Nicholson is one of those guys you can't not like, even if his character is a despicable villain. He radiates subversive charisma, something not a lot of today's younger, fresher actors are capable of. Danny Elfman is bar none the best composer of highly emotional music. He has a way of building the magic of the character into the score, and Batman is no exception. Just listen to the main theme - the growing crescendo, the defining character moments, the stings and the driving dynamics of the orchestra. It's all quite astounding. Batman is the penultimate comic movie, and even without the exorbitant special effects of today's comic movies, it establishes a wonderful, inspiring majesty that keeps the magic alive. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who admires the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film... but he isn't Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubts about the powerful vision of Tim Burton and his crew: Elfman's music became an instant classic; Furts's retro-futuristic sets were amazing; the balance between Nicholson's overacting against Keaton's silent presence was perfect. All that is wonderful, but has little relation with the real Batman, the one of the comic books. For a simple reason: Batman is not a killer.At the climax of the movie, the Dark Knight angrily says to Joker "I'm going to kill you". Minutes before, we see how a coward Batman sends the batmobile onto the chemical building, and drop a bomb which kills a group of Joker's henchmen. I'm a great fan of the comic character, so, for me, It's almost unacceptable that version of Batman. We are dealing here with a superhero, not Dirty Harry. Batman can be violent, and sure his methods are questionable. He's a vigilante over the law. But he's not a killer. In fact, in many comics he rejects the avenging actions and always uses rough (but no killing) fighting techniques. Do you remember the stupid "Batman Forever", when Val Kilmer criticizes Chris O'donell because of his quest of revenge?. Well, that fits better with the real attitude of the character.There is a strange paradox: Tim Burton made a pair of atmospheric, charismatic and really beautiful movies, but they spoil the real character; Joel Schumacher gave us two ugly stinkers, but they're more accurate with the real Dark Knight. Actually, the ultimate cinematic version of the character is still the animated series by Timm &amp; Dini. Let's hope Chris Nolan's new film will fix this situation.So, enjoy the Tim Burton modern classic as a great piece of cinema, full of powerful images and iconic ideas. But, please, don't consider it a good adaptation, because it betrays the real spirit of Batman.(Pardon my rude English!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman--Super Hero or Psychopath?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to read the Batman comic books as a youngster. It gave me a way to escape reality and enter another world. A world of make believe where evil never triumphed and the villains were always foiled, at least temporarily.The villains in the comic strip Batman were all head cases, and it took a special crime fighter to outwit and foil these types. He was tough, resourceful, dedicated and unswerving in his capacity as super hero. If you were like me you didn't question him or his motivation for being a fictional super hero, you just admired him and learned from him to be a hero too, at least in your imagination.But then, along comes the movie version of Batman. The TV version was deviation enough from the comic-book version. The movies were even worse. I'm not sure I liked the tongue-in-cheek way the TV series portrayed the duo ("HOLY SH_ _ BATMAN, DO THEY REALLY EXPECT ME TO DELIVER THESE LINES??"), but at least the TV Batman wasn't portrayed as insecure and didn't go around blurting out his secret identity on the first date, practically. The comic strip character was a lot less vulnerable, a lot more invincible, especially compared to the movie version. Above all he was never pathetic. He was too busy in his role as crime fighter, too focused on his role in life, to be stumbling around in a relationship for which he was unequipped.In the movie, Batman comes close to being a dullard. Why even the most sophisticated crime-fighting equipment ever dreamed of like the bat plane and the bat mobile respectively can be shot down by a .22 or sit stupidly by while some sewer trash totally disable its defenses and programming and make it work against its owner/designer. Why did the movie version's people want to make our hero out to be such a dolt? Why mess with a concept like the Batman character --with which you apparently feel uncomfortable-- in the first place?Just because there had to be super head cases to tax the mettle of our super hero, does the movie have to treat our hero like a head case too? Does crime fighting have to be turned into some kind of psychosis? And did the villains all have to be making some social statement in the movies? There was the Joker who had to make a statement of protest for being disfigured by a double crosser so he goes around disfiguring others, or like Catwoman who manages to circumvent the glass ceiling (and her ineptitude in the boardroom) by climbing up the outside of the building.As it is we have had to suspend our disbelief quite a bit. Does it need to be taxed further by these dumb devices that make Batman seem so out of touch with reality, so ineffective, so hapless and semi-helpless? As to the things we have to overlook in Batman there's Alfred, for one. He is valet, butler, chef, financial manager ("Uh Alfred, give what's-his-face here an endowment"). When does the man sleep?? Wayne manor is so vast that if they wanted to build Buckingham Palace next door the people would say, "There goes the neighborhood." Yet we are supposed to believe that Alfred runs everything and does all the upkeep. There are no other servants visible. I guess we can't have a maid dusting and stumbling across the secret passage to the bat cave. Same with the gardener. And then there is all the construction that had to take place to build the huge bat cave with all its state-of-the-art equipment. Then there is the city's police force. Imagine a police chief so humble and so without arrogance that he admits it when he is over his head and in need of the talents of our super hero. Now that IS fiction.Or how about Catwoman and how she survived a fall from the top floor of a skyscraper with only her attitude damaged?Even as a kid I had a hard time imagining how nobody could have the sense to link Bruce and his ward with Batman and the boy wonder. I did manage to overlook this difficulty, though. So the original concept did tax one's ability to overlook the flaws, no question about it. But the movie version seems to go out of its way to highlight the flaws rather than gloss over them.Is it my imagination or did the movie try to apologize for the wealthy Bruce by trying to make him seem like a regular guy? Is that why they made it look like --though he lives in this huge mansion and is super rich-- he had never heard of vichyssoise before in his life until we happened to come along and catch him eating his first bowl of it?Batman, like Superman and Spiderman, is a fictional character. For the movies in the series to treat him like he was a real person and a case for some shrink's couch makes me wonder about whoever came up with the concept for this screenplay. What could they have been thinking? Obviously not about a faithful rendition of the character, who could have been portrayed as quite interesting and multi-faceted without all the angst thrown in, had they just known how.It's fiction, folks, and entertainment mixed with escapism. It shouldn't have degenerated into a practice ground for neurotic amateur shrinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burton tries to give a new launch to Batman's theater career by adding to the comic-book aesthetics the one he found in his youth in Italian and English horror movies. A very good idea : by making Batman some kind of a modern Christopher Lee, he avoids the trap of being too close to the comic-book, which makes the 1960's movie and TV-series a little hard to watch today without laughing. But still something in the movie doesn't work (Michael Keaton, maybe, but I'm not sure he's the only one to blame) and the second Burton-Batman movie will be by far better (a masterpiece, to speak frankly). Well, at least this one proved that Batman could exist on screen without being ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Batman" stars Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as the villain, Joker. The story mainly focuses on The Joker, who is driven insane when he is pushed into a vat of acid by Batman. The Joker is deformed (given a permanent smile) so he decides to strike back at Batman, by poisoning the city. Like I said, Nicholson is the main character, and Keaton comes off as a supporting one.Another down about "Batman" is that Kim Basinger plays Keaton's love interest, a reporter. Basinger has little real relevance to the plot, well, except for the unnecessary romance. Also, there was too much Prince! The Joker danced to Prince music!Aside from Nicholson's overly large role, Basinger and Prince music, "Batman" is a good movie. It's dark and creepy (thanks to Director Tim Burton) and the acting and action is well done. Particularly, Michael Gough does a fine job as Batman's butler, Alfred Pennyworth."Batman" impresses, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read all the complaints about Tim Burton's view of 'Batman' and I understand where those fans of the Kane comic hero are coming from...but...it is not wise to fall into the trap of odious comparisons. A great creation, and Kane's Batman IS a great creation of the comic book genre, is able to withstand a multitude of interpretations and re-creations as time goes by. It is the same with great music and plays. It is always difficult to detach ourselves from that First Time and we always compare subsequent experiences of a beloved character, book, opera,what-have-you with that first time and the later experiences usually suffer in our estimation.I was a comic book reader back in the 50s, I remember Batman, I rememberAdam West on tv. Though I grew up and left comics behind I remember thoseyouthful diversions fondly.I happen to disagree with one reviewer who considers Tim Burton the "mostover-rated director" before us today. I think he is brilliant and sometimes he falls down, but never as badly as many of the more highly-vaunted "auteurs" likeScorcese and others who have laid some whoppers in their day in the midst oftheir finer works.I was very dubious about Michael Keaton being cast in this role of a "superhero" but my doubts were banished within the first 10 minutes of this movie. Keaton's got a fantastic chin and grin that look really hot and masculine under that mask and his Bruce Wayne is extremely believeable. Keaton's our verybest actor, I think, at least in Hollywood. I had to remind myself that this actor playing Batman, a role requiring him to project nerdiness and sexiness backand forth, is also the same actor who stunned people with his manic turn asBeetlejuice, another fine Tim Burton production.Burton has a knack for attracting the very finest Hollywood actors into hisproductions and though 'Batman' sports fewer big names, as compared to, say,'Mars Attacks' (my favorite Burton movie to date), he provides people like Jack Nicholson and Jack Palance fine roles for movie posterity.Nicholson IS The Joker and he steals the show. It is a two-man show really,with Nicholson and Keaton playing off each other with a subtle and highlycomedic undertow dragging the audience along. The movie is riveting becauseof these two great actors together and I didn't not drift off once, as is usually the case with Hollywood flicks.Kim Basinger is beautiful but she's also boring and has never developed intothe kind of actress that many thought she would. But she is not bad either. Her character is simply a widget to shift the gears of the plot, nothing more. She and Keaton have no electricity at all between them. The costume designer didwonders with Basinger's wardrobe and she looks great in everything she wears. A real fashion show, if not an acting show on her part.My suggestion to those who are not happy with Tim Burton's view of 'Batman' is to try and see it from Burton's strange and haunting point of view. In all of his films there is a sweat sadness that pervades the atmosphere which is mostsuccessful when you least expect such a soft tone to what seems to be a hard- edged or violent storyline. 'Batman Returns' (see review) is a wonderfulexample of this pathos that emerges suddenly after flowing quietly under theentire movie. The last 5 minutes are moving, only deeply so, but then, I love cats. Whereas the consciously "pathetic" moments in films like 'EdwardScissorhands' and 'Sleepy Hollow' ring hollow because they seem morecontrived, and both of those movies are not Burton's most inspired anyway, and it shows.But this 'Batman' is very good cinematic entertainment, that is the operative word "Entertainment". Burton entertains like no one else working in Hollywood now. And he never uses soft pornography, lewd language or excessive gut-churningviolence to hold one's attention. Any Burton-esque gore is always hilarious and never sickening and I'm grateful to him for that.It's probably a good thing that he bowed out of the last two sequels after 'Batman Returns'. He knows when something has run its course. He's a smart director as well as a tremendously creative one.For sheer entertainment and cinematic dazzle, plus wonderfully charismaticperformances from Nicholson and Keaton, I give Tim Burton's 'Batman' 9 starts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's 1989 take on the Batman character has a gothic, brooding character to it that, at its best, is hard to resist. Unfortunately, the film itself is rather tame, with a story that never seems to really get going. Part of the problem is that Batman himself isn't terribly interesting: he's played by Michael Keaton as a slightly neurotic, awkward playboy, who spends most of his time brooding. Sure, he has tons of neat gadgets, and we all know about the terrific car, but they aren't enough to make the character enticing. He's vastly overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's Joker, who, in a furor of over-acting, manages to steal nearly every key scene in the movie. As Batman's nemesis Nicholson is at times captivating and at other times horribly annoying; every time I watch the scene in which he runs rampant through a Gotham City art museum (to a soundtrack by Prince no less), I find myself wishing I could magically re-edit the movie, cutting out some Joker bits and giving Batman some more interesting things to do.I suppose it's worth mentioning the Gotham City populace as well. I recently re-watched Richard Donner's Superman and I was struck by how much the animated population of Metropolis augmented the hero's exploits in that film. During the action sequences, they react to Superman's feats, gasping, commenting and generally acting as real people in their positions probably would. They're our surrogates inside of the film; we can identify with their reactions and giggle at their disbelief, and this adds to our enjoyment of the movie because it increases our participation in it. Burton's Gotham populace, on the other hand, is virtually faceless. We're told they're being poisoned, and a small group is shown being gassed in one scene, but since we never identify with them it's hard to feel anything. On the contrary, the entire film plays out as a game of showmanship between Batman and the Joker, in which each particpant tries to outdo his opponent in the areas of spectacle, gadgets and outrageous behavior. There is little room for the common man among Burton's larger-than-life freaks.There are several action sequences sprinkled throughout the film, all of which have their "cool" moments of setting or atmosphere, but none of which builds momentum in the action department. In fact, most of the chase scenes in Batman feel stilted, or worse, never build on their initial promise. The perfect example of this occurs during the finale, in which Batman entices the audience by trotting out his coolest gadget yet, a wonderfully designed, ultra high-tech Batjet, outfitted with all sorts of neat weaponry and sighting devices. Alas, the thing immediately gets shot down by a bullet from a hand gun. Sigh.Without question, the real stars of Batman are the set design and the Danny Elfman score-- I dare say they're what most people recall first when they think of this film. Although at times the Gotham City sets look a little too stagey for my tastes, their dark, brooding character helps to set an interesting tone. As for the score, I suppose it's safe to call it a quasi-classic at this point; 12 years after the film's release it's immediately recognizable and can probably be hummed from memory by most ardent movie fans. Overall, while I recommend Batman as a fun movie and I believe it has some good things going for it, I definitely don't think it's the classic some others believe it to be.It should also be mentioned that this installment of the Batman series (perhaps along with Batman Returns, which has its own weird pleasures) is far superior to the two Joel Schumacher editions, both of which I find unbearable. Dark, boring Batman is better than neon, campy Batman.6.5/10</fullReview>

These two major inconsistencies will make any true Batman fan immediately leave the theaters.The visuals are OK, though. But the dialogue is lousy.

Later, after I grew up, I saw the show again and loved the comedy around it, but ALWAYS it was fun, on both levels. Tim Burton's Batman is fun on no level. At moments it's way too violent to be fun, at others it's way too boring to be fun. Perhaps this version is what Bob Kane intended it to be, but as a fan, I don't like it at all, and yet it's still better than any of the sequels. For fun, just watch the old TV show, at least you can laugh, have a good time, check out all those cool props(Even the TV show Batmobile is far superior than this tank!) As for this movie, if you like a movie where you'll have to squint to see what's going on, and characters so drole you'll find yourself yawning...Give it a look. Oh and one more thing, Tim Burton was the wrong man to have been given the job of directing these movies. He likes to deal with freaks, and as a result focuses more on the characters around Batman, more than the caped crusader himself. Maybe he should've called this movie "The Joker".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently re-watched this film after many years. It is better than i remembered--but still a disappointment.First there is the casting. Keaton does an okay job--but he does not have the physical presence to carry a larger than life character like Bruce Wayne(or Batman). He looks ridiculous in the costume. One scene of Batman running with Vicki Vale looks absolutely stupid. At least Kilmer and Clooney had the height to make the costume look halfway decent. Burton has said that he could not imagine a man who was 6 foot 2 dressed like a bat, when a ski mask would suffice to scare criminals. Good point--except this is a movie--not real life. And does he think it is more believeable that a man can fall into a vat of chemicals and come out looking like a clown? Or fall from a zillion story building and not go splat on the concrete?Second, Nicholson was miscast. He treated the role like a joke-(no pun intended). I wish more people who enjoy the Batman comics would take a look at a picture of Conrad Veidt from the Man Who Laughs(from 1928). This IS the Joker. Kane even mentioned that the character of the Joker came from seeing a still from this film. Veidt had the appearance, and the voice to capture the Joker as he first appeared way back in the early 40's. A clownish looking man--who was deadly serious--not a buffoon(as Romero, Nicholson, and even Mark Hamil has portrayed him). If only they could have found an actor who was similar in appearance and manner to Veidt.Third--the script. Lets face it--even though the casting wasnt great--they were workable--if they had a good screenplay and director--but the script is terrible--and the blame lies with the screenwriters and Burton.I will give high marks to Elfman's score. He did a great job. But that is all I can really say in praise of this film. I think the best treatment of Batman has got to be the cartoons from the early 90's. They treated the characters with respect. Perhaps comic book characters can never translate well to the screen in live action--but Superman's costume was even more ridiculous than Batman's--and he got a better film treatment back in 78.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Batman by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest Batman of all time. The acting is great, especially Jack Nicholson (Joker) and Michael Keaton (Bruce Wayne/Batman). Speaking of Keaton, he is the best guy to play Batman ever. The story is excellent and there is lots of action, Nicholson of course provides the humor. Tim Burton does a great job in the way Batman is supposed to be. He is not the bright, smiling character Superman is. He is dark and mysterious and that suits him. See it whenever you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited in 1989 when this flick came out; my best friend and I donned our brand new Batman shirts and went to see the picture. There was a good buzz about the film. Naturally we thought we were going to see the REAL Batman from the comics, not some goofy jokefest as in the 60's TV show (although, I admit, I enjoy the campy fun of that series, but it's NOT Batman).I can't tell you how disappointed we were with Tim Burton's film! Yeah, the costumes, sets, cast and cinematography were great (hence my 4/10 rating), but the story was unrealistic, goofy and, worst of all, dull; in other words, it siphoned! Tim Burton is outstanding with visuals, but he didn't take the Batman legend seriously and, most importantly, he failed to incorporate an interesting story. What good is a BORING film that looks great and doesn't take its subject seriously? This is a quintessential example of style over substance.Most of the high ratings of this film are from people who saw it when they were kids and they're just nostalgic. If they viewed the film objectively as an adult, with respect to the true Batman of the comics, they'd have to admit that it's not a good interpretation.Oh, I suppose it could be enjoyed on some level as a sort of an ALTERNATIVE Batman; a friend of mine who's in the comic business said this was the only way he could enjoy it. But if you want to see a serious Batman flick, true to the legend of the Dark Knight, catch "Batman Begins" and its sequels, they blow this overrated soporific movie out of the water.

		<shortDescription>Best of the Batman movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman was a new direction for superhero movies. Superman had a mature feel that was lacking in say the 60's Batman TV show and the serials of the 1940's but still had an innocent charm. Tim Burtons Batman at the time was dark and adult and ushered in the more serious take on superheros, popularised with the X Men and Spiderman films in the late 2000's. Batman however is more than just the beginning of a cultural phenomenon but an excellent movie to boot with a good cast, solid story, great set pieces and the best visual design of any comic book movie. First as usual the acting. Jack Nicholsons scene stealing performance of the Jokers remains my personal favourite. He handles the dark humour very well, with a particular highlights being the scene where he is coming out of surgery and when talking to the burnt corpse of one of his victims. These are classic Joker scenes that both creep the audience out while amusing them at the same time. The best scene however is the TV commercial which is so surreal its hilarious and Nicholson owns the role, even under his pretty cool make up. Michael Keatons casting had fanboys up in arms but fortunately they made the right choice in his casting. He remains the best live action batman, able to come across as tortured but not overdoing it. He also is menacing as Batman. You get the sense he is at times as mad as the villain hes fighting and thats a good thing-Batman is already a concept only a madman would dream up. The supporting cast is pretty good. Kim Basinger while a damsel in distress is a good enough actress to still give her character some personality. Both Michael Gough and Robert Wuhl are very likable as Alfred and Knox respectively while Jack Palance and Billy Dee Williams are decent in his their role of crime boss Grissom and DA Harvey Dent (Am I the only one who wanted to see Billy Dee Williams in a sequel?). Tracy Walker is also memorable as Bob the Goon who is a good sidekick to the Joker. The role of Commissioner Gordan in this isn't very well written although Pat Hingle tries his best. The batmoblie, Batwing and Batsuit have never looked better. Compared with the chrome and flashy lights of Schmarcher and the super gritty military style of Nolans this is sleek, cool looking and faithful to the comics. The look of Gotham was done by Anton Furst who rightfully won an Oscar for his work-the Art Deco buildings, the surreal designs and the '30's clothing all fit in perfectly with the Batman aesthetic. Its clearly a comic book world and the film benefits all the more for it. Gotham has its own identity to it which makes the film all the more unique. Danny Elfmans score is not only the best of his career but also one of the best film scores ever, Every tune is memorable with Batmans and the Jokers themes being particular highlights. Tim Burton is a surprisingly serviceable action director. On their own the action is OK but Elfmans score makes it seem more impressive. The Batwing scene is the best in the movie along with the Axis chemical firefight and the confrontation at the Cathedral. The story echoes film noir and is very well told and paced. The themes of revenge are present but are not hammered in your face like the Nolan movies which in my opinion gives this film the edge-its more subtle in its delivery. While the story is far fetched the film builds a world where it doesn't matter. The Jokers plan is crazy, but so is the Joker. I like how this isn't an origin story but we still have some backstory. Many comic book stories often have the main character becoming their alter ego in the middle or at the end but here hes Batman from the start. I think overall I prefer this approach. Although the film maybe to heavily focuses on Joker I do think they develop Batman with his romance with Vicki Vale being decent enough. There's some humour here contrasty of Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton. The only problem is the out of place and very dated Prince songs. While their not awful they could have easily been cut out. In recent years this films has had a negative backlash, probably from Nolan Bat-fans. I first saw this film after viewing the Dark Knight and would say to ignore them. Instead enter a comic book world of violence, romance, dark humour, revenge and action. Batman has aged well and continues to be not only the best Batman film but the best comic book film out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a very boring movie. I almost fell asleep watching it. I kept telling myself the action and exciting part will come but it never really did. Heath Ledger did a way better job of playing the joker his performance was more alive and kept me interested. Jack Nicholson did an OK job but was not nearly as exciting as Heath's was. Michael Keaton is a pretty good actor but they could of gotten a better actor for the job. When I picture batman I see a big strong tough looking guy that looks like he can fight. Keaton just did not fill that description. I did give it a 5 because I do realize it was mad much before all the technology was to make the dark knight. It is the second best Batman movie if you count the dark knight trilogy as a whole. In conclusion if nothing else is on you can watch it but if you want a good batman movie try all three of the dark night trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman- 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest here: the original Batman directed by Tim Burton is simply not that engaging of a film. It's one of those films that you really want to like, and that you admire many of the decisions it makes. At the end of the day, however, it never really adds up to much. The movie opens promisingly; the opening shots of Gotham City convey the absolutely impeccable production design and the dark and ominous tone. It truly feels as though it's going to be a great film, but once the plot begins to set in, you realize that most of this admiration is based primarily on its surface qualities. There simply isn't a truly engaging story to feel attached to; the movie is almost entirely based around a simple battle of good versus evil, with Batman pitted up against his archenemy, the Joker. Aside from some promising revelations that never seem to add up to much, that's about it. Compare this with something like The Dark Knight, where the Joker wants to cause total chaos and anarchy in Gotham by breaking the city's spirits. He corrupts and even kills loved ones. Here, he only wants to take over the city. The stakes never feel real, and much of this is due to the characterization of Batman/Bruce Wayne. It's understandable that they tried to make his character more introverted than, say, Christian Bale's depiction of the character, but that doesn't really work here. Yes, the character is similar in that sense in the comics, but film is an entirely different medium; Bruce Wayne seems too mysterious here, and so it's difficult to connect with him and to care about him. His character is clearly overshadowed by his archenemy. Speaking of the Joker, Jack Nicholson does an admirable job with what he's given, but something about the character feels... off. Before the incident that turns him into the white-skinned psychopath, he comes across as a suitably intimidating and ruthless threat. After that incident, he seems almost too comical. Sure, he's the definite villain, but he never really seems to embody the idea of true evil; it's tough to take him seriously when he's dancing to Prince songs. And this is honestly a problem that can be applied to most of the movie- it doesn't seem to really know what it wants to be. The film is dark and mysterious at various points, while relatively light-hearted and campy at others. It's like they tried to blend the styles of the Nolan version of the character and the Adam West version, and it doesn't work. In addition, with many of the plot revelation towards the end, Burton doesn't seem to know what to do with them. Batman claims he's on a quest for revenge, and even though we hear that, we never really see it. This review probably makes it seem like I hated the movie. I didn't. I admire it in many ways, along with what it attempted to do. In addition, I feel as though seeing the Nolan films first had already established what the story supposed to be in my head. That said, I still can't say that the film works. It simply never feels as engaging as a Batman story should be.Overall Rating: 5/10- "I Have to Say "Meh"."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ages poorly yet remains a fan favorite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the new "Bat craze" that has re-emerged amongst the pop culture crowd thanks to Christopher Nolan's epic retelling of The Dark Knight legacy, many fans have found reason to return to nostalgic roots and see the film that started it all, including a resurrection of the superhero genre which seemingly died with the appalling Superman IV. This landmark film was Tim Burton's Batman, with Michael Keaton as the troubled Bruce Wayne masquerading as the mysterious crime-fighter and Jack Nicholson as the iconic mad villain Joker. Regrettably, very little holds up well.The first major problem with this film is that the tone is all over the place. In several scenes it is almost impossible to understand what the filmmakers are trying to get across to the audience. Is it supposed to be scary, intimidating, funny or amazing? Another major problem is the casting and characterization of much of the supporting cast. Two small characters in particular, crooked cop Eckhardt and tireless reporter Alexander Knox, come across as so pointless and obnoxious that after awhile you wish they would just be killed off so we could focus on the real characters, specifically Bruce, Joker and the beautiful Vicki Vale.This brings us to another major problem: the screenplay. The plot is less than memorable, consisting mainly of jumbled story-lines thrown together without creating a coherent overall arc. At some points in the film, you may wonder if the editing was done incorrectly as the film swings from one emotion to another. I still feel woozy from the experience. The final major problem I will bring up is the characterization of some of the key characters. The entire Gotham Police Dept. is so incredibly inept in this film it is a wonder how more Jokers do not pop up. Unlike Gary Oldman's hard-working but exhausted Gordon, this one is simply a foil to laugh at until Batman arrives to save the day.In short, this is very far from being the best Batman film, much less a great film at all. The tone could best be described as "campy noir," a term I read in another review which I think sums it up best. The look and feel of the sets are fantastic; there is a real neo-noir atmosphere to Gotham City's physical attributes. However, there are countless problems with its most important inhabitants. Jack Palance is the most timid and unconvincing mobster I have ever seen, Keaton's Bruce Wayne is more boring than complex and brooding, Nicholson's Joker is funny but not menacing, and Kim Basinger is beautiful as Vicki Vale but still just a caricature for Batman and Joker to fight over. Essentially, this film is closer to the 1960s Adam West series than anything else. It is far superior to the amoral garbage Joel Schumacher was able to conjure up but in comparison to Nolan's "realistic" look, it is dumb, vapid and kind of silly. It remains a fan favorite I suppose for its stylish look and Keaton's strong Batman screen presence but certainly not for its plot, characterization or tone. Take your pick, but mine remains with Christopher Nolan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love this movie, but it has its flaws. The plot for me seems a little stupid, but picks itself up by the end, but honestly it's not enough to make it a ten.Also, Kim Bassinger is annoying. Sure she's cute, but she is very annoying. I did not like her character. She was annoying I also hated Alicia. Her purpose in the movie was just to Make Grissom mad. Everything else she was involved in was pointless.I'm giving it an 8 because it is incredibly entertaining. Every time I watch it(and that's a lot) I still get surprised by how entertaining it is.And the performances by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson is excellent. Jack Nicholson didn't play the role of the joker as well Heath Ledger but still great. As for Keaton, he is the best live action Batman. The best Batman is Kevin Conroy, voice of Batman on the animated series.Overall, it is entertaining, funny, and a few memorable performances</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually interesting, but a nonsensical mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I say that Tim Burton's quirky neo-noir Batman is not a good movie, it does not mean that I don't enjoy it. Despite Burton's lack of anything that even approaches depth of character or plot coherence (something that plagues all of his films to various degrees, with only a couple of notable exceptions), Batman is a visual triumph that saturates the screen with haunting images and lurid, colorful tableaux played out against a gloomy German expressionistic background and to an astounding Danny Elfman score.It has been argued that Burton's take on the Dark Knight was the first to take the source material really seriously, but unfortunately, the exact opposite is true. Like 1966's Batman: The Movie, Tim Burton's Batman revels in the absurdity of the characters and their situations, but unlike the ultra-hip tongue-in-cheek Adam West campfest, this film is not dedicated to "crimefighters the world over and to lovers of the ridiculous, lovers of the bizarre and fun lovers everywhere", but seems instead dedicated to the freaks, the wierdos, the neurotic and the emotionally stunted. It is telling that the Joker is allowed to caper on screen far more than Batman is allowed to fight crime - and given the lack of personality that Michael Keaton brings to his character, it's a small wonder that Jack Nicholson dominates this film. Ostensibly, he's the villain of the piece, but I tend to suspect that Burton sees him more as the underdog hero, the only truly free soul in the dark, steamy, oppressive, monolithic Gotham City. For all the Joker's murder and mayhem, he is a decidedly non-threatening bad-guy, certainly much more interesting than the titular hero, a streak of color and manic energy careening through otherwise grey and muted film-noiresque world. In Burton's world, Batman is the conformist who blends in; the Joker is the rebel misfit. And so it plays out like any other dime-a-dozen overly-emotional oh-so-tragic adolescent romance movie, with the popular rich kid, the misfit outsider, and the blonde cheerleader type they're both trying to win. This isn't a superhero adventure -- it's a John Hughes movie for the geeky Emo set.Given the comic book origins of the material, we can almost forgive some of the more gaping plot holes and glaring logical inconsistencies -- after all, a comic-book film doesn't really have to make sense to be enjoyable -- but the sketchy and insubstantial characters that populate the story are unforgivable, especially given the rich material from which the film was drawn. And even though Michael Keaton's blandness actually works well within the context of his character, Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale is an absolute disaster -- who ever heard of a war correspondent who shreiks and screams and faints as much as she does? Basinger's performance is far and away the worst of the bunch, but the film is otherwise extremely well-cast, with exceptional character actors like Pat Hingle and Michael Gough and dynamic stars like Jack Palance and Billy Dee Williams giving the illusion of depth to cardboard cut-out characters who watch from the sidelines as the hero and the other hero fight over the girl.Far from being the masterpiece of the genre that it is hailed to be, Batman is actually a clunky and uneven mess. As a superhero adventure story, it doesn't even come close to Sam Raimi's Darkman; as a Batman film, it pales in comparison to Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. Even the animated series that would follow in the wake of the Burton Batman hysteria is better, and it should give one pause to reflect when a half-hour cartoon can be more emotionally resonant than a feature-length film. But this film did pave the way for better written, better casted, better acted and better directed superhero films to follow. It is the ultimate triumph of style over substance, but it is a dazzling style, and after all is said and done, a fun and entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people have already seen the film and it is no surprise that it made over 200 million dollars in box office. And this was in the 80's which is unheard of.Tim Burton was hired on after Warner Brothers originally wanted the Cohan Brothers to direct. Talk of who will be Batman and Joker was going around. Jack Nicholson (Joker) originally said no, but when WB said that they might sign Robin Williams, leaving Jack to make a decision, in which he said yes. (*Side note, Robin Williams wasn't too happy about using his name to sign Jack). Then Burton got Michael Keaton (Beatlejuice) as Bruce Wayne.The movie is set in a dark, almost film noir, with a 1940/present setting. A metropolis city filled with gangs and crimes. That's where we meet Batman, a crime fighter that dresses up like a bat to strike fear into the most dangerous criminals. We then realize the man behind the mask is Bruce WAYNE, a billionaire who does it for justice. Rumors and word goes around about the news of Batman, weather he is good or bad. Jack Napier, is framed by his crime boss in a chemical factory, turns into the Joker. That's when BATMAN must face Joker.Burton's vision is dark and dramatic, something never seen in film history about a comic book. The movie is the best comic book movie out there.Unfortunately, all good things come to an end. Burton's sequel "Batman Returns" was good, but not near the original, thats when Warner Brothers gave it to another director who ruined the franchise. Then in 2005, Christopher Nolan tried a fresh new look of the franchise, that was good in story, but visually disappointing. Nothing will ever come close to the Original "BATMAN" from 1989.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but over-hyped superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I think nostalgia of the first time seeing a dark interpretation of Batman on the big screen has over-hyped this film a tad bit. Burton created a decent adaption of Batman in a time where Adam West's campy series was all that the general public knew. Burton should be applauded for his effort. His Gotham City was interesting, the Danny Elfman score is legendary in film-making history (Although I'll never understand why Prince music is anywhere in this film). Jack Nicholson gave a good performance as the Joker, he's truly a great actor. While Batman is a good fun, the movie has several problems. The plot and the script is a mess and almost missing. The director utilizes too many clichés and convenient plot devices to propell a rather a dull story. There is no exploration into Batman's motivation and character development here is really lacking. Some have excused it away as Burton wanted to Batman to be "mysterious." Whatever. This is usually just called bad character development. It's obvious Burton is not fully sure where to carry this character and decides to give him offbeat eccentric behavior to make up for it. Keaton's Bruce Wayne never grows and you never connect with him. The other characters besides the Joker are one-dimensional and forgettable. Basinger gives a less-than-decent portrayal as Vicki Vale, but she's really just eye candy in this Lois Lane rip-off role. Vale is a damsel in distress throughout the entire movie and has no real purpose, presence, or meaning in the movie. Her chemistry with Keaton is rather forced and its clear her purpose is just a mandated Warner Brothers "love interest" that is required in every superhero movie.Keatons gives a solid performance as Batman (as opposed to his dull and foppish Bruce) although I wasn't too impressed with his portrayal of Batman as a wreckless stoic James Bondish killer whose methods isn't all that different from the villains he fights. However, the movie is more about the Joker, giving his origin more focus than Batman's. After he's introduced, coincidence after coincidence after plot device occurs clicheingly tying the villain to the hero. The Joker is responsible for Batman and 30 years later Batman is responsible for the Joker. Small world. Then, the Joker is interested in Bruce's love interest for some reason. Then Batman figures out who the Joker really is through another lame plot device. The other characters are ignored while Nicholson (a great actor) takes all the spotlight. Batman is reduced to a distant man wanting violent revenge as opposed to a mythological crime fighter. What Batman gains from this whole ordeal isn't clear to anyone. However, once the score plays, the film is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong Batman - Right Joker - Not enough Palance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing that there are people out there that think this version sucks. It does have problems, but the look and feel are right on the mark.Now, I have been a Batman fan since the 1950s and was very disappointed with the 60s TV series basically making a mockery of the Batman story. I remember vividly the ad campaign put out by ABC TV to promote the first mid-season replacement series. They used the tease of never showing what Batman looked like except in dark shots where his face was not clearly visible so I naturally thought there would be a dark knight that Bob Kane had intended originally. I had to wait until 89 for Tim Burton to do that.But I still think that Michael Keaton was all wrong to play this hero. As Bruce Wayne he was somewhat believable but not physically right for the caped crusader. Nicholson's Joker was magnificent. but hey, it's Jack Nicholson. Of course he would be great. Personally it would have been really cool IMHO if Jack had played an older Batman and Keaton not long after his Beetlejuice role as a great Joker. But Burton and the studio didn't see it that way.Now there is this guy named Robert Wuhl with whom I have had personal dealings. He is cast (wrongly) as a sympathetic character (He isn't.

For you unititated, non-film buffs, this is the name of an Academy Award nominated actor who starred as President Wilson in a movie simply titled "Wilson." I never did find out if this was some kind of in -joke.Jack Palance is such a great fun actor and he is wasted in a role as a criminal who is killed off much too early in the film by Jack's Joker, which makes me wonder how much fun HE would have been as the Joker.Anyway, my personal favorite Batman actor (now I have not seen the latest Batman film, mind you) is Val Kilmer, but there are those who vehemently disagree with me. Oh well. Such is life.Now will someone tell me why Two Face changed race and nobody noticed? Is he somehow related to Catwoman? (That's an Eartha Kitt joke. See, in the ABC TV series.. oh never mind.

		<shortDescription>Dark and Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has successfully managed to recreate the original Batman comic books, and has tried to be authentic in his approach. To see Gotham city recreated on the big screen is great, i'm sure it fits in with everyone's idea of Gotham city; dark and Gothic, like it should be.The casting was also inspired, Michael Keaton brings a slight element of lunacy to the batman character (lets face it Batman can't be playing with a full deck) and Keaton convinces you that he is slightly mad and has suffered a troubled past.As for the Joker (Jack Nicholson) i defy anyone to top his performance, he is the Joker, he breathed life into a comic book badguy and played the role with exactly the right amount of madness to capture the imagination of every Batman fanatic.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHEN WILL SHE STOP SCREAMING?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a comic book fan, nor am I a "Batman" fan. But unfortunately enough, my brother is... and he just had to get this from our local library. Having seen this before and being rather neutral to it, I wasn't expecting much whenever I happened to be in the room when he watched this.The story is simple, and also simply stupid, which is #1 on Things I Hate About Batman (TIHAB, if you're acronym-ish). Maybe it's just me, but when you knock almost everyone out at a museum, it makes more sense to actually steal the paintings than to deface them. The Joker doesn't realize this, apparently, so he throws paints onto them. Even if he thinks he's improving art, well, even I know that flat, 2D colors don't enhance things.Also, rather than actually bothering to get better plastic surgery done on his face, the Joker decides to go and just put makeup on. If he's such a good criminal, why doesn't he do that after a while? Duh.#2 on TIHAB is the worst part of the film: Kim Basinger's character. I know, Batman &amp; the Joker need a love interest, but couldn't they have her progressively get quieter? You'd think she'd get used to all this anarchy around her, but no. She screams throughout the whole film, and I can just picture other events with her character: "AHHH! A fly is on my monitor!" "AHHH! I heard a noise!" "AHHH! This pencil is sharp!"Since I can't think of anything else to bash on about this film, I'll just stop with this quote from the film:AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHH H!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --Kim Basinger's character (repeated line).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very weak film saved by Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is very much a product of its time. It has "made in the 80s" written all over it, with Keaton's big mullet, the music and acting styles. My main issue is the complete lack of explanation for anything. I don't see the appeal of hero/superhero films with no back story. Close to the end we find out Wayne's parents were murdered and that's why he's a bit screwed up, but that's the entire story we get to work with. Why is he dressed as a bat? Why did he become a vigilante? Who makes those toys and vehicles? And Michael Keaton just cannot pull off the role. He is passable as Bruce Wayne, nothing special but he'll do. But as soon as he puts on the suit he suddenly starts walking like some sort of robot. The concepts of style, finesse, flair and cool seem to have completely passed him by. He's just not convincing as a tough hero guy, he looks so awkward in doing anything at all.It just seems to try and be 'cool' for the sake of it. The new Batmobile thing is a military tank spray-painted black with an afterburner to jump gaps. It was designed for a purpose and has a practical use. The Batmobile here, however, looks like some sort of space shuttle with an afterburner that doesn't appear to go particularly fast. It just looks ridiculous. Where did he get it? Does the manufacturer not have suspicions about Batman's identity when he realises he not so long ago was asked to build a rocket car with a bat wing on the roof? As for the Batwing thing, there are no words to describe how terrible that is. It just appears from nowhere, with no explanation, and doesn't look like it could physically get off the ground in that shape. The brief scene where the Batwing popped up above the clouds and lined up with the moon to make the symbol made me want to bang my head on something.And as a side note, why does Batman only appear to be able to glide at a perfectly vertical angle? The opening scene where he lowers onto the rooftops where the guys are counting the money, and then spreads his wings when they turn around and again after he gets shot, is just cringeworthy.Thank god for Nicholson then, the saving grace. His exceptionally manic performance as the Joker is superb, genuinely believable, despite it's ludicrous extremism. Michael Gough and Robert Wuhl also put in fairly decent performances that stand out above the rest.Whilst the direction is good for the most part, and I admire the extremely Gothic art direction Burton has gone for, I can't help but feel Gotham is a bit unconvincing. I know it's a big city, as well as an island, but during those far out landscape shots everything seems so over the top and the city so isolated that it feels less like a sprawling metropolis and more like an over-sized Disneyland with no source of light.And all this is a great shame, because it could have been very good. Had they at least attempted to put in an explanation to anything, got another actor who actually knew how to walk like a human when in the suit and got rid of that spaceship thing then it would probably get another 3 or 4 stars on this review. Perhaps if they had renamed it The Joker (featuring Batman) then it wouldn't have been so bitterly disappointing.</fullReview>

Box-office blockbuster with interesting elements: moody Keaton as Bruce Wayne the billionaire with an identity crisis dilemma as The Dark Knight facing his greatest enemy The Joker (inspired casting coup Nicholson over the top gleefully so) and his greatest challenge: avenging the deaths of his parents. Plot aside the visuals are the real stars with some impressive Gothic Oscar winning Art Direction by Anton Furst, ominous sets by Bo Welch and Danny Elfman's baroque musical score and dark direction by Tim Burton. Bitchin' Batmobile! Best line: "This town needs an enema!" by Joker Jack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the intent of this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was it comedy? It sure looked and sounded like it was attempting to be at times, but I never laughed, and I can laugh pretty easily when a movie is funny, even if that's unintended. Was it drama? I gained no sympathy for, or familiarity with any character. They were dull, meaningless and such unreal people. Was it horror? The special effects were impressive, but I felt no fear, nothing at all. And I mean NOTHING AT ALL!!! There was not one element of this movie that dragged me in. Kind of like just a boring commercial that's easy to forget. There were some good, seasoned actors in this movie, who I've enjoyed many times in other productions. I'm not even sure if saying 'miscast' is the right way for me to express my disgust. There was no script for them. Keaton is good for comedy and even drama at times, but he's no batman. Jack looks like The Shining repeated, in a boring way. Kim is like the cute girl that most guys with brains wouldn't want to be around. She looks like an irritation. I liked the old TV show, which is slapstick. And, I know that the comic books are more serious, which I don't mind. But this movie is DARK DARK AND DARKER. The last painful part of this movie that I'll mention is the music. It sounds like it would be good in some movies, but in this one it's just pure agony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this. It has great characters, great dialogue and not many flaws. Firstly the characters: I liked them. They were memorable, likable and well acted. Keaton is great as Batman but not so great as Bruce Wayne, Kim Basinger is good as Vicki Vale but way to like a damsel is distress but the show stealer is undoubtedly Jack Nicholson as the Joker. He is like the Golden Age version of the character: the mob boss. He is creepy, funny and crazy. Nicholson is made for the role. Is he the best Joker ever? No Heath Ledger takes that easily but Nicholson is definitely up there with Hamill and Ledger. Now to the story: it was good but not great. It isn't very memorable. It is a bit generic but still good. I don't see why Joker had to fall for Vicki Vale as it was pointless and weird. Summary What I liked: the direction, the music, the hero, the villain and the setting. What I disliked: the supporting characters, the costumes, the action and the effects. So it was a good movie for me. It wasn't the best Batman movie ever but is up there. Please remember this is all my opinion so don't get to mad at me. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton beats Chris Nolan any day of the week</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That statement in my summary could be viewed as very biased, but one should at least read what follows before judging on that. Where Tim Burton was so magical with the way he had his characters (and villains, mostly) carried out, with Danny Elfman's score (whether a fan or not, he brought that unique artistic touch in atmosphere to all those excellent 90's flicks), and the deliberately lighter, more facetious feel he'd give this first motion picture rendition of Batman... Nolan takes the mere comic-book plot of a guy who wears a latex bat suit and fights a crazy 'joker' villain, and makes it into a 3hr dark thriller with pseudo-intellectual pretension, like 'the Batman' held any sort of genuine philosophical lessons to it. It really feels from a distance that Burton would represent the seasoned, mature film savant demonstrating great distance and control over his characters and not afraid to make Batman a highly entertaining, wacky action packed ride with a little bit of symbolism; while Nolan seems the eager somewhat talented but very flawed younger flick enthusiast who takes everything literally, utterly seriously and seems to have absolutely no distance from his own works. Not to make this review a simple A vs B, but consequently it sheds some light on what this film here is. A good solid, Burton-imagined, late 80's flick with great actors, all in their own right, Keaton, Nicholson and Basinger. It's lots of fun, easy, funny, great visually, and plays out smoothly - Burton didn't need 5 hours to make "Batman" into something watchable and not completely ridiculous for the non-comic book fanatic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great start to the Batman movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is worth the two hours. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson were great choices for Batman and the Joker. The makeup on the Joker is amazing, and the costumes on Batman and the Joker are top-notch. Nicholson is creepy, twisted, and engaging, which is exactly what the Joker should be like, which strong emotion in his voice under his grin he has a majority of the movie. Keaton portrays Batman with complexity, intrigue, and commitment, drawing you to be interested in Batman. The dialogue and tone match what Batman should be like, the production is well- designed, while the fights are well-staged and the direction is solid. However, Batman doesn't focus enough on Batman. In fact, Jack Nicholson is billed first before Keaton, and it takes twenty minutes for Bruce Wayne to even introduce himself. But the movie still gives you the main information you should know about Batman, his past, and why he became a vigilante. I understand why people remember "Batman," and I would even recommend it to someone. Expect solid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film doesn't get me as thrilled as The Dark Knight. Sure this film may be really good to some Batman fans, but I'm not a huge fan of this as I am of The Dark Knight. I think Christian Bale makes a better Batman then Michael Keaton and Heath Ledger makes a better Joker then Jack Nicholson cause I don't think that Jack Nicholson fits well with the Joker and he's more Jack Torrance cause he fits well in the Shining. Also that scene where he trashes the museum while listening to Prince was really weird. I do believe that the Joker is the best villain of all time but I don't think that Jack Nicholson fits well with the character. Heath Ledger did way more better then Jack Nicholson did and he deserved the Oscar for that, even if he is dead. Also Batman doesn't kill his own enemies, cause in the Dark Knight he spares the Jokers life. After all Batman won't kill Joker out of rage and the Joker won't kill Batman cause he's too much fun for him. Now at the ending of this film Batman kills the Joker by using the Batman grappling hook and attaching his foot to a gargoyle statue on top of that building they were on when Joker was trying to make his escape in his helicopter and Joker falls to his death. Batman is not a killer. He doesn't even uses guns. Christian Bales Batman is better then Michael Keaton's Batman anyway. 3 out of 10 for this.</fullReview>

The movie hasn't aged as well as it could have. It gets kind of boring at times, and I don't feel like there was enough Batman in the movie. Michae Keaton is great as Bruce Wayne, and Jack Nicholson is awesome as The Joker. And honestly, the Joker parts were the highlights of the movie for me. I wasn't really intrigued. The Joker parts were quirky and fun, and Jack Nicholson captures the craziness and wittiness of The Joker. It was often so random and quirky that it just felt right. And the ending is rewarding and cool. It's a good movie in my opinion, and the music is marvelous, but I don't like it as much as the Cristopher Nolan movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Joker is the only good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film after Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy and I was extremely disappointed. My favorite movie is The Dark Knight so I didn't expect much of this film, but it's much worse than I thought. First of all, I say the only good thing: Jack Nicholson's performance. I'm a big Heath Ledger fan, but Nicholson is also very good. I think his character is much worse than Ledger's, but the acting is excellent. I especially hated the films visual style. In one of the first scenes, the background painting is very awful. Gotham city, the buildings and trees look like that we are in a tale or a movie that has been made for children. The Batmobil and the Wayne castle is also very ugly. So I was quite surprised, when I saw that this movie won an Oscar for best Art decoration - Set decoration. The fight scenes are very unrealistic. Especially the last scene, which made me laugh. The Joker's climbing up in the ladder was almost funny. Michael Keaton's batman voice sounds like a six year old girl's whispering compared to Christian Bale's or even Ben Affleck's. The music was also awful. Danny Elfman's music is a joke compared to Hans Zimmer's soundtrack.Tim Burton is a good director but it's probably his worst film. If you already saw The Dark Knight Trilogy or even Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice you'd better not watch this movie. If you haven't seen any of them, you can try it, but don't expect anything. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman 89 is an enjoyable surprisingly good movie and was the first dark, gritty and more realistic batman that we ever got. I bought it on Blu ray and the same day i got it i watched it to see how good it really was and i was surprised. I'm a massive batman fan, he's my favorite comic book hero and is the only reason i'm still on DC's side instead of Marvel's.Michael Keaton was the first Batman we got that opened the door to so much more like The Dark Knight because his portrayal as a darker character then we'd seen previously was great. Jack Nicholson will always be one of the best Jokers no matter how many we end up getting over the years because his portrayal is also a major addition to what later because one of the best hero's ever. I've only really heard of Vicky Vale from a few Batman comics and the Arkham game series so before i saw this movie i didn't know what to expect from Kim Basinger as i also hadn't really seen her in much, but i really liked her character and although i thought she wasn't 100% necessary to the plot i thought she was a good addition. So you can probably tell that i liked the cast of the movie but how was the story? I loved the story that they told in this movie, the classic Bruce Wayne losing his parents, how Jack became the Joker and i especially loved how they didn't feel the need to show Bruce Wayne's transformation into the Batman and it just shows him already fully developed which is the only reason i didn't absolutely love Batman Begins. Overall this movie gave us everything necessary for a good Batman movie and a set up for something much larger for DC in the future. Look at it now and the affect it and on the movie industry, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice has just come out and while it's getting mixed reviews people are still saying Batman is the best part about the movie. So i enjoyed this movie and will probably be doing reviews for all the other Batman movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a movie, a comic-band or neither?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the film adaptation of the comic-strip where Batman was born. Directed by Tim Burton (who became famous at this time thanks to this film and "Edward Scissorhands"), has Michael Keaton (in the title role) and Jack Nicholson (as the villain Joker) among others talented actors. But in this movie the actors weren't well, they simply failed to adapt to the way Tim Burton, a sui generis director, wanted the film.In fact, in this film (and in the following sequels), Tim Burton has shown that knows nothing about comics, and his love for his personal way he understands cinema is greater than his ability to adapt comic strip for cinema. Merely copying one thing to another?! A film that is comic-strip is not a movie nor a comic-book! The interpretation of the characters is too stylized, the costumes are too unrealistic, the cinematography is too dark and the absurd scenarios are worthy of an Orwellian dystopia. Everything has been thought to refer the public to the comics and strengthen the dystopian character of the city where the story takes place. Thus, as in the comics, Batman is the product of reality where he lives: a good and noble man who uses the violence to brings justice where it fails, turning perversity against the perversity he fights. Still, it's a comic-book Batman, not a cinema Batman, and the film doesn't even tries to bridge's the gap between reality and comics, something that surely would make the film more interesting.Mr. Burton, who want a comic-book buys it, who is going to the movies normally expects to see something different...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest thing that springs to mind when I think of Tim Burton's BATMAN is still that Summer back in '89 when the bat symbol graced everything as far as the eye can see. A sort of pop art marketing campaign the likes of which we haven't seen since. But as a movie, BATMAN holds up pretty well. I like Keaton's tightly-controlled madness hidden beneath awkward rich guy as Bruce Wayne, and his altering of the voice while under the cowl was an ingenious character flourish. He plays it cool, nothing overt. It's refreshing. And knowing how heavy and constricting that batsuit was, the physicality (limited though it may be) is impressive. Burton's Gotham City is a steamy nightmarish vision in the vein of BLADE RUNNER (just less neon) populated with sickly thugs. Ghastly place, but it feels very much the kind of place you'd find Nicholson's sadistic Caesar Romero. And it fits right in with Elfman's fantastic score. BATMAN ain't perfect; it runs long, the caped crusader takes a backseat to the Joker and . . . well there's that Prince soundtrack (GAH!). But it stands as a great piece of lavish big-Hollywood movie-making. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably Great Looking, Dramatically Lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest cultural phenomenon of its time, Batman has become a thing of legend. Its Batman logo with its simple black and yellow design is now so iconic nobody needs to ask what it is. I unfortunately think the film's popularity overshadows a seriously flawed movie. Tim Burton's Batman is a perfect example of production design triumphing over substance of the story and potentially great characters. The film plays out during Batman's (played by Michael Keaton) beginnings of crime busting in Gotham City, all while mob Lieutenant Jack Napier (played by Jack Nicholson) is set up by mob boss Gus Grissom to take a fall. Through the inadvertent interference of Batman, Napier is dropped into a vat of chemicals and emerges as the twisted, psychotic, silly, Prince music-loving Joker. As Joker's reign of crime continues and Batman must solve it, his alter ego Bruce Wayne must balance his double life with romance for ace reporter Vicki Vale (played by Kim Basinger)The most impressive elements of this movie is the production design by artist Anton Furst and set decorator Peter Young, and the cinematography by the amazingly bizarre Director of Photography Roger Pratt. When I think of Gotham City this is the look I think of, something that few of the following films, except for The Dark Knight, have been even able to try to aim at. The sets and look of Gotham City is truly a wonder to behold, a bizarre array of angles, black schemes and Gothic Deco accentuated by Pratt's gloriously under-lit photography during the night scenes. One can almost feel the grime and gross smell of everyone and everything in this world. The Batmobile still remains one of the greatest designs for a car ever made and blows anything out of the water.The best surprise of the movie for me in the dramatic department is Michael Keaton as Batman. Keaton is a very funny actor with great timing, but was rarely given the opportunity to anything outside the mold, in fact when Burton cast him fans were outraged that Mr. mom would play the beloved caped crusader. But thankfully, no one griped after they saw the masterwork he does here. One thing I noticed when watching is Keaton is very silent as Batman, and very reserved as Bruce Wayne. This is actually a very good approach to the role, on the opposite spectrum of what Christian Bale did as Batman in Nolan's films, which itself was a great take on the character. Keaton is able to convey the sense of loss and emptiness that Wayne feels after the terrible tragedy he's endured with one look in his face. That is impressive.The rest of this film I find to be a little dull and too silly to take seriously. Basinger doesn't have much to work with as Vale, I just find her as a pretty object for affection. The characters of Bob and Knox are enjoyable to watch so thats fine. Jack Nicholson as the Joker sounded like a really good idea, until he became the Joker. He is so silly I can't ever believe him as a villain. I actually thought he was more scary as Jack Napier than Joker. Anybody who uses Prince songs to carry out crime to is as non-threatening as a demented snail. The story is decent enough except for a few things writer Sam Hamm, who often takes the blame for it, did not do. One is making the character of Jack Napier into the man who killed the Wayne parents and into the Joker himself, who has always been nameless. He is not responsible for it, end of story. Alfred also makes the most unbelievably stupid mistake in the universe, but I can't reveal what it is. I like this movie enough to watch it if its on TV occasionally, but I wouldn't call this a must see movie. For me its kind of a bore in most spots. But like I said before, it still has an amazing and gorgeous look to it that make sit an interesting movie. Of course, i have to credit this movie for giving Batman movie life, and ultimately paving the way for Nolan's films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall the great anticipation for this film to come out, a full decade following 1978's "Superman" movie, as Batman was finally being brought to the big screen. There was a lot of controversy over the selection of Michael Keaton to portray the masked hero and a lot of anticipation to see Nicholson as The Joker. Watching today, I didn't remember anything about the story line except for the principals in their respective roles. So it wasn't exactly a film that made a lasting impression, and thinking back on things now, was probably the reason I never followed up with the sequels during their theatrical release. All just a bit too campy for my taste, and even though I didn't know what to expect in the way of a bat-suit, I'm pretty sure this wasn't it. Too big and bulky, it didn't seem like anyone could make it resemble a nimble creature like Batman's namesake. As far as Nicholson goes, he brought some of that Jack Torrance hysteria from "The Shining" to his character, so that was a plus. And holy moly, Kim Basinger was just stunning here as photographer Vicki Vale, making me wonder once again what she ever saw in Alec Baldwin to hook up with a lunatic like him. Otherwise, the story was somewhat inconsequential for me; as I say, I couldn't remember anything significant about it from the first time around. Most of the time the sets were so murky and dreary, it looked like the whole thing was filmed on one dark night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Great, Even If Overshadowed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dark Knight of Gotham City (Michael Keaton) begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being the clownishly homicidal Joker (Jack Nicholson).This goes down as one of the greatest adaptations of Batman ever. Sure, Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan have overshadowed Michael Keaton and Tim Burton in recent years... and I would have to agree the new series is better. But you have to give this film credit -- everything about it nailed how dark Batman is, and the Joker is just crazy. Whereas Ledger's Joker is a killer, this one (Nicholson) seems even more disturbed...The songs written by Prince were criticized at the time for being "too out of place", and I would have to agree. While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film. On the film itself, Burton remarked, "I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It's OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie." This is an odd comment to make. Modest, perhaps, but really selling himself short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's dark style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton is one of those responsible for the domination of the comic book superheroes. He is able to give his great style to Gotham City. Jack Nicholson is basically born to play the Joker. Michael Keaton may not be dark or strong enough. He's merely adequate. Kim Basinger is great to look at, and screams a lot. It's also great to see Jack Palance again.This is a darker vision than the other 60's silly ridiculousness. More than Donner's Superman, this one has a more modern sensibility. It is uglier, grittier, and meaner. The style is an industrial Gothic look. It signals a departure from the upbeat Superman. And it lays the foundation for others who will come later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So here it is. I have re-watched the first Batman film that audiences can actually take seriously. How does it hold up after all this time? It's a little slow in places but I personally think it's not that bad. I think everyone does a good job in bringing an iconic superhero (whether you like the character or not, he is iconic) to the screen.The plot is that a city overrun with crime called Gotham is just about to celebrate the 200th anniversary. The crime is all because of a Kingpin of sorts (Jack Palance). The criminals only fear a mythical bat-man which hardly anyone believes it exists and the only other person who does is an urban legend reporter (of which obviously can't be taken seriously). The Kingpin's right hand man Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) is set up for a trap to fall in the hands of bad cops also working for the kingpin and Batman shows up. Through the crossfire and chemicals Jack Napier becomes a villain with a sick and demented sense of humour - The Joker.While this is going on Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) starts up some sort of fund-raising party for the 200th anniversary festival. The urban legend reporter's photographer - Vicky Vale starts to go out with him. Soon Vicky becomes a little bit more curious and tries to look into Bruce's life. We find out that his parents were murdered in cold blood right in front of him. The Joker then makes his first appearance when everybody thinks it's Batman (I know just go with it). He then decides to completely scare the living sh!t out of everybody by putting chemicals into unspecified products. The result is death after uncontrollable laughter.The Joker then becomes intrigued in Vicky Vale and sets her up for a trap in leading her into an art gallery. Bruce finds out about it and goes as Batman to stop The Joker. He saves Vicky's life and they leave in the Batmobile. Batman then tells Vicky that the Joker's death products only work if you combine 2 of them (such as hairspray and lipstick). And The Joker then challenges Batman to a confrontation on the 200th anniversary festival while giving the public $2 million.Now, I enjoyed the acting from some people. The best actor being Jack Nicholson as The Joker... and I have to be honest I prefer him to Heath Ledger's performance - Don't get me wrong both are good. But when I think of The Joker (even though I never read the comics) my interpretation is closer to Nicholson's. I also like Michael Keaton as Batman and Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. Aside from that everybody else is decent.I also like the added plot point that The Joker was the person who murdered Bruce's parents. I think that way it can also be a semi-revenge story and also builds on the (already) psychopathic villain with a sick sense of humour.The only real complaint that I have with this movie is that it's slow paced. This might be because at the time comic book movies were in their infancy and needed to build as much development as possible but... It gets boring.So it is worth a watch (but not for younger kids) and it does get slow but comic book films were in their infancy so it is semi-excusable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Batman Begins?-It's Tim Burton's Best Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a comic book movie. Tim Burton chose Michael Keaton for his "brooding" personality. With fake muscles and lifts, almost anyone can play Batman, even a young William Shatner. Michael plays him just a bit off-center and almost as crazy as Bob Kane's villains. For the most part, less flashy and campy than its sequels. Jack Nicholson is glorious as the Joker. Batman's villains were always more fascinating than the Dark Knight in the comic books, so Burton got it right again. It's all very dark and moody. Many scenes seem almost blue and white with little color, for "film Noir" effect. More miniatures than CGI, and I mean that in a good way. Its way harder to make a miniature model look real. More city sets and far better staged than "Batman Returns". Quite violent, but again, in a comic book way. What I don't like about the film: The way that the female lead characters are portrayed. Jerry Hall plays an "airhead model", and her scared and acid-pocked face, leading to her suicide, (an edited out scene?) is nightmarish--I never liked it. Kim Basinger is drop-dead gorgeous, and a great screamer! Why would either one of these blonde beauties "go" for such homely leading men? Pretty good cast, otherwise, and "Alfred" is terrific. All the music works. Danny Elfman for the main themes and Prince for the steamy ones. More gritty and not as flashy as the other 3 entries in the original series of 4. Yes, "Batman Returns" has more villains and Catwoman is "purr-fect"; but "crazy" Jack Nicholson is the perfect personification of pure evil. A slightly weak ending as most Batman movies seem to end with someone falling to their death off a high tower or some such thing. It's just like most Disney cartoon villains die! A good viewing choice at Halloween or on a rainy Saturday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello fellow readers, welcome to another movie review, this time about my favorite Batman film of the franchise. Here it begins, if you enjoyed you can check out my review for Batman Returns (1992)So, the great film begins with a family lost in Gotham City which was designed very nicely in this film. They walk down in an eerie old alleyway only to be held up by some thugs. The film already gets exciting at this point for me. While atop a building, one of the thugs gets a weird feeling that the Batman is close by after reading many news articles about the strange man or thing. They suddenly hear a noise behind them thus showing us the Batman in costume, fighting very originally. Danny Elfman's musical score in this scene just matches with what is going on. After a cool briefing with a news reporter and a corrupt cop named Eckhart we then get our first scene of Jack Napier/ The Joker played here by Jack Nicholson, I really think this was one of his most iconic roles in a film. Anyway, there's like a party at Bruce Wayne's mansion which shows us Michael Keaton acting as Bruce Wayne for the first time. I must admit that Keaton was the best man to fit into the bat suit but Christian Bale was the best Bruce Wayne for sure. Commissioner Gordon gets a tip from a rookie of reported sightings of Jack Napier searching the Axis Chemical factory for Harvey Dent's files. I was really hoping that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face in the film watching it for the first time but when I realized why The Joker was intentionally meant to be the only villain that thought vanished. After a conversation between the reporter from before and Viki Vale played by Kim Basinger with Bruce Wayne, Alfred shows up and tells Bruce about Commissioner Gordan's tip which calls for more BATMAN action. We then get the action scene in Axis Chemicals which might be one of my favorite moments in the film. It is here that Jack Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals which alters him into his new insane identity, THE JOKER. But I really did like him when he was just Jack Napier. Batman is thought to be the reason of why Jack fell in and the police nearly have him cornered but there's always a helpful gadget along with Batman. Meanwhile Jack Napier is at his trusted surgeon to fix his face, then discovering his smiley face in a mirror. What follows is a first menacing laugh of the films villain. A day later at night time, Bruce is having a wonderful time with Viki on a date. The Joker then goes to his boss's apartment and shoots him several times in a very creative fashion. Stuff happens until we get a delightful scene with the Joker on TV advertising his new deadly products which menace the society of Gotham. Batman tries to cope with the matter while still keeping up with Viki. The two were meant to meet at an art gallery but as 3 Hours pass Bruce still isn't there. The Joker enters the scene and knocks out everyone with some purple gas, Viki manages to stay alive from the air device Joker had gift wrapped for her previously. Before things get bad Batman crashes through the glass window above heroically to save the day, we then get a car chase with the bat-mobile. Excitement follows and the next day Viki discovers the truth about Bruce, his parents were killed when he was young. She then finds out that Bruce is BATMAN who now finds out that Joker was the killer of his parents and that he must now confront and kill him with great vengeance. A cool bat-plane scene follows and we reach the films' slow point being the end church fight. The Joker dies creatively and we get a nice finishing scene with Batman standing proud and tall on a respective building. Though I have just read the story as messily as I could, you should really watch this great film. I always wonder, do I like this more than Batman Begins or not. Even if I did it would be strong second favorite. The film was nicely done by Tim Burton. It is just an awesome film which I really recommend you watch. If you enjoyed you can view my further reviews or my previous ones, see you soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we all know, Tim Burton likes to use his imagination which is always out of the box. Batman is a good representation of the darker life of Batman. Not just the guy who everybody loves and adores. In this movie he is feared by everyone, not just the criminals. Micheal Keaton looks good in the bat suite, but as Bruce Wayne, not so much. He's voice as batman isn't really intimidating and a few cheesy lines doesn't quite fit the bill. Jack Nicholsen is the Joker, without any make up or movie magic he would still have looked like the joker! He's laugh is excellent and scary. He plays the role well and makes the movie what it is. Some parts of the movie could have been changed a bit. Like a bit more detail on how and why Bruce became batman? But at least the bat mobile and the bat wing looks cool. Batman uses his rappelling hook one to many times and that irritates me a lot. Overall it is a good representative of who the fearsome batman really is.</fullReview>

Excellent score by Danny Elfman that truly puts us in the mood. Original songs by Prince. Great photography that really gives life to the Gotham City of the comic books. Superb vision by Burton. Very interesting story. Well built scenario with a good pace.The actors. Jack Nicholson is the real star of the movie. Not only is he the best actor, but he fits the role of the insane Joker perfectly. Michael Keaton has always left me cold as Batman, but he does a credible job, if nothing else.The bad. The miniatures are starting to show, but considering the age of the movie, it's easy to see that the original work was excellent, and it doesn't detract us from the story.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A great super hero movie, if you don't mind a bit of age. Highly recommended to the fans of Burton and Nicholson.</fullReview>

There is a few flaws though like every movie but I still love it so much. I think that Robin Williams would have been a better joker but Jack Nicholson still did a great job. This is the 4th best Batman including the Christopher Nolan ones. Michael Keaton was a really good Batman but i haven't seen 'Batman Forever' or 'Batman &amp; Robin'. Everyone says "don't see 'Batman &amp; Robin' don't see 'Batman &amp; Robin' it's so bad it's so bad. I have to watch it though because I paid 14 Euro (That's about ?10 or $17) for the Batman 1989 - 1997 anthology. Anyway moral of the story is 'Batman' is a classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original cinematic Dark Knight 'Begins'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one thinks 'Batman in the movies' today then one invariably thinks of Christopher Nolan's pseudo-realistic rendition of the franchise and the masterful performance of Heath Ledger as that manifestation of chaos unleashed-the Joker! The legacy of the Batman films BEFORE Nolan is forever tainted by the Neon-stained hopelessly juvenile fantasy world of Joel Schumacher's 'Batman &amp; Robin'...which is very unfortunate indeed, considering that this franchise once had so much potential, having had a very promising start indeed way back in 1989......which brings us to this, Tim Burton's 'Batman', a film which is sadly often overlooked since it is neither considered to be quite as good as Nolan, and certainly not as bad as Schumacher, and given the predilection for audiences and critics to focus on extremes, it often goes unnoticed. Yet, when it first appeared on the silver screen, it was revolutionary in its impact, not as much insofar as it was the first big blockbuster Batman film but instead with regards to its invaluable contribution to the legacy of the character. From the 1950's onwards, the character of Batman was far too freely associated with juvenile camp and silliness (later to be evoked in the aforementioned Schumacher films) and the smash-hit TV show of the 60's didn't help matters in that regard. While it was true that by the 70's, comic book writers like Dennis O'Neil and Steve Englehart had taken steps to return the Caped Crusader to his dark and serious roots, the public perception of the character invariably remained that of a square-jawed crime-buster in a colorful costume punching out villains with suitable sound effects and spouting out corny one-liners...But all of that changed when Tim Burton came on board this film. From the moment Batman emerges from the shadows to terrorize two thugs into submission and Michael Keaton's low raspy voice declares "I'm Batman"- you realize that this isn't the campy Batman of Adam West fame, but the Batman created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger and later reinvented successfully by Frank Miller in his groundbreaking stories 'The Dark Knight Returns' and 'Batman Year One'. This is a Batman who is an enigma, a mysterious avenger of the night, who strikes terror into the very heart of criminality-a ruthless vigilante who shows no mercy to his enemies and does not hesitate to use lethal force if necessary (something which most modern fans find disquieting but is actually in line with the earliest Kane/Finger 'Batman' stories). And what of the Joker, Batman's inimitable nemesis? Well, Jack Nicholson may not have been able to capture the sheer anarchic scope of the Joker as an agent of chaos, as presented by Heath Ledger nearly two decades later, but his Joker is certainly no harmless prankster, but a murderous brilliant and twisted psychopath. Grim humor surrounds the Joker like a plague in this movie so much so that a seemingly innocuous jack-in-the- box acquires sinister connotations.Kim Basinger does a pretty good job of Vicky Vale, intrepid photographer and Batman's alter ego Bruce Wayne's love interest, while Michael Gough does okay as the 'Batman's batman' Alfred Pennyworth. Somewhat disappointing is Pat Hingle's rendition of Commissioner Gordon, who seems almost a non-entity in this film, a stereotypical respectable authority figure as opposed to being the sharp detective and invaluable ally of the Batman in his war on crime that he is in most other versions, including and especially Gary Oldman's portrayal in the Nolan films.Perhaps this film's most enduring legacy is Danny Elfman's theme, the like of which even the Nolan films have yet to achieve, and which was later immortalized in the award-winning 'Batman The Animated Series'.Regardless of how well this film may be judged when stacked up against the more contemporary Nolan films, it is an indisputable fact that this film is the reason why most people today, whether Batman fans or not, consider Batman a 'Dark Knight' rather than a humorous instance of pop culture!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tim Burton Movie that didn't totally stink...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, I find Tim Burton's work to be a violation of my human rights, it is generally so awful. His early stuff, he had adult supervision, and this was one of them. This is probably the best of the four Burton/Schumacher Batman movies, but that is truly a "leper with the most fingers" distinction. (As Jack Nicholson said in another of his films, "The Two Jakes".) Okay, the first problem, and maybe the problem with Batman in general. His villains are more interesting than he is, and Burton hits the ground running with Batman's nemesis, the Joker. Jack Nicholson proceeds to steal the movie. Nicholson gets top billing, more screen time and most of the movie's really great lines. With all that said, he displays the other great problem with the Burton/Schumacher cycle- a big name actor in a silly costume, playing a variation of his screen persona. Nicholson is about as close to this awful formula gets to a good fit.Then you have Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Now, Batman is actually one of the most blatant rip-offs ever. He's essentially Zorro dressed as a bat at night, foppish rich guy by day. Keaton plays neither roll well.Still, it's a fun movie. Not a great movie, and doesn't compare to better treatments, like the 1990's Animated Series or Nolan's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman with style, but lacking substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I revisited this movie not too long ago and it is impossible not to compare the movie with the current Christopher Nolan run. The Burton Batman for years was the hallmark for comic-book movies and essentially this is the movie that for years was untouchable in search of the perfect language to convert comic stories to film.Unfortunately for Burton his Batman is essentially an action flick and all flaws that this movie has haunt it increasingly with each passing year as technology and stunt capabilities change the film standard. Action sequences look outdated and the Batman costume doesn't really hit the mark, especially in comparison with the current version. Storywise this is a far cry from The Dark Knight as well as Batman Begins going more for the stereotypical comic book angle with caricatures popping up left and right.There is no real depth to the story and you can feel the movie oozing with cardboard characterisation. Jack Nicholson as the Joker is basically the epitome of a Jack Nicholson character and the inevitable comparison between his portrayal and Heath Ledger's is very unfavourable for the older actor. Jack Nicholson is essentially a Joker, while Ledger is THE Joker.Micheal Keaton has good screen presence, but I feel that he never really fit the part based on looks alone. He does a great acting job, but still I prefer Christopher Bale or even Val Kilmer, mainly because Keaton just looks a tad... ridiculous in the Batman outfit.That said the stylishness of Gotham City is undeniable and the whole movie still has a certain charm to it, that years won't dissolve. Tim Burton is just so specific that you can't help but admire what he tried to do with this picture. In the end the cartoonishness (even if its darkness and Gothic feel is unmistakable) of the image doesn't work as well as the more realistic and cutting edge version of late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>remembered darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because i saw this film back when i was very young, and before now i hadn't seen it in a while, i have a personal relation with it. I evolved and the film evolved with me, in my mind.It really had been a while. And the memory i have of it is much darker than what the film is. Why? I changed; films changed. That's it. This was supposed to contain a dark world, many call it Gothic. Indeed it has a dark environment in some points, Burton is a specialist in producing certain environments. But it no longer works as a dark world with dark minds, if it ever did. It has now the appeal of teen films: we know where everything is going, but we want to see it anyway. And the world is brighter than that of so many other films not specially remembered for its "darkness" as this is. I suppose that probably has to do with how the cinematic narrative is built. This film relies on its visuals, and that is usually a matter of fashion. It goes away, and when it does, the film will stand or not based on its cinematic content. Burton trusts that showing the world will make us enter it. Well i did enter it 15 years ago, now i only remember i did, but i no longer find the door to it. I suppose Nolan really did replace solidly Burton's vision, after Schumacher's disasters. It introduced instability in narrative, in "dark knight" he built a whole narrative out of instability. He understood how he could support a whole visual world consistently adding layers twists, indeed making the whole film a big twist.Nicholson's performance is as plastered as his character. It's based on individual charm, not on a troubled mind. His villain is a non ironic joker. Ledger really pushed the character elsewhere, to the fields where Brando or Depp operate.This is interesting to watch, for it shows how linked are cinema, cinematic memories, and our own lives.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

After watching Forever before the first (big mistake!!), I was really hesitant about watching the first. But when I did, I saw it was a really good movie, but not enough to wow me. First off, the cast. Jack Nicholson is very good as the Joker, but not as good as Heath Ledger. The Dark Knight is a remake of Batman. But the Dark Knight is better than Batman and I have never heard of a remake being better than the original. Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger and Michael Gough have good moments, but sometimes their characters are boring. Last off, the dark, brooding violence. I could not believe this was rated PG in Australia. So, there you have it. The original Batman. Not the best Batman, but still pretty good.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

Actually they were both great, just different I guess. It is easy to forget the impact that this film had when it came out, at the time there was nothing like it. I actually enjoyed all the Batman films except ( no i'm not going to say Batman and Robin ) Batman Begins with the awful Penguin played by Danny DeVito, I got bored with that film very quickly and as for Catwoman with Michelle Phiffer, yuk it was awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The prince songs ruined the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman (1989) fits in very well with the rest of Tim Burton's movies. What I mean is that Burton has a style which really shines through the acting and the plot, which is great if you love Tim Burton, but I find something a little bothersome about his style. Everything in his movies is a bit too much like a cartoon. I guess, though, that this over-the-top quality works in favor of this comic book based movie.Still, there are scenes which are much too silly for this movie. For example, there are the lame Prince songs which really don't fit in at all. Why play some terrible Prince song when you already have an amazing Danny Elfman score? Other cheesy moments include the Joker's ninja underlings (he has a couple throughout the movie), and his 5-foot long gun which takes out the bat wing in a single shot. Oh, and I can't forget to mention how lame it is that there's what amounts to an American Express commercial within the first 3 minutes of the film.But since we were on the subject, I really should mention Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker. Since The Dark Knight has come out, many people have been comparing his performance to Heath Ledger's performance. Though they play the same character, after watching this movie again, I can safely say that the comparison is pretty silly.While The Dark Knight had a more realistic and gritty feel to it, the 1984 Batman has more of a comic book atmosphere - the kind where a guy can fall into a vat of random chemicals and come out with bleached skin and dyed green hair. No matter how much you compare them, neither Joker could be successfully transplanted into the other movie. But if I absolutely had to choose, I'd have to go with Ledger because, frankly, Jack Nicholson is kind of an annoying actor.To wrap up, Micheal Keaton was pretty good as Batman. Though he's not really known for this type of movie, he pulled it off pretty well. Kim Basnger was alright, but nothing to write home about. I'd have to say the movie was good, but not great.</fullReview>

As the joker tries to create havoc on Gotham city, batman is right there to counter his efforts. The costumes and special effects in this movie are wonderful and take you to the world of Gotham City. I personally like this movie because I am a big fan of the Batman character. I think people of all ages can sit down and enjoy this movie. The Joker really has a hard time and cannot match up against Batman's skill and strength. Kim Basinger does a super job as Vicky Vale and Director Tim Burton does an excellent piece of work bringing about this imaginary world to actuality.

However, this version of BATMAN is the way the creators of the comic strip originally envisioned it. Dark, brooding, intense. This is more like the original Dark Knight series. Originally, Batman was a vigilante type who was trying to basically avenge the murder of his parents.The thing I always liked about this comic strip was that all the characters in it were complex. The good guys weren't always good and the bad guys weren't always bad. There is some of that here, although the Joker is a henchman for a crime boss from the very beginning of the film and he loses it when he becomes the Joker. (Jack Nicholson as The Joker? He made an annoying one. Oh, well...) A great movie about how the Batman was originally intended. The only knock I have on it is Jack Nicholson. That guy gives me the creeps. Still, great story, and great interpretation of the original. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst super heroes, but a damn good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally am a Marvel comics person. Hell, my favorite movie of all time is Spider-Man 2. I can't stand DC comics. Why? Their just all poorly written. But the first two Batman films were just too good to pass up. The only two actors who can play Batman right is Adam West and Keaton. Not Clooney, kalmer, or Bale. The first one is the best. Not because it was well written, but because it was a funny and would have witty dialouge at times. Tim Burton did a great job on the first two. Too bad since Batman Forever, they've all been sucking. Please, no more Batman films. Do not get Bale back, Batman Begins sucked so bad its not even debatable. But it didn't suck as bad as Batman and Robin and Catwoman. But I guess good things must end at one point. But still, this movie rocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Tim Burton, Batman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone are the days of Adam West and Burt Ward in cheap-looking Spandex fighting villains even a cowardly wimp like me could take on. And whom do we have to thank? The off-kilter, visionary director Tim Burton. Although the least "Burtonesque" of his movies, due to Warner Bros. hesitance to give such a project to a new face, BATMAN was a major hint at things to come. Michael Keaton annihilates West's image and delves into the complex personalities of Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is everything the 60's Batman wasn't; dark, vengeful, shadowy, and Keaton plays the part with an artists touch. On the other end of the moral spectrum is Batman's arch-nemesis, the Joker. With the always-entertaining Jack Nicholson stepping into these shoes, this Joker is a combination of Robin Williams and John Dillinger. Kim Basinger is the love interest,but fails to bring depth to her character. But with Keaton and Nicholson in the leading roles, such a casting move can be forgiven.Finally, we come to Tim Burton. Unlike Joel Schumacher, whatever deranged lunatic directed the 60's movie, and Christopher Nolan (whose films I also enjoy very much,) Burton creates his own version of reality. His take on Gotham City is stark, gray, sinister, and hardly seems worth Batman's noble efforts. My guess is this is how creator Bob Kane intended his comics to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Which Holds One Truly Great Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Batman franchise is one that has had so much attention and money spent on it throughout generations. People (like me) in the 90s grew up with the blockbuster series and merchandise being advertised on every street corner. I remember the times where I would play with the Batman action figures for hours with my friends and eagerly await the latest Batman toy to be released. Today, Batman still remains my favourite superhero and comic-book franchise of all-time. And with 2005's Batman Begins being the finest film of the franchise to date, it has meant that the pathetic mid-90s sequels will slowly become forgotten pieces of money-making cinema. Yet, Tim Burton's Batman still remains a supreme film that still holds itself as one of the best action films ever made.Batman was the first unadulterated big-screen adaptation; revolving around Batman finding love while having the renowned goon The Joker to deal with and save the town from a perilous face. It's the typical "good vs. evil" battle, but one that remains unique and worthy of praise.For a film that has not stood the test time and has become dated, it's amazing just how much of a leap the film was for visual effects in cinema. The famous set-pieces used to create famous fictional dystopias (slightly reminiscent of the almighty Blade Runner or Metropolis) like Gotham City remain influential and ground-breaking. The film is technically superb and with the brilliant costumes, make-up, visual effects, lighting and general eccentric feel the film can be remembered for the trademark "Burton flair". It's a film that manages to create that infamous city with the needed Gothic fantasy feel, which Tim Burton rarely fails to achieve. Though Batman is a film that does not remain true to the original comic-book series, it gains a Burton approach exclusive to its own.Jack Nicholson's famous role as The Joker is one that remains an exceptionally individual performance, comprising of some of the finest acting you'll ever see. Nicholson pours his own outlandish personality into the role and creates a character that most actors wouldn't be able to pull off and definitely not with the same amazing, carefree ease. He brings the needed dark satire to the role and performs it with a sought of stage presence. Succeeding in stealing every scene he's in and managing to delightfully terrify me as a child, it remains one of the most under looked performances in the history of cinema. Nicholson performs with a distinction and captures the splendour of his nasty character. For what is such a dark and evil villain Nicholson pulls The Joker off as cunningly likable. Nicholson takes the cake for creating some of my favourite characters in cinema.Michael Keaton famously plays Batman. He doesn't act out his performance with the same ambiguity, charisma and charm as Nicholson, but manages to get into the shoes of Batman fairly well. Christian Bale still holds the crown for managing to perform Batman with wonderful magnitude. Kim Basinger plays Vicki Vale and gives one of her career performances.Time Burton never fails to manage to make intelligent entertainment and thrives to test the boundaries of visual fantasy entertainment which usually have a brilliant mass-appeal. Batman is entertainment pushed to the max and though the film's retro and somewhat techno look may not appeal to all, it's a must for any for any fans of Nicholson and people who want to study the vast and almost immediate change as cinema entered the 90s. A fascinating film, few superhero films have surpassed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie! I have seen it several times and each time, I notice things Ididn't see before. At tonight's viewing, I noticed that from the time that vicky enters the museum through the scene following her rescue where Batman asks her how much she weighs, no camera is seen. She holds on to Batman with both arms and then holds on with both hands to the retracting cable device that takes her to the roof of the building. Still no camera is ever seen or mentioned. But during the ensuing fight between Batman and joker's men, she suddenly comes up with a camera the size of a 4 by 5 graflex complete with a foot tall flash attachment. Do you suppose she kept it in the pocket of that cute little blue dress? This glaring hole notwithstanding, this film will remain amongst my favorites simply because of the grand grand performance of Mr. Nicholson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman ****I have always been a Batman fanatic my whole entire life. I just like dark things, that's who I am. Batman is everything that an Action/Adventure film needs. A dark superhero, a dark villain, a beautiful woman, and more things that make this film a treasure. The Joker is darker than ever. To be honest, this is how dark the Joker is suppose to be. In the comic books, he was a very mean man who killed children with a smile on his face. Now, the Joker doesn't kill children in this movie, but he does get equal kills here. Batman spins out of control when it needs to and this uncontrollable movie ends up at the top of a very, very, very, very high tower which made me gasp with amazement and excitement. Batman is definitely a great superhero film and you'll properly will see nothing else like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Batman.Michael Keaton is Batman.This is possibly the best Batman ever - and will be? Keaton makes our hero close to Neil Adam's hero from the 60's and 70's I believe,-as close as anyone could get to the dark knight in B/W and also in grey /blue. Keaton does it in a most honorable and simple way - balancing humor and suspense - neither making Batman look like a clown nor a fool. Alfred is also giving his share into this classic,- that not even C.Bale (in Batman Begins)and Michael Caine could do - I think. Jack Nicholson gives massive character to the criminal the Joker and is the perfect match for Batman. The Joker is truly dangerous ,- and gives Batman a hard time - also being the murderer of young Bruce Wayne's parents.This adds to the good story and makes it work . This would have been a 10" made in B/W . Check out that Batmobile!</fullReview>

The darkness... The spirit of the characters. Michael Keaton plays a perfect Batman. What to say about Jack Nicholson? He IS the Joker. I love the scene where Kim Basinger is waiting for Bruce Wayne at the museum and the Joker comes in with his whole crew. It's great! I also loved the mixture of costumes/ clothes and cars for you not to identify the time/ epoch when the story takes place. To make it universal. Tim Burton definitely is the best director for Batman. And the music... It couldn't have been better: definitely Danny Elfman is the man! Burton-Elfman is the best duo for this kind of "dark" movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotham City is being overrun with crime. The innocent citizens fear for their lives, that is until the arrival of a dark clad, mysterious superhero/vigilante known only as "The Bat" as the media calls him, until he is revealed to be known as "Batman" (MICHAEL KEATON) an masked avenger that seems to have supernatural powers, while at the same time remaining a complete mystery, taking the criminals out very fast, before disappearing into the night. Behind the mask is millionaire BRUCE WAYNE, aided with an assortment of gadgets &amp; a trusting ageing butler named ALFRED. Bruce dedicates his life to fighting crime, after witnessing the murder of his own parents when he was a child, by a couple of young thugs. During one his crusades, he accidentally drops crime figure Jack Napier (JACK NICHLSON) into a vat of chemical waste, later on he emerges with a bleached white skin complexion &amp; an evil alter ego known as the Joker, his hair green &amp; his face frozen in a disfigured smile. After overthrowing his scheming boss (the late JACK PALANCE) who set him up, Jack Napier, now operating under the name "the Joker" then quickly takes over the crime scene in Gotham City, first by poisoning the cities cosmetic properties &amp; then going on to even more homicidal trek, in his bid to kill the citizens of Gotham &amp; destroy Batman who accidentally disfigured him. However Batman soon comes to realize that the young thug who killed his parents &amp; got away with the crime, may very well indeed have been the Joker himself! In what is perhaps one of the best comic book to screen adoptions ever, BATMAN is a superb &amp; exciting action superhero piece, the film is very imaginative in pretty much all areas of production. Perhaps if nothing else, BATMAN will be forever known as one of the most phenomenally awaited film in decades (heck there was even stores designed in some countries that just carried BATMAN paraphernalia!) it did tremendous box office business &amp; was also the cause of much controversy regarding of the casting of comedy actor MICHAEL KEATON as Batman. Casting MICHAEL KEATON as BRUCE WAYNE/BATMAN was a very wise move on director TIM BURTON'S part, not only is he a really good actor, but he seems to be able to touch upon all those things that made the popular comic book character so great. He really is believable in the role. Also a big plus for the film is TIM BURTON'S direction, which perfectly suits the material here, not to mention a great set design, which gives the film a neo noir, futuristic 1940's style look to the buildings, many adorned with gargoyle statues, dripping boiler plates, bolted metal walls, seemingly blended factories &amp; skyscrapers &amp; let's not forget the bat-mobile which is a really sleek looking death machine, an incredible piece of work &amp; the Batman costume made of dark rubber is very stylized, far from the baggy tights &amp; capes seen in the 1960's TV show that clashes quiet well with the almost 1940's style fashions the films characters exhibit, with tommy guns, trench coats &amp; hats etc. JACK NICHOLSON was Tailor made for the Joker, while KIM BASINGER is sexy as VICKI VALE, Batman's new love interest, what a shame she didn't turn up in any more sequels!. I also liked the ending which was a real cliffhanger, full of action &amp; suspense! &amp; who could forget that fantastic score by DANNY ELFMAN? Funny, sexy, comedic at times, suspenseful, romantic, dramatic, sci-fi feel &amp; at times a touch of horror movie &amp; action packed from start to finish, BATMAN is a delight &amp; a must see! Followed by three sequels &amp; rebooted many years later (which by itself also contains two sequels) starting with BATMAN RETURNS.**** stars</fullReview>

Making like this mood, Tim Burton expresses hero's life and adds his own ironical comedy also. Batman's characteristic is as same as everybody thinks;calm, weird, and timid. This characteristic makes him lonely as bats. Joker's acting was the most impressed I've ever seen about enemy. Cruel, but he shows Tim Burton's ironical comedy as well. Even when I hear his childish voice, I smile all times. When I saw this movie at first time, I was just young child.

		<shortDescription>comic book classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has been know for his visual nuances. It has become a defining element of his films. Burton's film Beetle Juice kicked started this visual aesthetic for Burton, but Batman cemented it in. Based on the comic book series created by Bob Kane, utilizing the comic book visuals, Burton has built upon that foundation, making a dark, grungy Gotham City, with a slight touch of noir sensibilities. Gotham City thrives in amazing eighteenth century, Gothic architecture, to heavy masculinity with Atlas styled Greek statues. Heavy pastels round off the colour scheme for this dark tale.The dark knight, caped crusader Batman has become a staple of the comic book world and one of the greatest comic book films. As the caped crusader, Michael Keaton restrains making Batman stiff though utterly commanding. In an early scene cornering the street thugs, through minimal action dominates over his foe. Unlike later installments, it's not the moves that make Batman a commanding figure, it's his presence. Bruce holds bottled emotions over his parents death, Keaton expressing perfectly in his inability to attach to others and commit to Vicki. The Joker is a classic villain. His white face and giant red smile are unmistakable. Jack Nicholson couldn't have been a better choice for the role. Smirking jokes in childish manners one second, to icy menace are all perfectly executed with Nicholson's idiosyncrasies. Kim Basinger as the seductive reporter Vicki Vale, manages a balance of head strong stubbornness and whimsy flakiness.One aspect that oddly works about Batman is it's stuck in comic book mood. Writers Warren Skaaren and Sam Hamm seem to have ripped the dialog right out of the comic book, at times sounding childish and moronic. Though Burton takes this in a playful manner. On the surface there is a serious nature, though running heavily is that playful undercurrent. A lot of the characters are exaggerated, verging into caricature; Jack Palance's Grissom is a prime example, work in harmony with the comic touches.Batman is one of the great comic book films and a Burton classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Batman, and one of the ten best superhero films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1989, when publicity for the 1989 Batman film was doing the rounds, many a news outlet expressed dismay that Robin was nowhere to be seen, and that no Bam! or Pow! graphics are in sight. Seventeen years later, as a new Batman film has followed similar stylistic conventions and made a decent sum of money, time has vindicated Tim Burton on his stylistic choices. While the film is still campy in various aspects, it has cemented a film rule of the superhero film. Put simply, campy superhero films die. The more seriously one takes the superhero, the better the chance the film has of making back its money. And did this film ever make money. So much of it, in fact, that through a clever percentage deal on the merchandising, Nicholson alone made enough money to almost pay for the cost of 1989's Batman twice over. Although Tim Burton never made such a massive revenue generator again, the fact remains that the profit-to-cost ratio of Batman was such that he could afford to make at least three more write-offs for Warners and still have money left over from Batman to buy credibility with.While Batman is a classic example of choosing the right motif and the right director to execute it, a superhero film is only as good as its actors. Michael Keaton does not get enough credit for his performance as Bruce Wayne here. As one making-of featurette says, he was a less obvious choice for the part. Barely above five and a half feet tall, and with a build to match, Keaton is the last person one would expect to use terror as a weapon against the underworld. Yet he works in the part because he carries himself and enunciates his lines so perfectly. Michael Gough and Tracey Walter provide perfect supports for the hero and villain respectively, proving that no matter how small the part, every casting decision is equally important. I had to look in Walter's biography to confirm that he is the same man who portrayed Miller in Alex Cox's surreal masterpiece Repo Man. In some ways, he steals the show as Bob, the Joker's most trusted lieutenant. But in all superhero films, the titular hero is only as good as his antagonist.And what an antagonist we got in 1989. While I have said that Michael Keaton does not get enough credit for his performance, the critics and media are right in that Jack Nicholson steals the show. There are some scenes in which he overacts, such as his electrifying handshake with Edwin Craig, but his subsequent hit on a mob boss trying to take his position through subterfuge shows a subtlety beyond most actors. In this scene, he is not so much the crazed egomaniac the Joker is generally thought to be, but as a hypertensive, prowling cat. People might think his upfront salary (which has yet to be disclosed) and his merchandising share might be excessive, but he earned it all and then some. His broadcast announcing the presence of his Smilex poison on supermarket shelves is a brilliant exhibition of the warped side of Tim Burton's sense of humour, and it is small wonder that Burton went to Nicholson again to play not one but two parts in his subsequent Mars Attacks! satire.One popular comment about Batman in 1989 was that it was a "very dark" film. This is both fair and unfair, as while some would consider this a complaint, the fact of the matter is that it made the film what it is. After directing one sequel, Burton turned over the reigns to Joel Schumacher, and the results were an unmitigated disaster. Whatever else you take away from that story, perhaps the moral of the story is that franchises should not be extended past a certain point. But beyond the "oooo dark" monkey-calling of audiences who mistook the 1960s TV series for something worthy of something other than deletion, Batman is also remarkable for making its hero three-dimensional. In one classic sequence, we see Bruce Wayne about to reveal his big secret to his love interest, a less-than-stellar performance by Kim Basinger as a photojournalist. As a rich man called Bruce Wayne, he is unable to do this because he is too fearful of the implications. But when he is sitting in his cave, such fears dissolve. Nobody will ever mistake Batman for a deep psychological study, but this much depth was almost unprecedented in superhero films at that time.Batman was made on a mere thirty-five million dollars, according to estimates. Chump change by today's standards, but at the time it was a big deal. The really amazing part is that seventeen years later, it looks almost comparable to todays hundred-million dollar blockbusters. Clever photography hides the film's age well, as does elaborate costume, makeup, and prop design. The Batmobile and Batwing are true marvels of prop and set design, still impressive in an age where almost anything can be shown on a negative nowadays. Also impressive is the use of a grappling hook to explain how Batman is able to use flight to escape his enemies when needed. Inadequately used in the recent "reboot" of the franchise, this device helped to boost the the work already done to make Batman more human. Jerry Seinfeld said it best, the most compelling thing about Batman was that he did not have superpowers. He is just a bored rich guy who suddenly gets the idea into his head to put on an advanced outfit and tear through town, beating seven bells out of major criminals.Fifty years from now, 1989's Batman will still be one of the ten best superhero films. For that reason, I gave it a ten out of ten. See it at least once, it is a true milestone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burton may have brought Batman back to his dark roots, but personally I have alway had a rather low opinion of Burton's Batman movies. I view them usually as big-budget B-films rather than serious adaptations of the comic. Reasons why...Firstly there's Batman himself. Actually, I have nothing against Michael Keaton. He did a brilliant job with the limited amount of character he got, but I still think he was better as Beetlejuice. Jack Nicholson has never been my number-1 choice for the role of Joker. For all his got, Nicholson does perform rather well and funny but not quite on the same beat as the character from the comics.Also I have always felt that Burton has never managed to successfully create the illusion of big open spaces in his Batman films. It's all too obvious that the entire film is shot on stage. There are plenty of other stage-films where the illusion of space has been done successfully, such as Dracula and even the later Batman films. Either this was a lack of effort on everyone's part or Warner Bros. just could cough up the cash to make the film look credible. Also, it is painfully obvious that the film was done in the 80s, even though Burton tried to give it a timeless look. At times the film does look nice and crisp, at others it ends up looking like a goofy period piece. However, the stunts were made well and the film undoubtedly managed to capture the darker essence of Batman. The cheese-factor is rather high on the film however, but one may enjoy it as an exciting B-flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Begins sequel should really take notes on this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the new Batman Begins (which i happened to enjoy very much) has gotten the attention of many new fans, many seem to be unaware of this treasure. I first saw this film when i was about 9 or 10 and was blown away by it since at the time i was only familiar with the Adam West Batman show of the 60's which i happened to love at the time, being a long time Batman comic book fan as well, i was able to overlook some of the changes that were made, in fact some of the changes were for the better, like the Joker for example.Before this film came out, the Joker was mostly known as a harmless criminal with really bad jokes(romero portrayal), but in this film he is a take no prisoners maniac with a dark and sinister sense of humor. I also really liked the new origin they gave Joker, being a hit-man for the mob sort of brings a darker side to him, no one else could have been the Joker besides Jack Nicholson himself(i'm actually a little skeptical about the fact that the next batman film will have the joker in it since only Nicholson could capture the Joker perfectly). And of course lets not forget to mention Batman/Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton really almost convinces you that he IS Batman/Bruce Wayne, he portrays him as very tormented and mysterious and i believe he was the first to do that signature low raspy voice while dressed as Batman(something that unfortunately Christian bale wasn't able to do as well). There is just something about Michael Keatons appearance that just looks like he was pulled right out of the comics.The entire film is action packed, from the classic first appearance of Batman as he opens up his cape and scares off some low life thugs who had just mugged an out of town family, he grabs one of the thugs who begs for his life and when asks "what are you?!", he simply respsonds "....I'm Batman!" all the way to the finale (and i love the fact that it was done in a cathedral!) where Batman is fighting off the Jokers goons until the Joker ultimately reaches his classic death(and the film really makes you almost want to cheer after this scene). Sometihng that i HAVE to mention though is that the murder of Bruce Waynes parents has been done 3 times in all 5 Batman films, and this movie did it best BY FAR. While Batman Begins and Batman Forever didn't do bad jobs at portraying this scene, it came off a little stale, but you have to remember this is supposed to be a traumatizing scene, it should be almost HORRIFYING, which is exactly what this film did. Tim Burton really brought a eerie atmosphere to this scene but doing it in slow motion, adding lots of fog and of course a heavy echo, what really stands out is the scene where you see the murderer standing in the shadows, you cant really see his face but then he walks out of the mist and says with a sinister smile "tell me kid... have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moon light?" Tim Burtonreally brought an almost futuristic look to Batman, the all black"armored" bat suit, and batmobile armed with weapons which could really hold its own in a war and the slightly silly "shield". The music inthis film is just perfect, it really captures the mood and fits perfectly for the tone, sometimes it can sound very noirish and other times very Gothic sounding. My favorite musical piece is when Batman puts on the Batsuit for the last time and the Batmobile drives through the axis chemicals place just blowing up everything in its way.So if you have only seen Batman Begins or have just seen any Batman film in particular, you should really check out this film, its a real classic. I wrote this review because i saw that there have been many fans who really got hooked on Batman Begins but have not seen the older Batman films, this movie really moved me the first time i saw it and now more than 10 years later it is still possibly my all time favorite film.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson as Joker/Jack Napier is a fantastic villain who probably really does steal the show here. Kim Bassinger is great as the damsel in distress (she screams just a bit much in this film though). Keaton plays Batman to a T, and doesn't "ham it up" like Bale does through all of his screaming in Batman Begins. The dark, gritty, corrupt Gotham is fantastically portrayed through Tim Burton's twisted yet ingenious mind. Minor characters such as Robert Wuhl (he's okay i guess), and Jack Palance as Boss Grissom, and even Bob the Goon (Stacey Walter is his name i think) are great as well. This movie set the standards for all Batman films and is still the best of them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'89 Keaton, Nicholson Flick- Best Interpretation of the Famed Comic Book Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1989, director Tim Burton brought the comic book hero to life with the original movie "Batman". This was the first live action Batman on screen since the 1966-68 ABC television series. The 1989 "Batman" film was the best interpretation of the famed comic book hero. The movie stars Michael Keaton in the title role, and is a nice change of pace from the silly, high camp '60s TV series. The Tim Burton film paints Gotham City as a dark, gloomy place, and Batman as a recluse. The action though, is classic, comic book Batman. The Michael Keaton-Batman has much more virility and smarts than the silly, wooden character played by Adam West in the 1960's TV series.Batman, a DC Comics superhero, as he does in the comics- Fights crime in a blue cape, cowl, chest armor and utility belt. He also drives the Batmobile, and Batwings, and runs operations out of the Batcave, where he uses state-of-the art scientific equipment to help rid Gotham City of dangerous criminals.In the moderate camp, high action-adventure 1989 "Batman" film, the Joker is played by Jack Nicholson who really enjoys this role. Keaton is good as Batman, in fact better than Adam West in the same role, but as the Joker Nicholson really steals the show. The Joker is now known as "a homicidal artist", and no longer as "the clown prince of crime". Unlike the cartoonish TV show this movie has some dark and gloomy moments not meant to be enjoyed by very small children. This was the only problem that short circuited this great interpretation of "Batman". The movie should have been designed to carry no more than a (PG) rating. Batman, a.k.a. millionaire Bruce Wayne, was made an orphan when his parents were murdered in cold blood. Bruce was raised by Alfred the butler (Michael Gough), until he reached adulthood and decided that he was going to dedicate his life to fight crime. In the camp-style of the 1960's Batman, the caped crusader's arch nemesis, the Joker, gleefully sings, laughs, and dances his way through murder, robbery, extortion, and terrorizing Gotham City. Unlike the 60's TV show, there is death and violence in this movie. Good guys and bad guys both die. Into the mix goes photographic journalist Vicky Vale, (Kim Basinger) who becomes Batman's sidekick in this Robin-less movie. Batman, many times has to save her from the Joker's clenches: once at the Gotham Art Museum, once at Bruce Wayne's mansion, at Gotham town hall, and at the church where the Joker plans to force her hand in marriage.It is a pleasant change to see Batman risk life and limb to save someone else besides Robin, who on the high camp 1966-1968 TV version is often like a damsel in distress. The 60's Robin is there for comic relief. However in the 1989 Keaton/ Nicholson film, Kim Basinger's character more resembles Lois Lane being watched over by Christopher Reeve's immortal Superman. This is what comic book superhero/ action adventures are supposed to be about. "Batman' is a classic, an action, adventure, with humor, satire and tolerable levels of camp. The special effects, set design, and overall cinematography are first rate. Nicholson is outstanding as the freaky Joker, even though he is just the supporting actor he steals the show. Nicholson really appears to love the role of the villain, and sings and dances his way through his role as the clown prince of crime. This movie is also full of profanity, violence, murder and vice. The late actor Cesar Romero, who played the Joker in the TV Series, was dissatisfied with the film because according to him, Batman is a comic book intended for laughs and this movie is too serious at times and not intended for small children.Batman should have been made into a (PG) or (G) rated film so it could have been appreciated by children, DC Comics target audience. The movie however, is a highly welcome change of pace from the high camp 60's TV series, which often resembled a silly cartoon instead of a superhero action/ adventure flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best Batman film ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is actually in my personal top ten, I think Tim Burton does a wonderful job in capturing the essence of Gotham City and the Dark Knight. The set design of Gotham (clearly based on Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis) shows the City as the run-down, seedy, polluted criminal breeding ground that the comics originally created, although I must admit that the second film 'Batman Returns' has a much more Burton feel. Even so the original set is much more suited to my depiction of what Gotham would look like.Michael Keaton is brilliantly cast as the caped crusader, his sinister grin and menacing eyes make Batman seem more militant, as does the fact that violently throws bad guys about. Keaton also adds the sense that this batman isn't totally sane, that he is a bit disturbed (well wouldn't you be if your parents were murdered in front of your eyes!), and this makes Batman appear as more of a vigilante than a good guy, that he is not fighting for the good guys, he is fighting for himself, for pure revenge. Knowing this removes Batman from the traditional one-dimensional superhero. He won't always do the right thing, he's unpredictable. Although he fits the role very well, there are some problems with Keaton. He doesn't seem to be physically built for the part. Batman is meant to a realistic superhero, in other words without special powers, and too make a guy who can take a beating, throw men around like rag dolls and swing himself from ledge to ledge believable, he shouldn't be as small, short and scrawny as Keaton. But in Burton's defence I don't think he actually wanted this film to resemble reality. Apart from Christian Bale, Michael Keaton is the only actor who has pulled off the Batman character.The final, and possible greatest, foundation of this film is the Jack Nicholson bad guy The Joker/Jack Napier. He delivers a fantastic performance as the Dark Knights nemesis. He is guaranteed to make you crack up at his hilarious one liners. The thing with Nicholson is that he seems to get the balance right between comedy and serious acting. Even though his character is dressed like a clown and is constantly making jokes he still manages to make the Joker character a truly scary and evil villain. He might be able to make you laugh but you can't help but hate him when he cackles at people dying around him. All these factors are what create for us the best Batman film, especially the famous theme invented by Danny Elfman for this film. Fans of the comic will not be disappointed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Batman Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason i put a 10 out of 10 is because i'm comparing it to all of the other batman movies. This is by far the best Batman movie to date. Nicholson as the Joker was absolutely brilliant as well as a great performance by Micheal Keaton. Tim Burton as the director was also a nice touch. If you ask me this movie was so much better than Batman Begins in which i thought was horrible. In my mind Batman Begins was not really as dark as this one, Not to mention the villains sucked! I found the acting of Christian Bale very mediocre and cheap. If you compare them as far as the acting, the soundtrack, and the director. Than Batman the original wins hands down. Now of course your going to get some Batman nerd commenting on how DC got it right with Batman Begins, How can you worry about accuracy when Batman itself is a better all around movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Batman is the king of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here Batman is a human being, not some super creature with laser eyes or a three-mile tongue. It's very different from "X-men", "Superman", "Supergirl", "Flash", "Spiderman", "Hulk", etc. "Batman", born in 1989, touched the subject in a realistic but at the same time zany manner. What we have here is a powerful combination of the first-grade toughness, deadly sarcasm, idiotic lunacy, great urban landscapes, first grade acting, witty and hilarious dialogues, absence of digital effects, harsh colours, freaky to the core clowns and thugs plus ethereal Gothic atmosphere included. This is a very good cinema about a superhero without superhuman powers.This flick remains unique and very impressive as decades pass by. Its bitter clownish irony will never fade away. Let me make the following bold statement: "Batman" in cinematography is like "Hamlet" in literature.It is even more amazing that "Batman Returns" did also hit the zenith, but that's another story...If you want a superhero movie without digital effects, tough, zany, and very atmospheric - do not neglect this masterpiece.10 points out of 10. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, even after seeing the brilliant Batman Begins, has to be my number one Batman movie and it is also my favourite movie of all time. It's been 15 years since I saw this magnificent film and even seeing it prior to my teens and now that I'm in my twenties, it's still number 1. It displays a dark world, that comic book element that only Tim Burton could create. Although there is a similar darkness to the city in The Crow, Batman has a very unique style to it. I read recently that the four original film, Batman, Returns, Forever and Robin were all camp. this was when Begins was released. I don't think that Batman is camp, the first two were amazing. granted the last two could be considered camp, but Tim Burton's masterpieces were incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as Batman Begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't claim this movie is better than Batman Begins, but in my opinion it is definitely just as good. Both movies have pros and cons. One thing I liked better about Tim Burton's film is the Bruce Wayne character. Chritian Bale's version, in public at least, is rather snobby and pretentious, whereas Michael Keaton depicts a likable man. On the other hand, Batman Begins tells the story of the Dark Knight himself whereas in Tim Burton's version the Joker rather than our hero is the focus of attention. Both movies though are very dark and heavily influenced by Frank Miller's comics Batman Year 1 and the Dark Knight Returns and are nothing like the monstrosities Batman Forever and Batman and Robin in which Joel Schumacher tried his very best to completely destroy everything that is Batman and that was brought to life so well in the 1989 and 1992 movies. If only Tim Burton would ever be given a chance to go ahead with his original plan to make a film out of the Dark Knight Returns starring Mel Gibson or, why not, a return of Michael Keaton.</fullReview>

This is not an invitation to hook up or a way to get invited to Paris. He simply feels that his last night in Europe would be better with her in it. Their conversation was natural and insightful and it would be a shame to end it just because they have different destinations. She debates her answer in her mind. She has safety issues to think about, but she too comes to the realization that she doesn't want the conversation to end either and she bravely gets off the train with him.As the train pulls away they sort of nervously laugh at what they've done. But that nervousness goes away as they explore Vienna on one of those afternoons that makes you want to move there.</fullReview>

The thing i enjoyed most about this movie as I already mentioned was I can watch the movie right now in 2005 and enjoy it every bit as much as I did back in 1989 when it was released. This is a rare quality for any movie to have but this one certainly did. The director Tim Burton, the producers and writers and all others involved did a fantastic job on achieving the above mentioned quality. I would also like to comment on the actors and actresses. Jack Nicholson did and excellent job as the Joker. Micheal Keaton was terrific as the Batman. All the others also did a fantastic job. I could not really give a favorite part because there was so many. The set of Gothem city was also magnificent. I give this movie a definite "10".I would recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies in the 80's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a Fantasy/Comic movie-masterpiece. First of all- the excellent cast- Jack Nicholson shines in the role of the manic and crazy Jocker. Nicholsons character is truly amazing- like a mixture of his former roles/characters in "Chinatown" (Jake Gittes), "One Flew Over the Cuchoo's Nest" (Randle McMurphy), "Prizzie' s honor" (C.Partanna), "the Witches of Eastwick" (Daryl Van Horn) and of course "The Shining" (Jack Torrance)- but (the character) still keeps his own style. Michael Keaton also proves to be the ideal type for Burtons's Batman. He reminds on the dark Batman from the "Dark Knight" Batman comics, and is the exact opposite of Batman introduced by Adam West in the 70's. Second, Tim Burton created a unique atmosphere, exactly matching to the characters. Some people say that this movie is to dark, but I wouldn't agree. I must not forget to mention the exciting Batman Theme composed by Danny Elfmann. Burton's Batman, different from all the other Comic-hero movies, like Spiderman, Superman, Flash or Hulk, provides a refreshing character dimension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Revolutionary Film in EVERY Way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Batman Begins...I went back to this film to compare them. Then I realized...there is no reason to. Both of these films had a profound effect for their times. Batman Begins explored the tragedy of Bruce Wayne, and faded the villains and supporting roles into the background of Bruce Wayne's story, only to reveal them when needed. This is what the comic books were. Tim Burton, a man who has admitted to his lack of reading the comic books, created his own take on Batman in this film, and, for better or for worse, created an original story that picks up in the middle of Bruce Wayne's life as a crime fighter. Thus giving him enough creative control that he could make a film without explaining Wayne's origins, which took Begins about half the film. Burton didn't commit a crime (only to comic book freaks everywhere) but instead he created a Batman film from his own mind...giving us the highest grossing film of the 80's. A movie that introduced me into the amazing world of film that I love so much today. This is one of those rare movies that many have grown up with and have cherished it. This Batman wasn't just a movie...it was an experience. So I give you...Batman.The film opens with the movie's credits which is engulfed in Danny Elfman's haunting and powerful musical score. After the credits climax with the stone Batman symbol throughout the screen, Burton introduces us to Gotham city. A city full of corruption, violence, crime, and chaos. In the midst of all of this chaos, a family is being robbed by two petty crooks, only to be brought to justice by Batman. Batman, in the beginning of this film, is a vigilante, taking matters into his own hands. Being feared by criminals, and hunted by cops and reporters looking for a good story. The cops include Commisionar Gorden (Pat Hingle) and D.A. Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams). The reporters include Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), and Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl). On the other side of Gotham, crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), is planning on exacting revenge on his under boss Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson). After a violent set up, Napier and Batman are pitted in a fight in Axes Chemicals, where Batman unwittingly drops Napier into a vat of Toxic Chemicals. Within one night...Vicki Vale falls for Bruce Wayne and Napier becomes The Joker. From there the story is a battle between Batman and the Joker. From Batman foiling his plot to poison the city, to stopping him from making Vicki Vale into his next art piece, the victor would eventually be decided among Gotham's clouds in the high rising Gotham Cathedral.The film's story isn't Citizen Kane, it merely pits a hero and a villain in a battle to the death, and incorporates Shakespearian motives behind the clash of these two figures. This is seen in the conflict of Batman seeking his revenge on the Joker for murdering his parents when he was a little boy (told faithfully in Batman Begins, as done by a homeless thug named Joe Chill). While many people despise this choice by Burton, I always felt it added a great deal of animosity between Hero and Villain, and furiously fueled the end battle! Burton had made many good choices for the film nonetheless. His choice of special effects, music, and casting fit the bill perfectly for the time. Nicholson shines as the Joker, in an iconic part that most of my generation and others grew up on, and other generations will love for a long time. His Joker is so full of great one liners ("Where does he get those wonderful toys?"), style, creepiness, menace, and absolute insanity that culminates to create one of film's finest villains. And the scene finding him and his goons dancing to Prince in the museum is priceless, and is my favorite sequence in the film. Iam looking forward to seeing Heath Ledger's interpretation! Michael Keaton was excellent. Growing up, he was MY Batman, and he and Christian Bale do great by their characters. That is why I don't feel the need to put them against each other in a game of "Who is the better Batman"...both of them now have done a brilliant job by their iconic roles. From the moment that Keaton says "Im Batman"...you know Burton made the best choice imaginable for the time. Kim Basinger is fantastic as Vicki Vale, bringing the charm and independence that several other damsels in distress really lack these days. The rest of the cast , such as the ever funny Robert Wuhl, Billy Dee Williams, Pat Hingle, Jack Palance, and Michael Gough fill out well. I'll end this review by saying the film would only be half complete without Danny Elfman's brilliant score.9/10</fullReview>

Before this film came out, the only Batman people could name was Adam West's campy 1960's TV show. But when rookie director Tim Burton took on the task of bringing the dark knight to the screen, his version forever changed the way people viewed the iconic vigilante.First off Burton cast friend Michael Keaton as his hero and already legendary actor Jack Nicholson as the villain.While fans loved the choice of Nicholson as the Joker they had mixed feelings about Keaton. But Keaton gave such a strong performance that it made the audience over look the fact that he did not physically resemble Batman from the comics. Then Kim Basinger was signed on as Bruce Wayne's love interest. Basinger gives such a mediocre performance that sometimes you try to forget she's in the movie. But that does little to hurt the movies great story and awesome action scenes. Tim Burton's "Batman" is still one the best comic book movies ever made and will forever be regarded as an amazing action adventure masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!!!!! Alas, a comic book classic that not even Spider-Man can beat. The film is set in a dark, perfectly moody Gotham City that fits with the main character Batman. The special effects are, for its time, great. And the acting is the best of all 4 movies! Especially Nicholson as Joker! He is invincible! (Unless you count Ra's Al Ghul and Scarecrow from Batman Begins, they both beat Nicholson, but that's not the point...) And Michael Keaton STILL beats Val Wooden and George Nipples- whoops! I mean Val Stupid and George Loopey... ah, compared to Keaton, those guys look like Batgirl. As for love interest Vicki Vale, while she's no Catwoman, thankfully, she's no Chase 'save me Batman' Meridian either. Second best of Bruce's three lovers. And, this movie has some of the best scenes of the four: all of the scenes in the Bat-cave, the whole parade, Axis Chemical, and the whole Joker reveal and the scenes after Joker (SPOILER) kills Grissom. And it has the two best lines of dialog in the entire series: "I'm Batman!" and "Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale of moonlight?" Although many may argue that Keaton looks nothing like Bruce Wayne, go to batmanbegins.com, go to the flash site, and click on Comics and then 'Batman Original 1939' look at the Bruce Wayne there. Looks like Keaton to me! Oh, I almost forgot. Praise Danny Elfman for the score! "The Batman Theme" is dark and eerie, just like the character, and "Descent Into Mystery" is easily the best on the track. Danny's is still the best score! Thanks, Tim Burton, for a lovely Batman movie that surpasses the other 3! Watch it now!</fullReview>

Maybe the movie should be called Joker because it's really his origin story and not Batmans, but hey who doesn't know Batmans origin. Keaton proved he was born for the role and his eyebrows are creepy like Batman's cape and cowl. The effects still hold up pretty well and Nicholson steals the show as the hyperactive clown of crime. For me the music is the soul of the movie and really carries the film. Basinger is the boring love interest and is the only downer of the movie. To me she is no sex object and looks lost in the movie. Don't worry you will be to busy watching Burton's warped mind weave a perfect action thrill ride from start to finish.

		<fullReview>You know, if it wasn't for Tim Burton and the producers coming around and revamping the Bat-franchise, we would still be expecting the same *POW* *BAM* *BOOF* from the Adam West television show. During the 80s, unless you read the comics, that was all what you would expect. The producers and Burton realized change. Before you knew it, after Batman was its equally successful sequel, a brilliant animated television series and merchandising from here to Tokyo. And to see why it was so successful, rent this classic and see for yourself.A six foot Batman is haunting the criminals of Gotham City. All the police and media live in denial until it becomes all too obvious once an evil Joker causes chaos.Whatever Burton and Keaton did in Beetlejuice, they knew they had a winning formula and simply brought it over to a HUGE mainstream audience. Jack Nicholson always deserves mention for his show-stopping role as the Joker. Yes, it's true there's more style than substance in the film but this is based off a comic book, not some classic lit novel. And even though I would recommend the more recent Batman Begins above Burton's, this Bat-movie and its first sequel still deserve mention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like by now, almost everyone on Earth knows who Batman is. I guess that everybody also knows that in Tim Burton's 1989 movie, the Caped Crusader (Michael Keaton) battles The Joker (Jack Nicholson), and woos reporter Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger). Maybe the movie's not any kind of masterpiece, but it was of course the best of the modern "Batman" movies ("Batman Returns" was good, albeit still a sequel; Jim Carrey stole the show in "Batman Forever"; "Batman and Robin" was downright atrocious). As you might imagine, Jack Nicholson gets some of the best lines, namely when he's getting made up to look like The Joker.Anyway, we can say that Beetlejuice plays Batman, Jack Torrance (from "The Shining") plays the Joker, Lynn Bracken (from "LA Confidential") plays Vicki Vale, the guy from the 1950s "Dracula" movies (I mean Michael Gough) plays Alfred, and Curly (from "City Slickers") plays Grissom.

		<fullReview>Superhero movies are usually dumb - freaks with funny clothes fight save the world for loonies - but "Batman" is actually a very cool movie. It is shot very well, the actors are great, especially Jack Nicholson and the story is very interesting. What is more important, "Batman" has the feeling of the original cartoons and comic books, unlike its sequels or other adaptations. It is dark, nervous and Gothic, the main character is almost as bad as his enemies and the villain, the infamous Joker is absolutely psychotic and inspiring. The action scenes are fascinating for their time and the music of Danny Elfman is terrific. The only complaint is that the story is too slow-moving in the beginning, but after the first half the film is hearth-stopping. Recommended for fans of superheroes and good action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the greatest Superhero movie ever made, definitely the best Batman movie ever made. First of all, Tim Burton adds an incredible Gothic dark menacing outlook to the franchise. It isn't just a compliment to the comic but adds its own mark on the Batman form as we know it. Look at the camera work and the lighting and the symbolism with he use of music in the film, its pretty fascinating. On a less technical scale and on a more enjoyment based comment- Jack Nickolson (probably my favourite actor of all time) was simply outstanding as the Joker, he was deadly he was demented and he was absolutely hilarious! His one-liners are tremendous-" As my surgeon once said, if you have to go...go with a smile!" Genius, or this one is also a corker "Wait till they get a load o' me! Batman although upstaged by the joker is equally effective, Michael Keaton is the real deal- THE Batman! Keaton portrays the character of Bruce Wayne as a nervous man often driven by revenge keeps himself very much to himself. The Batman character is not one of brute strength but canny ability to get out of harmful situations as and escaping with excellent gadgetry and armour, transportation and martial art skills. The ending where he's hanging from the church but uses his utility belt to get him out of danger and put an end to the joker by trapping the jokers leg on to the goblin, inducing the Joker to fall via goblin statue puts into words that very point(symbolism?). Best moment in film the line "what are you? says the gangster. Batmans reply- "I'm Batman!" At the beginning where he arrives from the shadows. Or the ending where he stands on the rooftops acknowledging the signal is fabulous! Overall, sticks to the comic well, and adds real depth in character, and a heck of a lot of menacing, dark fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the greatest film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the world is still reeling from the 1960's day-time Batman, Tim Burton did us proud by bringing Batman back to what he should be; a dark avenger with a kick-ass car. Everything in this movie was right: Keaton made a superb Batman, and Nicholson the best villain, although he is closely followed by Danny Devito in "Batman Returns". A name like "Gotham City" cried out for a director like Tim Burton, and the entire set-up suits Batman perfectly. Whoever designed the Batmobile for this movie was working on a stroke of pure genius. Easily the best Batmobile ever, the car suited the driver and the whole thing worked out, and was so good in fact that they didn't destroy the car and even kept it for the second movie. The suit was also the best to date, again you can tell this by the fact that it was used again in "Batman Returns" and for most of "Batman Forever". At least the third film got one thing right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what makes Batman better than the rest of the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. I love BATMAN because it came out when I was 8-years-old, and when I watch it now, I am flooded with nostalgic memories of my youth. Blah blah blah. But I can also say, (especially as a film student) that I love BATMAN because it is an incredible piece of film-making.In my opinion, BATMAN is different from the rest of the franchise for these reasons:SCRIPT The Decalogue is adult oriented and real and I think that is a great way of approaching Decalogue in fantasy films, although that might sound ironic. But the truth is, viewers (young and old) can "believe" easier when people talk the way they do on planet Earth. The other BM's are too theatrical. Watching Danny Devito in BATMAN RETURNS is like watching some really bad reproduction of a Shakespeare play. Uhg. CAST Need I say more? When you have an actor like Jack Nicholson on set, there is a whole new atmosphere and degree of seriousness. EDITING The pacing and rhythm is awesome. Many (naive) people overlook this and start blaming (although well deserved) Joel for being "bored" in the other BM films. Go Ray Lovejoy!Plus the sound design (not soundtrack, I love Danny Elfman!) seems to be more captivating in the first film. Pay attention to the scenes with heavy Decalogue. In the first BM, the sound is strong enough to provide tension but subtle enough not to distract or annoy the viewers. In the other movies, the sound design falls flat or is overdone.PRODUCTION DESIGN Not to discredit the other films, but the palette used in the first film just suits BATMAN so well. I would say even BATMAN RETURNS started to look funny with its more colorful tones. I like how in BATMAN the characters stick out because they are in contrast with grays and browns.DIRECTION Don't get me wrong, Joel Schumacher is an awesome filmmaker, and he really takes a lot of heat for the direction BM went. But we all know in our heart of hearts that he was not meant to direct these films. Tim Burton can relate to BATMAN so much better because of his experience exploring that genre of film. FILMING LOCATION The first BATMAN is filmed entirely in England (of course in studios). But I think the working environment of the UK probably played a role in the outcome of this film. Maybe people were more disciplined and focused and not distracted by a Hollywood social life. Who knows. OK I have gone on long enough. The main point of this long drawn out comment is that there are many factors playing into the outcome of a film. You can't just say that movie sucked 'cause Joel directed it. There is much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another brilliantly dark and beautiful film from Tim Burton, and still the best movie based on a comic. The sets are spectacular, the scenery stunning, the action dazzling, and the performances are among the best from each actors' careers. Everything about the film, from the look to the themes, is made to enhance the dark tone, and yet it is still a fully enthralling and entertaining movie.The story begins with the rumour of a bat-like monster stalking Gotham city, and we soon find out that it is in fact Batman, the alter-ego of billionaire Bruce Wayne. Local crime-lord Grissom, and his psychotic and ambitious understudy Jack Napier are destroying the city for their own profits. Grissom sends Napier to a nuclear plant for a routine job, secretly planning his death as he is becoming a liability, and is getting it on with his wife. Batman moves in, and after an exciting fight, Napier falls into a toxic pit and is left for dead. Meanwhile, journalist Vicki Vale, Basinger's best role arrives, with an interest in Batman, but soon, ironically Wayne and Vale fall for each other. He decides to tell her all his secrets. But a new man is in town, calling himself the Joker, and he soon kills Grissom, and creates a new crime wave. The Joker falls for Vale, and plans to kill thousands by releasing his Smilex gas on unsuspecting crowds. Batman realises that The Joker is Napier, and that Napier killed his parents, and they are both out for revenge. The movie climaxes with the three on top of Gotham Cathedral.One of the most successful films of the 80's, Batman brought together a strange, but brilliant cast, from former comedian Keaton, to old favourites like Palance. Burton became a big name in Hollywood, and most of the cast went on to bigger fame. As with Burton, the style is very important, but only so that it enhances the story. Would Depp make a good Batman if Burton returned? The sequels decreased in quality, hopefully Bale's one will be close to this. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton At His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burtons 'Batman' is one of the finest superhero movies ever made.Attempting to re-create a comic book legend is no mean feat in itself, but pulling it off is nothing short of remarkable. Batman achieves the crossover with excellent visual effects and on-screen performances. Jack Nicholson is particularly noteworthy, as the sadistic, yet hilarious Joker character, and Michael Keaton is undoubtedly the most convincing Batman(Clooney was a laughing stock) The storyline isn't anything knew. Jack Napier, a hood working for Gotham crime boss Carl Grissom, becomes 'Joker' after falling into acid, at a chemical plant...At the hands, of course, of caped crusader Batman! Joker seeks revenge, and a war ensues, with Bruce Wayne love interest Vicky Vale smack in the middle.In short, an excellent good versus. evil story, with great acting all round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an overlooked "goof"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I grew up enjoying the original series with it's BAMs and ZAPs, I was not really excited about seeing this movie in 1989. But my sister insisted that I watch it, because she loved it. So, I did. Then, after pointing out an obvious mistake, she doesn't like me watching "her movies" anymore. LOL!One thing I noticed, that is not mentioned in the "goofs" section, is that in one scene.... a dark night on a street, the camera pans the scene and in doing so, highlights an orange Ford Pinto sitting beneath a light on a side street. We watched that scene several times, just to make sure I was correct. I believe it's about a 1972 model, but that isn't clear.Does it change the movie's enjoyment value? Not for me. But it did make my sister start looking at all movies with a new eye for what's not supposed to be there. :DOne good thing I can say about the movie: I love the Joker! J.N. is his usual scene-stealing self and gives some of the old "ZAP" to this movie. I have not seen any of the sequels. But maybe, if I'm ever desperate for something really different............?

		<shortDescription>the best version of the adventures of Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman" was a phenomenal success in 1989 in the USA thanks to an enormous publicity campaign and a colossal merchandising. There, a real "Batmania" had spread all over the USA. American spectators went to the movies mainly to discover the famous batman and they weren't disappointed at all judging by the substantial receipts. On the other hand, Europe didn't follow particularly in France where Tim Burton's film met mixed reviews. However, this American filmmaker delivered, here an original version of one of the most popular heroes of all time.First positive point: Tim Burton had the good idea by making Robin (Batman's faithful ally) disappear. His absence isn't a problem at all. More important, the director developed, here a very personal vision of the Batman/Bruce Wayne character. We are very far from the character created for the television series in the sixties. The less we can say is that Batman isn't presented as an invincible super hero with supernatural powers. Just a very down-to-earth hero with a big human dimension: he can't fly but walk, run, or jump. Besides, one of the Joker's accomplices says: "he's eventually a human being". As for Bruce Wayne, he's surely a rich man, as his mansion testifies but he is also a solitary man, haunted by bad memories (the death of his parents). He often gives the impression to have his head in the clouds. Fortunately, his servant Alfred is here and one moment, Wayne says a cue that speaks volume about his personality: "Without Alfred, I wouldn't find my socks...". To go on with Wayne's description, his lost air can be found again in his relationship with Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger). The latter loves Bruce Wayne but he's got trouble to assume his love affair with her. This portrait is eventually quite close to the one Sam Raimi will make fifteen years later about Peter Parker/Spider-Man in "Spider-Man 2" (2004).Ultimately, we have got two comic strip heroes with a tormented life but determined to fight evil. There is, however, a difference between Spider-Man and Batman and it involves the scenery. In Sam Raimi's quoted film, New York is a rather beautiful city. If only we could say the same thing for Gotham City! Batman moves in a bleak and sinister universe where violence and corruption prevail. Besides, Gotham City's architecture is enhanced by a photography of a high quality. On this point, it is easy to recognize Tim Burton's strong taste for Gothic. A characteristic that will become recurrent throughout his work.Scenery occupies such a big place in Burton's opus that we could say it crushes the actors, except two. First, Michael Keaton who certainly finds here, the role of his life. Unfortunately, subsequently, he will never really be able to find a first role to get him back in the saddle. The other star is arguably Jack Nicholson. His composition in the role of the Joker is unforgettable. It is nearly a treat to see him acting a bombastic role and Tim Burton scattered each of his apparitions with improper jokes.Given that the movie is especially axed on Batman/Bruce Wayne's psychology and also on the Joker's progressive seizure of power to control Gotham City, action sequences only irregularly appear (except at night and towards the end of the movie. So, it wouldn't be very fair to qualify "Batman" as a pure action movie. It is first and most of a crepuscular and a little patchy work. It can explain why the movie didn't work that well in France. Nevertheless, whenever Batman appears on the screen, Burton's work succeeds in soaring and becomes a real pleasure to watch.If we make an exception to the manichean side of the screenplay, "Batman" seems to be truly the best movie devoted to this comic strip hero even if Tim Burton was to shot better movies in the forthcoming years like "Edward Scissorhands" (1990) or "Ed Wood" (1994). Be that as it may, Batman's costume, his adventures and his victories in a dark city (where he brings hope and justice) are widely sufficient to make us dream. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic before it premiered!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the movie even opened at the box office, people knew it was big! The cast alone: Keaton, Nicholson and Basinger pushed the envelope and made Batman into the biggest action / adventure movie of the year. One of Burton's masterpiece, the movie was marketed as such. The box cover alone doesn't list its title. All you see is batman's logo...enough said. The movie made it possible for a series of sequels, all which, have fallen short to the original. The style that Burton created was a real "fantasy" world. One with heroes and villains. With Burton out of the picture and a new leading man to play Batman, the fantasy took over reality and created a new epic, not as good as the original. With Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, the world these characters lived in were pure fantasy. The original and Batman Returns both held onto the setting of a realistic Gotham City with characters that hit close to home. For 1989, Batman was a hit. For today's audience, Batman remains a champ in action / adventure movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well; let's start with what I liked. Kim Basinger is really pretty. The Joker's balloons are interesting looking. Robert "Arli$$" Wuhl is funny as always.So what didn't I like? Everything else. The plot is ponderous and uninteresting. Every happenstance seems to be dictated by aesthetics alone rather than from some actual logical motivation. Michael "Mr Mom" Keaton is 5'8". Mind you, I like him as an actor but he is not a superhero. Nicholson is good I guess, but he doesn't seem to do anything. He has no motivation. Kim Basinger is the de facto main character, as she is the only one who is developed. This is a failure on the writer's part. The fact that people consider this to be a better film than Richard Donner's note perfect "Superman The Movie" is an affront to logic. This movie has not aged well either. Hopefully if Warner Bros. gets off their asses and actually make a new Batman franchise, they'll learn from the egregious mistakes they made with Batman 1989(the fact that this turgid piece of celluloid is the best of the series is just sad) and give us the Batman Movie us film lovers and comic fans and Joe Schmoes can sink our teeth into. 4/10 (and three of those points are for of the visual aesthetics).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest comic book movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's original masterpiece marked quite a time in his young career. Not only did he release Edward Scissorhands the next year, he wowed crowds with the sheer majesty of this film. Sure, people will state it mimicked the original Spider Man comics, but I could care less what a few losers with far too much time on their hands are saying. The main thing I'm focusing on is the movie and how it stands artistically in the realm of film making. No other comic book movie has come close to the production design of this film, creating a false reality that still feels close to home, but makes you remember this is still a movie. Jack Nicholson definitely made this film, giving us a character that was both evil and memorable. Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger were also good in their roles, perfect in their opposing roles. For those who love film, I suggest you watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson's Over-the-Top Performance Saves This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman" was an amazing success at the box office when it premiered in 1989. Even though the film has some sweet frosting on it, the actual cake is somewhat stale and unsatisfying. Michael Keaton stars as the dark Bruce Wayne who is the Batman by night. His love interest, Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) seems to be the only light in an otherwise dark and dreary life. As he fights crime, many wonder whether he is a hero or a super-criminal because of the lack of knowledge the public has about him. Enter Jack Napier (Nicholson) who is an evil crony of Crime Boss Grissom (Jack Palance). When Batman throws Napier into some toxic material, he becomes the infamous Joker. This is when "Batman" takes off, when Nicholson turns into the Joker. Nicholson basically steals the show from Keaton and this is a good thing because all the other characters pale in comparison to the Joker. As usual, Nicholson saves a somewhat questionable screenplay and he brings light to an otherwise dark and depressing-looking film. I do not think that anyone knows exactly how much Nicholson made for being in this film, but whatever it was it was worth it. "Batman" is one of those films that would have fizzled due to bad word of mouth after two weeks if not for Nicholson's performance. That is the thing that separates this film from three lesser sequels, the fact that Jack Nicholson actually made one of the characters fun and interesting to watch. This film was a runaway hit in 1989 that even won an Oscar for its spooky art direction. The cinematography and direction (by Tim Burton) are both impressive. However, as previously mentioned all the characters (except Nicholson) are dull and uninteresting. Overall watch for Nicholson, but keep your expectations low. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, naturally, Batman is my favorite movie of all time, because Batman is my favorite comic book character of all time. But, the more times I watched it, the more I began to see its faults. The Joker takes up too much screen time. Batman is rarely seen, and when he does show up, it's just for a short time. Keaton is a more than capable Bruce Wayne, but is he physically comparable to the Dark Knight? Why does Batman reveal his identity to Vicki Vale? Etc., etc., etc. After these "stunning" revelations, I finally realized to just let the movie stand on its own. Instead of saying, "Well, that's not Batman," I now say, "It's just another interpretation." And while that allieves my fears, it may not serve to persuade others. All in all, it's still my favorite film of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not grow up watching this movie hence I do not have the nostalgic love for it many of its fans have. I saw it only recently and was not impressed by it. The problem with action movies is they do age well if they do not do anything different in terms of characters or story; movies a decade later will inevitable deliver better action. The movie starts quite well. We are given the backgrounds of our three main characters Bruce Wayne/Batman (Michael Keaton), photo-journalist Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) and Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) who would go on to become the notorious Joker. But once Napier turns into the super-villain, all character development is abandoned, becoming a good vs evil film. In the 80's, movies blamed chemicals for anything from mutations and horrible disfigurements to superpowers, just like they blame genetic- engineering these days. This movie is no different; they are the cause of the birth of Joker and he uses them induce his trademark creepy smile on his victims before they die. It is horribly outdated in every way, it is difficult to buy water mixed with primary color paints as deadly chemicals or that they can kill you as shown in the movie.There is earnest attempt at making the action innovative and I can see that it would have greatly impressed the audience at the time it came out, but it is pretty predictably today. There are some psychotic antics by Joker, some chases, some punches, some gunfire and of course Batman wins.Keaton is an interesting choice for the title character and quickly wins our hearts with his boyish charm. Basinger is beautiful and witty and it is easy to see why she has so many admirers. Nicholson does a good job as Joker but you have seen him play the crazy guy character in so many other movies, many of those performance like in "The Shining" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" are even better, that it come across as if he is being stereotyped.However, there is one tantalizing scene; the Joker dancing with Vicky Vale on the roof of a cathedral. It is beautiful, sinister and worth watching the entire movie for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, daring and humorous. Tim Burton's dark adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1989 must've been a helluva year. Batman was hitting screens all across the globe. People were reacting, I assume, in different and various ways. Let's start by saying that some fans, presumably, were hyped up, going crazy and going ballistic for the release of this film once they'd found out an adaptation was coming. But it was coming from a dark, daring, eerie and Gothic-like director known as Tim Burton. At this stage, back in 1989, fans didn't know Tim Burton too well. Their knowledge and thoughts on him were pretty mild and he was inconspicuous. However, if anything was going to make him money and give him more fame, it was this film. That is if he did a good job. Then, of course, you're left with the other fans. The ones who were thinking to themselves- "Why, just why. Why are they letting THIS MAN direct THIS FILM? He'll ruin it. He'll tear it down, dark it up and make it hideously-Gothic like and we're all going to HATE him for it. Ugh. Why?". But funnily enough, their minds changed. Their thoughts effectively changed and they were presumably left thinking- "Gosh. I was definitely wrong.". That's because this film turned out to be, indeed, incredible. Sure, it was a little 'too-dark' for most people's liking, but nevertheless, it was a sensation! Tim Burton had directed something remarkably wonderful. Haha. They're probably still annoyed, to this day, in saying what they had said back then. Fans reacted, and I know this through research, websites and the fact of being a fan for roughly 12 years, negatively towards knowing Michael Keaton was going to play the lead role as 'The Batman' and 'The Joker', whom was going to be portrayed by Jack Nicholson. Genuinely, they were more shocked at Nicholson being cast as the Joker, but were more affected and annoyed knowing Keaton was to star as The Batman. They were quickly and delightfully put in their place. As Keaton was outstanding, and Nicholson was, hmmmm, how do I put this, PHENOMENAL! Fans think to themselves and are often at times not afraid to say that they think the film focuses more on the Joker than Batman. I honestly think it's 50/50. Equal. But hey, that's the way it kinda should be if you ask me. Incredibly well-done film, with spectacular dark and daring directing, wonderful performances and genuinely amazing scenes that were simply unexpected rather than anything else. This film's somewhat unmatchable, and there are only a hand-full of films I can think are as good or better. Truly one of the greatest films ever, and perhaps the greatest comic book adaptation movie......still! 9.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As was noted in my review of Batman Begins, I was always more of a fan of the older movies than the newer series (TDKR is an exception though - i thought it was awesome). With that being said, I took the time out to re-watch the oldies and see if my opinion still holds today.The original Batman was never my favourite of the old movies - in fact, it was my least favourite, with the other three being better. However, it was still a good film. Sure, the effects and action are not like today's films, but it still looked decent for a film made in the eighties. While I couldn't stand Vicky Vale nor the Knox guy (she was too much damsel in distress, he was too annoying), Michael Keaton was a good Batman (Batman is sexy, too be honest, no matter who is playing him) and added a touch of mystery to him without being too brooding or cold. Jack Nicholson was an insanely nutty Joker and played the part fabulously. His cackles, his makeup, his humour, his insane antics...I don't know why people don't think of him as a good joker (he was almost on par with Heath, in my opinion).Overall, a good start to the oldies. But I know there is still better to come!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was a mainstream review that hit the nail right on the head.Originally planned in the late '70's to follow up Superman, producers kept the idea rolling throughout the early and mid-'80's. Ironically, Jack was signed to play the Joker in both the conceived films. After an 'exhaustive' search, Tim Burton was signed to direct, Jack to star and Michael Keaton the surprise pick as the man in the mask. With Kim Basinger picking up for Sean Young, the film simply rolled.With months of teasers, cereal and toys... the film released on June 23rd and dominated the box office... and didn't do Prince any harm either. The film set a new standard in summer blockbusters and completely redesigned the idea of 'comic book' films, and makes my list of 'Best' for that reason.Not nearly as true to the comic lore as 'Batman Begins', still a great tribute to the Dark Knight and his greatest nemesis, the Joker.This film reaches comic epic and no bathroom breaks allowed.</fullReview>

It doesn't really have any sort of plot, just our beloved Caped Crusader running around at night murdering a bunch of thugs and trying to save Gotham from Jack Nicholson on LSD, eer - I mean the Joker. the Joker's role in the film is cartoony, but still creepy. He is capable to pull off the laugh, but still went to far into showing his origin. Which is a mistake In my opinion. 'Batman' is an embarrassment to Jim Gordon's character. Gordon is far more important then Robin, Nightwing, etc. he's up there with Alfred, sometimes an even more superior character then Alfred can be. in these movies he was reduced to a 15 minute screen time of a fat idiot who said lines like "thanks for saving the day, Batman!" "Go, get 'em Batman!" and "he left us the signal!" Harvey Dent was a waste of time, why was he even in this film? Michael Gough does pull off a great performance. Decent film, but too many flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman has always been a fascinating character. A billionaire who voluntarily goes around in the night and saves people from crime and corruption in a major city while dressed up as a giant bat. Sadly this first Batman movie doesn't really look all that deep in to the Batman character. Batman isn't even the star of the movie, that honor goes to the Joker. The Joker is almost the main character with Batman just there to stop him. The story is relatively weak. The Joker is created from a mobster being dropped in to a batch of chemicals. He takes over the crime organization and starts to kill people with chemicals found in hygiene products. Batman then tries to stop him while trying to start a relationship with Vicki Vale.The biggest weakness is Michael Keaton who really doesn't give much of a performance. His work as Batman is not all that memorable. Even worse is his stiff and boring performance as Bruce Wayne. As the third and fourth movie proves, Michael Keaton can be easily replaced with another actor and change very little. Jack Nicholson is good as the Joker, who really should have came back in later movies. Robert Wuhl also does a nice job on what is essentially a throw away character. Kim Bassinger is the least successful. Her main job is to look good and provide a love interest for Bruce Wayne/ Batman. She does nothing with the character that's even remotely interesting.Luckily the movie avoids the bright colors and silliness of the 60's TV series. It has a dark look even during the day time sequences. The city has a moody, Gothic feel that survived for all four of the 90's Batman movies. Also of mention should be look of the bat cave and bat suit. Unlike later on in the movie series, the Bat Cave looks somewhat logical (no smoke machines or laser lights). It looks dark and mysterious. The bat suit makes sense. You honestly think some rich guy's gonna go out there with latex like he's Superman or something? Not only does the bat suit look good but it's functional.Overall it was a good enough attempt at Batman. It's a good popcorn movie that's not all that engaging or demanding. It has a few good action sequences. A few good one liners. A few interesting ideas. Sadly though, Batman was an under developed character with no depth or personality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited in anticipation of the batman movie. At the time, I used to collect a few comics. This was the era of Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Walt Simonson, and a whole lot of very creative artists and writers trying to push the medium into directions it hadn't gone before. What mostly followed in the 90's were pale imitations compared to these; just re-hacked story arcs and plots, obviously borrowed from this time.Then Sam Hamm, the one who wrote the script for the upcoming Batman movie, was invited to guest write the Batman comic. He wrote 3 issues, ending in the commemorative 600th issue. "Blind Justice". Great story, great pacing, great characterization, and great climax. The movie should've be great too.It wasn't. It got "Hollywood"-ized. They dumbed down the script; they had some good aspiring actors and actresses as candidates for each character, but instead went with the famous stars for movie marketability. They were thinking of a younger joker. And Michael Keaton ... he needs the suit just to make himself look more intimidating. If I remember correctly, Hamm wasn't pleased with the finished product either.But Hollywood got the movie they wanted ... a movie with mass appeal, with a simple story, great effects, big name stars, and all the marketing for toys, etc.A testament to Hamm's writing skills ... a character he co-created for the Batman comic he wrote in 1989(?), Ducard, is the character played by Liam Neeson in the Batman Begins movie.Batman Begins ... now that's a Batman movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Batman - fan, so for me this is a great film. It dosen't get silly halfway in, like some superhero - movies does. But the two really great actors here are Jack Palance and Jack Nhicolson. I just love Jacks portrayal of Napier before he becomes the Joker. Michael Keaton is perfect as Batman, the only actor who can pull it of so it feels right. Kim Basinger is pretty annoying, and Robert Whul is pretty funny as Alexander Knox. Another great aspect to it all is that Jack Napier was responsible for the death of Bruce Waynes parents. The music by Danny Elfman is great, and Prince's pop music is fantastic. Batman is a pop cultural landmark in film - history. No wonder that this film became a big success at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man, is this thing finally *over*?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I quit reading comic books when I was about twelve, so perhaps I'm not in this movie's target audience, but I came in entirely willing to play along with the comic-book aspect of the thing. Note, for example, that I will say not one word about the sheer silliness of a rich guy putting on a rubber bat suit to fight crime. If I hadn't been able to play along with the comic-booky stuff, I wouldn't have watched. I didn't know, when I finally got around to viewing *Batman*, whether it would be bad, good, or somewhere in between. For some reason, it never occurred to me that it would just be boring.This movie is *boring*. I probably spent as much time looking at my DVD player's timer as I did looking at the screen (and I still don't believe it was only two hours; I would estimate at least three days).The only thing in the film that isn't boring is Nicholson, and that's because he's appalling. I suppose any role where you have to caper around like a psychotic monkey is bound to be risky. In this case, the risk doesn't pay off.Keaton is unbelievable, by which I mean I didn't believe him, either as Wayne or as Batman. Basinger is eye candy, period. The city design is sort of neo-gothic meets *Blade Runner*, only with all possible interest carefully excised.Bleah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the modern "Batman" movies, Keaton and Nicholson shine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought the "Batman(1989)" DVD this week, the price has fallen to below $10USA in our favorite discount stores, and this budget DVD has a Dolby 5.1 sound track. This is far and away the winner among the current series of Batman movies that began with this one. The IMDb votes reflect this -- "Batman(89)" at 7.2, "Batman Returns(92)" at 6.3, "Batman Forever(95)" with Val Kilmer at 5.3, and "Batman and Robin(97) with George Clooney at 3.5. In fact, many reviewers consider this last Batman movie one of the worst films of all time!!The story in Batman is simple. The Joker (Jack Nicholson, in one of his better roles) is just a bad guy. He almost dies in a vat of acid but a plastic surgeon fixes him up. He is set upon wreaking havoc in Gotham City. Eventually Batman/Bruce Wayne figures out the Joker (Jack Napier) had killed his parents on the street years earlier, and this ignites his vengeance. The side story is the developing love affair between Vicky (Kim Basinger) and Wayne. This film is classic "comic book turned to film" without looking too much like a comic book.Except for certain scenes in a British mansion and an abandoned chemical plant, the bulk of the movie was filmed on a very large set in London. Gotham is given a very sinister-looking atmosphere which comes off perfectly for this story. The 5.1 surround track is nice, but no where near the quality of more recent movies filmed specifically for surround sound. The extras are spartan, but overall at this price a DVD to own for anyone who is a fan of the old Batman comics. A very good DVD of a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its just a movie. Its more entertaining than Citizen Cain, no offense intended to Orson Wells nor his masterpiece. And I mention Mr. Welles's masterpiece because Batman is no Citizen Cain, Batman is a children's movie. I say that with love, but it's true, Batman is not a great movie. Jack, you played the Joker with wild gusto and abandon, it was an indelible performance but not the signature Joker, that goes to Heath. Michael Keaton, you are an awesome actor, but not the best Batman, hey and to Michael Keaton's credit he never wanted to be the signature Batman, y'know, he's a real actor his white whale is the next role, always moving forward. To be fair to all the actors who have played Batman, none have been the signature Caped Crusader. That's a good thing, it means more Batman movies, so everybody, lighten up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Tim Burton was thinking?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. That's it. This film is the epitome of the badness. It disgusts me what Tim Burton did with my favorite comic book character, Batman. No, thinking well, there is no Batman at all. That character depicted in this film is a travesty, it is a cheap character with no depth in a cheap action film that found success merely because it used - guess what - the name of the most popular comic book character ever(title shared with spider man). Dawn, even Batman &amp; Robin made big money in box office just using Batman's name. And I must say that while 'Batman' is not as pathetic and silly as the aforementioned horrible Batman &amp; Robin, it is equally disrespectful and cheap.I mean, what in the hell is that Joker? He has nothing to do with the real Joker I know from the CB, but i can surely say that the one in this film is literally a joke. I don't know if i laugh or just cry in disgust by seeing what Burton did with that iconic villain. I mean, seriously? He killed Wayne's parents? And then turned to be the joker after a chemical incident? What kind of trip Burton had? But I'm not even bothered at all by Burton's crazy adaptation: what really pisses me off is his declared lack of interest in the comic book's story, and clearly he didn't put any effort in trying to make a good film for the die-hard fans of batman(such as me). He just created a new entire world and threw in it the Batman's name. Anyways, it is not at all a failure. This film has interesting Gothic visuals, that is the Burton's trademark. And though i don't like that much the score, it is very popular and also was incorporated in various batman's works. Overall, pretty awful and harmless film. 2.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Boring Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a young boy witnesses his parents' murder on the streets of Gotham City, he grows up to become the Batman - a mysterious figure in the eyes of Gotham's citizens - who takes crime-fighting into his own hands. He first emerges out of the shadows when the Joker appears - a horribly disfigured individual who is out for revenge on his former employer and generally likes to have a good time.BATMAN is more of a directorial debut film for Tim Burton than a superhero movie. In fact, the character that is named after the film does not show up until the hour mark. Instead, the Batman character is more like a supporting character than anything else, the Joker, seeming to have more screen time than anyone else here. I'll just say it: BATMAN is one boring superhero movie.The action scenes are very hard to see of what's going on because of the dimly lit staging, an early sign of Burton's fascination in a Gothic tone in almost 95% of his films. The story is also very uninteresting coming from my perspective. I did not feel an inch of excitement nor suspense. The only thing that kept me awake are some rather minor jokes running throughout the film which is pretty sad.Although there are many cons to this film, there are some good things, most of it, unfortunately, goes to technical aspects of the film. The production design is great. I see that the budget of the film is $45 million, which surprises me because it looked a whole lot more expensive. I liked the Gothic look. There's also Jack Nicholson as the Joker, who did a wonderful job playing an insane character almost perfectly! However, Michael Keaton's role as Batman did not impress me at all. I don't think the role fits him.BATMAN disappointed me and I'm probably the only person that will say that, but I really didn't like the movie because it was just so uninteresting. Apart from the Joker himself, everything was flat. Not even Kim Basinger herself could impress me. I just couldn't seem to connect with the film at all. This, in my opinion, isn't close to being one of the best superhero films ever made nor it's the worst. It was just mediocre and more like a directorial debut piece from Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>stars: Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Michael Keaton, Robert Wuhl, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance.An obviously simple plot....Batman tries to stop Jack Napier aka the Joker(Nicholson), who is actually the most evil of the Batman villains, while also trying to romance Vicky Vale(Bassinger). It's Tim Burton's extremely dark version of the comic book, which is in all actuality very dark. One problem with this movie is that the bad guy and the girl have more screen time than the hero....but hey, they are better written character's than him. In one of my favorite backup roles is Robert Wuhl as a stupid reporter. The thing that makes this extra weird is the way that the Joker kills people off. He puts chemicals in the water, deodorant, food and air supply and everyone dies with a particularly evil grin on their face. I highly recommend this! my rating-A minus. rated PG-13 for strong violence and language. 122 mins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the only Batman movie. As far as I'm concerned, to date, there is no other. Micheal Keaton plays Batman and Bruce Wayne with an eye for changing his attitude towards both characters. The pathetic 1960's TV series is totally removed, placing Batman back into his original and best surroundings, a dark Gotham, shadows, and sinister villains. This Batman is what the comics were all about, and Tim Burton finally sets the character straight in this movie. The score is perfect and everything from the suit to the Batmobile has dark vigilante written all over it. Forget Clooney, forget Kilmer, watch the best Batman movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The following review is a small story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the year 1989. Advertised massively all around the world was Tim Burton's Batman. The whole world was experiencing grand scale anxiety attacks. Everyone everywhere had the itch; the itch to see Batman. I was one of them. When the movie finally was about to grace itself on the eager public I personally shelled out some serious money to be one of the first to view it. It was truly going to be an unforgettable experience. I stood in a line that wrapped around a twelve screen theater six times. I knew that it was gonna be good. Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger was plastered on absolutely every magazine, poster, trailers, t.v. spots, talk show interviews, you name it, they were on it.The theater seated 300 people. Every seat was filled with people from all walks of life, different nationalities, all shapes and sizes young an old alike literally screaming for the film to start. Nobody wanted to see any previews...just strictly BATMAN!This was what they seen and what their reaction was. At the beginning Batman introduces himself to two thugs and the audience by saying who he is and raising his arms up to show off his Batwings under his arms and kicks a thug through a door. This is so scary that the one thug is in extreme shock (nobody in the audience responded at all).Later on the audience meets Bruce Wayne as do the characters and Bruce's fancy artwork and other expensive collectibles is discussed inside his mansion (the audience shows no interest in these scenes).At another point we meet the Joker who is learning that The Joker is him since he keeps flipping a Joker in a deck of cards (the audience is quiet).At a factory where the Joker is conceived we see Batman kick a gun from a thug's hand and he also punches a thug from behind (the audience is waiting.....for something).Back at the mansion Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale are dining at a ridiculously long dining table. They are sitting at each end and Vicki says, "Can you pass the salt?". She has to yell because the distance makes it hard to hear. (the audience isn't laughing).There is a sequence at an art gallery where the Joker and his thugs are vandalizing fancy art with paint. (the audience is disgusted).These scenes and many more lead up to a grand finale between Batman and the Joker. (the audience has stuck it out to this point thinking that Tim Burton saved the best for last, they figured they were being teased). Suddenly the audience sees the Batplane and the music is building up. The Batplane rises up through the clouds and blocks out the moon, which of course is a reference to the Bat searchlight. (the audience now is screaming). The Batplane does a nose dive and Batman clicks every switch, turns knobs, lines up his targeting device and makes a B line for the Joker (the audience is awaiting some incredible action). Batman's targeting device is top of the line, zeroed in on the Joker. Batman fires and the stream of bullets blast on both sides of the Joker. (the audience cheering has now dropped down 50 percent....he missed?!). The Joker pulls out a small gun with a long nose (the audience knows that the Joker's gun is no match for such a pristinely built machine like the Batplane). The Joker shoots one bullet, the Batplane is crippled and starts to fall. It crashes and comes to rest on some building steps (the audience is now so stunned that they simply don't understand what they just seen, they all have a look of puzzlement on their faces, they're completely silent).When the ending credits started to roll, nobody applauded and nobody was saying a word.As I stated earlier the theater consisted of all different kinds of people and none of them liked it. Yet every time someone who seen it was asked how good it was by someone who had not seen it they would brag about how brilliant it was. They would, for whatever reason, lie about it. They would go as far as saying that it was one of the best movies they had ever seen. If not one person out of 300 unique individuals liked it then obviously it truly sucked. And still to this very day people go right on lying about it. I'll bet that if you were to go over to a home of one who praises it and tell them that you want to watch it if they have it and actually stick it in and play it that person would suddenly have some dishes to wash; they would need to mow their lawn; run some errands.This film goes beyond being overrated. It has no good points at all and everybody knows it. Nobody will admit that Tim Burton played a practical joke on the world by making this intentionally boring superhero film. And he did it with a pathetic smile on his face. The public fell for his joke so hard that they pretended that they liked it, and they're still pretending.This film should win a special award for the number one most publicly exaggerated film in history.I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for the three Batman films he blessed us with. He understood that the Batman character was an important piece of our culture and should be respectively crafted and presented and not sickeningly insulted by the likes of one Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotham City. Crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) effectively runs the town but there's a new crime fighter in town - Batman (Michael Keaton). Grissom's right-hand man is Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), a brutal man who is not entirely sane... After falling out between the two Grissom has Napier set up with the Police and Napier falls to his apparent death in a vat of chemicals. However, he soon reappears as The Joker and starts a reign of terror in Gotham City. Meanwhile, reporter Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) is in the city to do an article on Batman. She soon starts a relationship with Batman's everyday persona, billionaire Bruce Wayne.Clumsy but reasonably entertaining. Plot is not that watertight and sub-plots are often quite weak. Quite a few inconsistencies in plot development. The love interest angle was half-baked, at best. Characters feel quite one-dimensional and cartoony at times.Add to this the wooden acting of Michael Keaton - not the right actor to play a hero. His delivery is off. However, there are a few pluses to this movie that make it watchable. The special effects are very good, especially for 1989. Director Tim Burton was quite innovative in the production side. Probably the best aspect is the performance of Jack Nicholson as The Joker. Wonderfully over the top. He gets all the best lines too.Not a must-see but it is the movie that started the Batman resurgence in the 1990s, culminating in the Dark Knight series in the 2000s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the first attempt to adapt one of the greatest superheroes into a movie,I will thank Tim Burton.But as a batman fan,I was simply shocked and felt terrible after watching this film as it was not a batman movie at all.Seriously,if you truly are a batman fan,if you've read a lot of batman comics and watched the animated films,you should also feel terrible after watching this.So,all the attempts to bring the legendary caped crusader on screen was perhaps a failure in my point of view. **slight spoilers Ahead*** Where should I start?I think about this movie and I merely remember a part of I can admire.I love Tim Burton,I really do,but how can you possibly accept the fact that someone who have merely read a batman comics directed a batman movie?It does not make sense,and he did it.He put the sign of his little knowledge everywhere in the movie.The casting was horrible.I mean,many people liked Micheal Keaton as Bruce Wayne and i feel embarrassed just to think about that.Have you ever read the comics?Bruce Wayne is a bad-ass,highly intelligent man with a very complicated psychological situation,and has a very smart tough personality which he tends to cover with hiss playboy-rich guy camouflage.And more over,He is highly-skilled in unarmed combat,perhaps one of the best.And what was Micheal Keaton's batman?a nerdy childish guy,who often makes some stupid move (and thanks god,ol'man Alfred is always there to correct his childish mistakes),he is weird when he is around people and he is even weirder when he is trying to be Bruce Wayne and absolutely no sign of being a macho-man with extraordinary fighting skills.I don't want to talk about Kim Basinger,it was too stupid to even discuss.The laughing stock chubby Gordon was an insult to the legacy of an honest but tough police commissioner of Gotham.Not to be a racist here,but black Harvey Dent? Finally,the joker.Those who told that Nicholson was perfect,put a great show as joker,they don't even deserve to comment about anything related to Batman.This was the worst Joker a batman fan can possibly dream of.Joker was never a mid-aged brutal assistant of a gangster.He was a slim,tall,long faced young guy with a high pitch who was a complete maniac and he actually laughed like a madman.Nicholson is a great actor,but come on,he is not the joker.The forced smile cliché was terrible and so was the museum scene where the joker and his gang perform a stupid dance-GOD!And when in the hell the joker killed Bruce's parents?It just turned this film into a lame revenge story we often watch in many lame movie. "Burton's Gothic Atmosphere" was a perfect mess if you really know what Gotham is.You shouldn't have used those old movie smoke and dark alley effects to make Gotham City a Gothic wasteland.And,come on man,Gotham is New York!Couldn't you do better with the whole city in your hand? At last,the dress!god help me,why a vigilante would were a dress so heavy and poorly made in which you can't even move properly,let alone fight?what's with the mask?why is it so big and funny?Why Batman raises his two hands in Dracula style which makes him look like a clown?why does it look like Bruce-Keaton doesn't know he is Wayne,or batman,or a man,and when he realizes that he is a failure,he goes "Nuts?" It was a movie.But not a Batman movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Way, way below my expectations. I don't know if I love Christopher Nolan's Batman too much or what, but I just couldn't wait for this movie to end and forget about it.The movie tries, and sometimes is, dark and violent. But on the other hand, seems like a comic book on screen. The plot is just laughable and completely not believable, Gordon and Harvey are simply ridiculous, the soundtrack is quite bad (sorry Prince, love you) and too many "physics challenging" moves happen throughout the movie. The watcher just couldn't care less about its plot, because it's neither thrilling nor fun nor unexpected. Let's not even mention the Joker killing Bruce's father and other absurd regarding the legend of the caped vigilante.Luckily Tim Burton focuses a lot of screen time on Jack's Joker, which is the only part of the movie that's really nice and truly stands out.In conclusion, it is, in my humble opinion, a completely overrated movie. If you have already watched Nolan's, don't bother watching this, unless your inner 12 y/o wants to watch a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word to describe "Batman": Overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman" is overrated. I watched this movie a handful of times and each time it got more mediocre to me. First of all: Keaton was a miscast. I don't care what anyone says. He didn't even look like Bruce Wayne. Who ever heard of Bruce Wayne having short curly hair, arched eyebrows, and a small mouth that looks like a drank something sour? Instead of the "playboy" Bruce Wayne that we're use to seeing in the comics. Keaton makes Wayne seem boring and wooden. The only interesting thing about Wayne is the fact that he's Batman.Jack Nicholson did fine as the Joker. The Joker almost completely overshadows Batman in this movie. The plot focuses more on the Joker and he also had more screen time than Batman did. The writer's mostly left out Batman's backstory just to make room for the Joker's. They were nice enough to mention that Bruce's parents were murdered in an alley, but the only reason why they did that was to reveal another juicy part of the Joker's backstory: He was the killer. If you're gonna make a superhero movie, make it about the superhero not the villain.The art direction was good. One of the very few positive things for me. The Batmobile looked good. The Batsuit not so much. It looked cheaply made. It looked like someone made in their garage to wear for comic con. It's obvious that Batman has trouble moving around in it, but doesn't do anything about. He doesn't upgrade it or anything. You think with all that money, Wayne could afford a suit that he can actually move around in. The street set for Gotham City is realistic looking, but the over use of that one particular set kinda kills it's realism. It seems like every location they show throughout the movie is all on the same street. They show Gotham City Hall, the art museum, the movie theater, the condemned cathedral. When the Joker does the parade, you can see all these locations are on the same street. When you watch a scene when they're at City Hall you can see the movie theater in the background. It makes you realize how small the set is.The action scenes weren't particularly thrilling. One scene where Batman is in an ally, one the Joker's thugs jumps and flips over a fence that looks like it's at least 8 feet tall. He pulls out two swords, swinging them around, kicking his legs(which looks like a rip-off of a scene from "Raider's of the lost ark") and of course Batman easily beats him with only one kick to his chest. One thing that really bugged was when the Joker drags Vickie Vale to the top of the bell tower, Batman goes after them. When he gets to the top of the tower some of the Joker's thugs come out of nowhere and attacks him. Were did these thugs come from?! You don't see any thugs go up the tower with the Joker and Vicki Vale. Another gap in the story is the fact that the police are trying to catch the Joker, but when the Joker announces that he's gonna be at the festival giving out money and shows up out in the open, the police don't show up to arrest him. They only show up when Batman is fighting him in the bell tower.This movie is just a mess. Basically "Batman" is a good looking movie with a crappy plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a mixed bag for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GOOD: I rather like the 1989 Batman. Though realism pervades in the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy, I prefer the Gothic expressionism of this earlier film. The look of Gotham hearkens back to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), an oppressive city filled with pollution, oppression, and crime. In fact, the art direction is the best part of the whole film.I love how the ending is staged, obviously a throwback to Vertigo (1958). I love Danny Elfman's score, simultaneously heroic and twisted.THE MEH: Michael Keaton is both a good and bad Batman. His Bruce Wayne is excellent in that you would never expect him to be the Caped Crusader, and he does the whole brooding thing well. The problem is he physically does not fit the character. Also, his Bruce Wayne is a bit too Clark Kent-ish.THE UGLY: Kim Basinger gets stuck playing Vicky Vale, a character who exists only as an object for Batman and the Joker to brawl over. She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream.The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky. Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line.IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought BATMAN was really good. I would have given it a 9 out of 10, but the fact that Michael Keaton's acting as the titular character was overly generic (i.e. Bat-mobile, Bat-cave, Bat-hook, Bat-plane) brings it down 2 whole grades. Another thing to comment on is the Joker (Jack Nicholson). He was well acted, and the creepy laugh was fantastically rehearsed, but somehow, it has been proved that NO Joker can top Heath Ledger's Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT (2008). (I say that without seeing BATMAN RETURNS or any of the other sequels, because I don't need to. SPOILER: The Joker dies in this film, so it would be anti-climactic to put him in BATMAN RETURNS, ... FOREVER, or ... &amp; ROBIN.) Overall, I recommend this. It was very, very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... the film starts out promisingly enough, all creepy and whatnot. Batman has a decent entrance, but the film goes downhill from there. The sets, while magnificently bizarre, tend to dominate the film. Keaton's Batman is stiff and unimpressive, while he turns Bruce Wayne into little more than a stuffed shirt. The character Batman becomes little more than a vehicle for the outlandish plot. Nicholson's Joker is... meh. A little unnerving, perhaps, but far too camp for the dark world that Burton seems to be bent on portraying. In the end... the film is little more than style over substance. There isn't much in the way of character development, which is a shame in a character as rich as Batman. Basically: it's okay, but it should have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some okay scenes, but I was bored.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this right after I saw the Incredible 'Dark Knight', it's hard not to compare the two films, but i'll try not to.This movie begins with Batman busting a few crooks, basically just introducing the character. Hardly anyone in Gotham believes in 'Batman' and thinks its just a criminal myth.It shows that Batman's secret identity is the extremely rich, but lonely, Bruce Wayne, who's only family is his loyal butler Alfred.I'll start out this review by telling you the bad things.Problem #1. Bruce as Batman is not in very many scenes. Bruce is in many, Batman is in few. Not very many action scenes. When I see a Batman or any superhero movie I want ACTION PACKED! Problem #2. The Joker is too crazy and giggly. I think Jack Nicholson did a nice job for the script he was given, but come on. Compare this Joker to the one in TDK, and this guy sucks.Problem #3. It got just plain boring. Too many scenes that had me not paying attention, too many pointless conversations, and half the scenes were just plain boring.Those are my 3 Main Issues with this movie, let's talk about the good things.1. I liked Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne. Good choice, He was able to capture the hardened-ness, and lacque of emotion that the character should have, one of my favorite Batmans.2.I loved the dark feel to this movie. Tim Burton portrayed Gotham City in a great way and I loved the night-time feel to this movie.3.The Climax was great, the Joker's death was crazy, Looking at his dead face, smiling, eyes wide open, and the laughing from a sound box in his front pocket. Memorable shot.All in all, this movie is pretty good, but I would Recommend The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, or Batman Returns moreso.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Series Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I finally got my chance to see The Dark Knight and I'm very happy to say that it's the best of the series. But before I do my review of the best I'm going to do my review of the worst, Batman &amp; Robin.No matter how good Uma Thurman looked has Poison Ivy there's no disputing the fact that not only did Joel Shumacher really butcher the directing but Akiva Goldsman made the worst script in his career; a complete 180 from his brilliant "A Beautiful Mind". George Cloony was the worst Bruce Wayne (yes he was worse than Adam West) Chris O'Donnell as Robin wasn't much better and Arnold Schwarzenegger became the worst villain of all time as Mr Freeze. I give it a 3/10 for the pure fact that it can be enjoyed if you really have no taste.Next worse is Batman Forever. Even if it had the most Oscar Nods of the series so far Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell doomed the movie from get go. Although Val Kilmer wasn't bad as the caped crusader he just didn't fit the role like Michael Keaton did before him. Another problem was that Joel Shumacher replaced Tim Burton which pushed the comic book appeal way over the top. I've got to say that Nicole Kidman was really good in her role and that she did bring the film up a few notches, but the true star of the film was Jim Carrey. He was so funny and yet so insane in his role has Edward Nigma/the Riddler. I give this a 6.5/10 for not being a total flop.Now the series begins to get better with Batman Returns. Although Danny Devito wasn't great as the Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer brought the real villain to the film. In this instalment Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return to their respective roles has Batman and Director but they definitely lost the magic after they switched the villains. I give this a 7.5/10for not butchering the series.In 3rd Place the original Batman movie which was fantastic. Jack Nicholson was great has the comical Joker and if I were judging this on awesome cartoony flavour than this would be #1 but since I'm not I put it at 3rd. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson play off each other so well and there's very little more to it. I give this a 8.5/10 for being the best original and the best Joker until TDK.In 2nd place Batman Begins reboots the series with a fresh new cast. Christian Bale completely renews the character of Bruce Wayne with a new sense of confusion and bringing a real anti-hero play into the role which is a great spin on the character. Michael Caine does a fantastic job as Alfred and completely blows Michael Gough out of the water. Bringing Morgan Freeman into the movie was a great idea all together. Liam Neeson was a refreshing change from the cartoony villains from the earlier movies and has a great heir of arrogance. The only bad part was Katie Holmes playing Rachel Dawes, she was just a bad choice for the part but luckily she was replaced for the latest instalment. I give this a 9/10 for reviving the series.Finally in 1st place is The Dark Knight. The film is not only the greatest Batman/ Superhero film of all time it's also one of the best films of all time. Director Christopher Nolan brought back the realism he used in Batman Begins as well as the actor's. Christian Bale completes his turn to the anti-hero and is so real in the role, but the real star of the movie is the late Heath Ledger. The darkness he brings to the role rivals Hannibal Lecter as a villain. He is so evil and you just can't deny liking him no matter how much you hate him. His plans, or rather lack of plans makes everything very suspenseful. Another star of the film was Aaron Eckhart has Harvey Dent/ Two Face. He brings the knight in shining armour feel to the movie to contrast the anti-hero Batman which is nice until he snaps. I'm not going to give away how or why he snaps but when he does he plays a villain that reminds me Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars 3. He's good but just snaps. Next Maggie Gylenhall plays Rachel Dawes with a much more commanding and sincere character than Katie Holmes did. Gary Oldman is spectacular has Capt. and later Police Commissioner James Gordan. He never loses his trust in our caped crusader even when the world has turned against him. The final stars of the film are the mob boss Maroni who is a new kind of boss instead of the same Old Italian wacko. There is one thing you can't forget which the design for the latest two movies is. To be short and frank are amazing. The Batmobile is so much cooler now than it was and then the Batcycle is even cooler. I give this a 10/10 for bringing the superhero movie into the category of Oscar worthy Drama.To end off I just want to say that I love all the movies (except Batman &amp; Robin) and can say It's one of the greatest series in movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elaborate production of the famous comic strip and television series, "Batman" the movie is technically impressive at best. This is a fifty million dollar film, and it shows. Costume design and special effects are good, but the sets are the real knockout.For all its visual splendour though, "Batman" is not much of a movie. Jack Nicholson, in his eccentric role of 'The Joker', steals the show completely. So much so that Michael Keaton's performance is bland in comparison. The plot lurches from one episode to the next, being at one time tedious and at other times ridiculous. Even "Batman" fans will be disappointed.Also, although some may disagree, I felt 'Robin' was sadly missing.Friday, April 17, 1992 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I am not a fan of most other Tim Burton flicks, I enjoyed BATMAN. Burton brings the movie back to its darker, edgier roots, after the campy 1966 movie starring Adam West and Burt Ward, which made Batman look more like a guy in a goofy costume more than a serious superhero. Anyway, I loved Burton's rendition of Gotham City. Filled with Gothic architecture, skyscrapers and raised train tracks, it is the perfect setting for this movie. Anyway, I also believe that Michael Keaton gave a great performance as rich playboy Bruce Wayne, but sometimes seemed like a stiff as the caped crusader. My favorite character in the whole movie was the Joker, a psychotic mob boss who was a bit overplayed by Jack Nicholson. Danny Elfman's score was terrific. BATMAN is not a great movie by any means, it has many flaws, but it still is relatively entertaining and somewhat pleasing to BATMAN fans like myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the only good "Batman" movie. One of the best superhero movies to date...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a very big comic book geek. I own three comic books I got for a buck and perhaps some odd number of others tucked away somewhere that I got at a bargain sale. They're not a hobby of mine. I've never been a diehard superhero buff, either. Years ago I used to watch Batman, Spider-Man and Superman cartoons on TV, and I still do when I get the chance.But I've always liked Batman. I've always preferred Batman to Superman. Superman is a typical superhero with inhuman powers. Batman is a normal guy trying to keep the streets clean. No superpowers, no inhuman strength, no flying, no web slinging. Just willpower. I just don't find any joy in Superman, really. Even the old grainy cartoon shows that started with "It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's Superman!" never thrilled me half as much as watching the old goofy Batman show with Adam West, or the modern cartoon show. I love Spider-Man and his recent big-screen adaptation, but even he doesn't quite match Batman, perhaps the darkest of all superheroes.Michael Keaton is the title character in Tim Burton's "Batman." He plays Bruce Wayne, a rich billionaire conglomerate owner who straps into his cool Bat Suit when help is needed. This can be a tricky affair, too, since he has to keep up two images at once--one of a carefree businessman and the other of a troubled crime fighter. And his love life with Kim Basinger is disastrous!The movie shows us that his nightmares come back to haunt him (and us), and that his newest foe--The Joker (Jack Nicholson)--is also his oldest, because before The Joker got his facial features mutilated in acid, he was a street thug; he just so happens to be the murderer of Bruce's two parents, too.Coincidence that the two would meet up years later and have to battle together? Yes. The Joker plans on taking Gotham City under his own control, but he and Batman have a difference of opinion on the matter.Forget the stupid sequels (particularly the one with George Clooney) and forget the bad reputation the series has--this is the film that started it all, and is arguably the only good "Batman" movie out of the three others following it. (Four next year.) Tim Burton presents Gotham City perfectly--the way it was in the comics and the way it wasn't in the television show. This is a great example of moody surroundings, and it's never too much (like the second film). It's right on target. Burton's direction is truly what separates "Batman" from, say, "Daredevil," and all the other pale imitators.Notice the darkness of the entire series and you'll understand the concept of this entire franchise. Bruce Wayne's world is dark and consumed by hatred for crime and love for peace. By using such a dark backdrop, we are presented with Wayne's interpretation of Gotham City--and it works beautifully.Michael Keaton isn't the best example of Bruce Wayne, although he is one of my favorite actors and I think that--considering his personality--he adapts well to that of a billionaire businessman who fights crime. Keaton possesses the look of a disturbed man--someone who is bothered by society and is eager to rid the world of evil after crime fighting becomes a personal thing for him. (Val Kilmer also did a great job of exhibiting this same type of overwhelmed exasperation in "Batman Forever," although the film itself was rather silly and extravagant thanks to Joel Schumacher's direction.)Arguably one of Jack Nicholson's most fondly remembered roles, The Joker is represented as a goofy crime lord with a big sense of humor--thanks to Nicholson. He was bashed upon the film's release for being too "over-the-top" and "camp," but the original television show had the same type of tongue-in-cheek attitude that the sequels (especially the fourth film) all lost. (Although Schumacher's films were TOO over-the-top, for sure.) Nicholson's role really helps make this film what it is today."Batman" is a very popular superhero movie, and I must say that it's one of the best. Upon numerous viewings recently, I've noticed its flaws a bit more every time--but it maintains a steady sense of fun that the sequels all lost. "Batman Returns" was too dark and strange for my liking, the third film was just a bit too bright and over-the-top, and "Batman and Robin"...well...the less said, the better.This is the best of the series. It's not a great film by any means, but it's an entertaining, and is--to date--the only good "Batman" movie. (That may change next year, mind you, when Christopher Nolan tries his hand at a "Batman" sequel--with Christian Bale in the lead role. It's about time the series gets treated with a fresh approach.)4.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Tim Burton is a legend among film makers purely because of his style. The way he put Batman together is simply awesome and really highlights the darkness that is Batman. I remember seeing the original batman movie and it was very bright, colourful, and fun, but Tim Burton's batman is completely different. Gotham City is a huge dirty crime ridden city. The buildings tower over the streets and are very twisted giving a very evil and dark feel to the city. This is very typical of Tim Burton for he always seems to drag the dark side out of everything.The movie is visually spectacular and the sound track (barring the songs by Prince) just build on top of it, but unfortunately it falls flat on its face. A friend says that Tim Burton is an awesome director, it is just that he cannot find a decent script. The Joker (Jack Nicolson) is reasonable, and even a little psychotic, but unfortunately he dies at the end of the movie, which is not true to Batman style. If they continue killing off all of the bad guys then they are going to be clawing for Bat villains in future movies.I can see an attempt to make Batman (Michael Keaton) a tragic character. One who is alone and with a single minded desire to fight crime. The film tries to portray this with his relationship with Vicki Vale (Kim Bassinger) but it fails. It seems to struggle with the concept of a character that can't relate with the outside world and the Hollywood axiom of the good guy always getting the girl. Unfortunately it just does not work. The relationship seems to be quite stale as well, there is very little emotion in it and the only time they are held together is when Alfred is talking with them in the servant's quarters. The scene where Wayne and Vale are dinning in the dinning room begins with the idea that he cannot relate with people, but it falls down constantly.They say that Jack Nicolson can do no wrong. The truth is that he is an incredibly good actor, and we see this with his portrayal of the Joker. I can only vaguely remember the old batman series but I think that Nicolson does do a good job for what is a difficult role. One needs to be a special type of person to play such an unusual character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but underdone and not very well thought out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it was something of a pioneer in it's day, Tim Burton's Batman now seems more than a little underdone on several counts. With the recent surge of great comic book adaptations - most notably Spider-Man and Sin City - film fans have come to expect a little more than just fight scenes and hammy acting. While Tim Burton makes an attempt to plug us into our protagonist's plight with a short back story sequence, it's put in the film merely as an afterthought and we don't get the impression that the director really cares about the man that the movie is supposed to be about. Jack Nicholson - who is the real star of the show, doesn't help this. Not only does the charismatic actor deliver the standout performance in the movie, he's also given more chance to flesh out his character than the hero is, and really; it's easier to care more for the Joker than it is for Batman. We get to see the Joker before he became a villain, we see his transformation and we watch his insanity. Batman hardly gets a look in - the film should have been called "The Joker"! It's easy to see why Tim Burton was selected for the job of directing this film. Batman is well known for being Gothic, and as Burton's Beetlejuice showed a year earlier; the man can do comic book Gothic. However; while he's got the look of Gotham City right, Burton has gone way over the top on silliness, and the scenes involving pop music are amazingly stupid and very difficult to take seriously. Nicholson looks like he enjoyed himself; but I didn't! Michael Keaton is an actor with charisma that can hold an audience's attention, but he is never allowed to show this; and this leaves him as something of a spectator in his own film, especially when there's Jack Nicholson on board. He doesn't look like much of an action hero either, and the illusion of him wearing the Batsuit and beating up bad guys doesn't hold all that much weight with that in light. On a purely shallow level; Batman is a nice slice of entertainment. Unlike the newer comic book films, this one doesn't have the characters and the plot to place itself alongside 'serious' movies; but it makes up for that somewhat with it's importance in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson Turns in an All-Time Great Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman (1989)** 1/2 (out of 4)Tim Burton's blockbuster has Batman (Michael Keaton) doing battle against the evil Joker (Jack Nicholson) who wants to take over the crime scene in Gotham City. I remember being around nine-years-old when my parents took me to see this film and I remember falling asleep. In fact, I tried to revisit it twice the following year and fell asleep both times yet again. It was a few years later when I gave the film another shot and while I enjoyed bits and pieces of it I still couldn't love the film like so many do. With this most recent viewing I once again found myself entertained by parts of it but in the end I think there's just way too much style and not enough substance to really carry and save the day. There are countless good things to really enjoy here including the rather dark vision of Burton. Many people seem to be upset that the light, comic book tone has been turned into some rather dark, dirty and depressing but I think the visual look of the streets, the bat cave and the rundown city is highly effective and it certainly creates a terrific atmosphere. There's just so much detail down to the smallest thing that you really must give the director and production crew credit for going all out. Another major plus are the performances, which are exceptionally well done. This includes smaller roles played by the likes of Jack Palance, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle and Billy Dee Williams. Kim Basinger plays the love interest and I've always been a bit torn on her performance. I think she's fine in the part but her character suffers from some really bland writing that really doesn't give the actress a chance to bring the character to life. Keaton seems to be debated on by fans but I thought he was fine. I think he's more believable and better at playing Bruce Wayne. Nicholson, on the other hand, turns in one of the best performances of his career and while watching the film you really can't help but wish that the entire movie featured him. I think Nicholson is so great in his part that it really hurts the film whenever he's not on screen. It says a lot that one performance can capture an entire film but Nicholson's wacky, fun and just downright bizarre performance does just that. I do think one of the film's biggest problems is that the Bruce Wayne/Batman role isn't given enough "great moments" to really stand out. I always think it's a problem whenever you enjoy watching the villain much more than the hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once a childhood favourite is now very dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman was released in 1989 amidst tons of publicity. It was obvious that the audiences were very excited to see it, till then all the audiences had in terms of Superhero movies was the Superman movies. Batman went on to break box office records and was highest grossing movie of 89. I used to love the Batman movie child, I was only four when it released. I was very happy when I purchased the DVD as I hadn't seen it for years. Looking back on it now it is very clear that the movie has dated very badly. What is so annoying is that it had such a promising start but post Napier's transformation into the Joker it all falls apart at the seams. The biggest problems is that there is virtually no script to speak of. The movie is almost single handedly saved by Jack Nicolson as the Joker. Another flaw is that compared to the Joker's antics in TDK, the Joker's antics in the original Batman can seem rather tame, even bordering on the lines of comical. It does however has to said it is the closest to Ceasar Romero's Joker in the Batman TV series. We as the viewers should fear superhero villains not laugh at them. All moments of terror are therefore ineffective. In terms of content Batman Returns was so much better and so was TDK and Batman Begins(my personal favourite Batman movie). As a child I loved it but as a adult I can finally see it for what it is, a piece of overrated tripe. I suppose I have to give credit for the fact that without Batman the far superior Returns and Begins wouldn't have existed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know back in 1989 , this was considered the bomb of comic book character movies. I never did like the casting choices ,short shi* Michael Keaton as a rather dull Bruce Wayne and the annoying Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale. The action and backdrops are all so cartoonish as if the director and producers were thinking product placement for kids rather than a dark and serious movie. Nicholson is sorely miscast as the Joker too - too old for starters and the hammy overacting is just awful. The movie degenerates into bad one liners and stagnant scenes of the characters just looking at each other as if saying I'm so bored lets just get this scene over with already. I've watched this movie several times and each time I see just how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moronic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Keaton was cast in this film as a social psychology measure to keep young good looking and wealthy tough guys with a chip on their shoulder, from spending their money on gadgets, training and weapons, and then donning a costume to go out and fight crime.Moronic, but true.Michael Keaton is not over six feet tall, does not have classic northern European chiseled features, nor muscles like an athlete. He is not GQ magazine cover material (though he's probably had his picture put there).I read some of the Batman comics, but I simply couldn't get into them. The characters were all dark and borderline macabre at times, with a strong dash of psychotic bad guys. That's what the comic book is intended for; to rope in the kid who may be on the edge and needs a little law and order guidance in his life. That's what the various Batman comics do, show, and thereby instruct.I was never a bit reader of the Batman comic, but knew enough about it to know who and what Bruce Wayne was. So imagine my surprise when the film is announced, and Michael Keaton is cast in the lead role, with what's her name as the damsel in distress. Jack Nicholson does a superb job of playing a psyched out and psychotic bad guy, but the film is so odd, off kilter, and just plain idiotic, that it's a wonder it got made at all.But there's a real fear in America that comic book figures will inspire more than just polite behavior, so a piece of trash film like this gets made to sort of subtlety trash Bruce Wayne's alter ego. How moronic.I call it moronic because probably less than a thousandth of a percent of people who read comic books and see films based on them, give serious contemplation to putting on a costume and going after bad guys in the real world. But there's a few nut cases out there, and this film is partially aimed at them to settle down and stay home.If I had shot it I would have just cast the best good looking leading man I could find, and make sure he hit his marks and said his lines with conviction. I would not have made the film so obviously campy, and probably give a detective feel to the whole thing. That as opposed to the half baked slop-artist rendition that we've given.Maybe someday.In the meantime, watch at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the biggest disappointments of my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out, the Iron Curtain has just fallen and my country, Hungary was just transforming into a free market economy. Although we weren't hermetically sealed from everything Western, superhero comics and movies never reached us. The only superhero I've ever heard during my childhood was Superman, however I've never seen Superman comics or anything about it. All we knew that there is this flying superguy who is a kind of a cultural icon in America. And yes, he looks cool. For some strange reason there was a brief time around 1986 when Hulk stickers were considered cool. Nobody knew who or what is Hulk. Some business-minded person apparently bought some comics in some Scandinavian country, brought them home and selected a few neat looking frames to be printed as stickers, sold to kids for a few forints. Hey, it looked very Western, it was in some weird alien language (probably Danish) and it was violent, so it was only cool! That's all what East Europe knew about superhero comics before 1989...One day it was announced that a new American movie will arrive soon, and it's titled "Batman". A very unusual marketing campaign was started. Unusual for us, Hungarians - we never knew that movies are sold as commercial products in America. Of course we had movies, even American movies - we had all the 1980s classics from Star Wars and Terminator to Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. - but they were not really advertised apart from a few posters, only shown in movies. Now came this Batman thing, and it was everywhere you looked. They discussed it on TV, they were counting the days to the premiere, there were Batman quizzes on the radio, Batman merchandise everywhere (something we never saw before!) and what not. The whole nation thought this Batman thing must be something really, really big and awesome or they wouldn't talk about it this much. Yes, we, naive citizens of a just recently freed ex-Soviet Bloc country naively believed that the media tells the truth and only discusses important things. (As it was actually more or less true in the Communist times, save for the political news!)So an entire nation excitedly awaited Batman (Denevérember, if you need the Hungarian title and the name of the character, which nowadays sounds odd - nobody translates the names of superheroes) and expected some cinematic revolution, some unforgettable experience, something vastly, overwhelmingly new, a taste of Western freedom. We expected something next level and unimaginable, as it was anticipated that everything will be so next level after the fall of communism.Then we sat in the cinema, and the movie was on... and we were... shocked... then disappointed... and devastated. Oh my God, WHAT IS THIS UTTER SH1T?! Even the weakest Soviet kids' movies were way, way more exciting and immerse. Batman was ridiculous, cheap, boring and pointlessly violent. It is THE worst movie I've ever seen in my life, no kidding!Batman was more than a bad film. It was a cultural trauma. A punch in the groin. A message to us, East Europeans that America is not better than the Soviet Union. They just deliver differently smelling crap. Different lies.There is a reason why my generation throws up on the mere thought of seeing a superhero movie. Many of us don't even let their kids to see any. It's for the best: superhero movies are dull, boring, violent and stupid. If I want my kids to see superheroes, I show them a historic movie. An old one, pre-1989. Perhaps a Soviet movie. But not Batman, for God's sake, no. And not Hulk either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1989 I saw Tim Burton's Batman on a rare visit to the cinema. I thoroughly enjoyed it - an oasis in a superhero-less desert - but even then I had reservations.Relatively early in Burton's career it was already becoming clear that a) the visual aesthetic was taking presence over other considerations, and b) Burton was not going to take second place to the material he was working with. Hence it was not possible to rely on Batman being entirely the character one might expect from the comics.Keaton is a consideration. In many ways he is a good Batman and Bruce Wayne, but he is a small man. In Burton's view this doesn't matter. To me, Batman needs to be physically impressive, and Keaton isn't.And I have such mixed feelings about Nicholson, because he's so obvious. Having said that, he is a credible Joker. Ditto for Michael Gough as Alfred. The other cast members make absolutely no mark as the characters they are playing.Yes, it looks impressive but, ultimately, it is empty eye candy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>witty, spectacular, intimate, crazy, subtle - proof comic books can turn into film art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman has its fans, and its detractors. Some saw the movie as kids and may have forgotten it. Others put it up quite high on a pedestal against its other big contender, The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan's film that broke box office records (more than the 89 Batman by far), and garnered the first major Oscar win for a comic-book movie adaptation. This is not unwarranted, but sometimes it helps to go back and watch the original phenomenon and realize just how impressive something really is. And without getting into a you-know-what measuring contest over the two films featuring the unbeatable match-up of hero (Batman) and villain (The Joker) I'll just say this: for me, Batman is almost everything I could want in a movie adapted from this source material- or just a movie, period.It's cinematically satisfying in terms of direction, music and production design. It astounds with a look that hearkens not only to Gothic architecture and the urban dark corners of a city like New York of the period (or of any period in the mid-late 20th century), but to a hyper-realistic attitude. It is, in its own way, quite surreal and at other times abstracted completely from our world to be identifiable - and also, it should be noted, to other movies as well. Seeing it on a big screen, or just in the clearest picture imaginable, you see how epic the design is, but how detail works into everything. You can get caught up in that winding road in the deep dark woods the Batmobile drives through just as you can a dark alley or AXIS chemicals. To call it "moody" is kind of missing the point: it's moody by nature, by its own sense of cinematic calling back to previous monolithic examples of style (Metropolis is one example, but Vertigo's climax in the church is recalled at the climax in the chapel in this film).And if Burton and his crew rise to a challenge they set form themselves to make the film look and feel and sound unique, he also casts his film with a wonderful cavalcade of stars and character actors (Hingle, Gaugh, Billy Dee, Palance especially). Nicholson gives one of those performances like Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood: you simply have to see it to believe it, and his scenery chewing as the Joker is sublime and totally tasteless in its twisted comedy (you'll laugh often, and then wonder if you should have, which is a great way of saying you went over the line and liked it), but even he has some moments (if only early on) where he doesn't go too far over the top. But also highly noteworthy- even underrated- is Keaton as Bruce Wayne, and to a degree Batman. It's slightly quirky, but perfectly modulated for a secret closet case who is, as he says, "complex". It may even be one of Keaton's very best performances, as he's mysterious, oddly charming, and gives an evenly matched turn to Nicholson's given scene-chewing. And (to compare TDK just once), his Batman's voice is perfectly brooding.The film's script, too, is absorbing and intricate, giving a great deal of layers to sink in to as tragedy, comedy, and thriller mix together (hence the "great popcorn movie" title). If there are some minor gripes to have with the total faithfulness to the source with its mythology, and it does tool around with it ("Ever dance with the devil on a pale moon light?"), it somehow compensates, if just barely, by being of a whole piece feeling complete. Does it work better in the comics the explanation of Bruce's parent's murder? Yes. But for the film's exploration of its characters' psychologies, however much it does go into them, it works just fine (and, watching it again, contrary to what some have argued, Batman doesn't *exactly* kill anyone in the movie, not exactly at least).Little gripes aside, it's such a terrific combination of means of cinematic art: performance, design, direction, cinematography, dialog, even props (gotta love the Batmobile and Joker's six-foot-long gun), all to create something extraordinary. If you give Batman a chance, and meet it at least halfway, its rewards are ten-fold. If a closed-off fan-boy, just... still give it a shot. After all, if you gotta go, go with a smile!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloomy Re-Imagining of Batman That Became a Smash Hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is a triumph of production design. There's no aspect of it that isn't first rate. The city of Gotham is especially well rendered and provides the perfect backdrop for the morose and violent inhabitants of this gloomy world. The art department was honored for their outstanding achievements at the Academy Awards. Michael Keaton stars as Bruce Waye/Batman, fresh from his collaboration with director Tim Burton on Beetlejuice. He's a sombre, monosyllabic hero scarred by the loss of his parents at the hands of a thug who would one day become his ultimate nemesis; The Joker. Jack Nicholson steals the show as the demented clown prince of crime who plots to murder the citizens of Gotham with toxic laughing gas. Nicholson's the Joker is an amazing performance but like the film is a bit too dark. There's no joy and wonder here like you may have felt watching Superman or exhilaration watching Peter Parker soaring above New York as Spiderman. Like Kim Bassinger as Vickie Vale, Batman keeps us at arms length when it should be drawing us in and making us care. It's a good movie and a promising start to the franchise but it wouldn't be till Batman Returns that Burton would perfect the formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still just a comic book movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real super hero in this post-modern cartoon adventure isn't the title character; it's the visionary retro-noir look of Gotham City: mysterious, forbidding, and overwhelmed by civic corruption and urban blight. The film is a masterpiece of production design, to the point where everything else about it (in particular the multi-plex fodder screenplay) can't help but suffer by comparison. All the psycho-allegorical pretensions about the relationship between eccentric millionaire and closet vigilante Bruce Wayne and his grinning nemesis Jack Napier (aka The Joker) can't hide the movie's comic book origins, and the skimpy plot presents little more than a thin romantic rivalry between the two alter egos over baby-doll reporter Kim Basinger, who frankly isn't worth the attention. Director Tim Burton succeeds in taking the campiness out of the caped crusader (Michael Keaton is suitably stoic in the title role), but he's still just a cog in the Paramount marketing machine, forcing even Joker Jack Nicholson (laughing all the way to the bank, to be sure) to plug the songs by Prince, included for no other reason except to boost soundtrack album sales.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophisticated film, that is easily the BEST of the Batman films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason why I didn't give this a 10, was that the film itself is a bit too long. But putting that discrepancy aside, this is still a solid and sophisticated film, that is undoubtedly one of Tim Burton's better film efforts along with Edward Scissorhands and Corpse Bride.The cinematography was spellbinding. The view of Gotham City from the air was brilliantly shot and very well realised. The music by Danny Elfman perfectly matched the cinematography, as that was outstanding. I also liked the mixture of darkness and tragedy wrought into the characters, as is so typical of Burton.As for the acting, that was equally outstanding. I couldn't think of a better cast for this type of film. Michael Keaten was suitably brooding as Batman, and Kim Basinger matched him wonderfully in an innocent but sophisticated role as Vicki Vale. However, it is Jack Nicolson's mind-blowing performance as the rather sadistic joker that holds this film together. If I have to decide who was better as the joker between Jack Nicolson and Heath Ledger, it would be an extremely close call, but Jack Nicolson for me. He was both scary and comical, which reminded me of Tim Curry's(who was 2nd choice for the role of the Joker) Pennywise in It.The direction by Burton was tight, and he assured us that the high-tension of this film rarely slipped. In conclusion, a must-see if you love sophisticated and dark films, with a touch of edge, because this film has plenty of that. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the original Batman franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gotham City, a big city where crime has been occurring lately and a mysterious caped crusader named Batman (Michael Keaton) is wiping streets clean of criminals, it leaves the police especially commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) baffled. A gangster named Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) was dropped into a vat of chemicals which leaves him disfigures with paint-like white bleached skin and ruby-red lips plus green hair which makes him clown-like as he now calls himself Joker, he begins to terrorize the city of Gotham and stalk a sexy photographer named Vickie Vale (Kim Bassinger). Bruce Wayne who is Gotham's richest man falls in love with Vickie yet she doesn't know his true secret that he's Batman, but can Bruce deal with romance and battling with Joker at the same time?A classic of the 80s and it was THE event movie of 1989 no doubt! after 50 years since Bob Kane and Bill Finger's DC comics creation has been made into serials in the 40s with a popular ABC TV show in the 60's with Filmation cartoons in the 70s especially on SuperFriends from Hanna- Barbara in the 70s to mid 80s. However in the 70s in comics Batman was changed back to his dark roots even in 1986 and 1987 when Frank Miller changed the face of comics with his excellent mini-series of "The Dark Knight Returns" and "Year One", these caught the attention of the media of how we can see Batman serious again. But since 1978 after the success of Warner's Superman adaptation that they were eying a Batman movie and took a decade of development hell, however in 1988 after the success of "Beetlejuice" director Tim Burton was assigned to do the film yet he did grew up with the 60's show but decided to read Alan Moore's brilliant 1988 graphic novel "The Killing Joke" and he adored it as he became a bigger fan of Batman as he directed the film. Jack Nicholson was nicely casted as Joker i should say, while not as excellent as Ledger's Joker still Jack's Joker is a lot of fun and he stole the show no doubt.Michael Keaton caused an uproar when he was casted as Batman as fans boycotted the idea yet in Christmas 1988 when the trailer hit theaters the silence was shut as it was a nice teaser. This movie was the most hyped movie of 1989 as months audiences including fans had waited even with a second trailer that showed up in the spring of 1989 and merchandise was everywhere as it was the year of the Batman, hell even TV stations had reruns of the 60's Batman show to cash-in on the phenomenon. This movie opened on June 21st 1989 and became one of the highest grossing movies of all time and the biggest movie of the year earning acclaim and making Batman cool again just like Frank Miller and Alan Moore did. It launched a franchise and influenced many films from "Dick Tracy" to "Darkman" to others of it's kind just like Richard Donner's "Superman" movies did, hell it was even admired by Christopher Nolan when he did his reboot of the franchise to even spawning the animated series in the 90s which had influences from Burton and the comics. The film co-stars Robert Wuhl as photographer Alexander Knox with Billie Dee Williams as Harvey Dent then Michael Gough as Alfred with Jack Palance as Grissom, it's a highly entertaining, well written and well acted action adventure from screenwriter Charles Hamm and director Tim Burton. I should say Keaton did a nice job as both Wayne and Batman as he convinced audiences, i remembered when i was 7 seeing this movie on the big screen 6 times and i had nearly all the merchandise as i was Batman obsessed that year and i even ate the cereal plus i collected the comics since then but before that i was more into Superman, Swamp Thing, Aquaman and other DC heroes but this movie made me a bigger fan of Batman since despite Swamp Thing is still my favorite DC character. I even got this movie with the NES game for Christmas that year and i watched reruns of the 60's batman show all the time, hell i even saw all the Batman movies in theaters and even watched and taped the awesome animated show religiously all the time on Fox and WB. This movie is still excellent even in these days of Dark Knight mania, let's never forgot how Batman became dark again on film after the 60's with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You get approximately 1,000 user reviews from The Dark Knight that belittle what is obviously the ultimate comic book sequel. Roger Ebert, a man who vows to not review comic book movies even gave The Dark Knight a perfect score.This is coming from an avid fan of Burton, so, don't start reading this thinking, "just another Nolan fanboy." I wasn't a fan of Christopher Nolan until late 2008, really.Batman (1989) is one of the worst comic book adaptations, despite being done by Burton and a list of credible actors. However, it's not as bad as Spider-Man 3 or X-Men: The Last Stand.Jack Nicholson is nothing to be amazed by. Nicholson is not by any means worthy of any prowess acknowledgment. I say this as a former fan of Nicholson. However, revisiting his films as an adult, I've realized he's not playing anyone but himself. Hell, his name in almost all his movies are Jack. Ponder why? Heath Ledger completely changed the role of The Joker with his performance. It easily outshines Nicholson, without trying. Why? Because Ledger wasn't ever a villain, really. He never was psychotic. He became The Joker. Nicholson did the same old song and dance.Joel Schumacher is probably 60% at fault for ruining the franchise of Batman, but Burton is not innocent. Michael Keaton was the definitive Bruce Wayne, but never ever was I convinced that nobody couldn't figure out he was Batman. It's so easy to tell when he never disguised his voice the way Bale does in his performance.Danny Elfman's music is superb in almost any movie and as much as I like the soundtrack to Batman, I can't say that Elfman's music goes well to the film and the character(s). Honestly, this is not Nightmare Before Christmas anymore, but, I can still hear the music from it.I don't see how people still view this film as the better one. It's clearly full of problems. Especially with the fact that they gave Joker a name in this film. The secret and mystery of the Joker makes you terrify him even more.Why does nothing happen with Harvey Dent? Why did the screenplay mix up the Joker's face disfigurement with the way that Dent loses half his face? It's beyond ridiculous the way this story of Batman origins is played out.Batman Begins is a much better imaging of Batman and Bruce Wayne with the origins of the watchful protector.</fullReview>

As a kid, I used to enjoy Batman a lot. Hell, I even liked the Shoe-maker sequels. But that was eons ago and I have since repented for my bad taste in movies. Keaton is barely acceptable as batman and pathetic as Wayne. Nicholson goes way over the top and is not even half as menacing as Ledger. Basinger is good eye candy, but here she is annoying.

		<shortDescription>My Conflicted Account Of Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, let me offer my formal welcomes to the Batman/Batman review. I can try with all of my willpower, but that can't stop me from comparing Tim Burton's interpretation of Batman with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I PROMISE I will keep things in perspective and be as fair to Batman as I can. Just know that I'm a youngster and Christopher Nolan's Batman films are what I'm accustomed to. So, these are simply my OPINIONS in black and white. You don't have to agree, I'm just putting them out there. Please don't hate me for having them. And here we ... go! Michael Keaton vs. Christian Bale. This round goes to Mr. Bale by way of total knockout. It's much easier to compare these two Bruce Wayne/Batmen than the Jokers because the their portrayal isn't radically different. Granted, Bale's Batman is more of an outcast, more of a vigilante than a hero, unlike Keaton's Batman, who ends up a rejoiced symbol. That aside, Batman still has the same "birth", if you will, the murder of his parents before his eyes. That is what changed Bruce Wayne. And I think Michael Keaton was a little too timid in his performance to really delve into the psychological aspect of that initiation. He seemed... terrible. His performance as Bruce was very... diluted. Mr. Bale was more erratic and obsessive, he truly captured an edgier side of Mr. Wayne. As far as the role of the Batman, Michael Keaton was fine. Just fine. I missed the guttural voice. Michael Keaton played a stonier Batman, Christian Bale played a more crazed Batman. And it may be due to the suit, but Bale's Batman was a bit more graceful. Jack Nicholson vs. Heath Ledger. Ah, the famous Joker debate. I've wanted in on this for a LONG time. But it's a difficult comparison, the direction of the characters are opposite the spectrum. So I'll tell you which Joker characterization I liked best: The Dark Knight's. Ledger's Joker was more obscure, he had no past, no name. And he wasn't, at all, silly. He was an intelligent, lethal, psycho with an OBJECTIVE. He was tormented. He was more realistic. I liked that better than the clown-like Joker we saw in Tim Burton's Batman. Nicholson's Joker was just deranged; his weapons were sophomoric. But he was funnier. All in all, The Dark Knight's Joker wins. As far as Jack and Heath's acting as their Jokers... I think they're on par with each other. Heath Ledger was amazing in The Dark Knight. Period. He made the movie darker, wittier, and a lot more terrifying. Jack Nicholson was also incredible. He was engulfed in lunacy, dancing and grinning with gusto and charisma. And just because I lean more toward Ledger's side in this epic battle, I still love Jack Nicholson. He was a great Joker, and he is a very talented actor. I couldn't think of anyone else to portray Tim Burton's Joker, it was his Joker. Alfred. Michael Caine wins. No argument. He was a wiser, more compassionate, stable figure for Bruce. Michael Caine's Alfred is a real story component.Burton's Gotham. Tim Burton... I love his vision. His movies always have an eerie, Halloween quality that is very stylized, and this movie was no exception. The city was creepy, burned looking. Ruined, terrified. It was great. Burton had HIS exclusive vision of Gotham, and he saw it to fruition. The execution of his Gotham was, again, level with Nolan's sleek, corrupted Gotham. The plot. Eh, I didn't like it. At all, to be honest. I'm used to a sophisticated Batman, and this was a bit ridiculous. The flying Bat-plane had me face palming. The Joker's origin was just plain asinine... Jack Napier falling into radioactive fluid. Really? Being shot is one thing. But surviving radiation is a bit of a stretch. Tainting the cosmetics was interesting. Just... weird. And the love story. Don't get me started. I strictly believe in a movie like this, romance should take second place to action; I felt like Michael Keaton was more often Bruce Wayne than he was Batman. The Bat mobile was a little cheesy looking. But I said I'd be fair, it looked good for its time. The Tumbler is just cooler. As for the plot twist, this means more spoilers: I HATED IT! Jack Napier being Bruce's parents' killers! It was like writers were looking for a good Batman-Joker confrontation outlet, it was bad. And the fact that Jack had pointed the gun at Bruce, and then just decided, never mind. And the whole idea would have been better if Michael Keaton had played up Batman's anger: if Batman had REACTED! The ending. Again, a total opposite from The Dark Knight. As I mentioned previously, Tim Burton's Batman ended up the hero. Which wasn't so much bad as it was predictable. I wanted to like this movie more; I have high expectations for Batman, and I'm a huge Batman fan. I just don't think all the elements were there, even with the story it presented. It seemed to me to be the rough draft of a potentially cool Batman movie, and I say this without The Dark Knight in mind. Some things about this film were pinpoint, others fell flat. Which is why, I give this movie a 5/10. Feel free to disagree. Thanks for reading!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I did get enjoyment out of this title, i think it is unfair to call it a masterpiece. Tim Burton drowns the subject matter of the movie out with his visual style. Although the movie has plenty of merits, comic book continuity is not one of them. The joker in this movie fits in neither with his pre-comics-code incarnation or his campy post-comics-code incarnation. The most Impressive aspect of this movie is Michael Keaton's portrayal of batman, proving further that Michael Keaton deserves a spot among the greats. So while i enjoy Tim Burton flicks, this is not what i would call his masterpiece, nor would i call it a breakthrough in the realm of batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton sucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think an origin story is always necessary for the first entry in any superhero movie franchise. However, Tim Burton decided to ignore Batman's almost entirely here. Sure, he gives us a glimpse of how Bruce Wayne's parents were killed in front of him as a child, but that's about it. We don't get to see how he becomes Batman nor does he answer the question of "where does he get those wonderful toys?" That's part of why "Batman Begins" was so awesome. We got to see all of that good stuff. It was important to be able to understand how an orphaned rich kid could be transformed into one of the world's greatest crime fighters. In Tim Burton's version, the movie starts and Batman's an already established crime fighter?why? I think this movie had a pretty stupid plot. It's even worse than Lex Luthor's from the original "Superman" movie. The Joker wants to poison everyday hygiene products causing death to all who use them. Seriously? That's the best they could come up with? This movie also violated a rule which I think should be adhered to in almost all situations?You don't kill off any villains. Doing so only keeps you from bringing them back in future installments, and that's never good to burn a bridge like that. Besides, if you're going to kill off a character, never make it the flagship villain in a superhero's rogues' gallery.I really wasn't impressed with Jack Nicholson's Joker, either. I think that for as famous of actor as Nicholson is, he really could've done better than what he did. Instead of becoming the character, Nicholson just played the character as himself. Not too impressive. I read that Robin Williams was in consideration for the part, either that, or he was being used as a way of trying to bait Nicholson. In my opinion, I think Williams has shown himself to be quite the accomplished dramatic actor and I would've been curious to see what he could've done with the part. I think it's sad they didn't give him the chance to show what he could do.Michael Keaton did a pretty good job as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He's not very charismatic, but he is brooding. You can tell he's got an edge to him, and particularly in the scene where he wants to "get nuts," you can tell he's got a temper, which I think Batman should obviously have. Keaton looked pretty good in the suit, but the suit had its limitations, namely in the fact he couldn't turn his head in it because of how it was made, and that made his movements look rather robotic at times.In short, I don't think Tim Burton did Batman justice because instead of doing what needed to be done to transition the character from comic book page to movie screen, it seems all he wanted to do was "Burtonize" him, and his world. It just didn't feel right to me, but I will say at least he helped to change the public perception of Batman away from his campy Caped Crusader image that stemmed from his appearance in the 1960s TV show to a darker, edgier Batman, but that's about his only contribution. The plot, some of the casting, and style was pretty much a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch this after you've watched The Dark Knight!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Batman is a cartoon kind of Batman,surreal,sometimes poor and silly and with mistakes in the script.Although what the whole film is about is presenting a demented Joker and a Nicholoson at his best. The problem is that if you've watched The Dark Knight(as i did)before having watched Batman,you'll probably end up not liking at all the latter.I have to say that the comparison is inevitable,since Dark Knight is a top class action/Batman film.If you try to get Ledger's Joker and generally the Dark Knight out of your head,you'll enjoy this one.It's not great cinematography nor Burton's best of,but it's entertaining.However it's definitely one of Nicholoson's best performances,a mix of Shining's Jack and One Flew Over The Cucoo's Nest McMurphy.Keaton does a good job as Batman(despite the awful rubber costume)and Basinger tries to be convincing,but sometimes fails to do so.I give 6,5/10 because of it's good performances and fun parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.As with Gilliam, Tim Burton isn't a real filmmaker, rather a production designer with a quirky taste. He creates a feel and shoves in the usual elements of characters and story and such. But the idea is that the `feel' of the thing will be enough to sell tickets. That quirkiness worked for me with `Ed Wood' which was essentially about the same thing (and had a particularly reflexive actor). But generally, his projects fail.The idea here is to wrap it in immense publicity, nostalgic memory and some (then) bankable stars. But if you look at this now, you'll see bankrupt production design. Its not cleverly quirky. Just bad.No matter in the long run. Burton knew he screwed up. He got it right the next time. Very right.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie stars JACK NICHOLSON as the Joker! Goodness me! I guess this movies only selling point is a selling point that did the job well enough as there is little else here to recommend it.Dull, dull, dull is the keyword here. Slow, slow, slow is that words counterpart.Jack Nicholson is what this movie is all about. No more, no less. It should have been called Nicholson. SEE! Jack Nicholson prancing about with a silly grin! SEE! Some irrelevant guy in a cape running around without a silly grin (Batman). SEE! Two hours of turgid entertainment that has little to keep the viewer watching except Jack 'Goodness Me!' Nicholson.I shall now declare a national holiday. I shall call it Goodness Me Day in honour of the fact that this movie stars Jack Nicholson.(Goodness me.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Darkest/Dullest/Depressing Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie years ago on its opening weekend on a first date. She is long gone but my memory of how terrible this film is still fresh. Actually we both hated it and each of us wanted to walk out but each thought the other liked it so we staid put. Interminably boring...I mean who wrote this stuff, "I'm Batman", geesh this isn't shakespeare. And by the way what passes for a plot, plot, what plot. It was neither interesting or original. There actually was a TV Batman episode where the Joker took on the pop art world with is blank canvas and Pollockesque dribbles on a tabletop. Not to mention a fight scene in the museum.Then let's talk about the real wack-o Bruce Wayne, let's see traumatized by the murder of his parents, he swears revenge, holes up in a dark cave, a techno=geek who lifts weights and has the skills of a tightrope walker. Secret identity? Secret from whom? I guess he also builds cars and airplanes on the side. Can't you just see it..your working at Wayne Industries when Bruce stops by and says, "Make me an armored car that seats one on the armrest, has a jet turbine engine, computer remote controls and shoots flames on command, oh, and paint it black. Now wouldn't that make you a bit suspicious of what old Bruce is doing on the swing shift?This movie is so full of holes it should be called Batman moves to Switzerland and makes cheese.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was EMBARRASSING!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's concept of his original Batman was VERY hard to take seriously. First off, it was set in cartoon like settings and the criminal characters had not been developed like they were in the reboot. The most noticeable character change by far is the Joker. Jack Nicholson's Joker was simply mad and wanted revenge for his mutilation. Heath Ledger's Joker lived and breathed the belief that all society is corruptible and he could turn any person to the dark side. Tim Burton had a hard time sustaining my interest in the story with the lack of special effects that was so desperately needed. I am VERY glad that this movie was chosen for a reboot and the outcome was "The Dark Knight"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stingy piece of work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie boggles me. Actually not the movie, but the fact that it grossed nearly 250 million at the Box Office. Why do retarded movies like this make it big? Maybe it was just the "batman" name. But what I don't understand is why it made it with the cartoon like script. "Ohhh I am throwing money out in the street. Come get it and I'll kill you all! Let's gas them!" This movie not only makes me want to beat it over my knee with my cartoon script that I made when I was 9, but also look out into the world, or USA and say, what monster have you created? In short, a cartoon with a childish script, that should have gotten no further than Saturday morning cartoons. Instead of going to see a great film like Ghostbusters 2, or any other great movies made back in 1989, America dwells on a pathetic, lazy, and inconsiderate attempt to entertain us. What a joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Me 'Batman Begins' or 'The Dark Knight'; this is trash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sure hope, for my own sake, that those who wrote most of the reviews I just read aren't professional critics! This movie is, without a doubt, positive proof that Jack Nicholson is most often an appalling actor, one-note and overrated, whose talent is almost as lacking as his taste in role choices. His only ability seems to be playing sociopaths, crazies, loons...characters of that nature. Even in his "romantic comedies," his characters are practically always certifiable and badly portrayed! Sure, there are rare exceptions (i.e. The Shining,) but for the most part, he is a poor excuse for an actor. Not only does he have no range, but he, along with nearly everyone else in the movie-watching crowd of the world, seems to think that he's a great actor, one of the best! It's a hideous case of a persona being massively over-hyped! Not only that, but his portrayal of the Joker has got to be the single worst performance of his entire career! I can't believe people actually watch this drivel! In fact, the only three things worse than Jack's bland, cookie-cutter act are Kim Basinger's overdone and, yet, emotionally unconvincing performance, Michael Keaton's effort, which makes Basinger's role look like a slice of heaven, and the movie itself. This is, without a doubt, the most overrated and least deserving comic book movie ever made! Even the later Batman movies were better; at least they were entertaining in their stupidity! At least they had style, and didn't "pretend" to be something they could never be in a million years! At least Jim Carrey, Danny DeVito, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman and their cohorts were fun to watch! I'm just so disappointed that the masses are convinced by this film! Give me 'Batman Begins' or, more importantly, 'The Dark Knight!' Compared to them, this is trash of the lowest order!</fullReview>
