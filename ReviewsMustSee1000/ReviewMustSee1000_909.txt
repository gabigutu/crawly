		<shortDescription>No action, all mood ? but it goes down like a cool beer on a hot summer evening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cult classic - and yet still relatively little known. Jim Jarmusch is a master when it comes to creating atmosphere (and nobody uses stretches of silence to better comedic effect than he does). Shot in beautiful black and white, this tale of three prisoners who make for very unlikely companions is all mood, deadpan humour and practically no action.Don't expect a story - just enjoy the ride, the dialogues (consisting mainly of the word 'F***' - unless it's Benigni talking: his chaotic, broken English lines are another highlight of the film) and the fantastic soundtrack by John Lurie and Tom Waits. Perhaps the epitome of a cult movie, this one goes down like a cool beer on a hot summer evening (and as with all cult movies, it is best seen with an audience that already knows and loves the film). A minimalistic comedy masterpiece. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle grace masquerades as jail-break film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most frequently heard criticisms of Jarmusch's work is that the pace is slow. I would like to make a case for patience. After all, if true beauty and grace were delivered in one massive hit, our poor brains and hearts would not withstand the blow. In Down By Law, Jarmusch invites us to take some time, some real time and devote it to getting deeply involved with his characters. Men in crisis. Misfits, jailbirds, heartbreakingly human. We accompany them on their journey, their escape from their confines. It is a truly epic journey on a small geographical scale. We watch as they begin to mirror one another, as their individual egos become inextricably enmeshed in one another. We watch a friendship form. And how can we begrudge the time Jarmusch takes for this glorious exposition? How can we do anything but marvel at the fine detail in which the scenes are drawn, at the subtle movements of our heroes? Every gesture signifies worlds of meaning and consequence. And Jarmusch does it better, with more skill and with more compassion than anyone. If you are prepared to get involved, if you are brave enough to commit to the journey, you will be rewarded with a kind of epiphany that few films can offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pure Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of three different men (Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni) in a Louisiana prison and their eventual journey.This film is a natural progression from "Stranger Than Paradise". Lurie returns as a lead, and the music of Screamin' Jay Hawkins is replaced with Tom Waits. If Hawkins and Waits know each other, I have no idea, but their music styles are not far removed.Although Waits is among my favorite actors (he excels at playing villains), the standout performance here is Benigni. How much English he knew at the time I am not sure, but he brings a comic mischief to the film, and is the most light-hearted despite being potentially the most dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great movie by Jim Jarmusch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a couple of Jarmusch movies and except for Dead Man (which I thought was an incredible bore), they were all great.Down By Law is probably one his best known flicks and is a very good low budget movie. It features Tom Waits, who's not only a fine musician but proves to be a decent actor as well; John Lurie, who also wrote the excellent soundtrack (Waits delivered the opening and end-credits track btw); Roberto Benigni, who nowadays is most famous for directing the Oscar-winning Italian film "La Vita E Bella".The movie deals about three guys who meet in prison and escape. It reminded me of "O Brother Where Are Thou?" and, perhaps because of it being filmed in black and white, of old 40's movies about escaping prisoners (can't think of a good example, but you get the picture).Three things I liked very much about this movie:1. It's incredibly funny, especially Benigni made me laugh every time he opened his mouth - He irritated me highly in "La Vita E Bella" so that must mean something....2. The frame of the camera is very well used. Look at the scene where Lurie counts the money and a hooker is laying behind him on the bed and the scene after that. Another example is when Benigni is dancing with a lady and the other two guys are continuing their breakfast in the back.3. It's very hard to pinpoint when the story takes place; it's timeless in more than one way, obviously helped by the lack of color.All in all, this one comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intricate filmmaking, a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Down by Law is a film that has mesmerized me for years. The first time I saw it, it sunk into me like the smile from a homeless person. It told me something I should've already known.I've heard people use the word "quirky", when drawing comparisons to a Jarmusch character, but, I like the phrase: "Spot On". He has captured man's fear within himself, and, the ability to hide that fear. It takes a director of great courage and knowledge of self to pull that one off without boring you.If you're a fan of Joel Schumaucher or James Cameron, this is not the film for you. But if your a fan of people, and, the human condition, the mirror reflects back, 2 hours at a time, and Jarmusch is right behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true embodient of cinematic poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law is one of the closest things I've seen to poetry on film, but not poetry in the sense of dialog nor musicality; poetry in the sense that this is a film that fully understands the beauty of cinema and cinematic presentation. The film opens by slowly panning the camera to the left through the town of New Orleans, which looks to be such an interesting and quietly beautiful place that it seems almost criminal of Jarmusch to inevitably confined to the four walls of a prison. Jarmusch presents us New Orleans as a city that basks in its imperfections and naturalism, cast through beautiful black and white cinematography and set to the glorious, almost jazzy sounds of John Lurie and Tom Waits, who also star in the film. The opening four minutes, and the remainder of the film, with its shot-structure, the intense focus on characters instead of plot and the action, and the dense visuals on display, showcases some of the deepest beauty and poetry of which cinema is capable.The film opens by focusing on three separate men, unknown to each other at the time, as they are each arrested and booked before being places in the same cell. Both Zack (Tom Waits), a B-grade disc jockey and Jack (John Lurie), a full-time pimp, have been set up by outsiders, whilst their cellmate Bob (Roberto Benigni) is an Italian tourist, who speaks broken English, is in jail for manslaughter. Upon showing each of their arrests, the three spend time in their cramped cell playing cards and engaging in occasionally hostile conversation, particularly Zack and Jack, whereas Bob finds himself rather positive about the entire situation.After not spending too much time in the clink, the three men decide they want out and craft what may indeed be the most anticlimactic prison break in the history of cinema. The three proceed to run for the hills, eventually crossing the humid bayou of New Orleans into unknown territory. The three men, in turn, try to seek refuge in the middle of nowhere until law enforcement dies down and the three can form a plan of how they want to spend their lives on the run.One criticism I can foresee about Down by Law is how unremarkable the prison break actually is; it's literally a fade-to-black sequence where, one moment, the three are behind bars, then the next, the three are escaping through an underground tunnel. However, this is further proof that Jarmusch doesn't have any desire to make this film about process and narrative plot-pointing. At the end of the day, that sets up developed situations and locations and not always developed, instrumental characters that are instrumental to the story. Jarmusch makes this film entirely focused on dialog and eccentricities of the characters; consider the famous "ice cream" scene in prison, where Zack defines the act of "screaming" to Bob, who then recalls the common phrase of "I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream," adding his Italian drawl to the phrase. The three men begin to harmlessly chant and dance around their cell, eventually inciting the majority of the unseen prisoners to chant. The scene is humorous because of its inanity and general harmlessness; out of all the things that could happen in a prison between three men, the fact that Jarmusch included this is hilarious in itself.The film persists on with many low-key, delightful scenes like this, and never does Jarmusch run out of ideas for these characters. The only fault here is that he does, admittedly, take a bit too long to get going, lingering on the opening scenes of how these men are put into prison instead of watching them spend time behind bars. Uniformly, however, this is a film of cinematic poetry, defined largely by its flawless cinematography - done by Robby Müller in a manner that accentuates the natural beauty of the locales - in addition to Jarmusch's slow-moving camera pans that make for a nice touch of stylistic flair to a film that could've ostensibly been made without any. Then there's the dynamic abilities of the actors and the hilarity of Jarmusch's screen writing that further complement the film and its wits; Down by Law is one of the quirkiest pieces of American independent cinema to be found in the 1980's and that, in addition to its dialog and lovable, if scummy, characters add that extra layer of craft.Starring: Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Bengini. Directed by: Jim Jarmusch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>atmospheric without much tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New Orleans, Radio DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is berated by his girlfriend Laurette (Ellen Barkin) for losing his job. He gets $1000 to drive a car across town but the cops stop him and find a dead body in the trunk. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who is offered a new young white girl. Before he notices that she's underage, cops bust in and arrest him. They end up in the same cell and Roberto (Roberto Benigni) who speaks little English is brought in. He writes down phrases that strike him. He tells them that he's a card cheat who killed a man with the pool 8-ball. Then he leads them on a breakout.The camera lingers in slow moving long continuous scenes. The sparse settings give a surreal feel to it all. Everything has a dreamlike quality. It has an interesting atmosphere but it doesn't have much tension which is Jim Jarmusch's style.</fullReview>

It is really a story that transcends even realism and belongs to the realm of literature, music and art. One cannot claim to know anything about movies without having seen this one.

		<fullReview>I first saw Down By Law when it first came out, and loved it. I watched it again recently, and it really hasn't aged at all. In fact, it has gotten even better. I'm not sure there's another movie like it (unless the other Jarmusch ones are -- I haven't seen them). There are very few movies that spend so much time on character development that still have great plots. Like the "Big Easy" where it is filmed, this one takes its time but has an easy charm once the plot gets where it was going. The dialogue is wonderfully written, and better acted. Each scene is like a work of art in how it is staged. The soundtrack uses one of the best albums ever recorded, "Rain Dogs" by Tom Waits, who stars. One of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah, it's a sad and beautiful world buddy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Down by Law initially oozes atmosphere. Robby Müller captures the grime and shabbiness of New Orleans with a crispness and exoticism. The sky is at its blackest, but he has assembled lights that cast long, lean shadows that go beyond the reach of the tiny lamps that line the roads. The characters wear pure white or the darkest black. The score is heavily percussive, with a mischievous bass line, and a snazzy, rhythmic brass. It is almost like a jungle beat; Jarmusch has made the suburban setting tropical, with the slight sheen of sweat on the foreheads, and a slight humid breeze that sweeps through the lonely streets. Half of its inhabitants are surly, shady figures that flit from corner to corner (with half of those police). Zack sits drunkenly at the back door of some half empty bar, and croons: "It's a sad and beautiful world...". And that it is. Later, he makes his call to no one in particular, and swigs vigorously from his bottle.The main characters have no further aspirations beyond the fuzzy boundaries of this town, but they do not care. Jarmusch creates a prison where it is easy to fall into a comfortable lull, blowing money, having fun, f*cking up today and caring little about tomorrow. The metaphorical cell door could be left wide open, but Zack and Jack would not try to walk through it. Yet they also do not fully succumb to the pressures of the evils that beckon them. Abuse is not only suggested but sent as an open invitation. A teary girlfriend screams at Zack to hit him, but he relents. Jack's only loyal girl philosophises that if he were a true pimp, he would discipline her by beating her. Women are meant to be commodities in this world; see the seller of the goods, heavyset and with a slight lisp, stumble into the room with an offering of peace and goodwill. Is the little girl in on it? Either way, it's a scummy move in a scummy town. But inevitably it switches from a neo-noir into a buddy film. Historically these are usually duos, but it applies here too, only because Waits and Lurie are all but the same person (even their names don't hide much). They are played against Roberto Benigni, who channels his inner clown and hammy Italian accent to stick out like a sore thumb. The film's revelations rest on Bob's philosophising, which in itself only just leans on the fetishisation of the simple truths told through his broken English. At times it reaches almost infantile heights of glee and careless abandon, as the trio lead the whole cell block into a chant for ice cream. Benigni nevertheless grows on you. He makes a manslaughter charge into a stand-up routine, and his accent does the rest, pleading for his innocence: "Very good ball. Dead. Very big man." And when he provides sustenance for the quarrelling little boys, he makes the simple act of cooking a rabbit into a touching journey into the past, and re-affirms his father figure status and the nature of his care.A pity, then, that the twins are still at each other's throats by the end of the film. They float on the Louisiana bayou, the camera gliding along with them, and the journey is meant to turn inward, to promote spiritual growth and drive. But the outer is not matched by the inner; whether they are floating along or stuck in the mud, and they are still static in their personalities. Jack and Zack are withdrawn at the beginning, and barely much more by the end. The redemption is merely implied in the closing shot, nothing more than simple symbolism. And does Bob deserve that fairytale ending, stumbling across the quaint cottage in the middle of the woods with a Italian counterpart of his own? There must be something more than just skin deep here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly eccentric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to be in a very particular type of mood to properly tune into a Jim Jarmusch film. He populates his often black and white and always slightly mournful films with awkward, dazed individuals who are more comfortable in the uncertain pauses between dialogue than the actual words themselves. When I feel like a Jarmusch film (other than Dead Man which is an all timer for me) it's always during times when I feel the daydreamy grey matter coming on, an otherworldly, downbeat relaxation that his work is rife with. Down By Law is a signature example of this, and most likely the film I connect with most of his, after Dead Man. This one concerns three wayward and very different souls who by fate and unfortunate circumstance end up in jail together. Zach (Tom Waits) is a radio DJ who is hounded by his girlfriend (Ellen Barkin) to be more proactive and less relaxed. Jack (John Lurie) is a laid back pimp, and they both find themselves incarcerated in a Louisiana prison where they meet the eccentric Italian tourist Roberto (Roberto Benigni, hilarious). The trio are a puzzling gaggle of misfits, moments of startling pathos and stinging humour sprouting as their time together goes on. Soon they discover that Roberto may know of a way to escape, and see it as their chance. The characters in any given Jarmusch film never seem the same as usual film archetypes; they're always quirky and completely their own person, which is no doubt a product of a very intuitive directorial process, and an excellent relationship with the actors. It can be disarming to spend time with such distinct people in film, but when you stop to realize just how weird everyone around you in real life is vs. what is common for movie scripts, it feels genuine. This one is lived in, authentic and funny in that intangible way where you can't even say why it's so hilarious. We all a- scream for ice a-scream!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 men end up in a prison cell. And then they escape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a story about how 3 men meet in a prison cell. Their escape, and their evolving relationship. Cast in the swamps of Louisiana, in black and white. It has a slow and underplayed mood to it, which is a delight to watch. When the movie came out in 1986, it stood out as different and daring. It attempts to tell a simple story, while giving room for the viewer to enjoy the mood of events unfolding. It doesn't use cheap Hollywood tricks to lure us into a desire to want more. No. It simply tells the story about how 3 men meet, and part. In a calm and honest way. I was crazy about the movie when it first came out, because it was so different from everything else I had seen. It's tempo was slow, and that was unusual for an American movie. But today this sense of calm narrating has become common in movies. See the movie as a meditation. It's simple plot allows the director (Jim Jarmush) to focus wholeheartedly on the human aspect of the story. It is one of the best movies of it's own time. I highly recommend it to everyone who likes the subtle aspects of human life. (PS: I haven't even told you about the music made by Lurie and Waits. It's topclass)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Altogether I think that the film, "Down By Law" (1986) by Jim Jarmusch featuring Tom Waits, is one of cinema's finest noir pieces, an obvious montage through the arts of it's time period, but held together at it's essence, which is the perceived voyeur's agreements with the sometimes awkwardly staggered and dragging exaggerations made by the true minds of the film. This context within context is somewhat familiar to the actors and writers whose hand at the work is seen like a stark author's stencil's dark shading on the texture of the characters at work in the movie. The exemplary effort given by the both the entire teams of the production and writing seem to fit seamlessly as though the stages were set and the actions seemed to flow out of the actors through the piece in the easiest, while at the same time, most mind-blowing orchestration through which the music plays on the rhythm of the story, and viewer. Great early attempt by Jim Jarmusch in film-making, and a true classic. Special recognition, definitely, for Roberto Benigni who was truly fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Jarmusch: awkward but heartwarming camaraderie in the America of vacant, overgrown lots and other such blight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's DOWN BY LAW is one of the art-house productions that the American independent director made his name with in the 1980s.At this point in his career, Jarmusch wanted to depict not the glitzy, glamorous America of Hollywood films, but rather the side no one ever talks about: vacant lots overgrown with weeds, the ramshackle homes of the working poor, and empty suburban streets. As the film opens, Jarmusch sets the stage by depicting New Orleans from this angle in a series of shots made from a moving car. Only then we see how a small-town pimp (John Lurie) and an itinerant DJ (Tom Waits) get themselves arrested after they've each accepted a job from a seedy friend. They subsequently end up sharing a jail cell, into which one day an Italian immigrant (Roberto Benigni) is also placed. The plot of the film is the developing camaraderie between these three men. The Italian's bumbling antics act initially aggravate his cellmates -- Benigni's role serve as comic relief against the morose behavior of the other two characters. DOWN BY LAW begins as a drama portraying the underbelly of a Louisiana town, but by the end it has transformed into absurdist comedy.Lurie's acting is fine, representing his character convincingly as a pathetic d-bag. Benigni might seem like he's playing himself, but his English is reputedly much better than the broken phrases he offers in the film. Nicoletta Braschi appears as the Italian's love interest, a role that must have been easy to play since Benigni and her are married in real life. I've never thought Tom Waits was a great actor, however.In terms of cinematography, this is a major step forward for Jarmusch. Bringing on cameraman Robby Müller, most famous for his work with Wim Wenders in the 1970s, Jarmusch shot many scenes with blatant diagonals and claustrophobic framing that suggests the prison in which these characters do time. It's certainly the most geometrically striking film of Jarmusch's career.This is an entertaining film, with many fine touches. If I give it less than a rave, it's just because I can't completely get into these black and white portrayals of contemporary lowlifes (I have a problem with early Kaurismäki for the same reason--his aesthetic was very similar to Jarmusch's.) But I think this film has held up pretty well three decades after its release, and I'd recommend it for anyone looking to explore Jarmusch's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the first Jarmusch film I was about to watch, I really didn't know what to expect from 'Down by Law'.As a Roberto Benigni fan, I expected it to be quite amusing. And it was. It had a subtle humour, which worked for me, even though it was in low amount. However, I found out that Tom Waits and John Lurie performed great too. I actually believe that the good chemistry among the actors is what makes this movie enjoyable. Also the cinematography and Jarmusch's direction were very interesting.Perhaps the only drawback of 'Down by Law' is its lack of a true plot. Their escape should be just a little bit more detailed (Jarmusch didn't intend to give us many technical details about it, but I think he should). Of course if he focused only on that, he would ruin it.All in all, this movie contains good acting and some strange climate, which makes it a nice one to watch. However, some may find it boring. I wasn't enthused, but I definitely recommend it to a real cinephile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The three stooges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Down By Law might just be the definitive independent, low budget art-house flick that defined the movement throughout the 80s and 90s. Folks like Soderbergh, Tarantino, Kevin Smith, and Richard Linklater owe a lot to Jarmusch's farce. The black and white photography is stoic, the acting is self assured, and the story is very bare bones, but never does the film wink or nudge at you to make the viewer notice how cool it is.The film just emanates cool, precisely because it doesn't think so highly of itself. It just wants to tell its story, and leave.Tom Waits helps a lot, but John Lurie is also solid as a pimp/hustler, both serving time in a Louisiana prison after being framed by their contemporaries. Robert Begnini comes in later, to act as a foil between the group, and eventually serves as the inspiration for their escape.While together, the three are resourceful and manage to escape the prison, it is when they separate that they are at their most vulnerable, so the film makes use of a certain sort of vague truth. But I don't think Jarmusch was as concerned with inserting any particularly deep philosophy into this film. He was just telling a simple tale, but what it lacks in intellectual furor, it makes up for in atmosphere and style. And this is one stylish piece of work. It has the structure more of a five act play, so the dialogue and characters are entertaining enough to maintain your interest even when no real action is going on. There are no heart pounding chases through the swamp, no complex escape plan, and no real tragedy. But the low budget stylistics make the film resemble more of a post-modern Marx Brothers escapade than 'The Shawshank Redemption'.The soundtrack says it all, really. Slow beat, jazzy, and cool baby, real cool. If all else, see this movie for one of, if not the, first U.S. performance by Robert Begnini. Before he replaced Peter Sellers in "The Son of Pink Panther", he was a great character actor. For this, Jarmusch should also be commended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Male bonding, bumbling and natural behavior among three men on the fringe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the setup, I wasn't sure what this was about. We see Tom Waits and John Lurie each get set up, framed, and sent to jail. Each has a girl friend who is inessential to the story and disappears after these introductions, but they comment on these men and their lives.The men and their women are living in rundown areas and on the fringe. The movie does a great job photographically of immersing us in these poor areas and giving them a beauty all their own. And it is also as if to say that all the people we are seeing are human beings too and part of the world's stage, as well as all fools too as mortals be.Waits is a disc jockey who loses one job after another because he's independent. Lurie is a pimp.In jail they are joined by an Italian still learning the language, played very comically by Roberto Benigni. In fact, it is at that point that the comic element comes to the fore, as we see how these three men living in one cell interact with one another. And that becomes largely what this part of the movie is about. It's fairly unpredictable and amusing. Some of it may have been improvised. Although there are frictions, the men bond with one another, but not too much. Their circumstances influence how they behave toward one another.Although Benigni is slighter of build than his cell mates, can't speak English well, and seems a clown, his character continually brings us some surprises as the story develops. This adds to the fun.The three men escape jail, and the rest of the story follows them through the chase, the swamps of Lousiana and what refuges they can find. The comic element fades away to a large extent and the movie's tone becomes simply wry and ironic. An interesting moral situation occurs when, during the pursuit, Benigni cannot swim and the others must decide whether or not to save their own skins or risk losing them by helping Benigni.They are in an existential plight. The whole movie has this existential tone to it. The men do not philosophize. They don't ruminate much about the situations they find themselves in. They don't cooperate all that much. They don't for the most part exhibit much skill in the wilderness, yet they manage to make their way. Their leadership seems always to shift. It's an anarchic set of relations.They create their own humor and laughter, their own kind of poetry, even their own jail window. We see that men need art, poetry, laughter, friendship. They also need women, and this too is shown. They need on occasion to fight. These men living on the fringe that most of us will never meet show us some basic things about human life. This is a large virtue of this movie. The men behave naturally. With all of society's conventions, we need to be reminded that men have natures and behave naturally.This is a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet brilliance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmush once again flaunts his intelligence, eye for detail, and love of poetry in his quietly brilliant film, Down by Law. It's a film about three men with very different stories who all find themselves in the same cell in a New Orleans prison. Tom Waits plays Zack, a lowly radio DJ with no future. John Lurie is Jack, a wannabe pimp who doesn't really have a clue what he is doing but pretends like he does. And then there is Roberto Benigni as Roberto, an Italian tourist who is desperate to learn about American culture and language, but has come to the wrong part of town to find it. Together, these three oddball characters escape from prison and go on a weird and offbeat, existential journey through the New Orleans swamp land.On the surface Down by Law seems like little to nothing. But it is the quiet subtleties that make this a rather ingenious film. On the surface it is a story of three strange men who escape from prison together. But Jarmush mixes in his witty dialect, astute characterization, and clever allusions to poetry that carry throughout the film to make it more than just a prison escape film. He disguises a sophisticated ingenuity about the film underneath simple quirkiness. He plays up a lively and rather simplistic nuance, only to sprinkle the film with a more intelligent air. The film really does feel like a smart film, whether you can place where the intelligence comes from or not.However, that's not to say that this film isn't fun, as well as funny. Zack, Jack, and Roberto are three great characters and they work so well together. They all have their odd quirks and strange mannerisms that make them all very unique people. There is some great banter between the three and plenty of moments that aren't necessarily laugh out loud hysterical, but pleasantly funny, eliciting a chuckle of approval. And then of course the unique way Jarmush shoots the film also makes it a very interesting watch for those with a keen eye for unique directorial ability. Down by Law is an effective exercise in intelligent shot framing as Jarmush shoots the entire film with very long still shots, or very long shots that make only subtle movements, making the direction of this film silently brilliant. Add to that the skillful black and white cinematography and it is safe to call this film a subtly excellent visual experience.Jim Jarmush almost always impresses us with his great usage of minimalist filmmaking techniques. He creates such unique stories that all have such quiet excellence that they become remarkably unforgettable films, even if you don't pick up on their brilliance the first one or two viewings. Down by Law may be one of his quietest exaltations of skillful minimalist filmmaking, but it is still an excellent film. Jarmush tells his story exactly how he wants to tell it, and he gives us, the audience, a unique experience to remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only persons I was familiar with in this movie when I started watching it were Ellen Barkin and Tom Waits (Waits as a singer with a very distinct singing style). I knew from previews that the storyline was about three prison escapees but I never realized that by the end of the film, I would be so totally satisfied in a yarn that had taken me on a fascinating journey through New Orleans. The viewer gets to see the down side of New Orleans and some of the 'countryside' during the movie, but the ending is a work of art. I loved the fact that there was no violence or the usual 'blood-letting', but most importantly, having been filmed in black and white, the film obviously relied on the characters and the story to keep the audiences in their seats. As in any sort of photography, black and white will triumph over color if the subject is exceptional. This is certainly the case here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film should be praised, as one of the best films to date. To many it is very boring, but for those people who have the patience to sit through it, its very worthwhile seeing it. The b&amp;w film (which is Jarmush's signature touch) adds a great effect throughout the whole movie. The long, drawn-out scenes help the audience connect with the 3 characters, and the characters subtle friendships expand. The long scenes, also show the dreadful boringness of isolation (particularly in the OPP.) The acting is very well done as well. His style makes the movie a great one. It is comedic, dramatic, and adventurous all in one film. I strongly suggest you see it, or any of Jarmush's work for that matter. Coffee&amp;Cigarettes, is also very good, of what i saw. SEE THIS MOVIE! (if you can find it)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Cecilia Stark's Aunt Lottie character in Stranger Than Paradise, Roberto Benigni breathes a breath of fresh air in the picture when he is put into a Louisiana cell with two other prisoners. He was an unknown at the time this came out and would win best actor 13 years later. John Lurie players a similarly self-centered SOB he played in Stranger Than Paradise as does Tom Waits' character. Both are framed for child prostitution and murder respectively and end up in prison locked up constantly living a continuously mundane life, unlike what has been previously shown in prison movies. After Benigni appears in their cell entertaining and amusing them, the three decide to make a break into the marshes and bayous of southern Louisiana. I'd recommend this highly for art-house afficonados.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Swedish guy saw below the surface of Jarmusch' 'Down by Law'. To his mind Jarmusch has much more to tell than just making a 'great prison comedy' which is obvious in many of his other films too.The three main characters of this film are representing true psychological types of our time. They are not just funny, even if Jarmusch likes to call his very serious films 'comedies'. So did Aristophanes about his plays, and funny they are, both Jarmusch and Aristophanes, but that does not strip their message from being quite profound.Anyhow, some prefer the surface, some the depths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may very well be a mans' journey film, actually literally, but philosophically, it's still one that serves to be a reminder of all of the things in life and about how our choices eventually need to come to a head. The three lead actors are very naturalistic, except Benigni who seems to overdo it at times. The writing and the directing are typical Jarmusch, and we are able to experience just what he is feeling in every frame. So typical that audiences themselves will be wondering what is going on, and seeing as how it's plot less besides the obvious already in the summary, only Jarmusch fans who know what they're getting into will not be surprised by its narrative. If anything, it's one of his plottier films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down by law: An ideal film for you if you want to discover Jim Jarmusch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is true that "Down by law" is a film which has been made for his actor as well as musician friends, director Jim Jarmusch has been able to capture a certain type of melancholic mood. It is a mood which affects many capricious men.This film has been built around such American men who do not seem to realize the importance of American culture.It is for this reason that they do not have much to say when an Italian man with little knowledge of English speaks to them enthusiastically about his appreciation of icons of American literature Robert Frost and Walt Whitman.The excessive use of vulgar language especially the incessant use of "F" word might be difficult for some viewers to digest.However,Jarmusch has ensured that for his film a conventional story does not matter as despite the lack of a clearly defined narrative structure,strengths and weaknesses of all characters have been nicely revealed.This film boasts of a good soundtrack with some mellifluous tunes which can be hummed anywhere,anytime.Lastly,'Down by law' is a good film to watch even when the viewers get to know that the real action of the film starts after 1 hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The road not taken, by "Bob" Frost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since "Stranger than Paradise," I have loved and sought out quirky filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. He has an unusual sense of humor and an unusual way of presenting his films. Sometimes they're episodic, like Coffee &amp; Cigarettes, Mystery Train, and Night on Earth, and sometimes they tell the story of bizarre people brought together by bizarre circumstances."Down by Law" is about three men who meet in a New Orleans prison, Zack, Jack, and Roberto (Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni). Zack is a DJ who took $1000 to drive a car, but there was a body in the trunk. Jack is a pimp sent out to check out a new prospect who turns out to be underage, and the police are waiting. We only hear Roberto's story from his lips - he apparently threw a billiard ball at someone and the person died. The three men manage to escape into a swamp and woods.Roberto quotes (in Italian) the man he refers to as "Bob Frost" and there is the symbol in the film of "The Road Not Taken" when a fork in the road is reached. One thing that cracked me up was the same thing that cracked me up in "Stranger than Paradise" - in that film, everywhere the characters went looked exactly the same as the crummy neighborhood and weather they left in Chicago. It didn't matter if it was in Florida or at the aunt's house - it was always overcast and awful. Here, the three men escape and wind up in a building to spend the night that looks just like their prison cell.Benigni, as the cheerful, chatty one is hilarious, and what happens to him is even funnier - and could only have happened to that character. Waits and Lurie give solid performances in less showy roles - another element of Jarmusch is his unusual casting."Down by Law" is done in stark black and white; rarely does Jarmusch work in color. It gives this film a downbeat atmosphere, along with the garbage in the neighborhood streets, the swamp, and the woods.There are slow sections but if you want to see this unique director's work, I recommend it. No one tells a story, or chooses what story to tell, quite like he does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down by Law</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers), this film featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die sounded like a different kind of film from the director commonly known for his darker dramas and comedies, and it was film I looked forward to. Basically out of work DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is set up when he is hired by a mob to drive a "clean" car from a bar to a city but he is arrested when a dead body is found by police in the trunk, and pimp Jack (John Lurie) is set up when one of his enemies sends him to meet a girl who wants to "work for him" but it turns out it is a child and the police arrest him on molestation charges. Zack and Jack ignore each other for some time, but they do eventually talk about neither one of them being guilty for the crimes they were arrested, there is a point when they come to blows because of the enclosed space and they stop talking. It is only months later when they are joined by a third cell mate, Italian tourist Roberto (Life Is Beautiful's Roberto Benigni) who speaks only a little English but has an enthusiastic and optimistic attitude, despite the fact that he is guilty of his crime on manslaughter. The three prisoners form a close friendship, and Roberto turns out not just to be good company for Zack and Jack, but he has devised a way for the three of them to escape the prison, and soon enough one night they manage to do it. They get away and are forced to run through the swampy wilderness surrounding the prison, and they do whatever they can to avoid detection from the authorities and sniffer dogs searching for them, there is a point when Zack and Jack fall out again and threaten splitting, but Roberto helps again providing food. Eventually the three prisoners find themselves on a road, so they choose a direction to take on it, and they are happy to find a forest house, Roberto is the one that enters and hopes not to be caught out, while the other wait for the all clear, but their friend takes a while. When they enter the house themselves Zack and Jack find that their Italian chum has fallen in love with the lady living there, Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi) who is also from Italy, and she allows them to stay with her until the searching by the authorities lessens. In the end, with new clothes, Zack and Jack set about leaving and going their own ways, Roberto says he is going to stay with Nicoletta as they are very much in love, and eventually the two remaining prisoners reach a crossroads, they part on seemingly good terms with hardly any words before they separate opposite directions. Also starring Ellen Barkin as Laurette, Billie Neal as Bobbie, Rockets Redglare as Gig, Vernel Bagneris as Preston, Timothea as Julie, L.C. Drane as L.C., Joy N. Houck Jr. as Detective Mandino and Ralph Joseph as Detective. Waits and Lurie gives great performances as the often argumentative but close friends, with her time on screen Braschi is likable as the girlfriend the foreigner finds, but for me Benigni stole the show as the vibrant Italian who is eager to learn more English, has some clever ideas, displays a great spirit for many things, and is just a lovable character. The story at the beginning is mildly important to see why they are put in their situation, but it is all the action in and escaping from prison that is the most watchable, the conversations inside the cell, and the action as the three friends make their getaway, all this is accompanied by a good script and many funny moments and makes up for a satisfying black comedy. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film by complete chance, not knowing anything about it (just needed to choose a film to see with a friend). It's not a roller coaster sort of film, but it has many charms. Really beautifully filmed, and has some absolute gems of dead-pan humor.In fact, I liked it so much, that I broke my oath not to buy any more DVDs, and got me into other early Jarmusch films.Granted, the beginning is very slow and the plot is quite unusual - and that may put off some. That said, the very slow open scenes have some amazing shots, and some really good music. Begnini does a great job with the language jokes, and Tom Waits and John Lurie also bring their characters to life.All in all, a really good film. Definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is cool? Is it defined by the clothes on your back, the shades on your face, the records you own, or the way you walk? On his brilliant 1985 album 'Rain Dogs', actor-musician Tom Waits rasps about "walking Spanish down the hall" and it's probably as good as any definition of this chimerical, near-unclassifiable status.Cool is a state of mind, but cool is also a commodity: when Jim Jarmusch's Down By Law was first released in 1986 the UK was undergoing another one of its periodic flirtations with the jazz and beat ethos. During a decade in which surface was all, but indolence considered a mortal sin, aspiring to cool - the received version at least, filtered through 1950s American iconography - seemed at once the most conservative and subversive reaction imaginable.Soon, the charts shimmied with diluted syncopation; the sounds of Chet Baker and Miles Davis snaked from street cafés; and every other beer commercial seemed to feature a young white guy being taught to play the sax by some sage old black dude in a smoky basement dive. In such an era, Jarmusch tipping his hat to film noir, pulp fiction and bebop was guaranteed to make an impact.As with the director's 1984 debut Stranger Than Paradise, this is a monochrome comedy about a bunch of losers. And, this being Jarmusch, style and attitude - and no small degree of heart - are to the fore. Down By Law's determined losers - jobless DJ Zack (Waits), framed pimp Jack (the jazz musician and actor Lurie) and befuddled tourist Roberto (comedian Benigni, then a virtual unknown outside his native Italy but the best thing here by miles) wind up sharing the same cell in the Louisiana bayou.Zack and Jack hate each other, but reserve most of their spleen for Roberto because he's so infuriatingly cheerful; he's not cool. Then they escape - we never find out how - they learn to depend on one other, and eventually go their separate ways.Like Tarantino, Jarmusch comes from a generation of US independent filmmakers whose aesthetic is informed by the video age; in this instance, old prison-break movies. Down By Law is a highly original homage to that genre, enlivened with the director's characteristic quirks: long takes, world-weary humour, and a superb score from Lurie and Waits, whose 'Rain Dogs' tracks 'Jockey Full Of Bourbon' and 'Tango Till They're Sore' bookend the film.One more thing; Jarmusch is generally considered one of the coolest directors there is. But as evinced by Down by Law and his later output, it's always the self-consciously coolest characters who wind up looking stupid while the 'straights' save the day. Being not cool is cool.

		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch has this odd way with films, where they vaguely resemble some genre but not really, and then become something else... some call it genre-undermining, but it's not really that, nor do I want to say that he delightfully rends them to pieces or pastes them together... it's just as if he starts out by saying, "I'm going to make a prison break movie" and ends by saying, "but it'll be a fairytale set in Louisiana." The closest comparison I can get to is O Brother, Where art Thou?, that musical prison-break movie set in the Depression.This film, I'd say, isn't as slow as most of Jarmusch's films I've seen... the beginning may be, as he sets the stage showing us a very Louisiana landscape (anybody who's been there will recognize it immediately... even though Jarmusch wrote the script having never been there!) and then slowly introduces our characters.Zack and Jack, well, they are just what you'd expect coming from the actors they came from, but they are still their own, aspectually engaging in demeanor and tone. Which is why they rhyme, and why Bob, who doesn't rhyme, fits in so well with them and is really the only reason anything seems to happen in the movie! Bob is a great character, hilarious, kind, and one of those you feel sorry for whenever Jack and Zack get so caught up in being them that they leave Bob alone and lonely... in fact, everything about Bob bleeds a sort of loneliness, from his word-play humor and his Italian expatriotism. Of course it's from a character like that that the ultimate fairytale form comes from, who transcends to "Happily ever after" while the two rhymers go off to find their way on opposing roads.This is definitely a great film, funny and moving, and I hope even people who dislike Jarmusch's other films will give it its chance to shine.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece. Jarmusch's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, there have only been two actors whose mere presence on the screen was enough to put audiences into raptures of laughter: Charlie Chaplin and Roberto Benigni. Perhaps Rowan Atkinson has this to a slight extent also. Along with Jim Jarmusch's hilarious script, Benigni Pulls off an amazing performance that is tear-jerckingly funny from start to finish. The movie is beautifully shot, which is to be expected from Jarmusch, with a lot of still shots, often depicting nothing but a ransacked hose. It is very seldom that the camera moves in Jarmusch pictures, and to me that is the essence of his pictures, along with beautiful scenery that outside of a Jarmusch movie is usually referred to as ugly.Jarmusch puts a huge amount of emphasis on the imperfections of humans. How they relate to each other, and more often how they don't. There are often long scenes in Jarmusch movies with little or no dialog between characters. This is certainly true in Down By Law.The Beginning may be a bit slow for many people, but this is Jarmusch's style. His films are extremely laid-back and often slow starting, or slow throughout. All These things; slow dialog, long scenes with not much going on and still pictures are what set Jarmusch movies apart from anyone else's. These are the things that make him unique, and why I admire him so much as a director and writer. In an age with fast cuts, overly dramatic camera movements and little attention to detail, there is one man who keeps it simple, yet beautiful. Jim Jarmusch.It is hard to compare Down By Lay to any other movie, except another movie by Jarmusch. It is similar in style to the film-noir movies of Jean Luc Goddard or perhaps Orson Welles. I guess if you like Bande a Part, you would like Down By Law.Down By Law is one of my favorite movies and makes me laugh every time I watch it. 10/10 definitely.</fullReview>

For this weird looking, weird soundin tunesmith is in fact a terrific actor.In by far and a way his most impressive role (he looks bored in Mystery Men, for example) Waits plays a free style jiving DJ, locked in a cell with an Italian lunatic and a middle American egomaniac (played brilliantly and adequately by Roberto Benigni and John Lurie respectively).Like all of Jim Jarmusch's movies, it is part dream, part nonsensical comedy. It doesn't entirely make sense. There is not a linear narrative per se. Big gaps are left for you to use your imagination. Suffice to say, the dream is part nightmare, part epiphany, part prophecy.Most people won't watch this movie, just as most people will never hear a Tom Waits record. No great shame, as the rest of us know that in Tom Waits we are in the presence of genius, and in Down By Law the genius is harnassed by a director of no little talent. Down By Law is, to use the beautiful parlance of boxing, pound for pound the greatest movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This jailbreak film makes 'O Brother' seem bloated and cliche-ridden. Down By Law follows the adventures of a pimp, a DJ and an Italian 'good egg' (see the film and understand) as they are incarcerated, bear the tedium of their cell, and finally escape across Louisiana's swamps. A wonderful film, sometimes tough, sometimes hilarious, and with a great ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one of my favorite contemporary U.S. films and Jim Jarmusch's (Ghost Dog, Dead Man, Mystery Train, Night on Earth, et al) second, his follow-up to Stranger Than Paradise (which he began in grad school). I first discovered the great Tom Waits (too many albums to mention; films: Ironweed, At Play in the Fields of the Lord, et al) here 16 years ago and immediately fell in love with his music and geeky bad boy persona. He wrote the opening and closing songs for the movie (Jockey Full of Bourbon and Tango Till They're Sore, both on Waits' Raindogs album), and sings a little Roy Orbison along the way. John Lurie composed an incredible score (buy the album which has both this soundtrack and the one he composed for Bette Gordon's film Variety), performed with his uber-hip Lounge Lizards. The pared down contemporary jazz stylings, spotlighting Lurie's expressive alto sax, echo the wry bleakness of the story, from deserted French Quarter streets to the seemingly endless Louisiana bayous. Robby Muller's (Dancer in the Dark, Breaking the Waves, Paris, Texas, et al) artful black and white cinematography contributes to the air of desolation, despair and timelessness. This was the brilliant Italian comedic actor Roberto Benigni's first U.S. film. All three men are fantastic in this ironic, dark and dryly funny film. Ellen Barkin, Nicoletta Braschi (Benigni's real-life wife and Life is Beautiful co-star), Billie Neal (She's Gotta Have It), Rockets Redglare, et al, round out a tantalizingly offbeat cast. Three loser-loners are thrown in jail together for crimes they didn't commit. They must overcome their differences and combine their efforts in order to beat the system and find their way out of the darkness. It's a story of alienation and coming together. Paths crossing and parting again.The hilarity of pathos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I really enjoy about "Down by Law" is not the fact that it is a road movie, nor that the characters suffer a rite of passage through their imprisonment and subsequent flight, nor any of the other characteristics mentioned by other users; it is in how the film presents human life and human relationships as a series of misunderstandings, coincidences, accidents and miracles.The three protagonists are tramps. Two of them think they are cool and smart, and yet they are so stupid and naive that at the same time they become delightful and memorable characters. Roberto lights up the screen in a Chaplin-like manner.As a whole, the picture leaves the viewer with a feeling of intelligent delight in a completely non-hollywood-esque style --with no closed ending, a rhythm of its own, tender but never kitsch, sordid and intimate, yet inspiring and deliriously funny. "Down by Law" is the filmed proof that silly characters plus comedy (in the classic sense of the word) do not necessarily result in vulgar humor. I believe it's one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I count this film next to "A Clockwork Orange" as one of the films had an substantial effect on how I perceive films. With that strange comparison made, consider this: The pace of our society has accelerated so rapidly, that in the last 10 years, it's been easy to get complacent about an art form that, if done well, so eloquently imitates life like no other. Everything from "The English Patient" to "Dude, Where's My Car?" gets lumped into the same vat, letting the movie trailers decide our choices."Down By Law" works so well with it's timing. You can't rush this film. Those friends of yours, the "talkies", who must know every second what's going on? This is not for them. I recommend you watch it alone or with a person that closely shares an attraction for the "un-Hollywood" movie. John Lurie sets the tone as a low-level hustler, and Tom Waits' adds such a solid balance to Lurie's character with a portrayal of a man caught in an existence that we can only hope we'll never have to know. He played it so well, that I can believe I am watching a person being themselves, as when Waits' character was wrapped in the solitude and malaise that followed his girlfriend (played by Ellen Barkin) throwing him out into the street. Speaking of solitude; that early scene in prison seemed to be progressing in real time! I felt like I was doing time with them! This is where your interest and patience as a viewer is tested for the first time, and it kept me glued to the screen with anticipation of what comes next. I almost hate to tell you about Roberto Begnini's appearance in the cell, and his contribution to the film's overall charm. You have to see it to appreciate it. When the first interaction of dialogue began among the three of them, the real magic of the film takes off. Avoid the comparisons made with "Stranger Than Paradise", another Jim Jarmusch effort and coincidentally, also featuring John Lurie. Lurie's there, it's black and white, and the pacing of the film is in Jarmusch's unique style. Fine. But that's where the comparisons should end. "Down By Law" has a personality all it's own. With the boatload of crud movies that have been released in the world since 1986, and many transfered to DVD, it should be declared a felony that this film is currently (as of 4/2001) out of print. Polygram Video is no longer solvent, but whoever salvaged the remains should redistribute it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jarmusch makes films about people.This is, to my taste, his best film. If you like people and you like watching people, you will enjoy this film. Jarmusch shows us some strange but interesting people, and these characters are delightfully strange and interesting -- but, importantly, these people are believable and accessible. These people are of the kind ground down by the world and their own poor choices. For a moment, a wonderful moment we witness, they are given a new lease on life and new hope for a better time, a better life. How do they deal with this grind of the world? With anger, ennui, humor and hope. Together, the cast is perfect. Perfectly cast, perfectly expressive, perfectly reactive to the world they inhabit.No fantastic chase scenes, no over-the-top explosions or CGI, no overdone melodrama. Perfectly tuned actors playing subtle notes. Like "The Remains of the Day" this film can quietly move you. Unlike that film, this one can finally lift you up as well. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully scored with just the right music, wonderfully filmed in black and white, this is an excellent movie of any kind. Of its own particular type, it is superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film again last night having originally seen it when it came out and again a few times over the years. I still love it and find it endlessly fascinating. One of the other reviews suggests that the first half hour is not very exciting. It may not set my pulse racing but I love the way it slowly engages me. The photography and the sound track and pace all really set up a sense of place and a mood that enables me to understand the characters and their background.Once the three main characters are bought together it seems to me that this provides an good example of three classic archetypes of modern maleness. There is something in all of the characters that struggles for expression. The Roberto Benigni character (Bob) although the least cool is the only one at peace with himself. I often hear women comment that they don't understand men, well watching this film may help.Overall it is one of my favourite films and I could watch it over and over again and still get something new from it. If you like quiet thoughtful character based pieces, this is for you. MT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original prison movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes an original approach on the prison-movie genre. Instead of going over-the-top in its drama and emotions, the movie prefers to keep the movie deliberately small and personal with its characters and emotions. It makes "Down by Law" an original and always intriguing movie to watch, though not necessarily better than other genre movies.It's a typically slowly told and build up movie, with long beautiful shots and lots of shots without any spoken lines. It does make the movie feel way longer than it really is but this really is not complaint, since I liked what I got to see all.In essence the movie is three in one. The movie begins with the (long) character introduction of the two main characters played by Tom Waits and John Lurie. Two low-life small criminals who get framed for two serious crimes they didn't commit. When they're in prison and are joined by the other criminal played Roberto Benigni, the entire movie gets situated in that one prison cell. It doesn't even provide us a look on their hallway-view. It shows that all they have inside the prison cell is each other. They don't really want to be friends, also because they differ from each other but circumstances forces them to create a solid bond of friendship, that only grows stronger when the three of them escape prison (also the escape itself is conveniently not fully shown). When they have escaped the movie gets different again, when the three main characters depend on each other for their survival.The movie is atmospherically filmed in black &amp; white. It does make the movie feel older but timeless at the same time. The atmosphere and storytelling reminded me of some good classics from the '40's. I definitely think that Jim Jarmusch is an underrated director, with already a long list of great movies behind his name. He knows how to tell a story compelling and original, without many resources or money.The acting is great, though by no means any of the actors are the greatest. The choose to make their characters work out realistic and humane, rather than they try to impress and show of their acting skills. It makes us feel involved with them and makes the story work out so much more powerful and interesting to follow. Tom Waits and John Lurie are great two tough guys and Roberto Benigni is put in for the more comical note.It's definitely true that the movie is way more entertaining and humor filled than you at first sight would expect. The movie certainly doesn't begins as a comedy but it subtly turns into one as the story progresses. I expected an heavy, serious drama but instead I got a light and entertaining one. It was a delightful surprise and made "Down by Law" definitely a great and pleasant viewing experience.A great little, underrated movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Jarmusch may be an acquired taste, but he's an interesting acquired taste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, "Down by Law" is definitely not for everyone. The movie is deliberately slow, there's no heart-pounding action or slapstick comedy, and certainly no "top stars" (although you could say that Roberto Benigni has since become one). Set in New Orleans, it portrays three men - Zack (Tom Waits), Jack (John Lurie), and Roberto (Benigni) - who get put in jail together. All these men were always sort of down on their luck: Zack was framed for murder, Jack was found with an under-aged girl, and Roberto was involved in a murder. Anyway, the three of them escape from jail and have to cooperate to survive while on the lam. But even when they manage to break free from each other, there remains the question of each man's future.Like I said, this is not for everyone; Jim Jarmusch is certainly an acquired taste. Many people will probably find the movie boring. But for me, it's a good representation of American independent cinema. Also starring Nicoletta Braschi, playing an Italian woman named Nicoletta.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch seems to have his own devoted little following, and I can appreciate that. And really, I liked Dead Man a lot. The sparse action/dialogue created a really interesting atmosphere that fit well with the subject matter. Really, an innovative movie. But Down By Law, using the same techniques (which are less appropriate here), feels boring, flat, student-filmy. There's no reason this movie should be so long. Really broad acting does not go well with long pauses between lines.Benigni is fun, as always. He's the only thing worthwhile, to me, and he isn't in it for very long. What was Jim's aim here? I don't know. It's painfully slow, not bad bad, but I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i had to describe any aspect of this flick i'd say it was "crafted". Utterly sublime direction from Jarmusch, with a sense of desolation in the landscape that is captured so well, it's almost surreal. Waits is, simply put, a genius, and puts in a performance which would silence any who feel that "you can't be both an actor and a musician". Benigni and Lurie are both a delirius joy and deliciously despicable respectively. The use of Waits' music within the film only heightens the sense of dusty Americana, and hip oddball style. It reminds me that indie-film snobs have actually got something right for a change, and its cult classic status is rightly deserved. Exquisitely shot, with an excellent soundtrack and sterling performances. Highly recommended, especially for fans of Waits and Benigny. Also, it's the only film that makes me want ice cream....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Down by Law, Jim Jarmusch's 1986 film has a premise that has been used by countless filmmakers: Guys who should never be friends end up in prison together, try to make a break for it, and end up as better people. The atmosphere is this film works; one can feel the foggy Louisiana bayou creeping up around them as these characters slog their way around. The problem is the acting; better, that Tom Waits and John Lurie, while doing an admirable job, are not natural actors, but musicians. It is Roberto Benigni, who many now recognize as a tremendous talent, who saves this film. In this, his first English-language performance, his character (aptly named Roberto) is charming, witty, and valiantly puts comradeship and friendship above all else. Benigni and the great Louisiana locations are the best reason to see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's 'neo-beat-noir' follow-up to his quirky debut feature 'Strangers In Paradise' was the in-film for the in-crowd when first released: a hip-to-distraction ersatz comedy in which the only joke is that there is no joke. With his deadpan disdain for the Hollywood mainstream Jarmusch might be accused of being a cinematic rebel simply for the sake of rebellion, offering as his only alternative a numb new form of motion picture in which most of the motion as been deliberately discarded. The result is either an exhilarating departure from convention or a supreme test of patience, filmed in handsome high-contrast black and white and bolstered by a trio of likable if not exactly memorable characters: Jack, Zack and Bob the Italian, three misfits who meet in jail and subsequently escape into the Louisiana bayous. That's about it. Recommended for aficionados of tongue-in-cheek obscurantism.</fullReview>

The story and film just move, sluggishly chugging forward to an ending that is really more of a dissolve. The story is ultimately of little importance, just enough movement to show us a bit of the big jokester in the skies irony. I was struck by the similarity's to Dead Man, similarities quite aside the black and white photography. The enigmatic character at the center, the drifting in and out of the main characters, the use of the boat, the disposal of the usual plot devices, the cutting away of obvious scenes (like the "how' of the escape) I wish more films displayed this sort of ease with themselves.

		<shortDescription>Fascinating filmmaking far away from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a movie. Far away from Hollywood, Jim Jarmusch creates a world where you don't need drama, pathos and action to fascinate the watcher. Because fascinating is exactly what this movie is. A plot in the classical sense is almost completely missing; the scenes, in their simplicity sometimes reminding of theater, follow each other without ever creating real suspense; neither griping action nor complex dialogues are there to excite the spectator. And still, with ease Jarmusch fills more than a hundred minutes with a story you won't take your eyes off. It is hard to tell what the atmosphere of the movie is really based on, the characters, the setting, entirely in black and white, the music - probably all of it. Again, like in Jarmusch's later movie "Dead man", speed is an important factor: everything moves slowly, without haste, as there is no dramatic climax you could hurry towards; yet, boring is a word that certainly doesn't fit this piece of cineastic art. On the other hand, though some of the scenes seem quite surrealistic, it is not a really artistic movie breaking with all the traditional concepts of filmmaking; it is more a movie in classic shape with an unconventional story, not trying to shock, to confuse or even to make you think so much; this movie doesn't need all this to get your complete attention. You could probably speculate a lot about the meaning of the movie; to me, this seems highly unnecessary. Just let it unfold its atmosphere. Judge yourselves, but I was excited in a very special way by every scene of this motion picture, giving me one of my best cineastic experiences of the recent time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw a 35mm print of "Down By Law" for the first time and really had no idea what to expect but as an admirer of independent film I was curious. Needless to say "Down By Law" almost single-handedly defines independent cinema with its seedy characters and willingness to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. Zack (Tom Waits) is a disc jockey who can't seem to keep a job and spends most of his time in an alcohol induced stupor. Ellen Barkin is memorable in a small role as Zack's long-suffering girlfriend. It's sad Barkin didn't get more opportunities in her film career. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who's fond of saying that he knows how to treat his girls and in one scene Jarmusch gives us a prolonged shot of Jack as seen from the perspective of a naked, outstretched prostitute. Obviously neither of these two ne'er do wells is destined to amount to much of anything so as fate would have it they end up sharing a prison cell where they argue incessantly. When an Italian tourist (Roberto Benigni) joins the two they learn that he too is a victim of bizarre circumstances. Benigni does a great job and practically owns the film from that point on. It's a great comedy performance. After this it's easy to see Benigni scaling the seats at the 1998 Oscars after winning for "Life Is Beautiful". Eventually there's an escape and the 3 convicts must dodge police trackers through the Louisiana bayou. Robby Muller's black and white camera-work adroitly creates a dark, surreal atmosphere. The Tom Waits songs are great and he and John Lurie play off each other beautifully. This is a great little work of cinema art by Jim Jarmusch. A must-see.</fullReview>

It is fantastical, but truly honest. The performances are, like the film, simple but beautiful. Tom Waits is so engaging and lovably cranky.

The upset Zack drinks booze on the street and his acquaintance Preston (Vernel Bagneris) offers US$ 1,500.00 to him to drive a Jaguar to the other side of the city. However, there is a man locked up in the trunk of the car and Zack is arrested and sent to the Orleans Parish Prison. Meanwhile the pimp Jack (John Lurie) is framed by his acquaintance Gig (Rockets Redglare) and is arrested in the same cell of Zack. When the Italian Roberto (Roberto Benigni) a.k.a. Bob that does note speak English very well is locked up in the same cell, the trio develops a strange friendship. Sooner Bob proposes a means of escape from prison and the trio shares a journey through the swamps of Mississippi. "Down by Law" is a cult-indie for the fans and a boring film for the others. The cinematography in black and white is stylish, but why? The plot is quite original but uninteresting. Further I do not like the actor Roberto Benigni that used the idea of the screenplay of "Train de Vie" of Radu Mihaileanu that was offered to him to the lead role to write his awarded "La Vita ? Bella". Therefore, I do not laugh of his gags and jokes. Maybe if I had seen this movie in 1986, I might have enjoyed more. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Down by Law"</fullReview>

Having seen all the stellar ratings and having read all the reviews, I expected a good, ENVOLVING movie. Oh boy, was I wrong.It is slow, so slow you can go and have some breakfast only to find out that it is still the same scene when you return. It's supposed to be deeply into character psychology -- but it's not. It's supposed to make you think deep thoughts, but it doesn't.Indeed, you can sit in your bedroom, stare at the old white cracked ceiling and reminiscence, but that doesn't mean that the ceiling has any artistic value. The same goes for this movie. You can "read into" it as much as you want, but it's you, not Jarmush. This movie is, in fact, totally void of any content.

		<shortDescription>A bit slow at times, but generally good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that I have always liked about Jim Jarmusch is that a lot of times he seems to use people whom you've either never heard of, or wouldn't expect to see acting in a film. His 1986 film "Down by Law" is no exception. The film tells the story of three men, Zack (Waits), Jack (Lurie) and Roberto (Benigni) who meet when they are put in the same jail cell at a New Orleans prison. All three men are different in terms of background; Zack is a serially employed radio DJ who is kicked out of the house by his girlfriend, only to run into a shady acquaintance that offers him $1,000 to drive a hot Jaguar to an undisclosed location in the city. Along the way he is stopped by the police and unfortunately, a body is found in the trunk of the Jag, which spells bad news for Zack and a quick trip to prison. Jack is a pimp who is set up by an associate of his; when he goes to meet a prospective "worker" in a hotel room, the police bust in, the lights go on and it turns out the woman is actually a young girl. Roberto's background is a little shadier, though murder factors into it. Roberto's command of the English language is comical and his naiveté and good mood are infectious, but the other two come to near blows either with each other or Roberto on more than one occasion, particularly after they manage to escape from prison, when they are forced to rely on one another to survive the swamps of Louisiana so they can escape prison, and one another, for good."Down by Law" is shot in wonderful black and white, which gives the film both a starkness and bare-bones feel. The music is also fantastic, with the instrumentals being performed by John Lurie and the songs by Tom Waits. Thirteen years before winning Best Actor for "Life is Beautiful", Beningi gives a great performance in this film; his charm and humor were incredibly apparent in this, his first American film. Tom Waits, a personal favorite of mine, most musically but also for his various movie roles, is a natural actor and did a great job in this film. John Lurie, whom I don't remember from other Jarmusch films I've seen, but apparently was in them gave a decent performance, though at times it was fairly wooden. I suspect that there was a good amount of improvisation throughout "Down by Law", but that didn't help some of its pacing problems. Though the photography of the film was wonderful, it couldn't help divert from the fact that there were times when the film really dragged for me, like Jarmusch had left the camera on and the principals were just kind of doing their thing, though not in a compelling manner.Overall, however, I did enjoy "Down by Law" and it is a must-see for any Jarmusch fan. I would also recommend it for those who enjoyed Beningi's more recent performances, because he really seemed to have a lot of fun with this film, as did I, for the most part. 6/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noire Fairy Tale: Surprised by Delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a total surprise to me. I'm sure it's very famous, but somehow had never seen it before. From the beginning scenes, I was expecting a gritty low life, wind up in the gutter, down and out kind of crime movie and that was fine with me, especially if set in New Orleans. At the same time there was a surprising freshness about it, that caught my attention, like a wake up call. Literally, there was writing on the wall that signaled "this is not that kind of movie!" The opening scenes reminded me of the opening of Sopranos -- the rolling shot of a neighborhood with an ominous sounding song in the background. (Were the Sopranos producers inspired by this film?) But once Roberto Benigni appeared on the scene, announcing that "Life is Sad and Beautiful" the whole story began to feel more like a strange fairy tale. Throughout the film, I appreciated the way the director took his time, letting the story evolve slowly, giving the characters time to develop their tenuous bonds. I could watch this again and again, knowing I would keep discovering hidden meanings, references, and ironies. Loved it!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benigni Shines in Offbeat Prison Break Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three rather benign losers from different backgrounds ( a DJ, a pimp, and a tourist) come together in a Louisiana jail and form an awkward alliance to find their way to freedom in this offbeat comedy drama by Jim Jarmusch. Done in typical flat affect Jarmusch style the film opens with the pimp (Jack) and the Dj (Zack) being clearly set up by colluding cops and criminals. The oppressive atmosphere in the cell they share is punctuated by insult and fights. When Roberto joins them he defuses the tension somewhat with his poor ability to communicate in English. Eventually the three manage to escape into the swamp. Stealing a canoe they row in circles before it sinks on them. Lost and isolated they stumble upon a diner in the middle of nowhere. Roberto becomes involved with the owner who also speaks Italian and the other two split up taking separate paths at a desolate fork in the road, free from prison and free from each other, their futures uncertain.In Law, Jarmusch creates a noirish world inhabited by surly, unctuous losers, cops and criminals. Everyone with the exception Roberto seems beyond redemption. He also effectively captures the madness that the tedium of being behind bars engenders.Robby Muller's B&amp;W cinematography is an endless array of strong verticals that creates a claustrophobic atmosphere whether in prison or the wide open spaces of the wilderness. It's muted low contrast contributes mightily to the bleak situation and setting. It is a film that moves slow and in circles however and Jarmusch has to ultimately employ a deus ex machina to avoid the inevitable.Tom Waits and John Lurie are typical Jarmusch protagonists, marginal deadbeats with indifferent outlooks and their street pride wears thin early before the charismatic Roberto played by Roberto Benigni breathes much needed life into the film's pace. He steals the rest of the film but along with the contrived fairy tale ending, Down by Law seems to go nowhere.</fullReview>

This movie if funny, fun, and exciting all around. A classic Tom Waits performance as the disgruntled DJ, Zack, and the very funny Italian tourist played by Roberto Benigni kept me laughing the whole time.

		<shortDescription>all about attachment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American film noire is making a headway with this movie. The Law appears almighty here, bringing to mind Kafka's account of Before the Law. Yet in Kafka, we are left undecided. Is it the doorman, he who stands between the grievance and the hearing tribunal who becomes the obstacle for obtaining justice or is it something about the Law, its essence, its mode of operation that we are invited to question. here, down by law is nothing more than a police car, a prison cell, presumably thus reduced to its most mundane appearance. But things change when we are enabled to depart from the hunted men's perspective. Looked at from the persepctive of the law, the problem is that it chases without a cause, mobilized by nothing more than the institutional routine. This is what so scary about it, more than its omnipotence. But there is a bright side: Bonding, attachment and the humble vulnerability that they bring about are the underlying themes here. Fun to watch, it leaves you with a rare species of inner butterflies: true love cannot be killed, it can only be escaped to nowhere (a swamp), or, to law (a prison) (and maybe they are the same?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Down by Law is a film that has mesmerized me for years. The first time I saw it, it sunk into me like the smile from a homeless person. It told me something I should've already known.I've heard people use the word "quirky", when drawing comparisons to a Jarmusch character, but, I like the phrase: "Spot On". He has captured man's fear within himself, and, the ability to hide that fear. It takes a director of great courage and knowledge of self to pull that one off without boring you.If you're a fan of Joel Schumaucher or James Cameron, this is not the film for you. But if your a fan of people, and, the human condition, the mirror reflects back, 2 hours at a time, and Jarmusch is right behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a sophisticated, masterfully laid-back take to the prison picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Down by Law twice in one day when I got it on DVD (an exceptional DVD for Jim Jarmusch fans, by the way). I wasn't expecting too, and I fast-forwarded past a couple of smaller scenes the second time around, but overall I found this to be a sort of sensational film in the most subdued way, if that's possible. It's realistic in some ways, but also sticking to many of the ideals that go with the 'prison' picture (a kind of sub-genre Jarmusch obviously loves and is tipping the hat to). It's also a comedy that juggles between Jarmusch's knack at subtleties ("hey, hey, not the shoes" is a hilariously low-key line by Waits) and also a key supporting role from Roberto Benigni, in his first film outside of Italy. His is a balancing act between Lurie and Waits, who for a lot of the film try to act too cool for school, so to speak, despite the fact that they're in jail. He's the obvious, but needful force that gives Down by Law its kick just when you think it might be getting a little dull. And somehow Benigni gives this character a dimension from Jarmusch's script; he's funny, and also has a slightly serious side too, an earnest one, which is shown in one of the best scenes of the film at the fire where Benigni tells the story of the rabbit.The acting (not necessarily 'professional', but truthful, and surprising considering Waits being almost always an eccentric musician) would've made Down by Law a good movie on its own, however Jarmusch's direction - and more particularly the contribution of Robby Mueller as DP - is a delicate act of black and white finesse. Mueller understands this story, and these actors, and also gets down this whole down-on-the-bayou area of America without a flaw. In particular the cool shots that get the camera moving, like when the three of them are on a boat in the bayou, and the camera just seems to float along at times, this despite the impeding danger of the characters being caught. Like Stanger than Paradise, Jarmusch's previous films, Down by Law is also partly a movie on the road (this time on the run), with eccentric characters and gritty settings, and so the camera-work compliments this. That it looks so much more beautiful on DVD is an added bonus.Down by Law is, if nothing else, a sort of 'genre' picture that goes beyond its limitations by way of a distinct style, some fascinating performances, and music that comes in a of spooky way that also adds another level to the film's effect on a viewer. Not for all tastes, as per usual with Jarmusch's work, however not without its pleasures; those who want a Benigni fix after checking out his Italian films need no further than to look here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dissenting Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without Roberto Benigni, this movie would be an utter wasteland. The characters played by Tom Waits and John Lurie are not very interesting, and neither actor makes a very strong impression in this viewer's opinion. I'm not sure where this falls in Benigni's film career, pretty early in his English language films, I would think, but his comic talents are all that saves this movie from being utterly forgettable instead of merely absurd. I couldn't care less what happened to the Waits or Lurie characters, and Benigni's finding Nicoletta Braschi operating a restaurant on a Louisiana road that no one seems to travel is beyond improbable. But the chemistry between them is unmistakable (as it is in other movies and in real life), and it's all that saves the movie from being utterly dump-worthy. Jim Jarmusch is usually off-beat, and some of his movies succeed better than others. (Or to look at it another way, some of his films fail more completely than others.) Without Benigni, this would easily qualify as the worst Jarmusch film I've ever seen -- and I've seen a lot of them</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to say which Jim Jarmusch film is the best considering the high quality the man always delivers, but I think this is it."Down By Law" is a film about three sad but beautiful people who end up in a prison cell together. They are of course innocent except for the most innocently behaving of them. Life in jail is not as hard as boring for them, and they break out. Through the Louisiana swamp they try to get away from the prison dogs.....The film has a story as told above, but it isn't really what it's about. What I love it for is the way we look into the characters and how they get along with each other. The dialogue is so laid-back and pleasant that you almost fall asleep. But you don't, you are just comfortable, very comfortable.For people who like easy films and films where the dialogues are emphasized, you will love this one.</fullReview>

I've seen only one Jarmusch movie before this one ("Broken flowers") and I liked it . I was expecting something good from this one too. Especially considering the praise I've heard from many people.This ? This is BORING . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING . I don't remember when was the last time I saw something so lifeless . Not to mention I fail to see where the jokes are . Really. I've seen this twice and I honestly haven't found a single funny thing . I regret that Jarmusch didn't put the fake laughs (just like in those American sitcoms)into the movie , so I would at least know what he thought was a good joke . And why this is black and white ? What's the point ? "Raging bull" and "Sin city" are black and white for reason. Here ? I don't know . Maybe so Jarmusch could pretend this is some "artistic" movie. Maybe he did this movie to show what a rebel he is.I liked Tom Waits songs . I also have to admit that acting is solid. The characters are likable. It doesn't change the fact that it's a completely pointless movie . Watch it only if you're insomniac. I give it 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***1/2 out of ****I love director Jim Jarmusch because he knows what kinds of films that he wants to make and isn't ever afraid to make a film that only he will like. DOWN BY LAW is a great movie made by a guy who knows what he wants to see when he sees a movie. DOWN BY LAW is a film that may not be realistic or meaningful, but it is a good film. It is a funny and beautiful film.It's about three completely different people, Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni who wind up sharing the same jail cell. They eventually get used to each other's presence and escape from prison, before getting completely lost in the wilderness.The film is great because it incorporates several different film styles into a completely original story, making it feel like a film like no other. It starts out very much in the vein of a film-noir thriller before slowing down and incorporating dry humor with the charisma of all three leads. Tom Waits is such a strange and unique presence that the film automatically feels different, John Lurie kind of represents the voice of the audience and gives the film a more sane kind of feel, and Roberto Benigni incorporates his wonderful humorous antics into the plot and helps the film move. Combine all this with the kind of beautiful and claustrophobic imagery that one can only dream of, and you have one hell of a great movie.I think what really brings the film to life is it's willingness to be offbeat, but dry at the same time by injecting personality into the minor characters. Even though they all play off of different stereotypes found in classic films, you can still feel how each one fits into what the main characters do. It isn't until the end of the film that the offbeat characters blossom into enjoying each other's company. It doesn't matter if it's believable or not. What matters is that it makes sense. Even though these characters have had a life changing experience together, it won't matter to them until they meet again. Check it out.Rated R for some language and sexual content.</fullReview>

If we forget the absence of color (why?!!!!) and the hopeless boredom that is a constant through out, it has some interesting moments. There is a reason why famous directors are famous.

After a while I started to wonder whether it does kick off or not, and halfway thru it I just sat, glassy eyed, realizing it would not. Astonishingly amateurish, pointless and sluggish, with no storyline to mention, it left me wondering why it had been done. Guys paddling around in the swampland, watching the boat sinking sums it up. Looked like it had been made in Finland. Jarmusch must have been both depressed and feeling special when he concocted this soup. What strikes me after the ordeal of watching thru it, is that the film does not reflect its epoch at all. If Down by Law is a masterpiece, it's the autistic sort, not meaning to slander persons suffering from the same malady as the the movie. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't your normal prison movie, nor by any stretch your normal American comedy. Make no mistake if your favourite movies are Hollywood by numbers, you will be confused and bored by this great piece of cinema. Tom waits stars as Zack, a DJ who ends up in jail for murder after being set up. John Lurie is Jack, a pimp who also gets set up. They bond uncomfortably in a Louisiana jail, before Italian comedic genius Roberto Benigni comes in and changes there world. Waits and Lurie are brilliant, they both completely become low level hoods, but its Benigni as usual who is the colour of this Black and White film. He is the heart and soul that these two losers never knew they had. They eventually escape and are then lost in the bayou for too long. The movie is less about what they do, and more about the journey that these two hoods have following this effervescent Italian. This is so different to the normal Hollywood comedy, that I can understand most people will not like it, but the gruff demeanour of Waits and Lurie are in beautiful contrast to the stunning black and white cinematography and the great Robert Benigni. Jim Jarmusch takes his time, and as usual delivers something worth waiting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent early Jarmusch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While his later and more acclaimed works such 'Night on Earth' and 'Dead Man' may well be better films, this is the one that catapulted Jim Jarmusch to the forefront of obscure American cinema in the 1980's, and aside from that fact; it's a hell of a lot of fun, and fans of Jarmusch, and just fans of obscure cool cinema in general will find lots to like about it. Treading a line between a classic prison movie and an odd comedy, Down by Law works on several levels. The premise of the film is simple, as we follow three rather different convicts that end up in the same cell in a penitentiary. Despite this being a simple base for a movie, Jim Jarmusch really makes the best of his premise and the three characters he has created to inhabit the jail cell are all unique enough to each other in order to make sure that the film is always interesting, and that the characters have a good chemistry with one another, so that the dialogue flows freely and that it's quirky nature is able to be revved up to the top.Tom Waits, John Lurie and Roberto Benigni take the lead three roles and although the former two actors are no doubt good in their roles, as usual it is Benigni that steals the show. His over the top style fits his over the top character like a glove and although Benigni isn't the sort of actor that can adapt to many different roles; when he's got one that fits him, he's pretty much unbeatable. The film's plot starts out slow, and the first half hour in which two of the three leads are introduced isn't all that exciting. It's when the three men get put inside that Down by Law really starts, and every minute from then on is a pleasure. Like he would with Dead Man nine years later, Jarmusch has opted to film Down by Law in a very stark black and white, which, also like Dead Man, increases the surrealism and also helps the film in it's bid to beat the thin plot line with a very potent visual complexity, which will delight fans of this sort of movie. On the whole, Down by Law is an excellent example of offbeat US film-making and I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another horrible boring movie by Jarmush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unwatchable. Jim Jarmush is able to stuck even Roberto Benigni to a pokerface expressive actor: not easy. It does not communicate anything to me, nothing at all. I suppose the "I scream, you scream, ice cream" sketch should be comic, at least fun. I watched it all just to see how and when it resolved: it does not. Not a lough, not a smile, not an emotion, not an impression, not a feeling. I did not finish it, as I did not finish Coffee &amp; Cigarettes (but I heroically finished Stranger than Paradise, Night on Earth - extremely offensive for Italy and Italians, trespassing the edge of a racist prejudice - and even the childish Only Lovers Left Alive). Every time I see a Jarmusch movie, I believe it is the worst I have ever seen. Till the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this film is admirable and important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Down by Law" is a very realistic film, in the way we here in Sweden used to look upon Strindberg as a realistic author at the turn of the century, and Vilgot Sjoman and Bo Widerberg as film makers during the sixtie's. He, like them, just tells "how it is", this time in the US, not in Sweden.Simultaneously, he represents a rather new esthetics in film making. I think that Angelopoulos, probably preceding Jarmusch, is perhaps the only one with a similar approach.This esthetics includes a fixed camera near to the ground, with pictures of a reality just as shabby as we all know it is, and with a narration of human despair and hope, love and hate, exactly as we all know these feelings are, especially when we remember how we felt when we were children.But it is not just esthetics. It also represents a new way of viewing the world. It adumbrates a new ethics, without being moralistic.Besides, the film is psychologically very convincing. Two of the main personalities, those first going to prison, are pregenital, narcissistic, and latently homosexual. They seem to represent most people in our time, leaving their heterosexual friend with his impossible option, as they see it. Later they are parting company, in spite of their genuine feeling of needing eachother, however much hate there is between them.The poor Italian is left in the swamp with the crocodiles, but his choice is an oedipal one, i.e. one of love, a choice that looks almost impossible in our time.This takes me back to Sweden. Some ten years ago Ingmar Bergman directed a performance of Hamlet in Stockholm. He ended that version of Shakespeare's play with an attack on all and everyone on the scene, by youth criminals in leather gear and with machine guns. They simply killed them, flice in their eyes, as Shakespearean passions did not seem intelligable to them, members of the new generation. However cruel Oedipal passions might be, they appear not interesting, not even intelligible, to youngsters of our time.Could it be that some new artists, like Angelopoulos and Jarmusch, want us to find those lost feelings of what is important in life, a feeling only some of us will recover in our own childhood? The Italian lover possibly found it, but in a swamp with terrible dangers. The two others, the narcissists, felt much more confident, convinced to conquer all dangers ahead. Brave new world!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of three films I've seen in the past tens year or so which I consider a masterpiece. I don't want to ruin it by commenting any more than that. The other two films on my list, though, happen to be "Seven" (aka "Se7en"), directed by David Fincher, with Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and and Kevin Spacey; and "Henry Fool," directed by Hal Hartley. How's that for a movie review?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very boring and incredibly slow-moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most viewers seem to be enthralled by this film, but I just don't get it. The picture is incredibly slow-moving and the whole story is pretty boring. I thought those scenes in the jail would never end. This film needs a lot more action and a lot more character development. Nothing much ever seems to happen in the movie, and much of the dialog is muddy and very hard to make out. The actors just seem plain bored and going through the motions. The viewer never seems to figure out exactly how these men manage to escape, it just mysteriously happens. They just happen to stumble upon a lady with a house and plenty of food for all, who speaks fluent Italian. Give me a break! This film is a pathetic fantasy and has nothing at all to do with reality or any meaningful commentary on the human condition. It is vastly over-rated. I hope this film is not in any way representative of the typical independent films that are being shown and honored every year at Sundance. If so, I am happy to stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a slow slog through the bayou</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Down By Law" *1/2. (1986, USA, R, 96 min Directed and written by Jim Jarmusch with Tom Waits, John Lurie, Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Ellen Barkin, Billie Neal). I read all the reviews (at least all the reviews on the Internet Movie Database) before going to see this movie. Without doing the math, I easily expected a 3 star-plus movie. Friends and relatives told me `'Down By Law' is great and you really have to see Jarmusch's other movies.' I don't think so! Zach (Waits), Jack (Lurie), and Roberto (Benigni) are three losers, who through a series of events end up in the same Louisiana jail cell. Zach and Jack hate one another. And, together they hate Roberto. I have to go along with them regarding Roberto. I'm sure I'd hate Roberto if I had to spend jail time with him. Hell, I hate him and I only had to put up with him during a 96-minute movie. But back to the movie, the three men's hunger for a good breakfast (You thought I was going say freedom.) move them to work together and escape. They escape into a Louisiana bayou. Their escape is followed by a slow slog through the bayou. God is it slow! (This the second slow bayou movie I didn't like this year. See my review of `Eve's Bayou.') The three end up at the home of an Italian woman who `adopts' Roberto in a weird, Oedipal sort of way. Roberto stays with her. Zach and Jack hit the road. The rest of the movie aside, there is one directional devise used by Jarmusch that I liked. There are scene changes that occur without completing the thought. It's like a conversation with someone you know real well. This one clever directorial tool excepted, I can not recommend `Down By Law.'</fullReview>
