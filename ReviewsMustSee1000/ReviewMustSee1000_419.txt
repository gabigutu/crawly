		<fullReview>I'm not sure what the people who dumped on this film were expecting, but I found it entertaining. I am a fan of good horror and good satire, so I was able to recognize and appreciate the jokes.True, this film relies a bit much on poddy humor, but at the same time, there is a cleverness in the way all the films being spoofed (and there are many) get twisted together and played with here. Some of the slapstick and sight gags do fall flat, but the movie is quick paced and the satire is fun. If you don't go in expecting Shakespeare, you'll enjoy it. And you might even get some Shakespeare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amusing parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most movie parodies, `Scary Movie' starts out well then begins to head downhill as it exhausts the possibilities of its limited material. Certainly, few genres are as rife for self-satire as the teen slasher films that have proliferated in theatres ever since the early 1980's. Seeing, however, as even some of the earliest `Friday the 13th' and `Halloween' films seem like ancient history to today's core movie going public, `Scary Movie' draws upon more contemporary examples of the genre like `Scream' and `I Know What You Did Last Summer' as its source of inspiration. In its opening stretches, `Scary Movie' has a great deal of fun parodying the many ludicrous conventions that have long defined these films: the use of 30-year old actors to portray empty-headed, nubile adolescents; the heavy emphasis on teen sexuality and partial nudity; the inane actions of the killer's victims who seem to do everything possible to hurl themselves into dangerous situations; and the oh-so-predictable false scare (usually caused by a leaping cat) followed immediately by the inevitable killer's attack.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and boasting a screenplay concocted by no fewer than six (count ?em SIX) writers, `Scary Movie' establishes a high speed rhythm and pace that the filmmakers manage to sustain through most of the film's 88-minute running time ? though there is a noticeable tendency on the part of the film to lag in the last half hour. Part of the problem could be that, as with most films made up essentially of sound and sight gags haphazardly strung together, it is inevitable that some of the bits will succeed better than others and that, as the movie rolls along, the inspiration will run a little dry and the humor will become less spontaneous and more forced. Indeed, this type of movie genre parody has always worked best when applied in small doses on TV series like `Saturday Night Live,' `In Living Color' and even the `Carol Burnett Show.' Stretched out to full length, such concepts often suffer the curse of diminishing returns.Occasionally, the screenplay edges so close to the limits of good taste that one may question whether or not the material is truly appropriate for the age group at which the movie is obviously targeted. The crudity is actually much more comically effective when it is merely hinted at than when it is so openly spelled out and displayed. But then subtlety is not exactly a strong suit of the straight horror movie genre either. `Scary Movie' is, at least, blessed with a winning, game cast made up of appropriately post adolescent actors who understand well the mannerisms and speech patterns of the stereotypes they embody. The overall good-natured quality of the film and its fairly high laugh ratio of gems to clunkers make `Scary Movie' an imperfect but generally likeable popcorn entertainment. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest spoofs ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is now (it was a little while ago it was Me, Myself &amp; Irene) my favorite comedy of the year. This film gives another word to the spoof/comedy genre, and even though it doesn't make a breakthrough like Airplane!, it is still very, very funny. Sure it's not for everyone, but for those who have seen all the scary movies parodied in this film (example- Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, Halloween, The Shining, etc) and can enjoy a good comedy, this film is definitely for you.But the plot is unexplainable, but the jokes are. The spoof follows in the Wayans bros. tradition (this film is directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, produced by all three, and starring all three) of they're last spoof- Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood. Jokes include a guy who acts very gay but isn't (Shawn Wayans) a pot head (Marlon Wayans) and some other characters (Carmen Electra's cameo is my favorite). Also, the references to movies but not parodies are still funny. Very sick, very crude, very funny. The funniest film of the year. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfliching crude teen spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of teenagers are targeted by a serial killer exactly one year after they ran over a man.In 1996 Scream was a film that reinstated the slasher horror genre and Keenan Ivory Wayans' spoof is a true and funny testament to that horror classic.Modern spoofs often contain slapstick humour, stereotypes and a fairly predictable plot. This is evident with this 2000 hit and is pure silly entertainment that you can't help but love and laugh along with despite the conventional approach.Recent releases such as Disaster Movie have brought the spoof genre to an all time low. Filled with unfunny parodies, attacks on celebrities and ultimately silly plots, it's a wonder why they are still being made. In the nineties we had classic spoofs such as Austin Powers and Naked Gun, silly but with a sharp and entertaining plot.Scary Movie has such a good plot, choosing to focus its energy on Scream and I know what you did last summer, that you forget its intentions to demean other films and therefore, are able to sit back and enjoy the ride.The opening is pretty much Scream with some great moments of slapstick in, and crude slapstick at that with safety signs, sexual references and an out of control car.This opening sets the tone for an engrossing comedy and viewers are thrust head first into typical teenagers lives, filled with some fine slapstick humour and stereotypes lives There is a consistency to Scary Movie. There is little wondering away from its objective to tell the tale of the teens being targeted and therefore achieves a realism in its own context. With follow-ups 2, 3 and 4 there is a tendency to run away from the main narrative and have sillier skits that this original remains the most sophisticated to date.Though the comedy is frequently predictable, there is still elegance about the way Wayans achieves this effect. His close and unflinching style gives that humorous and equally horrific substance to fly across both genres into this tantalizing tale.Spoofs are always worth viewing for their sheer cheek to criticize blockbusters and Scary Movie is no exception with its pin point accuracy on Scream and other horrors. Filled with likable slapstick and funny stereotypes, this is the finest in the series</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny comedy from the Wayan team. It's a take on all the recent teen horror flicks, and it does it superbly well. I hate noise in cinemas while I'm watching a film, but I couldn't keep quiet, I was laughing out loud, and I even shouted at the screen. Now I have never done that before. The gags, from one liners to the set pieces, are so funny, watch out for the sex scene and the gym teacher - I almost wet myself. This ranks next to Airplane as one of the top ten funnies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the easily offended!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A controversial Horror spoof that gained mainstream attention when released. If you liked and took seriously "Scream" then you should watch this movie with attention. It's almost the same concept. While "Scream" tried to be taken seriously , "Scary Movie" mocks about everything possible in the genre in a raw way.Anna Faris and the Wayans brothers deliver a funny performance. Sure the cast is over the top but the movie asks for it. Having such a pretty girl like Faris behaving like that always shocks and this time, it entertains. The rest of the cast is pretty good. All in the "American Pie" style but with raunchy humor. The main reason for me to like this movie is that it mocks perfectly many Horror popular movies. Friday the 13th, He Knows You Are Alone, Black Christmas, Psycho, etc. That's in my opinion, the best feature of the movie. It's a joke but it's a homage at the same time. Unlike "Scream" that tried to convince people that it was an innovative slasher. Give this movie a try if you are in the mood of raw black humor. It surely will entertain you if you are not easily offended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>first great parody film in awhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parody films kind of died in the early 90s, the good ones anyway. Leslie Neilson made a handful at the end of the decade, all very stupid as they didn't even try like the Zucker bros. did in the early days. But the last slapstick film I liked was 1993's "Loaded Weapon" so this film was a long time coming. Most parodies have some sort of target, and this one attacks all the teen slasher pics of the last few years. Since I didn't enjoy any of them, I really enjoyed watching them get lampooned, as a ton of the jokes are right on the money. If you're a fan of parody, I don't know how you couldn't love some of this. But even with all the praise, this still just barely missed being an overall success. Toward the end it starts to run out of steam, which is really too bad, as a lot of it is too hilarious for words. I do go along with everyone else in saying I don't know how this got only an R rating. There is a ton of graphic material, sexually and bloodily. Some will laugh, others will roll their eyes at the over the top approach to some scenes. I did a little of both. The cast, for mostly unknowns, is good, and it was nice to see the Wayans clan finally succeed in film, after about a decade of poorly self-written clunkers. I see a sequel is forthcoming, although I'm not sure whats left to make fun of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Darn Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK people. Enough is enough. I'm standing up for this movie. I had walked into the theater not knowing what to expect. After hearing about the nudity, I was definitely intrigued. Yes, this movie has a TON of gross out jokes that make Something About Mary seem like Sesame Street. The gross out jokes will no doubt make many people uncomfortable. In retrospect, this movie should have probably been NC-17, but it was really pretty harmless. (the girl-in-the-movie-theater-talking-on-the-phone bit should have been done a long time ago) The stereotyping is pretty bad, but again, harmless. I was more or less shocked at the material, rather than offended. There could have been less Scream spoofs and more "old-school" horror jokes, but I wouldn't trade the Doofy material for anything. Great impersonation! Cheri Oteri was a wonderful presence, in a great Blair Witch knockoff. The ghostface killer does a nifty little Friday the 13th music impression. And, there is a very brief Halloween spoof with Cindy in the classroom. The sex jokes were way over-the-top but pretty darn clever. After seeing Me, Myself, and Irene (which was god-awful, especially if you're used to seeing Jim Carrey doing good movies) I was thrilled to leave Scary Movie thoroughly pleased. Regardless of the tagline, everyone should expect a sequel. (the movie is grossing a ton of money) I'm already buying my popcorn...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Scary Movie. Like, THE Scary Movie. The movie that made fun of horror movies, aptly and plainly named "Scary Movie". The film that's had an entire generation crack up and still, today, reference its many hilarious moments as modern day lore. The time is 2000. The crack of the new millennium and an entire people fed up with the blatancy of contemporary horror, with all its predictability and sameness, what with the countless modern slashers coming out at the time and what not. Along comes this film, a Wayans brothers' production, with a style of humor that is so comically exaggerated and contagious lots of scenes remain references today. I really can't think of another explanation that the people putting this down are just prudes who can't take a fun ride every once in a while and just are incapable of seeing this for what it is, because it most certainly works fantastically at what it does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First,i'd like to apologize about my bad English,i'm not American.Now the review,people will disagree,but,this is one of the funniest movies i ever seen.Warning:If you like political correctness,this movie is totally not for you,it goes from suicide jokes to ejaculation jokes,it has lots of sex jokes,some are unfunny and kinda gross,but,are compensate by how other jokes are hilarious. Now,"Scary Movie" parodies slasher teen movies,mainly,"Scream" and "i know what you did last summer",but,take jabs at other films even "matrix".So the film synopsis is the same than from "Scream" and "IKWYDLS",only adding stupid,because it is a stupid version of these films.Sinopsis:stupid teens accidentally kill a man,one year later,these teens are chased by a stupid killer.See?Now,despite being one of the funniest movies i ever seen,it still has it bad moments,i mean,even naked gun has bad moments.One of the problems is after a while,the movie loses it steam,and the jokes get bad (those are probably the Seltzer- Friedberg parts of the script) but still it's a very funny movie and i recommend to everyone who likes stupidity and spoofs,even those who don't like may enjoy it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie..... Scary movie! The reason why I loved this film is because it was just so unreal and funny.... If you have read some of my reviews then you will already know I love comedy horrors and this one is definitely a favourite. I love how the Creator's of scream are taking the pee out of there own movie, that makes it HILARIOUS! When I saw this film about 2 years ago on TV I had to buy it, it was just hilarious, cool and very very crude. The humour of the characters is brilliant and the Scream guy is really cool, some of the deaths do actually make you get goosebumps, especially when she has her head cut of in the changing rooms and she is still talking, which is so goose-bump...y and funny. You will have to have a slapstick sense of humour to view this film otherwise you'll probably hate it....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great, acting by Anna Ferris and also it's funny really funny. Almost every part made me laugh, I wish the rest of the sequels can do that. Parody or spoof of I know what you did last summer and scream 1 and 2. I mean this movie does not deserve a mixed review or 6.2 based on franchise meaning it deserves a 7.6 or a very positive review. In this movie has very famous actors and actresses. Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Nia Long, Anna Ferris, and Carmen Electra. With also the deceased Prince playing a small role in the movie. Of course the movie has references to the deaths and in the ending every one is revived no one is dead really. A scene I really adored was the scene of Buffy setting murdered. It basically shows the clichés in horror films today. It really makes a great debut for a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redefined Spoofs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parody movies have been around for decades. Mel Brooks was very well known for making fun of various movies such as Star Wars by creating Space Balls. Just as the style began to become stale, Scary Movie enters the scene and pushes new boundaries, making it the movie that changed the way movies make fun of others.Scary Movie was actually the original name of Scream. Scream redefined horror by ridding the typical horror clichés that made them mindless. Scream had substance and brains. Keenan Ivory Wayans successfully keeps the substance and brain of Scream and takes the smarts of other movies to make one big laugh fest. The two main movies is parodies are Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. It also includes Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek among others. Most spoof movies these days to atrocious jobs of putting various things together. Movies like Disaster Movie and Epic Movie throw in random things just because they can. Scary Movie uses a solid bases and similar things that flow together. Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer are both teen horror movies that deal with a killer whom they try to find out his identity. Dawson's Creek is a high school drama, and that vibe could easily fit in with the horrors. Basically, this movie masters thrown-in humour: very difficult thing to do. As I mentioned, the basis of the movie combines Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.The characters are made fun of in truly hilarious ways and some characters are redone to be more funny. In Scream, David Arquette is a rookie cop, and his "other" in is a retarded officer named Doofy. They really did an excellent job of bending his character. Then there's Shawn Wayans who plays a seemingly gay character who is so funny. There were no hints of homosexuality of the other movies, but Shawn works well. In fact, each of our main characters are well-developed and hilarious.The movie works on so many levels, mainly the comedy. I laugh so hard every time I watch this. This pushed the boundaries for R-rated comedies. Since Scary Movie's release in 2000, every teen comedy tries to emulate this with most fail and none coming close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, first I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of the Wayans brothers, I watched "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood " (a 1996 movie that Marlon &amp; Shawn wrote) and I immediately fell for them! I than noticed the huge talent those two had and that's why I was pretty excited when I've heard that they wrote yet another Comedy-Parody movie. I went to the theater with lots of excitement and anticipation. And believe me, I wasn't disappointed when I left the theater! "Scary Movie" is a real pleasant break out of life, I almost wet my pants... I never stopped laughing! The wayans brothers simply took every single ridicules thing out of the new yet old genre movies called "teen-slaughter" and found a refreshing way to totally mock them. I really enjoyed watching them for 88 minutes making fun of every single movie that was made in the last 5 years with a minimum funding and a bad line of actors that can't even persuade an Eskimo to buy a heater (Maybe beside David &amp; Courtney Cox Arquette) and made millions at the box office (It's just not fare to art!). I also wanted to say that I'm really impressed by the way Lochlyn Munro manages to maintain a magnificent performance every single time (considering his small but wide roles). such as:"A night at the Roxbury" &amp; "Dead man on campus". And also, the Amazing Anna Faris that did a great job on this breakthrough movie for her. In conclusion, I give this Movie a 10 out of 10 in the TRON's scale of movies. And I would like to add that I saw this movie 4 times in the theater, that's how good I thought it was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so sorry to hear people say that the movie is funny. I believe that Scary Movie could be funny to people that were locked in a library for 30 years with no one else to talk to and suddenly someone played it to them. The jokes are unintelligent, the acting is terrible (like in most of Wayans' movies) and what comes out is a sense of rudeness to the audience. Toilet ans sex jokes at their worst, plus a joke about Usual Suspects that originally appeared in Wrongfully Accused. Now that I mentioned it, did you know that in contrast to this super-production the hilarious 'Wrongfully Accused' was filmed in only 5 days? (there's even a very good I have to say, recreation of the Matrix visual fx in a scene of Scary Movie). Of course W.A. was created by veterans and in a parody no one really cares about the visuals; what really matters is the jokes. And these jokes are like the jokes you hear in a classroom during a Physics class. Awful!</fullReview>

I personally am a huge fan of all of the movies that they made fun of, and I think that's why I loved it so much. I was a total mockery of something and the writers did it in such a way where anyone could appreciate it. They didn't just go off of stuff that was in the movies, rather they went off of what everyone would know, even if all the audience ever saw of the other movies was a preview or a commercial.

		<fullReview>Look, some people don't appear to like this. I can see why. The humour is at times childish, the humour is also at times adult. Even more confusing, the humour is sometimes both at once.What you need to watch this is a nice open mind and no hang-ups about bodily functions, body parts ('wet bits' or bloody bits) or jokes at the expense of various stereo-types.BTW, the jokes are at the expense of the /stereo-types/ (of blacks, gays, mentally challenged, vain, etc, etc) not at the /geno-types/ (all blacks, all gays, all those mentally challenged, all vain people). You're adult (otherwise you couldn't watch this film) so I imagine you can make the distinction.Burn me at a stake, already, but I liked it. I roared with laughter (luckily, so did the rest of the audience), and I don't think it's made me a bad person. Have fun watching it, bend like the willow a little, have a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest film any Scream-fan will ever see (but read below)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two kinds of audiences to this movie: those who have seen the Scream trilogy and those who haven't.The second group will think: "What the hell was this sh**?"The first mentioned group will be rolling on the floor laughing!Thank God I'm one of the first group. Scary Movie mocks about EVERYTHING that happened in Scream 1 - 3, and in such a twisted way that you cannot help but to laugh your a** off! Just take a look at the names: Neve Campbell's character Sidney Prescott becomes 'Cindy (notice the exchanged 'd' and 'n'?) Campbell'. Hilarious! And it goes on like that.For those who haven't seen it yet, I would say it is making fun of the following movies: 90% Scream 1-3, 7% I know what you did last summer, 1% Blair witch project, 1% American Pie and 1% Matrix - even though that seems off-topic, but you just has to love it when you see the parallels.Oh yes, of those 90% Scream I'd divide it as follows: Scream 1: 75%, Scream 2: 20%, Scream 3: 5%. And I really liked it that way!And, again, the warning to all German spectators: Go to your local video store and rent all three Scream movies in English! Then visit a theater/cinema near you that shows the films with the original language. Under NO circumstances you should watch either in the German dubbed version!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! NO ONE UNDER AGE 16 AT LEAST I'D SAY!I KNOW I have NEVER laughed so hard at a movie...I am BUYING this movie when it comes to video! I do however recommend that you beware of who you take to see this movie...this is not a movie parents are likley to be enthused about unless they are really out there and have a wicked sense of humor, and PLEASE, I must ask again, for the love of the goddess, don't take young children to see this either because it's really really really raunchy!!!!!!!! If you love to laugh and you are not a prude or have heart trouble then GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I for one plan to see it again and again and again and again and again....but then again Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of my all time favorite movies too so let that be your guide! I give it a major 10 star rating... the ONLY complaint I have is that a LOT of the funny stuff is in the trailer, but there is sure some gooooood stuff that's not in it too! Rock on Wayans Brothers! if you have not seen "the usual suspects" with Kevin Spacey then I suggest you see it first before you see Scary Movie, the ending will make more sense that way! feel free to email me if you have any response to my comments!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw the previews for Scary Movie, and it looked extremely funny. It was. I'm only 12 years old, and a lot of people think that people my age shouldn't see movies like American Pie, Road Trip, and this, and they also think that we won't understand the sexual humor. But they are wrong. I understood everything, and as I am a huge horror fan, I understood it completely. In my opinion, Scary movie is a funny, well done spoof.A couple parts were a little dumb, but thats all. I give this a 9 out of ten rating. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy Movie (more adequate title) WORSE THAN AMERICAN PIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go to see this movie, here's a few things i recommend: First off, do not see this with a family member or girlfriend, It is DEFINATELY NOT a date movie. Also, bring a barf bag because there are a few male nudity scenes that are pretty disgusting. One involving an extremely butch woman gym teacher. Lastly, make sure you have seen SCREAM, SCREAM 2, SCREAM 3, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, THE MATRIX, THE SIXTH SENSE, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and a bunch of other modern horror flicks. Although this movie was the most disgusting piece of garbage i have ever seen in my life, I am ashamed to say I liked it and laughed, a lot! It is a side-splitting comedy if you've seen all the actual horror films spoofed. If you haven't seen those movies, you will not laugh very much. So, even though I hated the raunchy aspect, i loved the movie. 4 out of 5 stars ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess people don't understand the Wayans' humor of addressing topics that adults don't feel like addressing: sex, pop culture, drugs, and more sex. If you can handle and laugh at jokes from those topics, then you will thoroughly enjoy the movie. Otherwise, keep your boring, clean Seinfeld/SNL(except for Ladies'Man and Robert Smiegel cartoons) humor and stay home. I don't feel sorry for those who had expected an "easy to understand" yet "slight dirty" humor movie and paid dearly to see the movie. I guess too many adults can't even handle some R/NC-17 movies because they aren't mature enough to handle the topics and address these topics to real life.Hats off to the Wayans Brothers for keeping it real and funny(and gettin' paid big time!!!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you go to a movie like Road Trip or Shanghai Noon, you only laugh when you see something real funny. When I saw Shanghai Noon, the only time everyone laughed hard was when they saw the trailer for Scary Movie. And on July 7, I saw the one movie that I thought I would never laugh at 5 seconds at a time. The movie had great acting, especially great by Carmen Electra, Shannon Elizabeth, Cheri Oteri, and newcomer Anna Faris, hilarious jokes, and the scenes where the jiffy pop started to roll around the stove, the Whazzup! spoof, Cindy pushing everything down the stairs, and The Blair Witch Project spoof kept me laughing for an entire 15 minutes. But the movie is built on parody and gross-out jokes that make you either want to laugh or puke. But Scary Movie is the one movie to pay your $7 for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see "Scary Movie" with not a lot of expectation. The reviews were mixed, although the movie had grabbed the most $$$ in the opening weekend. I had seen the trailer and it was not too tempting either. Still, curiosity got the best of me. And believe me, the movie is not that bad. Just try and avoid taking your parents with you, or for that matter, your kids. Some of the stuff is really gross... I mean REALLY REALLY gross.As it is a spoof, so don't expect any coherent storyline or plot, although the movie generally tags along the line of IKWYDLS, in between, several other ideas are thrown in. "The Sixth Sense" bit ("I See Dead People") was added, probably at the last minute, therefore it was totally disconected.The first scene of the movie, Carmen, running around in her underwear, was classic stuff. Just like any James Bond movie, the first scene HAD no relevance to the rest of the movie :-)Then the story picked up, when it started following the IKWYDLS routine, with several really interesting spoofs. The bit where the Cameron Diaz-like cum scene was created, was overdone. So was the gut-wretching male orgasm. It made the audience go wild, nevertheless. The grosser the better, it seems.The bit, which was picked up from "The Matrix" was surreal, but then the whole movie was surreal. The end of the movie made a mockery of the tag line "... No Sequel". Interesting Stuff.All in all, a couple of hours worth spent, with genuine laughs and some really wild scenes. Worth it. I'd give it an 8.5 anytime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it on Tuesday and I thought it was as funny as heck. Everybody is saying it's a bad bad movie and they think it's racist and they rip on women. Well I'm a girl and I thought it was funny not sickening or predgidous. Although I do have to admit the sex scene and bathroom scene and the Gym teacher parts were grotesque. So if you're not going to see it because you dont wanna see gross stuff just close your eyes on those parts the rest is fine. It was good though I wouldn't recommend it to NE one under the age of 11. This is a parody of alot a movies, Scream Series, Sixth Sense, I know what you did series, Halloween H20(Buffy dragging on the ground after leg incident),Blair Witch, Matrix and Usual Suspects. So if you've seen all of these movies you can quickly recognize some funny s**t. AS to the reference it was racist the only part I thought was even border line but definitely was not racist is when the news guy goes "White folks are dead we gettin the f*** outa here" and Shorty(Waynes) is a druggie but there's white guys right there next to him smokin pot. Overall I think it was a funny movie and that R was a fair rating. So go see it!</fullReview>

Similar to their homage to the urban films in Don't Be A Menace in South Central..., they didn't hold back on any of their sight gags. You can't try to analyze this movie too much or you'll miss the humor. It's a fun flick. I definitely need to see it again because I missed some dialogue from laughing too hard (along with the other audience members). Absolutely loved it.</fullReview>

Oh yeah, and there's a "usual suspects" reference thrown in there that you might not understand. But if you're a huge fan of those movies, you will LOVE this movie. It mainly spoofs the scream movies, and it is unbelievably funny. Example: Deputy Dewey's name is....Doofy. A mentally retarded man who gets to play as a police officer. Funny stuff.

		<fullReview>Way back in the early 80s, when Airplane and the like films came out, they had no intention of having a plot, and Scary Movie remembers that. What we do get is a no holds barred parody of the recent rash of teen horror flick that have come out in the last few years. Scream, The Sixth Sense, I Know What you did Last Summer, and the Matrix among others all are given an ol' punch in the guts through this film. The plot, which is very thin, is used only to keep the gags running along. But who cares? This film is very much aware it is a movie, and takes good advantage of it, with the gags coming along a mile a minute. Scary Movie is meant to be silly, and it pulls more jokes off more than it misses. I found myself laughing heartily at this film, along with the majority of theater. From the amazingly hilarious opening sequence, which features the ravishingly beautiful Carmen Electra, to it's subtle gags involving the facial expressions of the killer's mask, Scary Movie is non-stop laughter from the beginning to the end. Parent's beware, how this movie avoided the NC17 rating, I'll never know, and frankly I don't care. Well worth the price of admission at any cost!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's with the MPAA? Last year it took South Park:BL&amp;U like six or seven version of the film before finally getting an R rating but they let this film get away with stuff 20 times worse. Well I'm sure glad they did because it's down right hilarious. The jokes and gags come one after another and some right out of left field, you didn't even see that coming. This film is not only a great spoof but a fantastic gross out comedy. There's Something About Mary, American Pie, Road Trip, Porky's, they don't even come close to the gross out gags in this film. It's also great in the spoof department. Some of the scenes use almost the exact same dialogue and it works real well. The cast was great. Each performance was good in that they spoofed the character they were supposed to spoof. Anna Faris was perfectly cast as the Neve/Jennifer character. In some of the scenes I thought I was watching Neve. Jon Abrahams does a great job in the Skeet Ulrich part. At some points in the film, he even sounded like him, it was scary. Marlon Wayans was extremely funny as the stoner, Randy. This is going to go down as one of the funniest movies of all time and up there with Airplane! and Hot Shots as one of the great spoof films. Scary Movie is the funniest film of 2000, without a doubt. Get off your couch and check this one out. It will shock, rock and keep you laughing for all night long.</fullReview>

As soon as the movie opened, I was laughing. But, let me warn you: This IS a gross-out movie, so be prepared to be grossed out. Like, a lot. But still, that stuff was funny. Some of the jokes still have me laughing. If you have seen "Scream", "I Know What You Did..." and those movies, you'll love it. If you haven't seen those movies, don't bother. But anyway, the movie is hilarious. Anna Faris was great as "Cindy Campbell". Shannon Elizabeth (I liked her so much more in this than "American Pie".) was hilarious.

This movie combines Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, I Know What You Did Last Summer, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, Bay Watch, and several others. When I went to see this movie the theater was FULL! People of all ages where there and by the end everybody was laughing. If you want to see a comedy that doesn't have the other genres added in you need to see the movie. It does have some cheap jokes in it but hey, cheap jokes can still make you laugh. :0) The main thing I'm trying to say in all of this is SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the funniest spoof type movie I have ever seen. It sure knocks the socks off of Naked Gun, Airplane, Hot Shots and any other Leslie Nielson movie...a must see. Although the movie Scream was in fact a great movie, everyone knows that most horror movies are rather laughable...this brings out the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Scream have a plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Did I Know What You Did Last Summer make any sense?". This is the question that is posed during one of the many funny scenes of Scary Movie. While I did enjoy those movies, I do acknowledge some of their flaws, therefore it was a pleasure to poke fun at those and many other horror classics. Scary Movie (Scream's original title) is a 90 minute laugh out loud experience you need to witness. Sure it isn't the smartest spoof comedy ever, but between the more pop culture oriented jokes, as well as the sexual references, you may find some gems in this Wayans Bros. script. As the movie that launched Anna Faris as a comedy heavyweight, one can definitely see her style present in this film. My favorite among the series, Scary Movie is ,in general, my favorite spoof movie, with Airplane coming in as the best of the genre as a whole. As far as this one goes, it is in my eyes a comedy classic since its serves its purpose of making your insides burst out with genuine laughter. Don't miss it.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movies are such crap...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...And I think that this is what Scary Movie here is trying to prove to us. Many scriptwriters think that by making a character do a stupid decision is going to make the movie a lot scarier, but unfortunately, the movie is usually ruined because of those stupid actions. Take Carmen Electra, at the beginning, for example. Why the hell did she have to take the banana while there was a couple of other weapons that were a lot better, such as a handgun? It just shows a great example to not imitate. The acting was pretty good: The Wayans brothers, Anna Faris and many other were pretty good at imitating mediocre actors. Overall, Scary Movie is a really good choice to look at if you just watched a horror movie and felt really, really disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this movie stand out for me, is the emergence of Anna Faris. She is possibly the funniest, sexiest, cleverest, most captivating, intelligent and gorgeous actress in all of Hollywood right now - or possibly ever - and destined to go straight to the top, where she will remain for many years (Ok maybe I'm in love!)Even if you disagree (fools) there is no doubt that this spoof is the greatest of the spoof movies, and to call it a spoof really doesn't do it credit. I'm sure in years to come there will be spoofs of Scary Movie. This is original and funny in it's own right.Why bother trying to analyse this further? Just grab a beer and go watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This afternoon, I finally watched this movie through from beginning to end. You know what...I did not laugh once. This movie is just ridiculous. How in the world can such a stupid movie, make so much money at the box office? Are we all without minds in this world?This movie is a complete ripoff of Scream (which it parodies), and all other of the newer 90's style horror movies. Hollywood must really be hurting for ideas if a movie this terrible could actually be made.If you want to laugh, watch one of Mel Brooks' parodies, or the Monty Python films, or even The Pink Panther movies. These are true comedies. This is just a sick and twisted, incoherent movie with absolutely nothing funny in it. Now excuse me while I go and dust off my copy of Beverly Hills Cop, and watch a real entertaining, funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Darn Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK people. Enough is enough. I'm standing up for this movie. I had walked into the theater not knowing what to expect. After hearing about the nudity, I was definitely intrigued. Yes, this movie has a TON of gross out jokes that make Something About Mary seem like Sesame Street. The gross out jokes will no doubt make many people uncomfortable. In retrospect, this movie should have probably been NC-17, but it was really pretty harmless. (the girl-in-the-movie-theater-talking-on-the-phone bit should have been done a long time ago) The stereotyping is pretty bad, but again, harmless. I was more or less shocked at the material, rather than offended. There could have been less Scream spoofs and more "old-school" horror jokes, but I wouldn't trade the Doofy material for anything. Great impersonation! Cheri Oteri was a wonderful presence, in a great Blair Witch knockoff. The ghostface killer does a nifty little Friday the 13th music impression. And, there is a very brief Halloween spoof with Cindy in the classroom. The sex jokes were way over-the-top but pretty darn clever. After seeing Me, Myself, and Irene (which was god-awful, especially if you're used to seeing Jim Carrey doing good movies) I was thrilled to leave Scary Movie thoroughly pleased. Regardless of the tagline, everyone should expect a sequel. (the movie is grossing a ton of money) I'm already buying my popcorn...</fullReview>

What an achievement,comedy everywhere you look, TASTEFUL gore (not simply blood everywhere) and a selection of decent actors. Anna Faris will most likely have a great movie career, the Wayans brothers were a nice touch, as was Shannon Elizabeth, Lochlyn Munro and another intriguing character, Regina Hall. All I can say is see this film, have some laughs and buy the sequels as soon as possible, as they are equally fantastic in all aspects of comedy and quite possibly, horror!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SCARY MOVIE (**1/2) Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra, Shannon Elizabeth, Anna Faris, Kurt Fuller, Regina Hall, Lochlyn Munro, Cheri Oteri, Dave Sheridan, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kelly Coffield, David L. Lander. `Airplane!' meets `Scream' could've been the pitch made by director Keenan Ivory Wayans and his talented sibling screenwriters Marlon &amp; Shawn to their studio, Dimension, in this riotously funny, hit and miss, parody of the horror genre. Taking merciless jibes at the slasher films including `I Know What You Did Last Summer' among others, the satire focuses on B.A. Corpse High School and the costumed serial killer who begins a string of nasty killings starting with bodacious Electra (aping Drew Barrymore's signature opening to the first `Scream') whose silicone implants can't save her attacker nor from getting run over by her parents (oblivious to their daughter's plight by engaging in oral sex, the first of many sexual jokes throughout). Of course the media jumps on to glamourize the murders with the help of newshound Gail Hailstrom (`SNL's Oteri, spoofing Courteney Cox's rabid media blitzer) aimlessly trying to get a scoop. And then there are the generic teens-victims-to-be including Faris as the Neve Campbell/Jennifer Love Hewitt character, Cindy. Though not as hilarious as the granddaddy of all spoofs `Airplane!', `Scary Movie' (incidentally this was the original title of the first `Scream'), does attempt to get as many laughs for its buck in taking shots at the mentally ill, smoking dope, homosexuals, genitalia, and for me the biggest laugh was the predominately white film audience silencing an obnoxiously loud black character through all types of violence. Gross jokes, sex jokes, and any thing that will stick to the wall jokes get their dues paid here and then some. The Wayans brothers - Shawn as Ray, a football player with sexuality issues and Marlon as Shorty, the fun-loving pot head who hooks up the killer with some hilarious moments of getting baked - co-scripted this lampoon (and get onscreen credit with co-writers Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg &amp; Aaaron Seltzer) and provide most of the laughs often at their own expense and with a helping hand from elder brother Keenan (who has a cameo in a trailer for `Amistad 2'), clearly know how to make one laugh and even if their tv series for 5 seasons was axed (as it is fondly recalled in the film's climax), be certain that an inevitable sequel will unearth itself in all its grotesque giddiness ensuing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crude, rude and annoying parody of 'Scream' (parts 1 and 2) and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', follows their plots pretty closely, but also throws in gags poking fun at The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project Project, The Matrix and Amistad (?), plus some American PIE. Anna Faris, the only thing to shine in this cesspool, has the Neve Campbell virginal heroine role. She's perfect as the aloof Cindy Camp-bell, whose friends are stalked by a mysterious ghost-faced killer(s) who likes to smoke pot and look at porn mags. Supporting characters include Deputy Doofy, a retarded deputy sheriff who has sex with his vacuum cleaner and SNL star Cheri Oteri as reporter Gail Hailstorm, who "swallows." Shannon Elizabeth becomes Miss Teen Fellatio and Shawn Wayans gets a penis stuck through his head.For some reason, it took six writers (including 3 Wayans brothers) to come up with juvenile bad-taste gags involving farts, semen, snot, drool, silicone implants, penis size, pubic hair, vomit, panty-sniffing dyke gym coaches with testicles and other yummy stuff. Gays, retards, suicide cases and fat chicks are other points of comedy. John Waters was targeting the same taboo subjects for parody in the 1970s, but he managed to make it all funny. The novelty shock value is now gone and the gags are just tiresome and disgusting. There's a whole lot going on in 'Scary Movie,' but the obnoxious cast overacts and very little of this is actually funny. A surprise box-office hit, it was followed by two equally pitiful sequels and some direct-to-video copies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie (2000): Dir: Keenan Ivory Wayans / Cast: Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Shannon Elizabeth, Shawn Wayans, Kurt Fuller: Hilariously crude comedy that sets out to spoof the slasher film sub genre particularly Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The title is a mockery suggesting the extreme vulgarity within the humour with jokes like the ear-tickling penis scene or the testicles that hang just below the skirt of an unshaven gym teacher. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans proves that he knows the genre and is backed with a terrific resembling production. Anna Faris plays the heroine who receives ominous phone calls. Jon Abrahams plays her moron boyfriend accused of murder. Shannon Elizabeth plays pageant winner in a role highlighted by Sarah Michelle Gellar in I Know What You Did Last Summer. She is even named Buffy like the famed character whom Gellar portrayed in a popular TV show. Carmen Electra exploits every flaw made by horror heroines in the film's hilarious opening scene. Shawn Wayans earns a few laughs as a flamboyant homosexual character who seems to say the wrong things. Kurt Fuller is hilarious as a police captain low on empathy and high on showing pictures unrelated to the case. The ending is a tremendous Scream reference only it goes the extra mile that has Faris screaming at the heavens. Vulgar but very clever and?scary. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true that times change. Porky's made quite a stir within the media decades back, a crude `teen' film which was offensive back in those days and was covered with sexual references from top to bottom. In the late 90's, other movies came along which were being classed as `The Porky's of the 90's', such as American Pie, There's Something About Mary etc... These, while tastless still, vanished without a trace. In 2000, a horror movie spoof named Scary Movie arrived. Had this movie been released ten years ago, the broadcasting standards would have banned this movie outright.The Internet is now making people more accustomed to the likes of delicate subjects. Sex is commonplace, offends very few now. Your average teen has probably had so much sex they can relate to this easily. This film is Porky's multiplied by ten. This spoof analyses the slasher movie, from Friday the 13th to modern day `classics' such as Scream, and basically points and laughs. The Wayans Bros want us to be offended. Luckily, your writer has seen enough of this type of film to be offended. This film is intentionally crude, silly, and outrageous. And in the process it also makes you realise the fine line between memorable films and forgettable ones. Scary Movie is a film to watch with friends, have a laugh at, then leave. It has been no less then 24 hours from me enjoying the films humour, and I've forgotten most of what happens already. Now, take a classic like John Carpenter's `The Thing'. I saw this movie many years ago, and I can still remember everything about it. The only thing that sticks in my mind on view of this film is the hordes of teenage audiences, they are the ones that will truly enjoy this film. This is their genre. Sad as it is, promiscuity, oral sex, excessive alcohol, dope smoking and anti-gay stance is everything they can relate to. Funny as your writer sounds, your writer is 19 too ? this film was merely a step over the neighbours fence.More disturbing is the fact that someone here pointed out, anyone in the United States can get into the cinema to see this. The sad truth of what is happening today in society. Although I believe censorship should be there, since parents today aren't capable of looking after their children enough to know what influence films can have.This film marks the overdue burial of the slasher movie. So predictable, Scary Movie stands firmly on the dying body of all things Friday The 13th, Halloween, and (god forbid) Leprechaun.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Best: The non stop laughs, makes us think where in the world did this guys got this ideas?? The Worst: Few jokes are somehow superficial and don't stand side by side with the rest. The movie had so little minutes of life?.. Rating: 8/10This is a non merciful satiric comedy that parodies the teenage horror movies that came crumbling after the excellent Scream that serves as a model started after a bunch a murders of teenagers committed by a ghost face killer. Soon an arrogant journalist starts covering the story which starts worrying a high school girl that asks herself if the killer is the same man she and her friends killed last summer on Halloween.The plot parodies not only the Scream trilogy, but strikes as well movies like `I Know What You Did Last Summer', `Titanic', `Sixth Sense', `The Usual Suspects', `The Blair Witch Project', `Matrix' among others with successful or unsuccessful results. Keenan Ivory Wayans' directing is neither subtle nor elegant, but wasn't meant to, as the movie doesn't ask for it, it's mission is to show in our face violently or unviolently the comedy Matrix, that succeeds its mission. The gags are so enormous and compulsive that the big majority strike the point as few other don't which isn't a big problem because this movie is a princess compared to other American comedy movies that are it's slaves.Don't by any chance lose this film, see it and you'll consider your money and time, very well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movies like these should get NC-17.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Scary Movie opened last year and became a blockbuster. Why? I have no clue. Apparently, giant sperm fountains, penises, boobs, farts, and especially smoking pot, are funny. I can't believe this movie comes from the creators of The Wayan Brothers. The Wayan Brothers was a television show with the two brothers Sean and Marlon. They were f-u-n-n-y. Now, the brothers are back, but this time the director is the older brother Keenon Ivory. The humor looks a lot like There's Something About Mary, but there's one slight difference. TSAM wasn't completely sick and it was hilarious! Scary Movie is the kind of movie that should get NC-17, but doesn't. That means anyone can go in. A boy I know, he's 7 years old, and he was aloud going to Scary Movie with his cousin, who is 11. Is that justice? You haven't heard nothing yet.The plot is similar to Scream. In fact, it's the exact same as Scream, except the characters are a bunch of dumba**es. The plot goes a little in IKWYDLS, but still maintains Scream. This is mixed with penises, boobs, farts, giant sperm fountains, and the killer who smokes pot. News Flash! The killer is smoking pot, saying he is F'ing stoned, and absolutely no one in the audience is laughing. Is that justice? I'm not done yet.The Wayan brothers are not even funny. Apparently, smoking pot is "cool" and "funny", but actually marijuana should not be treated like this. Saving Grace treated marijuana with elegance, on the other hand. To have a good comedy (and I mean at LEAST good), the jokes have to be given at the right moment and at the right time. They have to also be delivered with elegance. Scary Movie did not. Scary Movie did not contain pazzazz at all, unless you count the sort of humor portrayed here "pazzazz". TSAM, on the other hand, contained enough gags and pazzazz to make absolutely everyone laugh. Why? Because the Farrelly Brothers directed it. Not a complete amateur like Keenon Ivory Wayans.Keenon Ivory Wayans has starred in a lot of parodies, like I'm Gonna Get You Sucka. Scary Movie is a disgrace. It shouldn't even called a "parody". It should be called a "sick blockbuster with absolutely no pazzazz". Hello MPAA! Rate this movie right. It should be NC-17 for: non-stop sick and disgusting humor. The movie Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th, very similar to Scary Movie, was funnier. SIYKWIDLFTT was actually more hilarious than Scary Movie. It was funnier because it contained original gags. Scary Movie had enough clichés. SO MANY clichés, that it got REALLY TIRING. NO ONE laughed, NO ONE cared, and what's up with the ending? It sucks! SIYKWIDLFTT was produced before Scary Movie, and it looks like Scary Movie should've copied that instead of adding a bunch of sick and twisted humor and a WHOLE LOT of clichés to the plot of Scream.At some point in the movie, after saying "Sick", "Gross" or "Ewww" about a 100 times, I wanted to go to Blockbuster and rent a Monty Python. Any Monty Python. Hello people! The Monty Pythons are sitting on the shelf in the comedy section, waiting for someone to enjoy them and find out what a REAL parody looks like. The Monty Pythons are original, contain pazzazz, and no SICK HUMOR! My only recommendations would be NOT to rent Scary Movie, but rent a Monty Python. I suggest "The Holy Grail" or "Life of Brian".Anna Farris, playing the main character "Cindy" was the only funny actress. The brand new actress is very funny, and should not have starred in such a bad movie. Even though she is the only redeeming quality, the movie should not even be given 1 star. The horrible Dude, Where's My Car contained much more redeeming qualities than Scary Movie, and that is NOT a good thing. The people who actually "like" Scary Movie are those who say it's "cool", and those people are either mentally challenged or are 7 years old and don't know what "sperm" actually is yet.Parodies like ANY Monty Python or Scream If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th, are the only "parodies" I can recommend. In fact, Scary Movie should not even be called a "parody" or even a "comedy", but just a should-have-been-NC-17-piece-of-sick-and-twisted-crap movie. Then again, it shouldn't even be called a "movie". Ok, I'm getting annoying. You have been warned. I can't belive there is a sequel.0/10 (No comment)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out well, goes downhill pretty quickly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ****Scary Movie is, of course, the parody to Wes Craven's immensely popular Scream. I've never been a huge fan of Scream so I was actually looking forward to a film that would be poking fun at it, as well as countless other films in the genre. Unfortunately, it's not very funny, despite some big laughs in certain spots. For the most part, this is a time waster, and while I've seen worse, it's not worth your hard-earned money unless you really, really hate Scream or just absolutely love sexual jokes.I don't think there's a real reason to go over the story, since it's essentially Scream added with individual scenes from other horror films. The movie starts out fairly well, actually. Carmen Electra is the movie's opening victim, and she has a lot of fun playing the part. I particularly enjoyed her response to what she thought was the scariest she'd ever seen. After this opening scene, there are some more laughs to be had, but it grows more tiresome as it moves along, which can't be a good thing when you consider the fact the film's only 88 minutes long.There are a lot of movies spoofed here, some work much better than others. The Wayan Brothers need to know what films to let well enough alone, such as The Matrix. Seeing a normal teen kick ass like Carrie Ann-Moss might be funny to some, but not to me. I mean, for crying out loud, we have a movie that parodies parts of that film, it's called Battlefield Earth (and it was a lot funnier in that movie). The only non-horror film that's parodied that works here is probably with Amistad, and it only worked because the filmmakers were African-American.But, I think, overall the real problem is the over-reliance on crude sexual jokes. I mean, it might just be me, but I paid to watch a movie that parodied the horror genre. What I got was a movie that spent 65% of its time thinking that sex jokes are the most brilliant form of humor around. Hell, it even seems like the Wayans Brothers forgot they were parodying horror flicks up until the finale. Do these guys really think it's funny to see a man get stabbed with a penis?Some of the funniest parts feature the killer running around, acting like an incompetent dolt. It's hard to believe these moments were sacrificed for so many jokes on penis size and gay-related humor, most of which almost completely fall flat. In my opinion, I believe the main reason the Wayans brother included so many unbelievably graphic and crude sex jokes was to make it more memorable, even if its in a notorious manner. After all, everybody I've spoken to about this film always bring up those jokes first.The movie stars a couple of the Wayans brothers, who are most definitely energetic but hardly consistently funny. Jon Abrahams gets off a couple of good laughs and I must say I could not recognize Shannon Elizabeth from American Pie; she just looks so...goofy in this movie. Anna Faris undeniably has the most fun, and while she's certainly not a great actress she fits in perfectly here.This was followed by the even moreso unimaginatively titled Scary Movie 2, which I have yet to see, but have heard that it makes the original look good in comparison. I don't know about you, but when it comes to movies, there's nothing more painful than watching a bad comedy that thinks it's so hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So scared that this was ever made, please no more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolute trash. It fails in every way possible. First it fails at making a spoof. Then, it fails at making a fun gross-out comedy for the frat boy crowd. Worst of all, it fails at making anybody laugh. Sure, you will see gallons of white stuff thrown around, but after the 300,000,000th sex joke, you will begin to wonder if the Wayans brothers based this movie on the far more intelligent satire "Scream" or some idiotic porn that cashed in on the teen horror flick revival?How did a movie spoofing something "recent" arrive so late? Four years after Scream and people are still finding this movie relevent and up to date?Also, how on earth are we supposed to find every reference made to some pop culture item funny. This film doesn't make a joke about it, it just repackages it as an alleged punchline. The "Wazzah" guys, the stupid Matrix moment followed by the stupider Riverdance moment, and even Marlon saying he sees dead people. These are just a few of the many pointless references to other movies and pop culture phenomenons. Are these things ripe for spoofing? Sure. Is it funny in this movie? Not a chance. Is this a bad movie? Aweful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most spoofs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is the best spoof and the first good spoof since the origonal Austin Powers. Of corse most spoofs nowdays are very dull because they simply use tired material from people who don't even try to think. Scary Movie is funny enough to recomend though. It's not constantly funny, but funny through out. There is definetly a disgust factor in this movie which goes suprisingly high, with some scenes I didn't even know could be put into an R rated movie. Still if you get past that you can enjoy parts of it. I wouldn't say this movie is as good as Austin Powers, Naked Gun or Airplane, but good enough for some decent comedy. I give this movie a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, its not really a rare occurrence when a real good idea for a film is made into a pretty poor movie, and this is proof.Since the release of Wes Cravens 'Scream' back in '96, people have been trying to jump onto the bandwagan, (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Cherry Falls, Urban Legend, etc). And thus ruining the genre. Scary Movie pokes fun at this, but not very well.The characters name for a start are far to clever; Buffy Gilmore, Cindy Cambell etc. Also a large majority of the gags are just stupid. But I have to say that the Dewey rip off, 'Doofy', is side splitting funny.The bottom line is it tries to be too clever for its own good, and so it fails. There are the obvious film mickey takes, but how many people will spot all the films that are mocked during this??!! Why don't you watch it and see if you can spot them.Marks out of 10. - 2. 'No Mercy. No Shame. No Sequel'. Well only the No Mercy bit is true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artless, unsavoury comedy shocker, luckily with enough tasteless gags to keep you watching and laughing. The humour is crass, but its delivery is enthusiastic and the young cast are entertaining, particularly Anna Faris. Don't think I've seen her in anything before, but I'll be looking out for her in the future. User comments aren't too great for the sequel, and to be honest it seemed like a stretch to fill this first movie with enough appropriate gags. Maybe they should have quit while they were ahead.</fullReview>

The only movies that were scary was Child's Play 1 and Nightmare on Elm street. The rest were just funny. But that is good that they made a movie that was making fun of all that stuff. So Scary movie is good and funny, Can't wait to see the second one. I give it 10/10. Rent the movie, buy the movie, love the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>surprisingly smart satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this one after having seen "Scary Movie 2", because of expectations. I didn't want to see the first one first, and then think that the second one was going to be better. "Scary Movie 2" is certainly the worst movie I have seen this year, next to "Swordfish", of course. However, "Scary Movie 2" did make "Swordfish" look like "Casablanca...2". But, anyway...This film was surprisingly smart. It was probably the best gross-out comedy we've had since "There's Something About Mary", and it was certainly every bit as entertaining. It was good at satirizing breast implants, homosexuality in men's sports, adult/youth relations, and even the horror movies themselves. We all thought we had seen it all when "Scream" spoofed scary movies, but this one took the cake at getting the last laugh with movies like "Halloween" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer". Of course, the sequel was just a collection of witless sight gags and tasteless humor that didn't strike any chord with the audience (believe me, I was in a crowded theater). But, there will always be this film. It is a treat in the parody genre that won't probably last long (because of the pop culture, some of which, has already died out). But we can enjoy it while it's here. A good companion piece to "Scream", as well.</fullReview>

Then we enter the Cinema, and the Usual Movie Start. The Movie, I feel, never took off enough in the Beginning. The Movie had no basis for a Story, and the Movie Lacked the Depth needed to make it that little bit funnier. Some of the Spoofs were good, and the Scream one was what I percieved as a Marvel. If the rest of the Movie had lived up to the few decent scenes in it, then there would have been a much higher rating for this.I do hope that the Writers can improve things for Scary Movie 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very clever and funny movie spoofing the horror films of the 90s. I wouldn't go as far as "The Funniest Movie of All Time." as some of the other reviewers have stated, but it certainly has it's moments.I do like the films that the Wayans brothers make (Dont Drink your Juice, I`m Gonna Git You Sucka etc), and I liked this too.The Films it has digs at are Scream 1 and Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Blair Witch Project, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, American Pie and There's Something About Mary (If there are Anymore, I didn't notice them).I thought the Parody of Blair Witch Project was the funniest. It was the one part of the film, that really made me laugh hard. Just one other thing: I can't believe that the IMDB has listed who the killer is in the cast. To Someone who hasn't seen this film, and has come here to search for Cast details/Reviews etc, is going to see who it is, and not be surprised by the ending !!!8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, a veteran of spoofing other films and television, shows that he really has pushed the envelope up to a new level.

I find it so unbelievable that HBO can run great shows like The Sopranos, Sex and the City, and Six Feet Under, and people can't stop praising them, in which, they should be praised, because they are good; and then material in this movie offends them? I haven't seen anything in this movie that I hadn't seen in Sex in the City that was offensive, but yet that show is a masterpiece by everyones standards. But when a movie makes fun of other movies and throws in sexual humor, that's just appalling to them. It's just a movie people, it is taking cliches, stereotypes, and making them funny! If you were embarrassed to sit among other people in a movie theater to watch this movie, you need to ask yourself are you taking life for what it's worth? This type of movie is what makes life funny, because we are able to make fun of ourselves and realize not everybody acts like this!! People lighten up!!!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" is what it is. The jokes aren't subtle and don't require much thought, but I found myself laughing through a majority of the film. All of the horror cliches are present (and then some). There's a virgin, the horny males, the whores, the sexuality questioners, the cold hearted b*tch, so on and so on.......... Obviously, they are put into the situations of previous horror (and some other genres) films. "Scary Movie" doesn't claim to be anything more than it is, a cheerfully gross comedy. WHAT WORKS: Some dead-on parodies of recent horror films. Cheri Oteri as the intrusive reporter is hilarious, there should have been much more of her. Newcomer Anna Farris is perfect for her virgin role in this film, she's cute as hell, innocent, and yet has a wickedly off-beat side that is perfect for a parody. Most jokes here are good for at least a little chuckle.WHAT DOESN'T: The druggies. They never had a huge role in horror films, so there is no need for them here. Their scenes are annoying and are only there because the writers thought that it would be funny. While the idea of making Dewey from Scream mentally challenged seems a bit humorous, his scenes are just too juvenile to work.Good for plenty of chuckles, "Scary Movie" is a comedy that should be checked out. (NOTE: If you have not seen the movies "Scary Movie" parodies, you will definitely be lost. If you've seen "Scream", you should be fine).</fullReview>

Some of the jokes really work, some of them really don't, but it is thanks to a very funny performance by Anna Faris (standing in for the Jennifer Love Hewitts and Neve Campbells of the world) that makes it worth watching. Features a funny cameo by Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek.</fullReview>

No genius dialogue, no character development: Seriously, who of you guys did expect this? It is a parody on the 90's scary movies (see other comments for a complete list), so what you get is a bunch of teenagers having fun, sex, movies, drugs and so on and making a laugh of it.Many comment writers complain being offended by the sexual references and remind their good taste. These people should not watch comedies like this one. This film is for those of you who don't take themselves too seriously. Only watch it, if you can laugh about yourself sometimes.

		<fullReview>There are comedies which are meant to do more than make you laugh, these are films which can be appreciated even if you don't laugh that much. There are other comedies for which the only purpose is to make you laugh. Scary Movie is one of these. If one of these latter films leaves you rolling in the isles, then the lack of development is overseeable. Otherwise they are not good enough. This film made me laugh on occasions, but nowhere near enough to rectify for its shortcomings. The hit to miss joke ratio is round about the 5% mark. There truly is a lot of useless material that should have been thrown on the scrap heap.Finally to reiterate a point made by others: this is not a spoof! Putting sex jokes around another film's script is not parody, nor is simply repeating lines from other films. This is all this film does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly not intelligent humour. It's not supposed to be, but dumb humour should still make you laugh. Scary movie is a supposed comedy about scary movies, Sadly, it just has loads of scenes ripped straight out of Scream and a few from I know what you did last summer. There are a few lines that are from other films and a 30 second scene here and there but not a lot. The sad thing is that in most cases the lines are done word for word or near enough to what they were in the first place and we are supposed to think it's funny just because they were in another film. No thought has gone into this total garbage at all. Even when it tries to expose other films short comings it actually just exposes it's own. The only thing that is hilariously ironic is the title 'Scary movie'. Because it really is scary when you realize that you paid money to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******SPOILERS******Scary Movie is a really cool movie which is genuinely funny. The way they have taken parts of 'scary' movies and made them into 'comedy' sketches is really cool. Some of my favourites being ones from films such as: The Blair Witch, The Sixth Sense, Scream, I know what you did last summer, The Matrix, and many more. As for the cast, Carmen Electra was ok at the beginning playing Drew Decker. Shannon Elizabeth was really quite annoying though as Buffy Gilmore but I guess that was the whole point of her character. Anna Faris was cool as Cindy Campell. Though she gets hit by a car at the end of the film and is still going to be in the sequel. Lochlyn Munro was good and quite mean as Greg. Jon Abrahams was really cool as Bobby who turned out to be on of the 'killers.' (Even though he only intended to kill Cindy (But doesn't.) and by mistake killed Shorty played by Marlon Wayans who is REALLY funny. Shorty is going to be in the sequel too and the same goes for his real-life funny brother Shawn Wayans who plays Ray and also turns out be one of the killers, even though he hasn't killed anyone and who ALSO dies in the film. Mind you, it is Scary Movie and anything can happen. Like a sequel, which I can't wait to see.The ending was really cool, when we find out that Doofy, (Dave Sheridon.) was the killer, the whole time. He obviously plays the cop who let's just say is very strange. UNTIL, the end when we see his strip of all his 'Doofy' police clothes into a cool outfit and Doofy turns out to be an EXTREMELY G00D-LOOKING guy, who runs away with Gail Hailstorm. (Cheri Oteri.) That leaves Cindy standing outside screaming NOOOOOO with the sheriff,(Kurt Fuller.) knowing that Doofy-The killer has got away. The sheriff see's Doofy's bag on the floor, opens it and finds a Scream mask, a knife, etc. That's the end, now we'll just have to wait and see what the sequel brings. I give Scary Movie a 9/10. Good film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I had a good time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie represents something of an anomaly in my movie going experience. I try to analyse and critique every movie I see with the same standards and level of judgement. I think there are FAR too many teen comedies out there on the back of the success of the 'quite good' "American Pie", and most of them don't hit the mark and seem to be just trying to push the envelope as far as tasteless humour goes. "Scary Movie" is no different to the rest in that respect, and yet I found it hilarious! It probably had something to do with the fact that I was with a group of friends as part of a birthday celebration, and was thus determined to have a good time; but "Scary Movie" definitely hit the spot. Rightly or wrongly, I gave it a 9. On a second viewing I probably wouldn't rate it anywhere NEAR that high, but I really enjoyed myself the first time. I think much of the film's success is due to its philosophy of joke telling: You fling enough mud and some of it will stick. (SLIGHT SPOILER) On a last note, I do think it was a stupid idea to include a skit of the Budweiser 'Whassup?' ad. It's stuff like that that is bound to make a movie dated 10 or even 5 years down the line, if it hasn't done so already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just say that if you are looking for an Academy Award Winner, you won't find it here! Scary Movies pushes a lot of borders which makes it absolutely hilarious. From the beginning you know that this is not going to be like any movie that you have ever seen before. Beautiful girls actually fart in the movie! I enjoyed this aspect of the movie, because I've never seen a girl like Carmen Electra break wind in any movie before, and in real life they do, no matter how gorgeous they are. Then you have the deaths, they are not too disgusting, which is good. Because this movie is a parody of several others( Scream, I know what you did last Summer, Blair Witch Project, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sixth Sense) you know that you can't take it too seriously. I did not find it too offensive, but it did have a lot of stereotypes. It is definitely not for kids under 13, I would say, only because of the sexuality, and the mature, crude subject matter. And it is not for the old-fashioned, or narrow minded folk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie so funny, it's scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, 'Scary Movie' focuses on spoofing all the 90's teen horror flicks that have run through the box office. From 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', through to 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'The Sixth Sense' - no scary movie could escape it's mockings.Cindy Campbell (a reference to Neve Campbells' Scream character, Sidney) is the lead here, who, along with her friends, are being stalked and killed by a bumbling serial killer.Heaps of one-liners, plus hilarious re-makes of some of the best scenes from the horror movies it spoofs, 'Scary Movie' is my favorite film of 2000.Also stars Lochlyn Munro (in Ryan Phillipe's 'I Know...' character), Shannon Elizabeth ('American Pie'), Carmen Electra ('Baywatch') and Cheri Oteri - this is a must for all horror and comedy lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I've come to realize why this movie became one of the fastest gross box office sellers in history, its because of scary people. People who have gone to see this movie over and over really scare me. Why? Because after seeing this movie once I just wanted to puke, like experiencing a tragic car accident right before my eyes. This movie is so horribly un-funny. The bad part is where the movie tries to parody off "The Sixth Sense" and "The Matrix" is just downright pathetic. If I had a million dollars I'd buy up every copy of the movie and have them burned in a bonfire. I would've given this movie a 0 but it gets a 1 out of 10 because the end was the best part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie was one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I usually don't say this about a lot of films because I give the cast and crew the credit for making a movie but this movie was truly bad. The idea of combining other cheesy scary movies into a spoof parody movie was good but this was probably the worst representation for the idea. They could definitely elaborated off the idea. The movie only consisted of extremely perverted humor and scenes showing a penis to attempt to get laughs. Another movie that originally had a good idea for a movie but destroyed it was the movie Waterworld which I believe had a good idea but ruined it due to cheesy scenes and structure and ill-directing, acting, and "all of the above." I no longer wish to digress therefore I conclude that 'Scary Movie' was an awful film and I urge you to avoid seeing it at all cost.</fullReview>

Being a huge fan of SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID... I was able to pick up on the amount of times the dialogue in SCARY MOVIE matched the EXACT words from the spoofed scripts, and it was a lot!! I mean, it's like they just took the SCREAM script and stuck a few jokes in it and actually used the SAME script!! I mean, the words are the exact same!!! I just couldn't get over it! It made me so angry. Kevin Williamson (who wrote both SCREAM 1 &amp; 2 and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID...) should really sue! I've told people this and they say "Oh, but that's what a spoof is". No. A spoof requires more thinking than just throwing in a few jokes in an already published script. I mean, use your imaginations, will you?</fullReview>

You can do better things in 90 minutes. Only two times I had to smile and that was during the Amistad II scene and during the scene in which Cindy's father says he has to disappear for a while for 'uncle Escobar'. I didn't laugh, I only smiled. These films are made for laughing your heart out. The only moment I really laughed was when the end credits started rolling. What a relief!! The end of this piece of s**t.In the movie a character says people stopped the TV show The Wayan Brothers. Looking through the credits I see that the Wayan Brothers are responsible for this and I wonder: Why is he surprised that they stopped the TV show???I still have some questions: Who gave the green light for this one? Who had the power to cancel it? Can't this small army of writers come up with one single FUNNY joke? And, last but not least, WHY ARE THEY MAKING A SEQUEL RIGHT NOW?

		<shortDescription>Scattershot humour often misses the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The verdict? Well, I take the side of people who say that you got what you paid for here -- nobody paid to see this expecting "Schindler's List". That being said, while many of the jokes were funny on their own, there was little pretense at continuity -- it seemed like the movie consisted of one SNL skit followed by another. Part of the difficulty was the nature of the subject matter being spoofed -- the Scream movies were satirical to begin with, and its hard to spoof a spoof. I think that on the whole, the movie could have been tightened up, instead of taking a scattershot approach -- which allowed some of the funnier jokes to be lost amidst the clutter of lousy ones. Also, while the idea of linking "Scream" and "I know what you did..." was amusing, the lifting of dialogue directly from these movies was pretty lame.Funny moments: Cindy emailing police headquarters with the message "White woman in trouble"; that bizarre Usual Suspects thingDisturbing: the scene where the closed gay football player makes his girlfriend put on his uniform before they go at it.And a final thought -- a previous (British) reviewer wrote that he found the "American" humour to be unfunny -- yet listed that hermaphroditic gym teacher as being the only funny moment?!? Seriously, what is with British people and that Crying Game stuff anyway??</fullReview>

But the movie actually has quite a few original gags, although too many relied on the certainty that you had seen the movies it spoofs. If you haven't seen SCREAM, SCREAM 2 and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER you'll like this movie a lot less. Overall, I would say watch this movie if you have seen them and you like this type of comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My number 23 movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is my number 23 movie. I loved the Scream series, I love horror movies, and I love films spoofing them. This movie is made with the screenplay of Scream, part 1, with some new lines in it. I saw Scream about one week before I had seen Scary Movie ( so I had watched it about 5 times till then ), and I knew what they were saying before they actually said it. This film could have been much better, if there had not been those disgusting jokes ( the restroom, the Blair Witch parody, the pubic hair scene, the Dewey parody( was his name Duffy?) ). They were disgusting weren't they? I saw this movie with my friend. We had seen Rush Hour, and South Park, and in those films there were just two guys laughing : me and my friend. But while watching Scary Movie, everyone was laughing. That was something new for us. In some scenes we laughed so hard that we could not get the following jokes. In the evening he reminded me of one scene of scary movie, and we laughed about five minutes about it, because it was just very hilarious.This movie features one of my all-time-favorite characters : it is the killer/s with the mask/s. They/She/He were/was just unbelievable funny.I'm really looking forward to part 2, I hope that they will leave out those disgusting jokes then.Good points about Scary Movie : the killer/s ( and her/his/their voice ) , very hilarious jokes, it parodies horror movies as no movie has done before, beginning, trailerBad points : the same screenplay that Scream has ( were they too stupid to write an own one ), many disgusting jokes, Duffy, Sixth Sense parody, ending.All in all, I rate Scary Movie 9.5/10. I recommend it to horror and spoof fans.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. CU; Rinho.</fullReview>

For my money, it delivered everything it promised. It is incredibly moronic, mindlessly stupid, and basically abysmal - exactly what it's supposed to be! The cross-film references are great, but what I appreciated most were the small background details, e.g., coroner's wagon in the school parking lot (which none of the characters notices), the menu board in the cafeteria, brand-names of the beer in the fridge, descriptions on the condom machines in the boys' bathroom - all of those were hilarious (but you gotta be sharp to catch 'em, 'cuz they go by in only a coupla frames!). Anyone who expects this movie to be the "Airplane!" of teen slasher pics is bound to be let down; the Wayans never lead us (well, me anyway) to believe it would be that. Is it vulgar and offensive? YES! Is it also harmless and does it have several genuinely funny bits? YES! So my advice? Like dating, lower your expectations and you just might have a good time......</fullReview>

All the stunts, jokes and punchlines are childish, lack any real intelligence and are very predictable. I was able to second guess the results of much of the scenes. This is not comedy or parody, it is outright stupidity.Are we at the stage now where Hollywood produces films that are totally cornball, the cast makes complete idiots of themselves, and the humor seems to be aimed at those with an IQ that approaches the freezing temperature of water. We need more productions not at all unlike the gems from Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Terry Gilliam, and Federico Fellini.I could hardly wait for the movie to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not the best parody I've ever tasted...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late 90's horror renaissance was a perfect target for a well done spoof, but "Scary Movie" doesn't deliver.It starts off well, with Carmen Electra parodying Drew Barrymore's performance as the first victim in the original "Scream". When she sees the signs in her yard, the one pointing to the left that says "safety", and the one pointing to the right that says "death", now that was promising. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there.Scary Movie primarily spoofs Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, but there are scenes interspersed that goof on The Matrix, Halloween H20, the Sixth Sense, Scream 2, American Pie, Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, "Dawson's Creek", and those Budweiser "WHAZZZZUUUUUUUP" commercials. That whazzzzzuuuuuuup scene was one of the funnier scenes in the film.I enjoyed how they tied the establishing plots of both Scream and IKWYDLS together, but it seemed strange to have the killer in this one be wearing the same costume as ghostface from Scream. He used Ben Willis' hook from IKWYDLS, but too many of the scenes seemed like they could have been REAL scenes from a Scream film. Keep in mind that the Scream series was intended as a parody of the 80's slasher films, so in effect, we are watching a spoof of a spoof. Can you imagine if somebody made a parody of "Airplane" and called it "Jumbo Jet"? You probably wouldn't expect much, and in the case of "Scary Movie", you don't get much either.And enough with all the ridiculous sexual jokes. I like funny sex jokes as much as the next guy, but with every other scene having blatantly goofy sexual images being thrust at you (um... er...), shoved down your throat (um... sorry...), being the FOCAL POINT (there!) of the entire scene, it gets very boring after a short time. It's like the movie is saying "LOOK LOOK LOOK!!! THIS IS FUNNY!!! AND IT'S DIRTY!!!! THIS IS REALLY FUNNY AND NAUGHTY!!!" Puh-lease.It was fun picking out the movie and character references that scenes were "borrowed" from, but for the most part "Scary Movie" didn't live up to the hype. Perhaps "Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th" will be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a sad state of affairs when a movie like this grosses so much money and is allowed to make a sequel. People refer to 'the dumbing down of America', and after seeing this movie I think they might be right. Why is it that a joke has to deal with either sex or farting in order to be funny? I yearn for the days when we could find other things to laugh at. One or two jokes is funny. Eight thousand is not. This movie is a rehash of the same tired jokes over and over again. After awhile it becomes tedious to watch.If it was indeed trying to parody scary movies, shouldn't there have been more scary movie parodies? This movie starts out fairly good, but slowly starts to turn into the parody of a porno movie instead of a scary movie. There are some funny parts, I'll admit that, but there was nothing that had me laughing out loud. I think I laughed harder when I saw Scream. This movie is a blatant rip-off of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. All the Wayans brothers truly did was add a few sex and fart jokes to a storyline that was already established, which creates a completely unoriginal movie. I am not easily offended, but this movie made me sick. How many naked body parts do I need to see? It is absolutely not appropriate for anyone under the age of 18. This is a very good concept (although it was already done in Scream) and could have led to a very funny movie, but instead it stooped to a level so low that I am embarrassed for all of the actors involved. Do not waste your money on this movie. Do not go and see the sequel. All you are doing is putting money in the pockets of two people who clearly have no imagination or talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take Airplane, smash it together with some XXX movie, take any of the good jokes from airplane and make them bad, and you've got scary movie. Any of the good jokes in the movie (very very few) were basically in the ads on tv. There were a countless number (no i'm serious...countless) of sex jokes which seemed to come out of nowhere...not to mention they weren't funny. Some of the funniest moments in the movie were not related to any movie they were trying to spoof, in fact most of the stupid jokes came from the movies they WERE TRYING to spoof. Basically that's what ruined this movie...too many attempts to joke at the other movies...maybe they ran out of time to write the jokes...maybe the actors were incompetent (more likely)...but either way this movie gets 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this movie and finally found the DVD at the video store after looking for a couple of weeks. I wish that I hadn't wasted my time searching. The Wayans family is a very funny one but they seem not to be able to get their act together since "In Living Color." I am not one of those people who criticize a comedy because the story is dumb or the acting isn't Oscar caliber, I love a good parody. This film however did not even come close to my expectations. There were a few genuinely funny moments, but overall the film was a stinker. I think the idea of making fun of the recent rash of horror films is a great idea, but this one never gets off the ground. Perhaps the Wayans' failed to realize that "Scream" was Wes Craven's tribute to the predictable, rehashed horror movies of the 1980's. It was a parody in itself. I hope the sequel is better, but with all of their hits so far, I'm not getting my hopes up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I set out to watch Scary Movie, I expected something more along the lines of "Don't Be A Menace To South Central...". Instead, I get a flick that is more suitable for the x-rated room of the video store.I'm no prude, by far, but this movie actually offended me, which is a first for modern cinema. Most of the 'jokes' stem from vulgar sex references, many of which were so blunt that I was left with my jaw on the ground. Some of the parodies are funny in concept, and there are a few legitimate laughs, but most scenes wind up being marred by sex, sex talk, and sex jokes. And lest we forget, sexual imagery, including shots of...*ahem*...male genitalia. It sets a new low for 'lowest common denominator' entertainment.</fullReview>

To be honest this movie was bizarre and not all that funny (there were maybe two belly laughs here and there) as the humor was more focused on crudity and slapstick than irony or anything more spontanteously clever.

		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" is not so much a real movie as it is a nonstop orgy of cheaper-than-cheap gags, jokes, puns and asides poking fun at the popular wave of teen slasher-horror films that have flooded the theatres in recent years. As with most movies (parodies) of this type, the jokes are definitely hit-and-miss, but enough of them are sufficiently outrageous and hilarious enough to make this worth your time. You don't HAVE to be familiar with the SCREAM films (and all the other myriad films and pop-culture references contained herein) being sent-up here, but the recognition factor definitely adds another level of enjoyment.The script (such as it is) was co-written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, who earlier were part of the troupe of TV's groundbreaking "In Living Color," which was created by their older brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who serves as director on this flick. The pair also dabbled rather successfully a few back with parody when they took the p*** out of gangsta rap and "Boys N The Hood"-type films in "Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood. So these guys definitely know what they're doing. As a director, Keenen keeps the energy level high and the raunchy gags coming at breakneck speed. It's not high art, but if it makes audiences of all ages laugh practically nonstop for 90 minutes, why does that matter?</fullReview>

Second let me say how absolutley tasteless and downright embarassing a lot of the scenes with the girls were, especially the lead character losing her virginity and the beauty pageant. I did not see a spoof here, I saw another vehicle for mainstream ideals to come across to make people ashamed of their bodies and young girls who went on dates to see this movie (how fooled they were by the trailer!) think that all they are good for is sex and be embarassed about everything even down to their pubic hair. I saw very few jokes made about male genitalia in the film, and I think it was tasteless (and not in a good way).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SCARY MOVIE is the quintessential slasher parody, meeting the spoof points that SCREAM failed to touch upon. The opening scene is a gem, and other highlights include the I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER spoof, and the ending itself (which I won't reveal), not to mention the numerous in-jokes taking jabs at the teen culture that makes these senseless, monotonous slasher flicks such big hits.SCREAM went askew in making itself a serious slasher film. Yeah, it had its share of in-jokes, but it too often adhered to the same stereotypes that it tried to satirize, not to mention giving us a horrible ending. SCARY MOVIE doesn't do that, it completely relies on the humor of those tedious films to carry it, and carry is what it certainly does.Abundance of vulgarity may turn some viewers off, though its no more vulgar than that THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY garbage, and audiences seemed to love that.*** out of ****.</fullReview>

Lots of drug content, sex/nudity...but it is all mostly played for laughs and not to be taken too seriously. I mean, it's just a spoof anyway. I loved the opening sequence ("Oops...I farted"), as well as the scene in the movie theater and of course, we cannot forget Miss Mann ("Come in dear, sit down...take off your bra if you'd like,").

		<fullReview>The Wayans brothers should have known better. "Scary Movie" is a spoof of "Scream", which was itself a spoof of the concept of the "80's teen slasher" movie genre, which itself was a spoof of the cheesy Roger Corman exploitation horror movie genre of the late 50's and 60's. Sounds great, huh?If you thought "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1", "Fatal Instinct", "Hot Shots Part Deux" and "Silence of The Hams" were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet! The writing here is awful, the good jokes in this movie (like the funny ode to the Usual Suspects) are few and far between and the rest of the jokes for the most part are stupid and designed to not exceed beyond the intellect and comprehension of the average 8th grader. In short, this movie sucked.Shawn and Marlon Wayans can be funny (and have been in the past). They were clearly in their element when they wrote "Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood" in ode to the utterly ridiculous, black stereotyping "hood" movie craze of the early 90's. That movie was funny because they actually made it in line with films like "The Naked Gun" and "Top Secret" -- It was a true spoof. The jokes in there were well thought out and well timed. The movie was well written. It was a film that had to be made, eventually, given how utterly ridiculous these "hood" movies were starting to get. "Scary Movie" on the other had was a film that didn't need to be made. The original "Scream", as it is, was a great spoof of the teen slasher genre already, filled to the brim with self aware pop-culture dialogue that made even Tarantino shake his head at the utter pretentiousness of it all. It was great. It spawned a whole genre of the exact same types of self-aware slasher films that never took themselves seriously in the first place. Making a film like "Scary Movie" would be like making a movie spoofing "Austin Powers". It relies solely on a couple of unfunny offensive sight gags with no comical timing whatsoever (which are surprisingly non-subtle, given the knack for comic timing these guys displayed during some of the scene's in "Don't Be A Menace") and on a bunch of dumb jokes about `weed' and other current pop-culture things (those insipidly stupid "Wuzzzup" commercials, The Matrix, etc....). I think I laughed thrice during the entire duration of this film. As one other person here said, I can't imagine the feeling watching a movie like this 20 years from now. Its movies like this that make you appreciate a good "spoof" film. The genre was very overdone for awhile, but a film as witless as this makes you yearn for a good ol' Mel Brooks film and another film staring Leslie Nealson. It also makes you cringe at the glaring double standard in Hollywood. If you an make interesting, intelligent and unconventional film like "Eyes Wide Shut" or "American Psycho", you will probably have to censor vital scene's of the film to avoid an NC-17 rating, but if you want to make a buffo box-office, brainless, laughless and witless teen comedy, you can include all the tasteless "dick" shots and "cum" shots you want and still get an "R" Rating, since we know an NC-17 would cut into your core audience. I give it a 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

I was so glad I saw this film, it is easily one of the most enjoyable experiences of 2000.The local school is in shock after a man in a black cloak and a white ghost-mask (sound familiar?) kills one of the students. Reporter Gail Hailstorm seduces police officer Doofy in order to get the inside information, while other school kids start to fall victim to the killer. I know, I know, the plot summary is short, but Scary Movie doesn't have a plot of its own. It's simply a montage of scenes from Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, all done in a spoof-like way.Hugely enjoyable performances from newcomer Anna Faris who plays Cindy Campbell, and Carmen Electra who plays Drew Decker, the porn babe who acts in the hilarious opening attack. But, the stand-out is Shannon Elizabeth, the Tatum-like girl who has a scene with the killer with is so funny that you'll be crying. Elizabeth actually acts in the film, but you can tell she is having so much fun. I also admire the director's, not because their direction is full of effort and brilliant, but because they let the cast have almost as much fun as the audience.Some audiences should be warned, but I encourage any people who want a gross-out good time to go and see this memorably funny flick.I rate Scary Movie 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but Stunningly Disposable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a moment, around four minutes into Scary Movie, where Carmen Electra, playing the preprocessed meat role originated by Drew Barrymore in Scream, makes a joke about having a black boyfriend who's going to beat up the psycho who's taunting her on the phone. It takes several seconds to remember that for about thirty seconds Carmen Electra was married to Dennis Rodman. But when the killer turns on the pool lights to reveal the boyfriend he's kidnapped, it isn't Rodman, but Prince. Well, what percentage of the teen audience that made Scary Movie such a huge hit even remembers Prince before his name became a glyph? And how many remember, or care, that Carmen Electra was once musical hopeful in the Prince Paisley Palace empire. Electra, of course, has gone through several lives since then. She posed nude; she co-hosted an MTV gameshow; she was on Baywatch. Basically, Electra was the perfect star for this opening sequence. Not because she gets such a kick out of self mockery, which she clearly does, but because she is the perfect disposable (and reusable) icon for this film, which may be the most disposable film ever made.First of all, Scary Movie is funny. It's frequently even very funny. In a crowded theater or crowded room, the laughter is largely wall to wall. With that out of the way, it's tempting to ask if anybody is ever going to pick the film up in twenty years and still find it funny. It's my guess that they won't have a clue what's going on. And that's why Scary Movie is so sad. It's hip. It's current. And it sure won't have a legacy.Airplane was made more than 20 years ago. It's still the funniest film (in terms of laughs per second of screentime) ever made. Blazing Saddles, The Producers, and Young Frankenstein are also still amazingly funny films. Were these films funnier at the second they were released than they are now? Inevitably. All the films get much of their humour from boundary breaking. Compared to Scary Movie, they're all pretty tame. They also get much of their humour from parodies of cinematic conventions. They all look 100% original compared to Scary Movie.The most hilarious thing about Scary Movie is how it reflects on the self-cannibalization rampant in Hollywood. In this case it's Miramax's Dimension films that represents the serpent devouring its own tail. Scary Movie, of course, is a parody of the Scream movies. And Dimension produced both the Scream trilogy and Scary Movie. Scary Movie is Dimension's assurance that there's no point in another Scream movie (arguably there wasn't a point in the third). After all, what can you do when you get a movie that parodies a movie that parodied a genre? Nothing. You hit a dead end.Similarly, Scary Movie hits a cultural dead end. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans (who you probably forgot directed Low Down Dirty Shame, as well as creating In Living Color) and written by several Wayans siblings, Scary Movie pokes fun at the Screams, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, The Sixth Sense, and any number of other recent movies and commercials. The problem is that when the movie came out this summer, it's Matrix jokes were already a little past their freshness date. Watching them on video, it seems positively stale. Already. Sure it's funny, but for how much longer? The Usual Suspects jokes are old. The "Wassup" sequence will be absolutely meaningless within three years. After all, would you still get a kick out of a movie from the 80s making Spuds jokes? Or if the "Yes I Am" guy showed up in an early 90s movie would you laugh? Perhaps, but only at the lameness.The expiration date on Scary Movie is accelerated by the fact that the non-parody jokes (including a legion of gay jokes) are the least funny parts of the film. Scary Movie frequently mentions the fact that it's a near scene-by-scene remake of the original Scream and as a result, the humour is similarly paint-by-numbers. Some of the quality slapstick will always be funny, and the stoner elements (mostly in the person of Marlon Wayans's Shorty) will always have their adherents. But at a certainly point the film will hit a brick wall.I'm overanalyzing Scary Movie, of course. Dimension made the film on the cheap to make a quick buck. They succeeded. And, more importantly to me, people were happy with the movie. Some of the reviews were positive and audiences kept coming back from more. And despite the tag line "No mercy. No shame. No sequel," a sequel is inevitable. So look at your TV or movie screen now and see what's hot. That's what'll be mocked in Scary Movie 2, which will certainly cost a penny, make a mint, and spawn another sequel. Perhaps against all odds, one of those movies will look beyond the instant gratification of the cheap laugh to try to create something that will last.But why would anybody want to do a silly thing like that?I give this one a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer was that they had different directors. So the fact that Scary Movie welds together the Kevin Williamson screenplays for those films was overlooked by most reviewers. I mean, darn, even the title is Williamson's original title for Scream.Williamson's films were themselves parodies of the genre and the Wayans have decided to do a rather less subtle parody, a gross-out version.I like to work a bit harder for my laughs but Scary Movie does have funny moments and enough spunk to carry the audience's goodwill past the less funny moments. It is maybe worth seeing once but it isn't funny enough or original enough to bear repeated viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a real shame. If you want to watch an EVEN MORE stupid version of Scream that is exactly the same but with supposedly funny sex-related jokes, go watch Scary Movie. The jokes are very disgusting, I'd say they're so bad I could not imagine them. I won't make any descriptions, because they didn't accept my last comment on this film the last time because of the descriptions...that's another proof of how nasty they are. Very crude humor, even worse than Nutty Professor 2, even though I haven't seen it, and I will probably never see it. The acting wants to parody the pathetic acting in Scream...but, they do the job so bad I knew they did their best and tried to be serious too...okay, that's mean, but true. The Wazzup joke was just another cliché, one of the thousands you'll find in this ''film''. I was not laughing at all, and I looked around, and every single teenager that looked main stream was laughing so hard they seemed to be dying...ridiculous...Am I the only teenager with Funky A that has a bit of IQ? Send me an IMDb private message if you're another of those persons that think they're alone with this opinion, you can be sure I'll like you! From a serious point of view, it's this year's worst, this one is the winner all the way, no contest, 110% sure. A-W-F-U-L! I'm being generous here, 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give this movie credit for having the balls (pun very much intended!!) to do the things that they did w/ this movie and still pull out w/ an R rating! I admit that I really dislike the new wave of conservatism that is popping up in teen flicks today.Yet, this is definitely one of the worst Wayans pictures I've seen, if they only went the extra mile for this movie, as it is all the crude humor is over-the-top and not executed as artistically well as the previous Wayans films. Yup, it's easily the worst Wayans film in existence! It still get's a 7 from me, point of argument though!! Why is it that people have to have a stiff upper lip about these kind of flicks! Whats wrong with this movie doesn't necessarily get pointed out as much as the fact that it's crude!! All Wayans flicks are crude(even though their previous films are a lot better written and edited!!!!) you would have to expect that they're gonna try to push it!!! Oh well, we live in a pampered society and it shows...but check out "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka!" or even "Don't Be A Menace While Drinking Your Juice N' Tha Hood" (sp? it's a long title!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is absolutely one of the worst parodies, if not one of the worst movies, ever made. It isn't hard to make a succesful parody, it's a two step process: 1. Take elements/scenes/dialogue from the movie you intend to parody. 2. Change the element/scene/dialogue so it: a) Pokes fun at the movie you are parodying, or b) Pokes fun at something else that is subject to humor.Keenan Ivory Wayans, however, doesn't understand this. He makes a parody using this process:1. Take a random line from Scream/Scream 2/Scream 3 and copy it word for word. 2. Throw in a shot of/joke about a penis.This does not make good parody. He is avoiding actually making fun of Scream, and is simply just mixing dialogue from Scream and then making jokes about totally unrelated things. He needs to focus more on wit than gross out humor. Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing wrong with gross humor; I found There's Something About Mary and BASEketball very funny and enjoyable movies. I also don't have a problem with stupid-funny flicks ( I consider Tommy Boy and Happy Gilmore classics). The problem with Scary Movie is that instead of gross-funny, it's just gross, and instead of stupid-funny, it's just plain stupid. On a last note, I found the parody of The Usual Suspects VERY unneccisary (spelling). Usual Suspects is a classic, and not one that is intended to be parodied. It wasn't even a good parody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The word that came out of my mouth was "Oh My GoD!!" This movie is the funniest movie ever. Especially in this movie, there's a combination of previous popular scary movies like "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Blair Witch Porject" etc. Also included the famous line from "The Sixth Sense".. "I see dead people...".. Also especially when the killer is kind of a "Dumb Killer" and the 'dumb' Doofy, which makes this movie soooo funny! Of course, there are some 'sexual scene/act' in this movie which is something that kids underage aren't suppose to watch. I couldn't stop laughing when watching the movie, i can't even stop laughing thinking about this movie. It's a must watch movie if you like 'funny + scary + parody' movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to the cinema I expected a nice film, not a good one. But each genre has a point from you have to see it, it could be a good one in his genre. I give it 3 points since it has some very good gags where I was laughing for a long time, but the rest is... The only thing that I can say is that I don't like it. But really, if you want to have a good time go to watch it, don't expect that you'll watch the best genre movie of all the times. You can past the evening with your friends (typical "dressing room" friends) and then laugh everybody together eating some chips or drinking soda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend at work recommended this movie highly. He said that it was a great parody of horror movies... "when you get finished with one parody, another one is coming along". As a fan of horror movies and parodies, I paid my dollar.What a waste! The film basically parodied one movie: "I Know What You Did Last Summer". There was also a single reference to "Sixth Sense".This movie is a compendium of adolescent sex humor similar to the "Porky's" movies. Not to mention all sorts of nasty slams at gays and retarded people.I laughed maybe two or three times, that's all. And I very nearly walked out around twenty minutes into the movie. I should have because it only got dumber and more offensive as the time dragged on.And now they're gonna make a sequel. I'll bet it makes a bunch of money because there will always be teens out there who will pay for this sort of shlock.I rated it one star, but only because imdb.com won't allow me to go lower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My take on "Scary Movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!Let me begin by saying that the trailers pretty much exhibit all the funny scenes in the movie (which by the way the movie did not make me laugh, not even crack a smile, which is hard for a 17 year old) and everything else clean.When I went to see this movie (expecting to see something with humor), I came in with a good attitude. This is not trying to be the next "Gone With the Wind", I told myself. But after seeing the most raunchy and horrible film since "Showgirls", I realized they were trying to be stupid-funny. Let me tell you, it didn't work. It just ending up being stupid, which isn't THAT bad, I would except that for a parody, but it was horrible, as I mentioned above, which is why I hated this film. The humor makes it worse. It tries so hard to make you laugh with its disgusting shock scenes. I was P.O.'d towards the end. And having a discussion about the film the next day, someone said the movie was "controversial film of the year". "American Psycho" is the year's controversial film, this is the worst film of the year.The jokes about private parts, flatulence, homosexuality, and retardation get old. When the joke is over, it's over, but the writers instead want to repeat the same lame joke over and over. I was wowed when I heard the audience screaming with laughter. What exactly is so funny? A penis getting shoved into an ear? A girl getting shot with semen? Let me tell you, if you are mature, you'll have a hard time watching this. The movie aims for high schoolers, yet with an R rating which *should* be NC-17.Rating: 1 out of 4</fullReview>

It was a Naked Gun style horror movie, the kind of movie where they just throw in parodies of everything they can think of, or just throw in anything they can into some scenes. Still I think most people looking for a good waste of time comedy will enjoy this movie even if they do say it was stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With as many hits as misses, SCARY MOVIE is an obvious acquired taste. Fortunately for the film, I had an open mind going into it, excepting it for what it was right off the bat: an at times clever, but utterly tasteless shock comedy. The Farrely Brothers are probably pretty upset right now for throwing out all those extra penis, semen and pubic hair gags because they were in bad taste, so this one could snatch them all up and cash in on a now totally desensitized society. The gags that work are pretty funny and this film definately delivers to its target audience, while offending a few (if not a lot) stragglers aside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea is good one (a horror movie spoof). But the Wayans brothers don't know what to do with this good idea. Instead, they serve up disgusting (sometimes obscene) gags that should only be funny to a nine year old, but at the same time should never be seen by a nine year old. While watching the movie I was acutely aware of young teenagers in the audience--so much for the R rating. I was embarrassed and worried that they were present. This movie is guilty of what Socrates was innocent of: corrupting the youth. Because of its raunchiness, only adults should see this movie, but it's not fit for adults to watch because it's merely raunchy and devoid of humor, intelligence or wit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is good cheese and bad cheese, this film was very bad cheese. Let me preface this by saying that I am a big fan of parody and satire. I loved the Naked Gun series, Army of Darkness is on my list, and the Airplanes (more the first than the second) were great. This movie is not great. There is a way to do over-the-top scenes, check out The Mask with Carrey for an idea. This movie goes over the top and beyond, poorly. When a joke is dead, don't repeat it over and over. It's not funny and it's not entertaining. Mind you, there are certainly some funny parts of the film. I laughed out loud several times. Trying not to give anything away (spoiler alert?)(but why would I want to?): the beauty pageant scene, the on-the-lam father, the matrix rip-off, just to name a few. Sadly, this movie on the whole falls flat. One joke, or a few, did not make Aliens funny, and the pity is that many jokes didn't make this comedy funny. The execution is poor, the acting stale and stilted. There were many parts of the film that were simply disgusting without being funny (again, for technically disgusting AND funny, try the scene from The Mask where the dog puts the mask on). There were too many places where I just couldn't swallow the ludicrous scene they had just shown me (beauty queen's death, electric undies). Add to all this a main character who is unlikable, whiny, and unrelatable, and you've got a big miss in my book. Not only unfunny as a whole, but unentertaining. If you want to see a good parody, see Galaxy Quest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes you laugh all the way through but only in these 2 conditions: 1. Be open minded to the kind of humor, if you thought South Park was rude the you might not want to check this out; 2. If you are familiar with the Scream trilogy, I know What You Did Last Summer and sequel, The Matrix and The Sixth Sense. When I saw the trailer I wasn't too enthusiastic about the movie: I mean, I laughed but it sounded too much like that other parody, BASEketball, which quite frankly was total crap, not funny at all. So, keeping in mind that I'm a huge fan of the Scream trilogy and that I had seen the other movies this one parodied, I went to the nearest movie theater to see it. And my conclusion is: 4/10, due to the fact that I knew by heart the movies it parodied, and so it made a lot funnier to watch, but on the down-side I rate it like so because of the way it was written, too incoherent, and that weird guy who I hate. Oh, and also due the fact that some of the jokes were too much in your face and weren't as funny as they should. And finally, I should set clear here that I don't like the Wayans Bros. kind of humor it's too much like "An Alan Smithee Movie: Burn Hollywood Burn", but even dumber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A HELL of a funny movie... What can I do???????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCARY MOVIE (2000) ***WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADI agree with Roger Ebert's review that the spoof-genre is a hard one to comment about. You don't know what to say... Film editing? Cinematography? Directing? Acting? Come on!!!!!! What matters is if the film is funny or not and if it really makes a satire or just put one stupid scene after another. By this point, SCARY MOVIE is one of the best satires I've seen in years, ranking up there with AIRPLANE! and NAKED GUN- and staying far from crap like SPY HARD and MAFIA!.I have a strange taste for humor. I'm not a big fan of slapstick humor. I like something that is not forced, that makes you laugh naturally. For you to have an idea, I found BEING JOHN MALKOVICH to be an extremely hilarious film. Even some critics who loved it said that the laughs were not hysterical, but I couldn't stop myself in the scene where Malkovich enters his own mind and finds himself into a restaurant with lots of "Malkoviches", from the waiter to the singer, all they speak is "Malkovich", everything that is written on the menu is "Malkovich"... There were also some things involving a monkey and Cameron Diaz wanting to change her sex... It was a hell of a funny film, my #3 of 1999. However, I hated AMERICAN PIE. It was not funny, because the situations were recycled from PORKY'S, THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN and other crappy comedies from the '80s- it was also forced. I loved the nasty humor of SOUTH PARK- BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT, but I was used with the TV series. But I was not very confident about SCARY MOVIE. Maybe the trailer showed everything, maybe the humor was recycled and forced. Thankfully, my expectations were not confirmed when I saw the movie: I couldn't stop laughing a minute. Every time they showed something dirtier than what they had showed in the scene before. But anyway it was a hell of a fun!I can't describe every scene I liked because my comment would be enormous. But, for example, the opening scene, making satire of the one in SCREAM with Drew Barrymore, here with Carmen Electra, was a great beginning- especially when he stabbed one of her tits and took the... you know! There was also the thing of the gym teacher, lots of dick, gay/lesbian jokes, but my favorite is maybe the one similar to that in SCREAM 2, in a movie theater when Jada Pinkett is killed. Here the girl is watching SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, but acts like she were in a hood theater. She comments every detail loudly, answers the cell phone and the audience can't handle her any longer. So some of them start to stab her, and while she is walking to the screen, lots of people come and stab her, probably because she did the same thing other times, in other movies: THELMA AND LOUISE, THE FUGITIVE, a Jackie Chan movie, BOOGIE NIGHTS, BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE... It's a very funny scene! So thankfully the best parts weren't showed in the trailer.It's difficult to find out all the references and spoofs to other movies. The "movie connections" page shows lots of movies, even some that have nothing related to horror: FIGHT CLUB, AMERICAN BEAUTY, ELECTION, TEACHING MRS. TINGLE. One of the best references is to THE USUAL SUSPECTS, in the end. It is a real twist that concludes this movie very well. Of course there were stupid connections (as the special appearance by James Van Der Beek- pointless!), but overall they were very good (THE BLAIR WITH PROJECT is a disgusting example).So do I recommend SCARY MOVIE? (God help me!) Yes! But only a warning: THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!!!!! If you are an old-fashioned person, has a weak stomach, is an intellectual, is easily offended or can't see or hear stupidity, STAY AWAY!!!!!! But if you don't care about that and have bad taste, don't let this pass by. It is offensive, nasty, disgusting, heavy, over-the-top, silly, stupid, idiotic, brainless... but a HELL of a funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is dumb. So dumb it washes away the admittedly sometimes-funny parodies in it. So mindnumbingly dumb it makes you wish you were watching a just-plain-dumb movie. This movie makes films like "Dumb and Dumber" seem positively effervescent. And it is so cosmically witless, you just KNOW it will make millions, and a sequel will be forthcoming shortly.We walked out of this film. We had to. One dumb-joke too many. The Wayans confuse dumb with funny, but on the other hand so do many moviegoers it seems. If you like 4th-grade humor (such memorable characters as "Doofy, the Retarded Guy," who has relations with a vacuum cleaner -- no kidding), you'll probably be able to endure it.If you want a scary movie satire, just rent "Scream." Or any Vincent Price film for that matter. (I personally recommend "Theatre of Blood".) Even "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" is more clever than this vacuous tripe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not such a really big turkey, but not really a good movie either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-spoilersSure, SCARY MOVIE is a stupid movie, But I never really expect a spoof-movie to be 'smart', even though this one is one step over everyone else, and it's really, really cheap.SCARY MOVIE has almost no jokes that aren't about sex, drugs, big dick, small dick, big tits, small tits, gays, farts. So if you're fourteen years old and can't think of nothing else... what are you waiting for? You'll get the blast of your life! I laughed 'for real' maybe two times and it's not really enough for a good comedy, and most of the good jokes were in the trailer. I mean, it's cheap! Instead of actually being funny this part of the Wayans-brothers takes some "tasty jokes" that aren't even funny. Some people here say it's really hilarious... What is so hilarious? A woman is very unshaved and the guy has to bring out the "big scissor". Or maybe the Blair Witch spoof. What is so funny about the Blair Witch spoof? It's exactly the same scene as in that movie. Eh? Afterwards, I can't really believe I actually waited for this movie. It's sad, because this movie could have been much better. It's not really a big idea making a spoof of SCREAM, since it's a parody too, but why not? Anyway, I didn't think much of it, luckily I didn't go to the movies to see it. I wouldn't pay that amount of money to watch this movie. However it's not such a bomb, but it wasn't good either. It was simply too cheap. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What else could we of done with this money???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started off with an open mind and had a few giggles at the start of the film. The mickey take out of Scream was funny, at first, until I realised that the film was just a repeat of Scream but with just a few very weak references to other films.This is a great idea if done right, but in my opinion this was far from being done right. It was very flat and unimaginative considering that this idea has been about for a while now. Surely it is about time we had a parody of the parodies!?In summary: Nothing new, few funny bits and a very quiet cinema. Pity as the adverts looked great! I think I will give the sequel a miss somehow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping that this movie would be just outrageously funny, but fearful that it would be mostly flat, with a few good jokes, and that's it. Well, without discussing the jokes, there were only a couple of them that really got me good. Far too few to justify even a suggestion that you watch it. I enjoyed my time at the theater when I went to go see the movie, but the people I was sitting around were cracking better comments than the movie itself, and without them, I know I would have been bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insult To Viewers: Thank God the Wayan Bros. was Cancelled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie could have been fun. It COULD have been side-splitting hilarity. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by adolescents with hormone-induced stupidity and immaturity.Scary Movie is filled to the brim with jokes that fall flat: there are unnecessary flatulence jokes, body fluid/sex jokes to the extreme, genitalia that does not look fake at all, and some scenes that are directly lifted from other horror movies in order to be parodied, but instead drag on and on forever to a laughless death. The ONLY scene that is a brilliantly inspired parody is NOT from a horror movie, and you have to wait until the VERY end to see it. An R-rating? It's ludicrous that serious, quality films like Tom Soldonz' Happiness and others are condemned by the MPAA to have scenes cut or be released unrated for having controversial topics/scenes. This piece of drek drags out some of the most offensive, thoroughly squirm-inducing and tasteless acts, language, and images ever imagined, yet gets an R-rating just fine.And as for the Wayans, their creativity seems to have dwindled ever since In Living Color ended. Their show was a funny, brilliant, daring satire at times. This movie, however, is a testament to how dumbed-down, empty, and money-hungry some entertainers become for a paycheck.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. And yes, I have seen almost all of the movies they tried to parody (with the exception of The Matrix). And yes, I knew going in that it was supposed to be a parody. This was a case of the Wayans Brothers trying to be like the Farrelly Brothers, and they missed by heaps. They were not clever in any sense of the word. I have heard this movie compared to the Airplane movies, the Naked Gun movies and Mel Brooks movies. This movie was not even in the same league as any of these classic comedies. To point out how horrible this movie was....the teens sitting in front of me, like me, didn't even crack a smile, let alone laugh. What a shame that something as terrible as this was even made, while there are probably a ton of brilliant scripts out there that we'll never know about.</fullReview>

Well the first scene of the movie was so great I never stopped laughing for the whole first 15 minutes of it. I even had to stand up in the theatre to catch my breath because I was getting a side ache from laughing way too much. If you are going to watch it make sure that you watch all the movies that it is making fun about (all the teen horror movies like scream) because thats what makes the movie so scary.

Another scene I saw in the trailer and thought was pretty funny was when the sherif shows the fake-Neve Campbell "some photo's, tell me what you think". In the trailer, a good short laugh, in the movie it just goes on and on and on and on....In short, just watch the trailer on the internet and realize that 90 minutes of this nonsense is a bit too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has never been a good "Airplane!"-style movie about horror movies. There have been attempts, like "Pandemonium" with Paul Reubens and "National Lampoon's Class Reunion", but none of them have been very funny. "Scary Movie" is pretty funny and it's based on the movie "Scream", but it isn't really a parody of that trend-setting hit or of horror movies in general. It seems like the writers had a bunch of gags about drugs, pubic hair, penises, boobs, testicles, oral sex, and other such things, but no plot, and Miramax said, "here, use one of the plots of our other hit movies, and stick all your jokes on it!" The gross-out sex and drug jokes that make up the bulk of "Scary Movie" could have been transferred easily to a parody of, say, "Good Will Hunting" (that's not a bad idea- they could give the Robin Williams character the big afro of pubic hair).None of the big laughs in "Scary Movie" are derived from mocking the conventions of horror movies, except for a scene inspired by "Halloween", where the killer is shown running behind a tree to hide when a victim spots him out the window. In "Scream" the characters have a party where they watch old slasher movies. This movie could have used that scene to show a bunch of short satires of other horror movies, like "Nightmare on Elm St.", "Friday the 13th", or "Child's Play". Heck, Miramax owns the rights to the "Hellraiser" and "Halloween" franchises, so Pinhead and Michael Myers could have made cameos. It seems they were too afraid to leave the plot points of "Scream", "Scream 2", and "I Know What I Did Last Summer" for too long, less the brain dead teen audience get lost due to a reference to a movie less than five years old. There are effortless take-offs on "The Matrix" (just like in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"), "The Usual Suspects" (just like in "Wrongfully Accused"), and "The Blair Witch Project" (just like in- well, pretty much everything, these days)."Scary Movie" isn't totally crappy. I thought a lot of the jokes were funny and was amazed at the amount of sordid sight gags that got by the MPAA (more proof of how arbitrary and irrelevant they are today). I thought Shawn and Marlon Wayans were good, as were the actors in the Neve Campbell and David Arquette roles. The low points of the cast are, predictably, Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth. Elizabeth is undeniably awful, yet her character has not one but two scenes that require expert acting: When she sees her boyfriend getting murdered but people think she's just acting; and later when she is acting like she's scared of the killer but isn't. A good actress could have made these sequences work, but Elizabeth isn't up to the task. That's what you get when you cast someone solely on the basis of a topless scene in "American Pie".Since the success of "Scream" inspired plenty of imitators, hopefully the success of "Scary Movie" will inspire some knock-offs, and one will take full advantage of the plethora of slasher movie cliches available to mock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the first 10 minutes we lost 50% of the audience ? but considering there were only 4 people in the theater that's not saying much.This spoof of horror flicks was the longest 88 minutes of my life ? too bad I'll never get them back.The dialogue was bad in a way I have seen before: at times it could have been funny but something in the way it was delivered made it embarrassingly bad..Some of the sight gags were funny: `B. A. Corpse High School,' the stuffed toy monkey with the banana; but they were not laugh-out-loud and too few and far between to actually have any kind of impact. You cannot build a film on flimsy sight gags.The only part of the movie that I actually liked was when the woman in the movie theater wouldn't stop talking, was taking calls on her cell phone and the theater audience (including Mother Theresa and the Pope) brutally attacked her. I've been there myself a few times.A special thank you to Steve and Lori who said I should avoid this movie at all costs ? I wish I had listened to them.The tag line for this film is `No mercy. No shame. No sequel.' I wish the producers had kept their word ? Scary Movie II is already in the works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scary movie" is a parody on a number of movies, especially "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer".The best scene of the whole movie is in fact when they had "sex", because it doesn't parodizes anything and therefore you really have no clue what comes next; plus it is very well done.The rest of the movie is, well, not that exiting, but not too bad either. I didn't liked it when they parodized the "Matrix" because it fails completely. In most scenes, I was happy that they where so short because one already knows what is going on in this scene, and only the modifications where important.Well, thats it. In the sum, I liked it. This is a nice entertainment movie, don't watch it if you want to see something worth to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this and I laughed, a lot, and that was what I wanted from "Scary Movie". I didn't go in looking for great cinema, or for sophistication, or for anything resembling maturity. Just because I like the Coen brothers doesn't mean I can't laugh like a drain at this too. It was stupid, it was funny, and I'm not going to say too much about it because I don't want to think about it too much. If you like stupid spoof movies, you'll probably like it; if not, you won't. I like them, and I think it's great to see a new generation of spoofists (?) emerging, giving us an alternative to the faintly tired but (I reckon) still pretty funny Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker movies. Especially as they're black, and as such they can both bring a fresh new perspective and make some points about ethnic diversity (or lack of it) in Hollywood. More power to the Wayans: "Don't Be A Menace To..." was criminally ignored and I'm glad this didn't receive the same DTV fate.But I'm rambling on. See "Scary Movie" if you like spoofs, and don't join the cynics in saying "it's a spoof of a spoof, that's stupid" because "Scream" was never a spoof. It was clever and it was funny, but it never really ridiculed those silly horror movies enough; essentially it celebrated and aped them, and it eventually fell victim to its own clichés. "Scary Movie" is up with the ZAZ films and later-period Mel Brooks spoofs, if not quite in the "Producers"/"Blazing Saddles" league.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie is great...even without Sidney's Mother...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a classic comedy film taking elements from the Naked Gun all the way to Saved By The Bell as it takes every conceivable situation that has been done to death ( literally ) by the teen horror movies that were born again with Scream.The movie has been cleverly worked around the scripts, situations and even characters of past scary movies to create a film that's fun for everyone...who's seen every horror movie after Scream up until now, that is.From Carmen Electra farting all the way to Cindy's drug dealing father, every element of flawed horror movie situations has been jumped on, from Puss Puss in the garage to knock things over, to the killer walking around in the background whilst the leads ponder where he or she is, Scary Movie is the ultimate way to kindly say to the horror genre, Ne Pas De Sequel.The elements of comedy in Scary Movie range from the crass to the intelligent, as not many people would appreciate the ending with Doofy unless they watched The Usual Suspects, a joke lost on stupid 14 year olds in the row in front of this reviewer, or even the inclusion of Bobby's finale would be lost on an audience who don't know what it's like to be...erm..sexually anorexic (as Tatum from Scream calls it).Though for the people with no prior movie knowledge the numerous fart jokes, Cindy getting kicked by Ray, gratuitous genitalia and everyone's favourite teacher Miss Mann should provide a good chuckle.Scary Movie is a very funny movie but only for those with the knowledge to back it up, mind frame to appreciate clever and thought out humour, and the patience to wait until after the credits to see Doofy and the Vaccuum Cleaner re-kindling their relationship.So, go see it, hire it on video, whatever, and to laugh even harder, hire the Scream Trilogy, The Usual Suspects, I Know What You Did Last Summer and even the good 'ole Blair Witch Project and enjoy one of the funniest films this "teen slasher generation " can appreciate, Scary Movie.</fullReview>

So to hear everyone around me talking about the film and to have all the critics actually praising it is really refreshing.I am a big fan of spoof films anyway, so i'm never likely to give an objective opinion of this. But hell, it is funny. although you will have to be up to date on the most famous films of the last three years.One thing they get away with is spoofing the Usual Suspects even though it was done in '98 by Wrongfully Accused (and better) but not many people would've seen that in the UK so they are safe in that respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS.Of course, that's something the Wayans brothers have already done in their hilarious spoof of ghetto movies, "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood".Here they push the bad taste envelope further, with mockery of the mentally retarded and violence against women. Whereas such things may be forgivable if done right, Scary Movie's biggest crime is that it simply isn't very funny.There are some amusing moments, of course. A Blair Witch mickey-take got the biggest laugh from the audience, and a brief Sixth Sense parody is nice. Perhaps my favourite bit is the masked killer's inept attempts to hide ("I can see your feet sticking out from behind the sofa") but how funny can seeing people stabbed to death be?Similarly, the on-screen use of marijuana (something now fashionable in cinema since American Beauty) produces some comic moments, but the image of the stoned killer, his mask distorted into a bemused smile, is not the sort of humour that travels across the Atlantic.It's impossible to say why the movie isn't that good, and certainly after Don't... (written by half as many people, yet at least twice as funny) I was desperately looking forward to this. Maybe it's the underuse of Marlon Wayans, or the film's major flaw: you can't spoof a spoof. Breaking the fourth wall and adding a succession of in-jokes doesn't work when 90% of the film is based on the already self-referential Scream. And the fact that it's plot structure is exactly identical to that of Scream means that this is a movie who's joke is four years too late.The best jokes are the ones that don't refer to Wes Craven's film, and consequently show more imagination. There's some satire of cinema etiquette in a theatre, some nice mock trailers, and some literal toilet humour, with a sideways look at condom machines and urinal culture. This element also raises an important issue about the nature of censorship, if not intentionally: Shawn Wayans finds himself stabbed to death by a penis in one of the more bizarre moments. The fact that this plastic prosthetic is incredibly realistic makes a mockery of the censorship board: erections are not allowed to be shown in cinema, but incredibly realistic fakes ? that by all accounts could be the genuine article - are. Weird.There are some moments of genuine social satire, when the movie gets to show its teeth. Particularly notable are the people who dial 911 and recieve a quicker service by registering that they're white. Or the police station where officers stand around a Rodney King beat 'em up arcade game. Generally, though, the humour is soft and lacking in focus. Ultimately, I laughed heartily for fifteen minutes at Scary Movie. The film is 89 minutes long. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a sad fact that Scary Movie will go down in history as having one of the biggest grossing opening weekends in movie history and not just pale into the insignificance that it deserves.I usually enjoy movies like this and was looking forward to seeing it but was hugely disappointed. Films such as the Naked Gun films and Mike Myers films that tip their hats at other, more successful films have always, and always will be made but (hopefully) never as bad as this again, although a sequel has been announced.Those of you who have seen Scream 2 will have seen the clips for Stab - a film of the events of Scream. These clips are far more ammusing than the childish humour on show in Scary Movie. Maybe Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson should strike back and make a parody of the parody of the parody of the horror movie, I'm sure the film studios would buy it, they were fooled into paying for the trash that is Scary Movie. It plays the Scream script word for word, shot for shot. Weren't they bright enough to think for themselves? For once all the armchair critics out there are right, they themselves could do better.This was the worst film I have ever seen at the cinema. The only film I really wanted to walk out from, but I stayed, hoping it would improve, I was wrong. There are a couple of funny moments but most of the 'jokes' are so un-funny that I spent most of my time with my head in my hands, cringing, not daring to see want awful moment this turkey would fling up next.Do your self a favour and see Snatch, or any other film instead.2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie had me laughing out loud in parts and scratching my head wondering when the punchline was coming in others. I'm really surprised that this movie has made as much money as it has, the 'parody' genre is nothing new and has been done a lot better in the past. Scary Movie does have one thing going for it though, it is a hell of a lot better than 90% of the movies it is poking fun at!.I'd give this film half marks as there is some genuinely funny moments and it does have enough guts to admit that 90's horror movies are embarrassingly bad!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was funnier than I thought it would be. Even though I haven't seen some of the movies that it made fun of, it didn't matter. It was still hilarious.Lately everyone has been going on about the black talent this summer, I don't think that this can be defined as a 'black' film. In fact I find it utterly ridiculous that movie genres have sunk down to race. Scary Movie is a comedy that can make anyone laugh, of any race, religion, or culture. You don't have to see too many movies before seeing this film. I would only advise you seeing Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. It's enough to see the famous nostril Blair Witch scene for the brief Blair Witch parody and getting the concept of the Matrix supernatural special effects for that brief parody.Seeing Scream 2 is not as essential but I would definitely recommend seeing it too... my favorite scene is the parody of the Movie Theatre scene (Also the first scene) from Scream 2. Regina Hall (playing Brenda, a Brandy parody, but a Jada Pinket parody for this scene) gave such a hilarious performance, I couldn't stop laughing!In fact all the acting in this movie is quite superb. Cheri Oteri did a wonderful Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox in Scream) parody. Also Jon Abrahams and Anna Faris (playing Bobby- a Billy from Scream parody, and Cindy Campbell the Sidney from Scream parody) were great. And of course the Wayans brothers were FUNNY.But note that this a parody and not a serius film. The racial, sexual and crude jokes play an important part on making this film funny. Not for the Politically Correct...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarey Movie review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the Scream films were Wes Craven &amp; Co. quietly subverting the horror genre by giving us the blood and death, but whispering irony to us, then Scary Movie is some idiot with his trousers down shouting all the rude words he can think of.This film obviously had good intentions, but lifting whole scenes from other films and changing a few words is merely lazy, not funny.After a promising start, the film soon runs out of ideas - and the ones it uses will promote a sense of deja vu. Remember those hilarious 'camera jokes' Mel Brooks used to use? Well, they're here, just not done as well.The character of Doofy - the equivalent of David Arquette's scene-stealing Dewey - is a spectacular failure and, if it weren't for the films lousy ending, could be edited out altogether. Something that could be said of much of this film.As for 'feeling sick' at this so-called gross-out comedy, it didn't even manage that. Only the Mr. Creosote scene from Monty Python's Meaning of Life manages that.It's easy to see why this film was so popular in America - it's big, loud and dumb, the opposite of Scream in fact.</fullReview>

Scary Movie sends up all the latest breed of horror movies and other recent blockbusters brilliantly.The story centers around a group of college kids doing what normal kids do like partying,etc. A killer is going round wiping them out one by one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if your in a silly, stupid, 15 year old state of mind then 'Scary movie' is for you. Unfortunately this return to spoof by the Wayans brothers cannot compete with films like 'Naked Gun' or 'Airplane'. It just doesn't sustain the laughs, there are long gaps where they give you time to think and when you do that this spoof is finnished! It's extremely crude and makes 'Something About Mary' look like a g-rated film. Overall the film did have some laughs but they came few and far apart and there were bits where you were wincing with disgust. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crying and Laughter, Two words I would associate with Scary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a very funny film that re-lights the spoof genre. Many recent spoofs have been a bit of a flop as the jokes seem redundant and very over used. However this film takes the Farrelly Brothers approach with using many crude jokes that include gallons of the Hair Gel in There's Something about Mary. The film mirrors the storyline of scream with similar dialogue but this is part of the joke. I think the target audience for this film is between 16-25. I would definitely advise anyone younger than 16 not to watch this, as it might be a little to crude. I think to increase the viewing pleasure of this film I would recommend seeing several films first which are Scream 1+2, IKWYDLS and the Usual suspects. The others will not make that much difference to understanding the gags because they are funny anyway.This film features several young talented actors who are willing to make fools out of themselves for the films sake. The direction on the film is good but nothing spectacular, You just want it to be straightforward. My favourite Characters in this one has got to be Shorty and Doofy.I was crying all the way through out this one, as it was so funny. I had to watch it 3 times so far and every time I have noticed a new joke as I have been laughing so loud in the previous showings.(Slight Spoiler) The ending of the film is the funniest bit but you would have to see a certain film to understand it other wise it is wasted.I would truly recommend this film as it is the funniest this year so far 9/10.</fullReview>

This is a movie that looked great in the ads made for t.v. and in the trailers shown with other features but the end result is an amateur film that moves about as fast as a speeding car out of control, throwing off any good timing that was possible and making it seem like one big drawn out skit from any lame comedy/variety show over the last decade.

		<fullReview>Damn this movie was funny! I had been watching out for this movie since before it came out in America so I went and saw it a few days after it came out in Australia. Let me just say that this is a total gross-out comedy! But a comedy indeed! The whole theatre audience was in stitches for the most part of the movie and there were even some bursts of applause! Certainly, if you don't appreciate that kind of humour, don't see the movie. But if you can stand movies where most of the jokes are sex-based, i strongly urge you to see Scary Movie! I counted at least 15 movies that there were take-offs from and mentions from TV shows like Dawson's Creek, The Brady Bunch and a subtle Buffy mention. It was hilarious! Totally awesome!

		<shortDescription>how about "Crappy Movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a joke in a film gets old after only ten minutes of the film (Marlon Wayans's "is he gay" jokes), it's an indicator for what's to come. While there were some laugh out loud funny parts of this movie, it was overall a really irritating moviegoing experience. These aforementioned funny parts were connected to an otherwise unwatchable piece of crap. The writing was juvenile at best, and sub-ape-man-stupid at its worst. The Wayans brothers should probably stick to the WB network, where fans of "Buffy" and "Charmed" will find them to be the Marx brothers of the 90s, while the rest of us lament the end of good comedy in our cinemas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has everybody missed the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at these reviews it seems the viewing public have forgotten that this is a spoof. It was never going to be a mind-stretcher like The Usual Suspects, so if you can tell who the killer is straight away that's probably part of the irony! Furthermore those who have warned others about taking their children to see the film have clearly lost sight of the fact that R-rated movies are rated so because they are likely to confuse or repulse young children, or go straight over their heads. So they shouldn't be watching the film anyway - the very fact that it's called Scary Movie and that Laverne &amp; Shirley from 1976 is referenced should indicate this! There aren't as many phallic images as made out either. There's one full-on one in a photograph, the rest are all disguised.***POSSIBLE SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH***I think most of the negative press stems from lack of understanding of the film references, of which there are a lot. I had seen just about all of the movies parodied, but there were some blank faces around me - for example, if you haven't seen The Usual Suspects, the ending will seem fairly standard and won't have the extra irony it presents for those who have. On which theme, being from the UK I seem to have missed the Budweiser 'Wassup?' parody that people have found funny - perhaps someone could e-mail me to clear it up? Cheers :)All in all I found Scary Movie hilarious and recommend it despite the occasional disgusting moment. My only criticism is that, at times, it seems like a re-run of Scream with the occasional improved line thrown in from another film, and one or two of the jokes are embarrassingly unfunny e.g. the Spice Girls reference. That said I'd give it 8/10, well worth seeing!</fullReview>

This was the crudest, funniest movie I have ever seen. It is impossible to describe any part of this movie without coming off as completely vulgar. If you cannot stand bathroom humor, then this is not the movie for you. Everyone else check it out. And it takes more than one viewing to catch everything.

		<fullReview>One comment should say it all: you'll either love this movie or hate it. I heard someone say that at the premiere, the Wayan's parents walked out, and I can understand why -- this is by far one of the raunchiest films I've ever seen. There is a ton of very lewd humor, and the subject matter is probably only really funny to those who have both seen and appreciated the movies it spoofs. The sight gags and pratt-falls can get old pretty quickly if you're not willing to roll with them.That said, if you are able to suspend your level of maturity at about age fifteen or sixteen, this is quite a funny film. It spoofs (or downright copies) Scream 1,2 and 3, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, The Blair Witch Project, a nod to The Shining, and the now infamous "Wassap!" beer commercial, all done in a style which would have made the Zucker brothers proud (Airplane, Kentucky Fried Movie, Police Squad).If you liked the above movies, you'll probably find something to laugh at in this one. If not, or if you insist on some thread of consistency or deeper philosophical meaning in your entertainment, go rent "Citizen Kane."</fullReview>

This one ripsoff SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, URBAN LEDGEND, FRIDAY THE 13th, THE SIXTH SENSE and HALLOWEEN just with comedy mixed with it. Our theater refused to play it because it was so stupid. (Or it did'nt reach) I think the producers of those films above should have sued the Wayne brothers for making a boring movie/rip off. People say this is a spoof it isn't. The movie is complete with every thing. The scream costume, the famous Drew Barrymore kill and phone voice and the LAST SUMMER murders. I think this movie should have been pulled. Avoid this it's just like watching SCREAM all over again. Very dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SCARY MOVIE is a tough movie to give a comment on. I found it both funny and disappointing. I was in stitches at times while watching the film, but was left feeling empty inside after I left the theatre. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect cinematic art here, but I thought I'd at least have something to tell my friends about. All I could say about SCARY MOVIE was that I enjoyed it, but couldn't really describe why. Perhaps it is because I believe they put way too many sexual references into it. The parodies of SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and other movies were great and well thought out, but the sexual humor was unnecessary most of the time. It felt like no one could think of anything else to spoof, so they threw in all these sex jokes to fill the voids. They really dragged the fun down and made me think at times that "this is too stupid, even for a spoof". SCARY MOVIE is both entertaining and lackluster. I had fun, but also felt like I was wasting my time. I did laugh quite a bit, but I think I needed to force a chuckle a time or two. Perhaps I expected too much from this. I thought it would be as hilarious as I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA or DON'T BE A MENACE..., two Wayans Brothers films I think are much better. SCARY MOVIE was good and I would watch it again, but only when it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't make it a point to add spoilers (and honestly, I don't know if this really counts since this is not a plot outline), but I'm about to say in one line what "Scary Movie" is:*SPOILER*"Scary Movie" uses the exact same plot as "Scream", but adds a billion drug and sex (both gay and straight) jokes, with numerous people getting hit by a car when all else fails.*END SPOILER*This is one of those movies where everything good is shown in the trailer. And while the film people congratulate themselves on what a great trailer it is, they realize they've just given away all the good stuff.Granted, I did laugh about a dozen times or so at the movie, but it wasn't a "laugh until it hurts" kind of humor. The funniest moments were a brief quip by the "Black News Team", and "Principal Squiggy" making a jibe at "Scream"'s Henry (Fonzie) Winkler as the high school principal. The killer's confusion over meeting Shannon Elizabeth was one of the more clever moments, and both Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth made for great eye candy.My problem? Quoting SEVERAL scenes from "Scream" word for word does not make a good parody. It makes it a copy, and less than inspired as the original "Scream" was. Throw in a lame subplot from "I Know What You Did Last Summer" (which being one of the most ridiculously stupid movies I had ever seen, and didn't help my opinion), and the film just ultimately falls flat on its face, because it runs out of the really good laughs well before the credits roll. I saw it once, and that was enough. I laughed a few times, but it was mostly at the original stuff they did, when they weren't blatantly copying "Scream" scenes. I might rent it again, but I doubt it. I think this is going to be one of those movies that people will barely remember five years from now, other than a "Yeah, I saw that" kind of answer.It's made a decent amount of money so far, so if a sequel is in the works, please stick to the more original scenes, guys. Those were the funny parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me it was a so-so movie. Some of it funny, some of it not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rated R for strong crude sexual humor, language, drug use and violence. *Believe it*. While I like a good parody as much as the next person, most of this film was crude, rude, and tasteless. While the marketing of this film shows only, what, a few seconds of a couple of the funny moments, it seems to be aimed at kids - and my kids (ages 9 and 12) have been howling to see it. This is NOT a kids movie in any way, shape or form. I did find myself laughing at some of the more subtle things, however, they were few and far between. If you remember how funny "AIRPLANE!" was in treating the "AIRPORT" movies, or how funny Leslie Nielsen was in his parodies, you'll walk out of this film going "Huh?" and feeling somewhat cheated - The barrage of drug use, sex, and parodied violence is unending, and yes, the adult humor is there as well. It does manage to grope at your groin for a laugh. The bathroom-ear-tickling scene is something you will definitely *not* want your children to see, not in the theater and not on home video. Scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a genre that should be dead by now, the Wayans comedy team scores a solid hit with Scary Movie. And they definitely deserve it! The humor varies from clever and topical to just plain fall down funny belly laughs. To give any of it away here just would not be fair. Leave the kids at home, though, because there are a couple of scenes in which you would have a lot of explaining to do! This film keeps you on your toes and honestly never really gives you a chance to lose interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I laughed...A LOT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie", an "Airplane"-style sendup of the recent horror-movie boom, is not a great piece of great cinematic art. It's not slick, or glossy, or brilliantly directed. But it made me laugh, a lot, and loudly, and since that's all this picture, directed by "In Living Color"'s Keenen Ivory Wayans, is going for, I guess that means it works.The picture's plot is a hodgepodge of elements from "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", and countless other horror films from the last twenty years, as a dumb-ass fright-masked killer stalks a gang of epically dimwitted teenagers at B.A. Corpse High School. During this story (and I use the term as loosely as possible), the plot finds time to take out-of-nowhere swipes at "Dawson's Creek", "Amistad", "The Matrix", "The Usual Suspects", and probably about fifty other movies I'm leaving out. The screenplay (credited to six writers, including Shawn and Marlon Wayans) is one of those everything-but-the-kitchen- sink affairs, and to be sure, there's a fair share of groaners here. But this film, even with all that, still has more laugh-out-loud funny moments than any comedy I've seen this year.A lot of credit has to be given to the cast. It's really refreshing, after so many bad teen films with fashion-model types posturing and trying to look deep, to see a group of young actors throw themselves into this disgusting, ridiculous material with such unfettered gusto. They're unafraid to look stupid, to make their audience sick, to embarass themselves, and it takes the film to comic highs. Of course, there are a few standouts in this admittedly large group. Anna Faris, as the film's Neve / Jennifer Love good girl, has a winsome sexiness in addition to a deft touch with a joke. Carmen Electra effectively sends up her bimbo image in the picture's opening sequence, and Shawn Wayans steals the picture from everyone as the most ineffectively closeted homosexual in cinematic history (he also gets what I think you will agree is the most delightfully vulgar death scene ever).Keenen Ivory Wayans' direction is not polished or comically elegant, but enough of his jokes hit that you realize you're in the hands of someone who knows his yuks. And speaking of yuck, this being a contemporary comedy, many of the jokes skitter over the boundaries of taste into true gross-out territory. There are genital jokes, breast-implant jokes, oral-sex jokes, and a sex scene that gives new meaning to the term "It's a gusher!" Still, the yardstick for scenes like this, if this type of humor doesn't offend you, is simply whether or not you laugh. "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" left me cold. I laughed at "Scary Movie"'s scatology. And there you have it.What else is there to say, really? If you like horror movies and are in the mood to see them get a roasting, or if you just need a good gross laugh, you can't do much better right now than "Scary Movie". It breathes new life into the parody genre, and one hopes that the Wayans boys do just as well with their next satirical target. May I suggest a "Battlefield Earth" parody? Picture Marlon in those ugly floppy Travolta dreads, and try not to laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gross, but funny parody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is kind of a spoiler for all of you who don't want to know what happens. This is an extremely funny parody of the recent slew of teen slasher films, with bits thrown in from calssic slasher films and other films out of the genre altogether. The movie follows the plot of the original Scream very closely, while adding some scenes from I know what you Did Last Summer. Cheri Oteri is great as Gale Thunderstorm. The facial expressions on the killer's mask add to the humor. The killer's identity was no big surprise, driving away with Gale Thunderstorm at the end.There are also a few too many penis jokes in the movie, some of which a few people might vomit at. Also, the gay jokes go on way too long. The film stereotypes African Americans, which is odd considereing it was directed by an African- American. Well, if you can stand all those downsides, have a fun time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailer was better. REALLY NOT FOR KIDS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I have seen Scary Movie on its first week here in Israel, so all we saw about it was the trailer, which was hilarious. We thought that this movie will be a nonstop parody of various action/horror movies. Well, it was, but as remarked before, all good parts are already in the trailer.The thing we didn't prepare for was the sex scenes and jokes (What sex has to do with a horror film spoof???). I wish I had checked the IMDb on this movie before viewing it, as I don't think it's really my girlfriend's (or in fact, any girl's) type...In Israel, MPAA ratings and local age limitations are not enforced, so children aged 10 and less were in the theater. This movie is really not for them. This movie included photos of penises, and almost graphic oral sex scenes and talk, which can upset even strong porn-viewing audiences. Parents around the world - If you don't let your children watch porn films, don't let them watch this one.The film would have been much better with the porn scences cut out, and replaced with better jokes. Then it could have had a PG-13 rating, that is much more appropriate for this genre.My suggestion: Don't see it in the cinema. Wait and view it alone, or with the guys, on cable.</fullReview>

I'm really surprised this movie didn't get an X rating, although a porn flick might prove better than this trash. It was all sex, no plot and no laughs. Some of the subject matter was very offending and this is the first movie I have EVER seen that I walked out on. I think it's geared for 13 year olds who have a high old time laughing at fake genitals and disgusting scenarios (the bathroom scene in the movie theatre, the Blair Witch "I am so scared" spoof to name a few).

		<fullReview>Parody movies are a hard bunch. Let's face it, they usually suck. Typically soulless endeavors meant to make cash in a quick and timely fashion. Scary Movie isn't a champion of the genre, but it delivered enough toilet humor to satisfy me. I really had a better time than I ought to sitting in a theater watching this flick's antics. This much I'll tell you about Scary Movie. It's nearly mindless and there's very little subtlety. That you probably could have guessed. You'll know what movies they're about to parody even before the parody starts. Who actually laughed at the Matrix parody? Didn't they run that into the ground with the trailers and TV spots before you went to see the real thing? Pop culture references only get you so far. As such, I don't expect this film to date very well.Alas it's been the suffocating glut of horrible, teen-oriented horror flicks of late that makes a movie like this possible. Showing how stupid they've been and by extension, how stupid we are to have watched and/or paid for them. If by chance you haven't seen the wave of teenage oriented films like 'Scream' or 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' some of the jokes will no doubt be lost on you. To enjoy this film (like any parody) you need to know the films that the parody spoofs and it doesn't hurt if you dislike those movies too.My review would be incomplete if I didn't mention the guy playing Doofy. A hilarious parody of David Arquette's Deputy Dewey from the Scream series. The guy is an f'ing riot. He so's good that he borderline stole the show. He definitely got my full fledged attention whenever he appeared on screen.All said and done, the Wayans bros. score some points with Scary Movie. Their last effort "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood" got some laughs outta me and Scary Movie trumped that threefold. One way or another that's gotta be worth something.</fullReview>

What a tribute to David Cox! Get it more sexual innuendo for all you puritans.All you religious lunatics complained about the sexual scenes. Some homophobes complained that they needed female nudity. It was there, but guess you were more interested in watching the male portions. One person even stated that they had to keep telling their friend that "this was the worst movie ever". What is wrong with you people? If the movie was so against your values why did you stay? Quit trying to protect the children, you already do a poor enough job. Responsible parents don't take kids to an "R" rated movie.I really thought this movie was going to be lame, like most other spoof movies. It was a great treat to actually leave laughing.

		<fullReview>This was a very stupid, disapointing movie. It's makers don't seem to understand that in order for a parody to be funny, you have to do something more then just re-film it - in some cases (the "I see dead people" and the "wassup" commercial parody) it's almost line for line. There's nothing else in it - they just repeat it using different characters and you're supposed to laugh. This movie is like the annoying guy at work who thinks he's funny when he repeats the same movie/commercial catch phrase over and over. I think I laughed maybe 5 times in the movie - but each time, the joke went on for so long that it just became annoying. They had the same problem with the "gross out" humor - they'd show something disgusting but forget to make it funny.</fullReview>

Otherwise, this is a banal and tired teen jiggle porn movie that consists of sophomoric self-references and second rate smut. It's not even pornographic.

		<shortDescription>Airplane, it isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" wishes it could be like "Airplane" but it doesn't have the seasoned actors making fun of themselves nor the perfectly timed sight gags and punchlines. What it does have are enough positives - parodies of horror film scenes taken to its extreme, to make up for its negatives - preoccupation with oral sex, gay sex, and passing gas along with a collection of funny scenes which are poorly thought out ( a suicide fall that coincides with a character yelling 'what are you waiting for', a pissing contest patterned after pari-mutuel betting, a girlfriend who dons on a football uniform so she can act out like a male for her boyfriend). "Scary Movie" could even be labeled as racist (stereotyping blacks as rapsters and being illegitimate) if we did not know who wrote and directed the film. There must also be a misconnect in our minds between good and bad when we can laugh at a woman repeatedly punched and body-slammed on the ground or a sassy black female stabbed by people in a movie audience because she is disturbing them from seeing "Shakespeare in Love". But think back to a similar scene in "Airplane" in which a hysterical woman is told to 'snap out of it' by a succession of passengers bearing bats, whips, and saws. You also can't help thinking about Julie Haggerty when you see the Cindy character (Anna Faris), so mousy and prim, just waiting to explode. The bit about her '70s girl' look but shaving her other body parts to its extreme is cute. Several other scenes are very inventive including a Coach 'Man' who has a clearly exposed body part, a detective who shows his photographs while asking an eyewitness if they could possibly match the suspect, and tantalizing nostrils a la "Blair Witch Project". "Scary Movie" isn't a great horror picture spoof but there are enough moments to make up for non-stop offensive behavior and downright sloppiness.</fullReview>

Also, the death scenes quite easily could have been the funniest parts of the movie, but only one of them made me laugh much at all (it's the fifth one, but I don't want to give it away).

		<shortDescription>Laughable, but for the wrong reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Wayans brothers, Keenan, Shawn, and Marlon, decided to make Scary Movie maybe they should have taken some time out of their busy schedules to check out a few of the success stories in the movie-parody genre.If there is a thread that runs through such classics as Young Frankenstein, Dracula: Dead And Loving It, and the Airplane and Naked Gun series, it's that there was plenty of work done before the filming started.Scary Movie, by contrast, looks like it was put together off the side of someone's desk. It's almost as if the Wayans decided to do a parody of the recent litany of slasher/occult flicks simply because they form an easy target for a quick summer comedy before dashing off on vacation.At the risk of sounding like their grade eight English teacher: Script writing matters, boys.Scary Movie starts out all right. True to teen slasher tradition, Carmen Electra does absolutely everything wrong as she's chased down by a knife-wielding maniac, even turning the wrong way when she faces two signs, one pointing to safety, the other to danger.But that's about as good as it gets.The referential humour is there: Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project -- they all play a part. But so does Kingpin, American Pie and Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo, as the Wayans opt to delve into this new-fangled gross out humour that's all the rage.Even when Scary Movie gets back on track, it's only partly so. For reasons known only to Keenan, Shawn, and Marlon, scenes from the very un-slasher The Matrix and the very un-occult The Usual Suspects are spoofed. There was even a near word-for-word remake of a Budweiser commercial, about the only difference being that one guy wears a mask.Clearly, the Wayans failed to stick with the challenge, the end result being a movie which promises so much failing to deliver. That said, there were plenty of people lined up at Center Cinema on Saturday night -- obviously more than just a few movie-goers like this kind of stuff.And as disjointed as the whole thing is, I have to admit I laughed at a few scenes, particularly the one where Cindy and Bobby finally do something about their unrequited teenage love. Let's just say there's enough energy let lose to equal the impact of Godzilla battling Mothra.Unfortunately, for every good sequence there were three or four lame ones. It's a lot like watching your favourite team in an off year, when the wins are rare and usually by the skin of their teeth.</fullReview>

A movie like Orgazmo was hilarious because the jokes were original and most of the graphic scenes left something to the imagination. "Scary Movie" was a 2 hour-long rpresentation of cliche after cliche.I really don't know why, but I didn't laugh at this movie much. Not to mention the fact that there were only a total of six people in the theater (myself and my boyfriend were 2). The movie was good for a few chuckles over all, and I have to say I do love spoofs.

		<fullReview>The trouble with doing a parody film on this particular genre (especially the SCREAM series), is that a lot of these movies made fun of themselves, as well. So SCARY MOVIE has had to take the parody concept to a second level, with mixed results. The gags were either hit or miss, like any other comedy. The essential ingredient in all comedy is a sense of timing, and the element of amusing surprise. This movie runs hot and cold. The jokes that succeeded, were hilarious (and some more than slightly tawdry). Other attempts, were pushed to the point where the humor felt forced. This was evident, as at times the theater (which was packed) would fall silent, except for a groan or two, scattered about the room.SCARY MOVIE isn't bad, though. It's just that this form of send-up has been done a lot, and it's starting to show signs of wear.</fullReview>

There are quite a few funny jokes, parodies, and references to other movies, and they all tied in together fairly well. The movie was, however, also quite nasty at parts, with a few scenes of graphic male nudity, a bloody compound fracture, and some graphic jokes, but you learned to see by them. So, a lot of the jokes were stupid and maybe not that original, but I think that there a bit of intelligent humor as well, and that the comedy was basically successful in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty cool movie, worth every minute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funnier movies this year and bound to become a classic, based upon the popularity of the "Scream" and "I Know..." movies. Guaranteed laughs. Excellent choice of actors/actresses and the Wayans brothers bring the same comedy to the screen as with their old show "In Living Color".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recycled laughs? (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie over the weekend, and with all the hype, it was a bit of a let-down, with the first 10 minutes being an almost line-for-line and scene-for-scene take from the original Scream (which was expected). Other films which were spoofed included the other 2 Screams, both I Know What You Did Last Summer and its sequel, The Sixth Sense and The Matrix. I think I was the only one in the theatre who laughed when "Principal Squigman" came on screen, complete with a Shotz Beer sign on the office wall (which is of course reference to Henry Winkler's appearance as the High School Principal in the original Scream). My two big beefs with the film are 1) that we never find out who the killer is (he just gets buried under an armoire) and 2) while I personally found all the sexual innuendo funny, it is not a movie appropriate for kids, and there were a couple of young kids in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wayans disappointed me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved the Wayans' sense of humor all the way back to when Keenan was in "Hollywood Shuffle". "Menace to South Central" is one of my favorite comedies. But this movie made me want to ask for a refund.This movie was not funny beyond the previews I had already seen on TV. If you laughed at them, be happy with that and save your money. You have seen every funny part in the film..I liked Shorty a lot, especially the way he referred to everyone as, "Son", even the female characters.For everyone who has praised this movie so far, you are entitled to your opinion. I strongly disagree with you. This movie was terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shut up, people!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first off, I want to say that "Scary Movie" is the best movie to come out this year. It is a very intelligent spoof of horror flicks like "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Halloween", even "The Blair Witch Project". Not even "The Sixth Sense" or "The Matrix" get off easy! To quote Keenan Ivory Wayans, the director, "These movies have been going on for almost 50 years, and they just keep getting dumber and dumber". And he's right. I mean, FINALLY, a movie like "Scary Movie" has come out!Getting to my summary, which you're probably wondering about, almost every comment I've seen on IMDb says "Oh, it should've been rated NC-17. There's too much graphic sexual content. It's definitely not for young kids. It's really disgusting. Don't see it. I've seen less nudity in X-rated movies."All I have to say to you people is...........SHUT UP!!!! Okay, I agree with you people who say it's not for young children. I mean, honestly, why would you take an 8-year-old, or younger, to see an R-rated movie? It's rated R for a reason! But I think it was okay for an R-rating. All that people seemed to be paying any attention to was the vulgar sexual content. I think if it had more than it did, it could've been rated NC-17.And also, there wasn't that much nudity. There was the "I Know" thing, the scene in the stall at the movie theatre, and the the.....ugh.....gym teacher, but those were the only "strong" nudity scenes. Even the pretty graphic sex scene (with Bobby and Cindy) didn't have a lot of nudity.To sum up, "Scary Movie" was definitely worth the six bucks I paid. I laughed my ass off! If you haven't seen it yet, go see it NOW! Oh, I also forgot to say that the "WHAZZUP?" commercial parody was pretty funny too. I give it **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie is the type of movie that attracts the teen audiance. This movie features crude sexual humor, profanity, drug use and violence. Scary Movie has a runtime of 88 min. The movie has a weak plot and slapstic humor, half way through the movie the humor dies out and stops being funny. It spoofs scenes from movies like the Matrix, Usual Suspects, Romeo Must Die, Scream pt1 and scream pt2. Overall the movie is good, I gave it an 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest parody ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie ruled! It was great to see somebody finally make fun of these kind of movies because basically horror movies today really started to suck.This movie parodies everything from the Scream trilogy to the two IKWYDLS movies and even to the Matrix. Good thing too because all of these movie's sucked(except for the first Scream). The characters in these movie were funny too. Anna Faris, Shannon Elizabeth and Lochlyn Munro were the funniest in the movie. This was the best of the Wayans brothers too. I thought it was a lot funnier than Don't Be A Menace to South Central while drinking your Juice in the Hood.Scary Movie is a Funny Movie. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was great- very funny - had a constant flow of jokes. However, whats up with all the kids in the theater?! Everyone I have talked to has seen kids, some with mommy, attending this movie. I was laughing at all the "adult" jokes and found the 12 year old girls sitting by me trying to figure them out. Between the blabbin' on and on about their little Mr. Right not showing up for the Saturday night movie, and the constant explanation of every joke by the only one that seemed to understand what everyone was laughing at, I found the movie worth seeing. I hope the next time I go to see it, I wont have to sit next to the Blues Clues Fans!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What has the world come to when disgusting trash movies like this are being made? I did not even want to see this movie, but at the last minute I gave in because I thought well maybe if it's the #1 movie in America it can't be that bad. But, it was and is that bad. It was terrible. I almost walked out, but I had a sick curiosity to find out who the "killer" was. So, I stayed and watched as I sat there wasting 2 hours of my life. 2 hours of my life that I can never get back (not to mention my $7.25). At the end of the movie which I thought might never come, I was ashamed and disgusted that I had sat through the whole thing. I have never regretted anything more. This movie is an insult to humanity. Hey, and I enjoyed the "Scream" movies.</fullReview>

Why not just put text/cue cards in there for all the lamers they think must be watching it would at least give those of us with brains something else to laugh at as we watch the light go on over their heads!

		<shortDescription>Do u like... Scary Movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder why this movie was called scary movie? Anyway... I have a statement to make. I thought the movie was funny, but the only reason why it was is because it had to use other movies for its humor. This is my opinion. Anyone who knows all about sex, and sex toys, and all about erectums is mature enough to see scary movie. The thing is most kids between 11-13 don't and claim they do. They think they bad because they know what it is when i a guy is sticking a women. The point of the matter is, 11-13 year olds are not sexually mature for the things they know about. Most kids went to see Scary movie cause they knew it would be funny. They didn't know that they were not physically and sexually mature for this movie. I would say u should be gone threw puberty before u see this movie, and millions of scary movies profit has been through kids who haven't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have to pay to see this movie, and I feel a little sorry for those who *did* shell out $8. "Scary Movie" *was* funny; I laughed almost throughout the movie, but the jokes and gags were not exactly memorable, with the exceptions of Ray's (Shawn Wayans) bathroom encounter with the killer; Brenda's telling everyone in the theater to be quiet and then talking on her cell phone ("I'm watchin Shake-a-spear in Looove, girl!") and enraging everyone in the theater to a point where they kill her; and the gym teacher's uncrossing "her" legs. It's a good movie to see with your friends if you're all high, or if you have a buddy at the box office who can hook you up with free tickets. Otherwise, wait 'till it comes to the Dollar Movies, or make it a Blockbuster night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gross, but not that gross. Funny, but not that funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read quick reviews of this film, and it was described as a sort of King of gross-out movies. With this in mind, I wondered whether I should even bother to see it, because I don't find nausea all that amusing.But when I watched this film, the gross-out gags that I saw were more shocking than disgusting. There were a couple involving nudity, granted, that were over-the-top. But other than that, the scenes that had critics enraged were fake, therefore more funny than anything else. If it's not realistic, how gross can it really be? There are scenes in "Kingpin" that are worse than this, in my opinion. I have seen movies that made my stomach turn or made me cover my eyes with embarrassment, and this simply isn't one of them.The sex wasn't pornographic or extremely raunchy because the movie didn't take it seriously. That is why I wasn't offended by the in-your-face sexual content.I think it's completely deranged that someone could take a child way under 17 to this R-rated movie and then complain about the crude humor, sexual jokes and imagery, and everything else. If you don't want your kids to see this type of stuff, maybe next time you should bother to check out the many sites online that let you know exactly how films rate for child viewing. Or even better yet, follow the MPAA ratings.Finally, I think the movie would have been a lot funnier if all of the best gags hadn't been given away in the trailer. It's a paradox though, because most of us saw the movie because we liked the trailer so much. There were some spectacularly unfunny moments in this film, but they were balanced out by some truly hilarious moments. It's rare to hear an entire audience howling with laughter, and that happened at least six or seven times in this movie. So all in all, I think it's a success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie does it all film wise by portraying and twisting films like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and even the Matrix into the funniest parodies ever. It just goes to show that not only has Hollywood cut down on the making and release of horror films, but with what popular horror films are now made they develop into parodies and films such as Scary Movie can become a watched hit by the use of comedic parody. Scary Movie is not the funniest movie, but give it a watch if you have nothing else better to do any comedy fan will find the parody superb. Horror fans won't like this film, but hey every now and then it should be okay to enjoy twisted parody of even your favorite genre. In film you must take the good and also the bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't have been more scared of this type of humor! How do they get away with this over-sexed-drug-infested humor without having someone rate the movie higher than 'R'? It's utterly amazing since I've heard of movies being put back on the cutting board so to NOT reach an NC-17 rating.Over all I found this type of humor a disgrace to my intelligence and a disgrace to movie-goers everywhere. The "Blair Witch Project" parodies are getting old and the repetition of jokes was getting ridiculous. There were some highlights though. There were a few acts that I found funny (even if it was a bit of toilet humor) and the cameo appearance of Squiggy of Laverne &amp; Shirley. I think I was one of the only ones that found humor in the schools name, "Corpse".So all is not bad but this is a definite rent movie.</fullReview>

The first oral sex joke (a rip-off of a classic Chris Elliot moment in "Mary") wasn't funny. The 50th was offensive. The first naked male brought a chuckle. The next few times, I had to turn away. Drugs and dopers were funny in "Fast Times At Ridgemont High", but Spicoli rarely mentioned them or was even seen with them. His attitude and actions told it all.

		<fullReview>First of all, this movie was quite enjoyable and had me laughing throughout. I liked it. I really did. Really. There's just the matter of a little philosophy I put great stock into: a movie should not contain more male than female nudity. There have been several movies in the past that have gone against this (i.e. The Full Monty, There's Something About Mary), so sadly this is not the first transgression. Of course, the scenes of the crimes did not produce genuine laughter, rather horrified screams and disgusted groans. I can appreciate gross-out humor to an extent (American Pie); even shock value (Me Myself and Irene). But once you cross that line, the laughter ends. Fortunately, this was only a small part of the movie (no pun intended). As far as the spoofs, they were done quite well in most cases, especially the takes on IKWYDLS. Unfortunately, these scenes were already shown in trailers and commercials millions of times before the movie's release. Nevertheless, Scary Movie was very entertaining and I give it a 7 on a comedic scale of 1-10. Just a bit of advice: kids, don't bring the parents to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An occasional laugh not worth the seven bucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty bad. Every now and again there was a trace of real wit, as in a few of the direct parodies of scenes from the "Scream" or the "I Know What You Did Last Summer" movies (I particularly liked the pretty heroine yelling, "C'mon! Do it!", ala Jennifer Love Hewitt from the "I Know" flicks--very funny!). The "Blair Witch Project" bit was clever, and well-done. But overall, the Wayans brothers humor isn't stupid-funny (as in the sublime "Airplane" or "Top Secret" flicks) it's just groaningly, unfunny-stupid. A shame, had it been made with a little more finesse, it could have really been something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a few good laughs. It gets tiresome really quickly. It is some sort of hybrid, mutant cross of Farrally Brothers (Dumb &amp; Dumber) and ZAZ (Airplane). The acting was fine but you go to a spoof movie for the laughs and parodies and this comes up short as so many jokes are repetitive and predictable.Don't waste your money on it in first run theatres. Good movie for a second run theatre or home video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer number of attempted jokes, does not a good movie make.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An inherent problem with movies which pay a satirical homage to the films they are trying to make fun of, is that the viewer is often bombarded with so many laughs that the act of laughing actually becomes tiresome. Scary Movie is worse in one respect. Out of the hundred or so sight gags, stunts, and pratfalls, a grand total of 2 struck me as being actually funny. The rest were ridiculous at best and stupid in general. Apparently the rest of the audience seemed to be pretty much in agreement with me judging by the blank looks of disbelief registered on their faces when these so-called "jokes" appeared on the screen. Do not waste your money on this one. Wait till it reaches cable, and then judge for yourself the lack of talent that the Wayan brothers possess. A generous 2 out of ten, counting one point for each of the two laughs I actually enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious as hell, but NOT FOR KIDS &amp; TEENS! Sexually graphic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***WARNING: this review reveals a quick scene description, so if you haven't seen it and don't want to know anything, don't read on.I've been working at a movie theater in Metro Detroit for 5 years now, and I think that I'm a pretty good judge of what's appropriate for the younger audience. Note also that I'm in my early 20s, so I'm no square. =)I saw this parody movie cause I thought it would be hilarious... and I hated the Screams (I stopped at the first one) and I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc. They are pure cheese, not funny at all, and made for an audience who likes brain-numbing dialogs and plots. No suspense or thrill whatever.Scary Movie really does a great job at poking fun at those movies, and does some really funny sight gags referring to other movies. The audience was roaring with laughter! I enjoyed it myself, but it's not quite on the "buy it" list.However it's VERY sexually crude and raunchy. I don't mind it, but I DEFINATELY think parents should know what's in it before they take their kids. I mean, rampant marijuana use, binge drinking, penises everywhere, a couple of oral sex scenes (words and moans and implied actions, you don't see the parts but definately know what's going on), TONS of sex talk and cussing, and the highlight... a sex scene with an ejaculation that shoots a woman up to the ceiling and COVERS her in TONS of semen!Now if you see the preview on TV, you'd probably think there was just a little violence and a few cuss words, that's it. The worst thing they show is a scantily clad woman running through a sprinkler. So lots of parents are taking their kids and teens to see this movie, thinking it's no big deal. They even ask, "Is it REALLY that bad?" or "How can I get my kids into this movie without me seeing it with them?" DUH, it's rated R for a reason! When we tell them what's in it, 9 times out of 10 they switch shows or don't see it.We've actually had parents coming out and complaining about why we never warned them about it. Well, DUH, that's not our job, YOU are the parent who should KNOW what your kids are seeing. However, my managers have been telling the cashiers to warn parents who look like they might give a care of what their kids see and we're carding like crazy.So go see this movie for laughs, but don't take your kids! I wonder why this movie didn't get an NC-17 just because of the penis shots and sex references and talk. This movie blows "There's Something About Mary" out of the water in terms of sex gags and raunch! (But it's really funny for adults!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAAASSSUUP!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wayans family has from time to time chimed in with a parody of not just one movie, but a whole sub-genre. And they seem to do this when it is most needed. First there was I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA, which basically slammed all the blaxploitation cops &amp; pimps movies of the 70's - for example: SHAFT, DOLEMITE, THE MACK, etc. Then the "In Living Color" series came out and not much was seen from the Wayans in film as far as spoofs are concerned. Then in 1996 they released DON'T BE A MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN THE HOOD. Now again if you know the sub-genre, you will laugh through the whole movie and this time its the depressing early 90's growing up in the ghetto fliks a la BOYZ N THE HOOD, MENACE II SOCIETY and others.Now I know I'm supposed to be talking about SCARY MOVIE, but that was just a prerequisite. SCARY MOVIE is the funniest movie I've seen in 2000, easily. What better way to put an end to a tired, played-out sub-genre than to totally rip it apart. Now to fully appreciate a film like this, you really have to understand the humor. See the Wayans' style of humor is kind of like THE NAKED GUN meets Russel Simmons' "Def Comedy Jam". And ooh is it funny and at times brutal. I'm not even gonna go into what they spoofed here because I'm sure you've heard it a thousand times. Most memorable scene - the spoof of the "Waasup commercial". Most memorable character - Marlon Wayans as "Shorty". Most memorable cameo - a tie between Squiggy as the principal and Keenon Ivory Wayans in the spoof-trailer for Amistad II. It is one crazy, outrageous film that packs more genius humor in each minute than ROAD TRIP &amp; AMERICAN PIE combined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had to be one of the funniest spoofs I have ever seen. I literally almost fell to the floor in the theater especially during the parody of the Matrix. However I had to give it a lower rating due to the blatant references to sex and the grafic nature of it. It seemed to go way to far for me and in all honesty I believe that the film deserved and NC-17 for certain things in it. I do feel that sex has its place in the movies but it can easily ruin the mood in a comedy especially for people who are offended by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I went in expecting lame, stupid humor, and that's exactly what I got. There were two or three flat spots, but they were more than made up for by the rest of it. You'll need to have seen at least "Scream" and "Scream 2" to get about 95% of it, and there are also references to "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "I Still Know....", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "The Matrix", "The Blair Witch Project", "Sixth Sense", and "The Usual Suspects". One reference I particularly liked, which might be a bit obscure especially to those not old enough to remember the shows: David Lander appears as Principal Squiggy. In the 70's, Lander starred as Squiggy in "Laverne and Shirley", which was a spin-off of "Happy Days", which starred Henry Winkler, who played Principal Himbry in "Scream".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See It If You Like Cheri Oteri!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favourite part of this film was Cheri Oteri's role. She was great. As for the film, I like many was disapopinted. And I, like many, have to agree that, all in all, I'd rather have seen the trailer again than this film. It's a shame when all the best parts of a film are put in a trailer just to get you to the theatre. The acting was good. I'd have to say that the lead girl, who played Cindy, was very good, as was the loser, Doofy. And of course, Cheri's character, a parody of Courtney Cox's reporter from Scream. The sexual content only bothered me because I was with my mom, who I had to beg to take me to the film: Don't see this with your parents, is all I have to say. Alone, I could handle the sex and all, but with my mom, I felt humiliated for both the content and for the fact that this was something I had asked to see. I laughed through most of it only so she wouldn't know how disappointed I was. The beginning was okay, the Scream parody was well done. But then it dragged. The cute part was when the supposedly deadman came back to life after getting hit by a car, only to get knocked out again (and no, this isn't a spoiler). I'd give this film a three point five out of ten. The point five is for Cheri.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie offers itself up as a parody and that it most definetly is. Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, The Matrix, I Know What You Did Last Summer all are referenced. The secret to enjoying it is to go into it with the mindset of a 14 year old. Then you will be blown away. Most of the jokes work on that level and that's what should be remembered. Overall the mostly unknown cast does well with the script they have, but it still has to be realized that most of the jokes in the movie are very low-brow with a lot of shots being taken at blacks and gays. So for the intellectuals out there, avoid this movie, but for everyone else go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie today, and I thought that it was one of the funniest spoofs I have ever seen. There was only a couple fleeting moments when I or the rest of the audience wasn't laughing. However, i thought the Blair Witch Project part of the movie was pointless, but that only lasted about 30 seconds so it didn't affect the greatness of the movie. I have no idea what the people that thought this movie was bad, not funny, or offensive were thinking. I thought it was acted well(note that each character in this movie spoofed at least 2 characters in other movies). I also thought the R rating is what this movie deserves, not NC-17. There was some brief nudity, but not enough of that or sexually explicit humor to make this movie NC-17. Overall, I Thought this movies was very well put together, not to mention extremely hilarious. I definately think it is worth the money to see it, and you should see it while it's still in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious in spots, but uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little wary of this movie, given that I generally don't fully appreciate the Wayans brothers' brand of humor. But I gamely went along with my friends to watch it last night. First, this movie would have been better without the questionable material (which should have qualified it for an NC17 rating.) Second, the acting in this movie is much better than the material. Third, most of the fun in this movie comes from figuring out which movies they are spoofing or out-right ripping off. By my count, they stole whole scenes from both the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer franchises, and peppered the movie heavily with direct and indirect references to other recent flicks, many not even of the horror genre: American Beauty, Matrix, Very Bad Things, American Pie, even Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance (or was that Riverdance?) And I believe the bathroom scene with the male organ could have been a reference to the famous shower scene from Porky's, but I might be reading too much into it.And yet, this movie reminds me of a Woody Allen routine about life being like airline food -- it's bad, and they don't give you enough. Yes, some of the humor is strained, and most is juvenile... but the movie is also too short (run time claims to be 88 minutes, but it must have some really long credits, because we were in and out of the theatre in 85 minutes, including the coming attractions.) Bottom line is that I wish I had seen it at a second-run theatre for $1, or at least at a matinee -- it's worth seeing if you like picking out pop culture references, or if you're really into juvenile humor, but it isn't worth the $7 or $8 most theatres get for an evening showing.</fullReview>

"Scream, Scream2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer" The first 15 min. is funny, then it drags a little the rest of the way. It does repeat sex and drug gags through out the movie. It does more of a close take of "Scream" then the other two movies. Carman Electra is her own sexual self. Anna Faris who plays Cindy is quite good and the only character who is normal. Anna is a look between Katie Holmes and Christina Ricci. I like the movie. Two best scenes, The mask man does rap with a hook and Cindy with Bobby in the bedroom near the end. Beware!

To like this movie you have to have seen some other movies...The Scream series, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects, and even any knowledge of The Brady Bunch kids names.This movie was awesome....it wasn't the funniest movie i have ever seen....because nobody can top 'Four Rooms'.Here's a nice tip for parents...don't let your kids see this movie unless they are over 15.....you might want to wait longer for your daughter(s) though because the humor is understood by men more and you wouldn't want to ruin her fragile little mind. I am 16 and loved it...but i laugh at things that are so stupid/gross/whatever. The previews do not do the movie justice, just like 'Me, Myself, &amp; Irene'. There is a lot of humor that has to do with.....lets just describe it as "penis humor" and several scenes have to do with the sexual parts of a man. Thats why you might wait on your daughter(s) seeing this film.Remember....(i can't stress this enough) do not think when watching...it won't make sense!

		<fullReview>_Scary Movie_ is a parody of many contemporary horror films (most notably, _Scream_ and its sequels). And to give it some credit, it does have its moments; it did make me laugh (out loud) on a number of scenes. But, as the film rolled on, I thought that it relied on too many "gross out" jokes to generate its laughs. Personally, I didn't find some of its grosser scenes--scenes which might make the Farrelly brothers blush with embarrassment--to be funny at all. I just found them to be gross and disgusting. Also, the film contains a lot of attempted jokes that just fall flat. If one laughs at them, it might be more out of courtesy than out of perceived hilarity of the situation. Overall, the movie is okay; it's worth seeing--but it is nothing to scream about</fullReview>

Oh, sure, there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but it's just not enough to cancel out how disgusting and bad it was. A lot of the jokes wear themselves out two seconds into it. It's not worth your time or money. My advice is don't see it at all, or at least wait till it comes out on video - at least you waste LESS money renting it. If you want a good, quality comedy this summer, go see Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger in Me, Myself, and Irene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to provide the public with fair warning. Those of us who were gullable enough to pay $7.50 to see the teen spoof flick "Scary Movie" are really paying for it now. Not only was the movie not humorous, but it was also mind-numbingly immature. Not immature in an "Ace Ventura"-like way immature in more of an "American Pie" way...but only 1/1000 as funny. The amount of actual humour in this film was comparable to that of "Schindlers List" or better yet...a child being run over by a cement truck. In fact, the only thing that I laughed at was the fact that people were stupid enough to think this movie was comedic. Let me tell you...it is WORSE than slapstick.Maybe I don't see the humour in it. The fact that people are praising it, doubled over in laughter points to the signs that they may have been on drugs or have experienced mind-bending amounts of internal bleeding. Who knows? All I know is that masses of people not only love this movie but are paying to see it AGAIN. I can't imagine seeing this movie 2 agonous times. I would actually rather spend my 7 dollars and 50 cents buying food or paying off my mortgage. The only way someone would be able to get me off of my couch to see this film again is if they paid for my admission, food, car insurance payments, and approached me with enough mind-altering drugs to kill a mule (that way I might actually find it a trifold comical). If this doesn't tell you enough of my feelings for this monumental cinemagraphic error then feel free to give yourself a full frontal lobotomy...that will provide you with some insight on what my brain feels like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've followed the hype Scary Movie's been brewing for over the past year now. I have to say, I still can't get over this film raking in 42 million dollars it's opening weekend. For any type of movie, including something of this calibre, an estimate like that ensures that Scary Movie is a hit. I personally thought it was very funny, but WAY overboard in some of its humor. By the way, this is a 20 year old guy saying this. I'm a fan of Keenan Ivory Wayans, not his biggest fan, but anything he makes I'd give it a look. I loved in Living Color, didn't think Low Down Dirty Shame was that bad, considering it did flop. My favorite movie of his up to this point I'm Gonna Git You Sucka-- what a great parody! Definitely one of my all-time favorite comedies. Granted it was 12 years ago, I was certain Scary Movie would follow up on the way the laughs were made in the 1988 comedy. I was wrong, because the button is pushed at least 7 times more this time around. The problem is all the way too vile parts don't mesh well with the truly funny parts, leaving a real mixed bag.I liked Scary Movie for one reason, the laughs that were dead on, were really on the money. I don't want to spoil anything, but one part I found very amusing in particular was Shawn Wayans' classic mocking of Matthew Lillard's "It's a Scream Baby" rant of enthusiasm from Scream. Overall, I can't recommend it to anyone except 17-30 year olds. This movie hits as well as misses, and that sex scene climax was just too much, even for me. As much as I respect Jim Carrey's work and his bringing back the big bucks in Me, Myself and Irene, I thought Scary Movie was simply the funnier movie of the two this summer.Is Scary Movie a well made, plotted film. Oh no. It's a pop culture parody at its finest with young faces and urban appeal. I saw the movie, presumably with the majority of the nation opening night, and I am planning on seeing it again because while the jokes did miss it's mark a lot, and some of the bits went way out of hand, it's scary to muster what the MPAA was thinking when they gave this film an R rating-- Scary Movie is just too funny to overcome once. The targeted movies getting lampooned are definitely worth receiving the sting Wayans style.</fullReview>

I am surprised they got away with some of the nudity and sexual scenes.If you realize what kind of movie you are going to, and you like horror movies and spoofs of movies, this is great.The Wayans brothers are at their best, and the lead girl does a great job.Some of the jokes are easy to miss. I'll have to see this again to catch the rest. Also, if you didn't see a particular movie they are spoofing, you probably won't find that part funny.The masked guy and his facial changes (watch the mask closely) are very funny.Not for kids, unless you take them to horror movies anyway.If you are easily offended, don't see this movie; otherwise, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayans at their best! AFI needs to redo their top 100 comedy list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent spoof on horror movies of the nineties. The gags never stop, and they keep pushing the boundaries till the very end of the movie. This was the first time that I was in a movie theatre and there was consistent laughter from start to finish. A lot of gags were over-the-top, but there were a lot of subtle gags throughout the film, which made me feel that every part of the movie was thoroughly thought through. There are probably many gags I have missed.The Wayans have always had a wide range of spoofs through television or film. "Scary Movie" is definitely their tightest work. Not only is the writing fresh, but the direction and the editing compliments the rapid fire comedy by not letting it drag or fizzle, as many other comedies tend to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like some others, I had hopes this movie would be funny based on the trailer which was hilarious, but the movie fell WAAY short. This isn't one of those movies where the trailer showed the best parts but it's pretty close.They had a good premise and a good framework and just hacked it to death. The jokes would start out funny, but then they jumped off the cliff with it and went on and began to not be funny but sick. The humor of the movie relied primarily on gross sight gags and pushing that envelope. Most of it could've been really funny if they didn't have genitalia popping out of she-men or an EXTREMELY runny nose parodying Blair Witch, and stuff like this. If you thought the Farrelly brothers were bad, you haven't seen this movie.I'm still a fan of all the Wayans' works, and the direction of the movie wasn't bad, but cleverly satirical this isn't. What could have been a good movie got too caught up in topping every other grossout out there. Don't spend your money.</fullReview>

I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my entire life. I admit that it was raunchier than I expected, but it was way funnier than I expected. There was maybe five minutes through the entire movie that the theater actually got quiet, and no one was laughing. I have to see it again. We laughed so hard that we missed some of the jokes while we were laughing. I highly recommend to anyone who wants a good laugh (or several)!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just last weekend i saw Me,Myself,&amp; Irene. At the time i thought it was the grossest yet funniest movie of the summer but now that Scary Movie has emerged i can honestly say not only is it the funniest movie of the summer, it's one of the funniest films i have ever seen.Scary Movie is a spoof of all the major teen horror films that have emerged in the last few years. Targets of this film include: Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did last summer, halloween. Other films include: The matrix, Titanic, the usual suspects, and Amistad. This film hits on all these films dead on. take the opening scene for instance with Carmen Electra. It takes some of the dialogue and action from the opening scene of the original Scream. The filmmakers have carefully researched all these movies and have some major fun poking fun at them.the acting in the film isn't great but it's good for this kind of film. Anna Faris who plays Cindy is good at mimicking neve campbell's chracter sydney in scream and doing a good Jennifer love hewitt impression from her character in I know... Shawn waynas is good as the closet homosexual, and Shannon Elizabeth, last seen in american Pie, has great comic timing and is very funny in the film. Props go out to regina hall too. she was my favorite character in the movie.For any one who hasn't seen please go do so because you're missing out. and just remember it's having fun spoofing these movies and you can have fun laughing at them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I must admit, the only reason I went to see Scary Movie was because I wanted to see the trailer for "Highlander:Endgame" (it was awesome, btw). Let me just say this movie surprised me a bit.I found myself laughing throughout and just simply astonished at some of the things the Wayans Brothers got away with.This movie requires you leave your brain in the car and just enjoy good, ridiculous grossed out fun. If you do that, you'll be fine. If you think too much, you won't enjoy this movie.Would I see it again? Yeah, I would, but this time it would be because I want to laugh. Scary Movie pulls in recognizable scenes from Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Sixth Sense. Since the horror genre has always been a little silly anyway, it made perfect sense that this spoof would do such a fantastic job.Wayans Brothers, you did an outstanding job at this one.</fullReview>

I hated the "Scream" and "I Know" films, and hoped to see them get the parody they deserved. I don't know which of the Wayans brothers has the penis fetish, but it's up here for all the world to see, and what's up with Hollywood's new love of making fun of retarded people? First "There's Something About Mary", then "Drop Dead Gorgeous", now this. This thing is so bad that had I rented it, I would have hurled the tape through the Window of the video store, and I'm glad to see most IMDB users have the sense to agree.

		<fullReview>...or money.This is definitely not a movie for kids, nor for your parents, nor anyone with any sense of embarrassment, dignity, morals or shame. Nor is it for anyone who wants to see a good movie. It's tiresome. I heard people say "that was cute" more than twice on leaving the theater. That's being diplomatic. It's crude and, other than a few laughs, the humor is lower than sophomoric. It makes "Dumb and Dumber" (or "Beavis and Butthead," for that matter) look like "I Love Lucy," and the "hair gel" sequence in "Something About Mary" look like Victorian parlor banter.It isn't a total waste, but nearly so. There's a big difference between effective parody and satire and a "two-by-four" of crude juvenile bathroom humor (don't mention THAT, for those who have seen the movie) being beaten across your forehead.My advice: don't take out the usual second mortgage to see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie is the gross-out, slapstick, spoof comedy that all others before can only dream of being. It goes without saying that the acting is not Oscaresque, but then again if you spent your $8 to see this movie for the acting you have already missed the point.This is not a movie for the classic critics of the world, looking for a serious plot with dozens of subplots intertwined. There are no superstar actors with years of accolades and awards on their coattails. If you are one of those critics who can't see the enjoyment in movies like American Pie, South Park, or Something About Mary, don't even bother going to the theatre. Because your warped outlook on the purpose of this movie will ruin it for many possible viewers.I will not spoil any of the jokes for you, but I will tell you that the humor in this movie is worse than that of any movie made before it with an R rating. How this movie passed as an 'R' is beyond me, but I would have gone to see it anyway. Some of the intended jokes are so shocking that your eyes will pop out of your head before you even know what you are supposed to laugh about. The movie is so funny at parts we missed some jokes because the theatre was still laughing (myself and friends included) so hard at the previous scene.If gag jokes and gross-outs are not your thing, then this movie is not for you. Don't even go. If it is however, or even if you aren't sure, you have to see this movie because it is by far the extreme of shock comedy. Four out of Five Stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a parody, for goodness' sake! It makes fun of other movies by having the actors act stupid. Duh! When the beautiful girl has a chance to grab a weapon from a table holding several objects including a handgun and a knife, of course she's going to grab the banana! It wouldn't be funny if the bimbo were intelligent. Is Naked Gun a classic because Frank Drebn is as skillful as James Bond? Do we love Airplane because of its serious drama and deep character development? (say it with me) Of course not. Parodies are supposed to picture people acting dumb. That's the funny part. Some of you people obviously need a splint for your funny bone, cuz you gots major porosis in ya humerus osteum. Obviously, I loved this movie.That said, I also agree with another IMDB reviewer who couldn't believe this wasn't rated NC-17. It was quite over-the-top with all the male genitalia and the rather volcanic love scene. I just wish I had been warned by a proper rating. Do not take children to this movie. Tell them about the birds and bees at home.Oh, there is just . . . one more thing (thank you, Columbo). You know the recurring jokes about the obviously-gay-and-in-denial guy? That's not a joke "getting old" as some have implied. That's called a "running gag." That too is, in fact, funny. Running gags were probably invented before parodies.Okay, I'm done.

		<fullReview>Went in having read the NY Times review and was fully prepared for sophomoric, sight-gag humor, leaving behind all expectations of high-brow, sophisticated wit and wisdom. The result: recycled, boring and rather lame attempts at cheap laughs. The movie was really choppy and seemed a forced attempt to push out all of the mini-sketches that fell to the cutting room floor under the censor's pen during the In Living Color Days. This is a classic example of a trailer-driven movie. There isn't much else to see beyond the 60 seconds Miramax packaged for ads. Save the $9 and go to AdCritic.com to watch the trailer. Hopefully Mr. Wayans will take a bit of a breather from the spoof business, but based on opening weekend box office results, he'll be encouraged to unsheath his rather deadly pen from the inkwell to bore again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucked and that's all there is to it.I wish people would stop making spoofs/parodies until they learn how to do it right. Message to the Wayans: rent Austin Powers or even Don't Be a Menace...As another poster said, comedy can't be simply referential. That is an all too disturbing trend in our culture today. People think they are funny just because they can regurgitate something funny that was already said. For comedy to work, it has to turn its subject on its head, play with it, breathe new life into it. This movie was filled with dead-on replays of crap we seen done before...and done better.The only truly funny scene was the movie theatre scene (which was also the only good scene in Scream 2 by the way) and it resonated even more for me cause I saw it with a mostly black preview audience.I think one of the major flaws of the picture was the fact that it parodied movies that were supposed to parodies themselves. The only problem with that? The Scream movies sucked too! I didn't think they were all that clever; again, kids referencing something is not the same as making fun of it or making a joke out of it. And I just saw American Pie so I just got the chick slapping the guy "JOKE", if that's what you want to call it. It was the same damn scene.The thing that pisses me off is I can't tell if people are dumbing down movies for the teen set or if people are really just getting dumber. I know for a fact that the Wayans can be funny; as I said earlier "Don't Be Menace" was great. It didn't recycle earlier jokes, it was clever, it struck a chord, and it didn't have to be nasty as hell to get a laugh out of me.I hope that teenagers today (by the way I'm 23) aren't stupid enough to let Hollywood keep feeding them this type of crap. How will they ever write a decent comedy film? We will end up with a generation of people who don't know what funny really is; they'll just take their cue from laugh tracks or the idiot sitting next to them in the theater.BTW - Anna Faris was great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A spoof set up more or less like 'Top Secret' or 'Airplane' rather than the more developed 'Austin Powers'. Most of the best scenes in the film are shown in the trailer. The remainder of the laughs are much weaker. The worst part about the movie is the number of young kids who went to see it. This film deserved a NC-17 rating that should have been enforced. One particular scene goes Farrely brothers too far, and is wholly inappropriate for anyone less than 17.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is right on the money with everything. If you thought a spoof of a spoof couldn't work, watch this movie and you'll think otherwise.Mixing the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer story lines is done very well, and making fun of other movies doesn't get carried away. The jokes are never run too far, and are as low brow as they come.If you're looking for nudity in this movie, you had better be a woman.This movie has it all and is definitely worth your money to see.I give it an 8 out of 10, it would have been 9 but they show too much male nudity and that's just evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing this won't kill you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are the sort of uptight person with a weak stomach who cries foul when they see a bit of dirty humor on the big screen, then don't go see this movie. If you are that type of crotchety old crumpet, then you should stay home and go to bed early. (You can count the minutes until Martha Stewart comes on!)Otherwise, expect a movie with minimal plot but which has some refreshingly sick, laugh out loud jokes and lots of crude gags that deal with every part of the human body.In short, I feel sorry for anyone who goes into this film expecting a good clean family fun movie, because that isn't this type of film. It's a slash and gag movie aimed at the mid 20's single crowd. In short, it's not for uptight soccer moms with three kids in tow.If you see this you'll walk out laughing. Bottom line.. this is a very FUNNY movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No the plot is not unique, but we knew that. No it's not scary, but we knew that. No Kenan Wayans is not on the same level as the Zuckers, but we knew that. And yes, it was vulgar, but we knew that too. The fact is this movie was mindless humor. And anyone who is upset about that they spent the money to see this, really has no one to blame but themselves. So for those smart enough to do the investigation before they plop down a small fortune to see a movie, here it is - It's Porkys meats Scream. If you didn't like both of these movies, see the Patriot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent gag movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is the gross-out, slapstick, spoof comedy that all others before can only dream of being. It goes without saying that the acting is not Oscaresque, but then again if you spent your $8 to see this movie for the acting you have already missed the point.This is not a movie for the classic critics of the world, looking for a serious plot with dozens of subplots intertwined. There are no superstar actors with years of accolades and awards on their coattails. If you are one of those critics who can't see the enjoyment in movies like American Pie, South Park, or Something About Mary, don't even bother going to the theatre. Because your warped outlook on the purpose of this movie will ruin it for many possible viewers.I will not spoil any of the jokes for you, but I will tell you that the humor in this movie is worse than that of any movie made before it with an R rating. How this movie passed as an 'R' is beyond me, but I would have gone to see it anyway. Some of the intended jokes are so shocking that your eyes will pop out of your head before you even know what you are supposed to laugh about. The movie is so funny at parts we missed some jokes because the theatre was still laughing (myself and friends included) so hard at the previous scene.If gag jokes and gross-outs are not your thing, then this movie is not for you. Don't even go. If it is however, or even if you aren't sure, you have to see this movie because it is by far the extreme of shock comedy. Four out of Five Stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of course it's stupid! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a parody, for goodness' sake! It makes fun of other movies by having the actors act stupid. Duh! When the beautiful girl has a chance to grab a weapon from a table holding several objects including a handgun and a knife, of course she's going to grab the banana! It wouldn't be funny if the bimbo were intelligent. Is Naked Gun a classic because Frank Drebn is as skillful as James Bond? Do we love Airplane because of its serious drama and deep character development? (say it with me) Of course not. Parodies are supposed to picture people acting dumb. That's the funny part. Some of you people obviously need a splint for your funny bone, cuz you gots major porosis in ya humerus osteum. Obviously, I loved this movie.That said, I also agree with another IMDB reviewer who couldn't believe this wasn't rated NC-17. It was quite over-the-top with all the male genitalia and the rather volcanic love scene. I just wish I had been warned by a proper rating. Do not take children to this movie. Tell them about the birds and bees at home.Oh, there is just . . . one more thing (thank you, Columbo). You know the recurring jokes about the obviously-gay-and-in-denial guy? That's not a joke "getting old" as some have implied. That's called a "running gag." That too is, in fact, funny. Running gags were probably invented before parodies.Okay, I'm done. Thank you, and goodnight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went in having read the NY Times review and was fully prepared for sophomoric, sight-gag humor, leaving behind all expectations of high-brow, sophisticated wit and wisdom. The result: recycled, boring and rather lame attempts at cheap laughs. The movie was really choppy and seemed a forced attempt to push out all of the mini-sketches that fell to the cutting room floor under the censor's pen during the In Living Color Days. This is a classic example of a trailer-driven movie. There isn't much else to see beyond the 60 seconds Miramax packaged for ads. Save the $9 and go to AdCritic.com to watch the trailer. Hopefully Mr. Wayans will take a bit of a breather from the spoof business, but based on opening weekend box office results, he'll be encouraged to unsheath his rather deadly pen from the inkwell to bore again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A parody of a parody?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually I think this movie may be breaking new ground. Scream was a good trilogy. The first 2 movies were basically satirizing horror movies from the past, all the characters know they're in a horror movie and the film does a good job with this, although Scream 3 was disappointing, it's almost like it became what it was mocking. So how do you do a parody of a film that was a parody? I have no idea, but I think that Scary Movie does it just about as well as it can be done.It's nearly impossible to write a review on this flick. None of the dialogue or plot is original, and everyone pretty much knows what it's going to be about. So basically the movie has one and only one task: to make us laugh. And that it did. I really wish I had watched the Scream trilogy before going to this so it would be fresh in my mind, but most of the gags seemed familiar to me.I could steal all the movie's best lines and write them here, but I don't want to spoil it any more than the trailers already did. I believe the theater would've been in an uproar had we not seen The Matrix ripoff 20 times already. There's 2 scenes near the end that are intercut and take up about 10 minutes. For these 10 minutes I laughed harder than watching any other movie for the same time that I can think of in quite some while. It includes a sex scene which features goggles, a hedgetrimmer, funny dialogue ("Say my name, Bobby!"), and an orgasm that must've felt awfully good or hurt like the dickens (so to speak), I'm not sure. All this completed with a scene where the killer, after getting high from an aquariam bong slashes folks during a freestyle session.Many parts of the movie are almost too funny for itself. Some scenes are so hilarious that you're still laughing halfway through the next scene and you miss some of the dialogue (Sample: "You ruined Schindler's List!"). Some of this is pure gross-out humor, but it's fresh. Case in point: Mrs. Man, the Omar Epps Bathroom Scene, and the Carmen Elecktra breast stab. The Blair Witch remake was done so perfectly you wonder if they cut and pasted the actual film and put it into their own reel.I must end this review sometime, so I'll just say that it delivers the goods. It's humorous to know that Dimension Films produced this movie, which also produced the Scream series, I believe. They must've had some clout as apparently the MPAA didn't see fit to rate this movie a deserving NC-17. What disturbs me is that I could hear kids behind me saying "Daddy, is this supposed to be Scream?" What kind of sicko would take their 7 year old to see this? Oh well, I sure enjoyed it.*** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most disgusting movie you'll ever see but its hard not to crack up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was definitely not expecting the graphic sexuality that you see during this movie but almost every scene makes you laugh. Although in some places the script is exactly the same as that of "Scream", the added comedy parts make it worthwhile. The killing scenes had to be the best because of the humour that went into them. The scene with Carmen Electra at the beginning was to die for and the hilariousness was enough to make you wet your pants. The mixture of horror movies was not really the case. So they may have done a brief "I Know What You Did Last Summer" scene or something from the "Blair Witch Project", "The Sixth Sense" or "The Matrix" but the movie was a funny remake of "Scream" and nothing else. The only thing that connects it to another movie was the Scream killer with a hook. The acting was great and the Wayans brothers deserve some kind of credit for their performances. I know that movie is repugnant, offensive, disgusting and utterly horrible to most adults, Scary Movie is a movie that only makes sense to teens! WARNING: Never sit next to a couple over 40 in this movie! All you will hear is their complaints about "These modern movies completely alienate adults" and "This is so disgusting! We should have gone to "The Perfect Storm!" Believe me, take this warning seriously!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Like all of the other IMDB reviewers, I was suckered in by the funny commercial and now wish I had an hour and a half of my life back to live. If you can't stomach sex jokes, please don't see this movie. A purist at heart, I felt disgusted about 85% of the time while watching. I would have left if my friend weren't with me. Iif you think Farrely Brothers movies are disgusting, then you'll faint while watching this. I have no idea how it escaped an NC-17 rating and wish it didn't. I applaud Mom and Pop Wayans for leaving in the middle of this piece of trash movie. I encourage any of you dumb enough to see it after this review to take my word for it and not do the same, cause you'll want to! Not only is this movie disgusting, but also it is very poorly made. The same jokes are repeated OVER and OVER again and you'll get sick of them after a short while. The first 25 minutes are the first 25 minutes of Scream parodied(and only 1/3 of that is the Electra scene) and it gets old VERY quickly.Only, and I do mean only, see this is if you can stomach disgusting sex jokes and visible male appendages throughout the entire movie or if you want to waste time and make fun of a terribly-made flop. This movie is not worth anything- they should have paid ME to see it. I want $5 back.</fullReview>

This movie starts off pretty funny as the spoof of such horror flicks as "Scream," "I Know What You Did Last Summer," etc. The best part of this movie was Carmen Electra's part! Don't go see this movie with your little brother or sister because there are too many sexual references and scenes. All and all it wasn't a scream!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a parody fan myself, Kentucky Fried Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret, I had to go this. I was glad that I did. Some parts I couldn't stop laughing the jokes were so funny! The Matrix scene was funny and the writing was witty and sharp! If you enjoyed any of the above or just looking for a good time at the movies, DON'T MISS THIS ONE! Only caution is, don't bring the little ones as some jokes are for adults only. :)</fullReview>

The second the movie came on i was roaring(as was the rest of the audience). Every scene I laughed at. Then there were scenes when you couldn't hear the next scene because everyone was still laughing their asses off. Some of the jokes make the Farrelly bros. jokes look like something Bill Cosby would do or say. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that you would have had to seen The Usual Suspects to understand the ending. But for those who did it was a riot(clever too).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another successful satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I couldn't wait to see it. I'm a fan of the recent horror movies, namely the "Scream" series. Needless to say, I was very impressed with the Wayans' satire on the on-again off-again horror genre. While a lot of the jokes will not make sense if you haven't seen these movies, that should by no means stop you from seeing it. But be warned, if you can't handle grossout humor, stay away. This movie takes sex jokes to a whole new extreme; a certain body part makes several appearances in the film.The cast is absolutely fabulous. Shannon Elizabeth's dead-on parodies of both Sarah Michelle Gellar and Rose McGowan's characters are so funny. Marlon Wayans' is over-the-top with his pothead Shorty. Even the relative unknown stars do a great job, especially Anna Faris, in the Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt roles. Even the opening scene with Carmen Electra was still funny, even though most of it is seen in commericals.No recent movie seems to be left unturned; or commercial for that matter with even the recent "Whazzup?" campaign spoofed. While some of the gags go WAY over the top, I found myself continually laughing at its stupidity. The script is really well-done, even though some of the lines are directly ripped from some of the spoofed films, especially "Scream." But since the film is released by Dimension, as was "Scream," I guess they can get away with it. The Wayans' brothers have achieved yet another destined to be successful satire. If "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" and "Don't Be A Menace..." were the start, then "Scary Movie" is the next step on their path to comedic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A teen 'horror' film worth watching...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who enjoyed 'Scream', but loathed the onslaught of copy-craps, rejoice! This is better than 'Student Bodies'! Better than 'April Fools Day'! Better than... I can't think of any more horror/comedies... Oh well...'Scary Movie' essentially (out &amp; out) steals it's story from 'Scream' scene for scene with some 'I Know What...' elements and a plot twist from 'Usual Suspects'. The only difference? Altered dialogue, exaggerated characters, numerous parodic vignettes and heavy, HEAVY doses of EXTREME raunch. Think back to Johnny Depp's death scene in the original 'Nightmare on Elm Street'. Now replace the blood with...If your mind went straight to the gutter on that one then you'll love this film! Far surpassing the Farrelly's efforts by sheer volume, this film isn't subtle... It's blunt, over-the- top, hit-you-with-everything-all-at-once comedy at it's best.Unfortunately, even the best has it's flaws. Some of the vignettes are so annoyingly pointless and unfunny that it takes away from the overall flow. Ex.: The "I Know..." flashback scene is funny at first, but soon forgets to be funny and doesn't effect the rest of the film in ANY way! Ex.#2: Although funny, the "Whazzup!?" send-up is seemingly thrown in for no reason! 'Airplane!' had at least SOME semblance of purpose for it's send-ups...Funny for funny's sake can be funny... But only if it's funny. Either poorly executed or just plain dumb some of the jokes/gags fall short. Note to everyone: Stop laughing at the same gas-passing jokes used in seemingly EVERY comedy nowadays. It's lame. It's old. Stop laughing and it will go away... When the film hits a lull, it resorts to childish, Adam Sandler-esque humor. Nothing wrong with that, but it's still old-hat.Even with all of it's flaws, 'Scary Movie' is still up to the task of making you laugh out loud. It's the first good film from Keenen Ivory Wayans since 'I'm Gonna Git You Sucka'. It's the first good film in the horror/comedy genre. It's the first good film of the week of July 7, 2000. I liked it. You might. See it anyway!And oh yeah... This film features a scene with a visual variation on the phrase "Tongue in cheek." Fare warning. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is good if you take it for what it is a Spoof!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that Scary movie for what it was, which was a Spoof of the resurging 90's horror films, was done pretty good. I'll admit that I was surprised by how far some of the sexual content was taken, however it still was pretty funny movie. If you take it for what it is a movie that is going to trash everything it can about other movies and even itself. Also if your someone who is easily offended by one Racial material or Sexual content Male or Female this is probably not the movie for you. However if your looking for a movie were you can kick back and relax and laugh at practically anything this is a good movie. Also with some of the Scary Movies that have come out I thought this pointed out some good points of how we as movie viewers got sucked into some storylines pretty easy and missed some things when they were right there. However if you haven't seen some of the things they make fun of the jokes they make won't make sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this movie has no intellectual value whatsoever going into it, but a dumb gross-out comedy is good for you sometimes. If you didn't figure out this was going to be a tasteless, adolescent raunch-fest of a spoof when you saw the trailers featuring Carmen Electra running through sprinklers in slo-mo, then the fact that the masterminds behind one of the sickest comedies to ever grace the FOX line-up (In Living Color, the early years) were the same people that are behind this movie should have tipped you off. I expected to cringe at a few of the jokes walking in, and had I not, I would have questioned my taste limits. The movie's there to offend. It's a spoof, a satire, and just as with others' works in such categories, the greatest group to speak up seem to be the ones who were horribly offended and sickened by it. It's just a movie. Take it with a grain of salt and milk the fun for all it's worth.All in all, I enjoyed it. This is probably the best spoof to come out in the past decade, and I'm glad to see that the Wayans are still not bound by the limits of good taste. They work best that way. This is coming from a gal who was raised on tapes of the good episodes of "In Living Color" and accepts the Wayans' raunchy humor used in those episodes and in this movie as something good. I'd much prefer this sick movie over the other sick movie of the summer - "Road Trip". Head and shoulders better than that.Go in with an open mind and tolerance for such things, and you'll have a great time. Otherwise, you'll hate almost every second of it.Just my 2-pence.- AuntieMeat</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you may know already, Scary movie is a movie based on making fun of the teen slasher craze. Once I got to the theater, I was very excited, after seeing the trailer over 50 times, I coudn't help it! I am 14 year's old, and was lucky to get in. I heard that it is rated R in the U.S., I live in Canada, it was rated AA. I didn't much like movies such as American pie and There's Something About Mary, but I was obsessed with movies such as Scream. Scary movie, turned out to be one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. Although, at some times, it just sickened me. There were two scenes that were VERY gross, not gross as in gory, but gross as in sexually gross! But, it is a movie that is good enough to see over again. The plot was stupid, but it was fun. Sometimes, what count's in a movie is if you had fun watching it, and Scary Movie accomplished just that. So all in all, I give it 8 out of 10 star's! I recommend people see this movie, it almost made my mouth bleed with laughter!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes funny, but mostly obscene. DO NOT BRING KIDS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My two kids had wanted me to bring them to see this. Thank God I had common sense and checked out some web reviews first. I went alone. I am 36 years old and have seen virtually every type film made, but to me this was less a parody, than an excuse to get away with every filthy joke and reference possible. I have no idea how they got away with an R rating on this...It should definitely have been NC-17. I went to a 3 pm matinee and it seemed like there was at least 40% children under 14 with parents. I didn't see as many kids at Big Momma's House, which was like a Nickelodeon show compared to this. I was totally shocked to be sitting around so many kids hearing references to (and sometimes scenes of) oral, homosexual, heterosexual sex and every other variation. The Wayans Brothers must have a phallic fixation because this is the first movie I've seen outside an X-rating that showed the male organ as many times as S.M. did. The MPAA was asleep at the wheel here. There were some funny gags and the funniest ones IMHO excluding one, didn't even involve any sexual reference, especially one involving the killer's baffledness at one of his victim's behavior; but honestly, I was so completely embarrassed about being around so many young children in this kind of movie that I couldn't enjoy myself even at the legitimately funny dirty jokes. In the row in front of me, a woman had 5 kids under the age of 12!Parents, if you intend to bring your kids to an R-rated movie, please at least read several reviews of it first, or better yet, go see it by yourself first. There is quite a difference in how movies are rated obviously. "Double Jeopardy" had an R rating, and except for a quick "murder" scene (which I've seen worse on Law &amp; Order) one mild sex scene, and language, it barely rated an R. Scary Movie is the complete opposite end of the spectrum. If you're over 18, go see it, and you may enjoy it. Just hopefully there won't be as many kids in the theater who are asking "What's that, mom?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the movies out there that spoof other films, this one should be near the top of the list in terms of entertaining value. From start to finish, jokes fly at the audience with unexpected force. In fact, the innumerable sight gags in this film put to shame the movie "There's Something About Mary." While some people may upset that many of the jokes in this movie do not mock the recent popularity of horror movies like it should, they are still hilarious. The difference between "Mary" and Scary Movie is that Scary Movie does not get caught up in itself nor develop a need to form a solid conclusion to the plot. In fact the conclusion to this movie spoofs another movie not of the horror genre. In all, Scary Movie is a very entertaining movie that provides more conclusion to Scream than Scream 3 did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite comedy movies of all time. I already give it second funniest spoof ever,the Wayans' "Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In the Hood" being number one. I will even say that the two films are a tie. I have read comments of people saying that they liked movies like "The Naked Gun" better. The Naked Gun was funny but does not compare to this movie, in my opinion, of course. I go to a comedy for two reasons and two reasons only. To be entertained and to laugh my a** off. I was entertained and I certainly laughed my a** off. I thought the gross-out humor was better than any movie I've ever seen. I think the Wayans are the masters of comedy. I don't understand, everyone loved "There's Something About Mary", a movie that I thought was hilarious, but it didn't make me laugh every minute like this movie did. It had gross-out humor and nobody was offended. Now all of a sudden it is offensive and tasteless. I don't care what is done in a movie as long as it makes me laugh. To anyone who had a problem with the way he material in this movie was presented, I say lighten up a bit. I mean, if you thought it wasn't funny, that's all well and good, but don't diss the material and the writers. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

Putting this aside, I was optimistic after fairly humorous trailers. This movie is a perfect example that a great trailer can be made for any movie. The main focus is 'Scream' with the main character named Cindy Campbell (Sidney Prescott), starring along side Gail Hailstorm (Gail Weathers), and Deputy Doofy (Deputy Dewey). If the humor doesn't grow stale on you, you can really get into this film. This film even spoofs the now famous garage scene from the original scream but in a very twisted way. The repeated showing of male nudity is a bit hard to stomach though. If you have a sick sense of humor, than this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time I've truly laughed at a comedy in a long time. Something about Mary, well I just didn't laugh, same with austin Powers. But here I don't know what it is but found myself laughing really hard. In Canada you only have to be 14 to see this movie, BIG MISTAKE! It has a repulsive scene with Mrs. Man. It was really quite sick. But who cares this is a funny movie. Best scene has to be when The-supposedly gay guys girlfriend is in the theatre, I choked on popcorn!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've made me laugh, but the previews ruined it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been dying to see this movie from the first time I saw the trailer in the internet, but unfortunately I didn't like it at all. After watching the ads on TV over and over again, (they seem to come up every 5 minutes) I almost memorized all the funny parts, and when I actually saw the movie I couldn't laugh again. The jokes that were left out of the commercials weren't there because they were too disgusting for TV, and I didn't find them funny. "Scary Movie" was a big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite comedy movies of all time. I already give it second funniest spoof ever,the Wayans' "Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In the Hood" being number one. I will even say that the two films are a tie. I have read comments of people saying that they liked movies like "The Naked Gun" better. The Naked Gun was funny but does not compare to this movie, in my opinion, of course. I go to a comedy for two reasons and two reasons only. To be entertained and to laugh my a** off. I was entertained and I certainly laughed my a** off. I thought the gross-out humor was better than any movie I've ever seen. I think the Wayans are the masters of comedy. I don't understand, everyone loved "There's Something About Mary", a movie that I thought was hilarious, but it didn't make me laugh every minute like this movie did. It had gross-out humor and nobody was offended. Now all of a sudden it is offensive and tasteless. I don't care what is done in a movie as long as it makes me laugh. To anyone who had a problem with the way he material in this movie was presented, I say lighten up a bit. I mean, if you thought it wasn't funny, that's all well and good, but don't diss the material and the writers. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening sequence of Scary Movie is hysterical. A throwback to the days when people actually watched Saturday Night Live and would re-enact their favorite sketch the following Monday around the water cooler at work. In a riff on the "lets-kill-off-the-most-famous-member-of-the-cast" opening of Scream, Carmen Electra is being chased by a masked, knife-welding killer. She stops at a table where a knife, a gun, a hand-grenade and a banana lay neatly arranged. In true horror movie fashion, she arms herself with the banana. There are even better gags in the scene, but I wouldn't dare spoil them. Suffice it to say that this may go down in film and television history as the only time Carmen Electra could be called a scene-stealer.Scary Movie starts off so well, that the rest of the movie has trouble measuring up to the promise of the beginning. However, director Keenan Ivory Wayans and writers Shawn and Marlon Wayans (along with four, count 'em, four other screenwriters) have made a very funny movie. That's right. I'm doing something I haven't done since the second season of In Living Color: using the name "Wayans" and the word "funny" in the same sentence.Scary Movie is an obvious spoof on the teen horror genre, and when it calls too much attention to the horror movie cliches it ridicules, it's at its weakest. The stupidity of teen slasher flicks is not a new topic. Scream itself was a satire on slasher movie cliches: and the first rule of comedy is that you can't spoof a satire. The film finds its footing when it simply uses our familiarity with Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and their sequels as a jumping off point for over the top gags worthy of There's Something About Mary.Much of the film's humor depends on violence against women, homophobia, out and out cruelty, even fat jokes. The Wayans Bros. push everything up to and then past the limits of good taste, but the film is so bold in its politically incorrectness, that you laugh anyway.As parody movies go, Scary Movie isn't up to the level of Hot Shots! or Airplane!, but it's funny enough to be worthy of comparison to both. All serious criticism aside, Scary Movie promises laughs, and delivers them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting Okay, But Humor Wears Out Fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into 'Scary Movie' with high hopes. The preview trailer was funny and I wanted to see more of the same type of jokes. Since no one can successfully do this type of parodic humor quite like the ZAZ boys from 'Airplane!' I was not sure what to expect. The jokes got repetitive. The pacing became labored. And the sex organ jokes should have almost given this movie an NC-17 rating! For those keeping track, the take-offs included the 'Scream' series of course, 'The Matrix', a brief 'Sixth Sense' gag, 'I Know What You Did...', 'The Blair Witch Project', and for some reason, 'The Usual Suspects'. They also reshot the 'Whassup?' commercial almost line for line. The film is only referentially funny. If you didn't see any of the above, none of the humor will make any sense to you. Even if you have seen everything listed, some jokes are just plain silly or stupid. When the main character Cindy (Anna Faris) is poised in midair a la 'The Matrix', she starts doing an Irish jig out of nowhere. This is the best they could do? The acting was pretty good for this type of lowbrow comedy, however. The characters seemed sincere even when they repeated the same joke over and over. For example, there are several references to the possibility of a character being gay. This just went on and on throughout the movie until you wanted to, ahem, scream. For nostalgia fans, even Squiggy (David Lander) from Laverne &amp; Shirley shows up as the Corpse High principal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie: A masked psychotic killer is stalks an unsuspecting group of teens. Sound familiar?I understand how "Battlefield Earth" got made: John Travolta had enough clout to bully a studio into making his pet project, even though the most clueless sycophant would have known from the first dailies that it was going to be a bomb. At least we won't have to worry about him for awhile.. The question is how did this movie get the green light?"Airplane" is arguably, the best parody ever made. It poked fun at the disaster genre and succeeded for several reasons: it boasted big name stars, had a clever script, silly special effects and most importantly, it was hilarious. With "Scream " (the most successful tongue-in-cheek horror film -ever) as it's template, "Scary Movie" had the potential to be another good parody. Unfortunately, like people, movies don't always live up to their potential, and the execution (sorry) in this case, is frighteningly bad.Rather than creating a clever script the writers chose instead to make enough changes to escape being sued for copyright infringement. They then cobbled together scene references from the spate of copycat horror films that have been polluting movie screens since "Scream's" success, had Carmen Electra (the only recognizable "star" in the film) run through a sprinkler in her underwear and showed the funniest scenes from the movie in the trailer. There was also a conscious effort to capture the "Something About Mary" crowd with scenes of people being done in by penises and a woman being plastered to the ceiling and deluged in semen. And let's not forget the less than subtle homophobic bent that permeates the movie.I take comfort in the knowledge that the brothers Wayans will not be coming out with another piece of drivel like this for quite some time.</fullReview>

Everyone actor in the movie is in his prime and maybe this is their best roles. Ray - his gay kind of character is hilarious and his jokes are just on the limit of not to offend anybody or to be uncomfortable to watch. Shorty - freaking funny and insane with his shouting jokes. Cindy - innocent, stupid and naturally funny. Bobby - absolute punk, funny as hell, especially the part where he explains to Cindy and Ray that he's gay at the end, I laughed my ass out at this part. Brenda - so natural to play rude black woman. Buffy - the ultimate bitch, he plays herself. Miss Thunderstorm - awesome hot ass reporter, a little bit evil to her cameraman. Greg - the ultimate macho, but with the smallest dick ..hahahahahaha, hilarious character. Doofy - the best retard in a movie ever made. The Slave and his master in Amistad II...OMG may be the funniest part in the movie - to see how black director make fun of slavery in America. I rate this movie 10/10 because I've watched it more than 300 times and I'll watch it again for sure. One of my all time favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Shameless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a parody of the teenage slasher genre, and luckily a very funny parody indeed. Keenan Ivory Wayans is the mastermind, and he has assembled a fairly standard group of teenagers and a psychopath, and gives them the opportunity to completely spoof the slasher genre. The "plot," such as it is, happens as a result of the teenagers out cruising with much hard alcohol accidentally hit someone, mistake him for dead, and then accidentally kill him when they throw his body into the bay to dispose of it. We suspect that somehow the victim rose from the dead or recovered to be the psychopath, but we are never quite sure. The psychopath, with a bunch of hilarious changeable masks out of the Scream movies, attempts to kill all the teens, but has some misadventures along the way.This movie is completely shameless, and anyone with a sense of decency should be warned. If you do not mind this issue, however, the movie has some great laughs. One scene that sticks out in my mind pretty much encapsulates this movie's strategy: at one point, the killer opens the door on a bunch of teenage boys who are watching TV and smoking ridiculous amounts of pot. They are completely helpless and about to get slaughtered when one of them has the presence of mind to offer the killer a smoke. After a few puffs, everyone starts laughing hysterically together, and then they all decide to start making threatening phone calls to potential victims (giggling all the time). The scene has an ironic ending that I will not give away for fear of tripping the spoiler alert. The killer has lots of moments where things don't go right and you think, man, it is tough to be psychopath. The teenagers are a study in human superficiality and often seem to preoccupied with their own issues to notice that they are slowly being sliced and diced. The sight gags are quite good and their are some legit surprises that keep you guessing. All in all, it is an hour and a half of quite effective tasteless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parody of the "Scream" series and the "I Know What You Did..." series. A bunch of teens accidentally kill a man one night and dump the body and agree to never tell anyone. A year later they get notes telling them that someone knows what they did last summer. This is all a copy of the first "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and throws in some very funny parodies of sequences from the movie pointing out all the stupidity and inconsistent plot lines. However there's also a killer wandering around dressed just like the killer from the "Scream" movies and we get parodies from those movies too.The jokes are sometimes VERY crude and not all of them work but, as a horror fan, I found this movie hilarious. I got every reference and plot point they were making fun of it and the movie keeps moving full tilt throwing out jokes left and right. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense but neither did the original movies. The cast are as good as they can be saying their lines with completely straight faces and enjoying themselves. There's also quite a bit of nudity in here--all male! Well worth seeing--especially for horror fans.</fullReview>

Among my favorite actors and actresses in the movie are Anna Faris, Regina Hall, John Abrahams, and Shannon Elizabeth. The writers successfully did the spoofs and parodies, such as "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", and even a beer commercial. Not suggested for early teens or children. Probably 17 or older. Lots and lots of sexual references, some drug use, some language, and some male nudity. Most scenes with Shortie (Marlon Wayans) with them use drugs. Very recommended film for comedy movie lovers. This began other movies such as "Superhero Movie", "Not Another Teen Movie", and "Date Movie". But this is the best one, and I can't wait for "Scary Movie 5". I loved all the others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie (2000) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Director Keenen Ivory Wayans' spoof of various horror movies including SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, THE SIXTH SENSE and even a little bit of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. The main "target" is the Wes Craven film as Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) finds herself losing one friend after another by a crazed Ghostface carrying a knife and various other objects. SCARY MOVIE is incredibly hit and miss and I think a lot of it could have been re-written for a much better movie but it seems everyone involved just wanted to take a lazy route and give us rather routine jokes. I say that because this here is basically nothing more than a scene-for-scene remake of SCREAM only jokes are added. I really think it hurt the film by making it so obviously a remake. I mean, did you really need to copy so much of the Craven film? That film in itself was pretty much spoofing a genre so what we've got here is a spoof of a spoof and it just doesn't work as well as it could have. I think the movie has some very funny moments but more times than not it just goes for rather lazy and obvious jokes. There are countless sex and oral sex jokes, many lame race jokes and in the most confusing scene, Cindy gets violently beaten up by a man for comedy relief. Spoof or no spoof, how do you include a scene like this and expect people to laugh? Still, I think what jokes do work are good enough to where fans of the horror genre should at least get a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I was back in elementary school everybody loved this film, they constantly quoted it. But you know what, they were all immature and that's why this film was so successful. There is an unbelievable amount of crude humour in this movie, I watched this a few months ago, and found myself tired from it fast. There was only two standout parts for me, that actually made me laugh. Something so generic and simple as the character seeing the killer one second, then looking away and looking back and he's gone, while showing him running away behind a tree was something I didn't really think about. Thinking about Micheal Myers doing that makes for some fun imagery. The other scene being when Ghostface kills that girl in the locker room, not very intelligent but it was amusing. This film could have been so much better if it was given to a more talented writer or director, but it just turns in silly jokes about sex. If you want to sit back and let all intelligence slip away for an hour and a half give it a watch. Take for what it is, a very crude film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First (and Best) from the Spoof Craze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of the millennium, there was resurgence in the spoof movie genre that would eventually lead to an overwhelming flood of horrible films over the next decade. The majority of those films are the fault of writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, two of the writers who had a hand in SCARY MOVIE. But back before Friedberg and Seltzer committed atrocities like EPIC MOVIE and SUPERHERO MOVIE, the Wayans were involved and everything was a lot better. This came out when I was still in high school and, just to be sure I wasn't remembering it through some na?ve juvenile haze, I dug it out of my collection and watched it again. Not surprisingly, it held up well over the years. SCARY MOVIE is a spoof of the popular slasher movies of the time, primarily SCREAM and SCREAM 2. A masked killer has come to B. A. Corpse High School and he seems to be targeting Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) and her friends. Really, the plot isn't important here and neither are the characters. Everyone in the movie is a direct spoof of the common horror movie archetypes: the horny boyfriend, the virgin heroine, the ditzy bombshell/cheerleader, etc. A movie like this is all about the gags and a constant stream of parodies and pop culture references, but that doesn't mean it's as bad as the stream of garbage that followed. No, the original SCARY MOVIE (for those who haven't seen it) is hilarious, even more than a decade later.The problem with all the spoof movies that gummed up theaters for nearly a decade before studios realized people were tired of paying for crap was that they believed a pop culture reference alone was enough to garner laughs. Well, they're wrong, and it didn't take them long to slip up. This is really the only good spoof to come out of the fad. The original tag line for the movie promised "no sequels" and I wish they'd kept to their word because the rest of them were awful and it only got worse when Friedberg and Seltzer tried to branch out to other genres. SCARY MOVIE was good and they should have left it at that but, you know? money. This movie made serious bank at the box office so I guess it should've been expected that it'd be milked for all it was worth and then some. Lame legacy aside, SCARY MOVIE is great fun and pokes fun at all of the popular thrillers of the time with references to SCREAM, SCREAM 2, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, URBAN LEGEND, and more. The core parody is that of the original SCREAM. While SCREAM itself was a satire of the horror movie clichés, SCARY MOVIE just straight up made fun of them. Busty babes running from masked killers, tripping and falling or running upstairs. Bumbling cops on the case and horny teenage motivations. And then there's the stoner humor. Of course, there's the stoner humor.The movie's pretty dated now. It references a Budweiser commercial that anyone born in the mid to late nineties probably doesn't even remember, but it compensates by taking the usual easy shots at white people, black people, fat people, stoners, blondes, etc. Pretty much every stereotype you can think of, but never crossing the line into offensiveness. At least, not in my opinion. It's actually pretty tough to write out a comment/review to support SCARY MOVIE without discussing the gags, because that's all the movie boils down to. I'm not looking to ruin the jokes for anyone who hasn't seen it and might be thinking of checking it out for the first time. The cast is pretty well done with Shawn and Marlon Wayans, Anna Faris (in her "breakout" role), Shannon Elizabeth, and Cheri Oteri (in the only role I've seen her play outside of SNL). SCARY MOVIE is a good movie to get wasted and settle in for some cheap laughs with. Just don't get your hopes up that the rest are anywhere near as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny but ultimately unmemorable parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole film is a parody of the horror movie "Scream" with a few altered segments from other films combined and a slightly different twist at the end, to try and create a more unexpected finish. Overall the plot isn't the best (although parodies of other movies are adeptly entwined into the film) and the acting is far from great (but in a film such as this that can be excused and perhaps even makes the film seem all the better), the overall effect creates an extremely crude and funny movie that'd be great if you're looking for just one night to relax and lighten up, with some hilarious moments and great adaptations of other movies. But all in all it's just a parody that's been stretched to a movie length that you may or may not find funny, depending upon what you are expecting from the film, and though it may make you laugh uncontrollably for some time it'll just be a movie that you'd forget about shortly after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story A year after accidentally killing someone and covering it up (as in I Know What You Did Last Summer) a group of high schoolers is stalked by a killer in a Scream costume. Scenes from Scream and Scream 2 are spoofed throughout, and there are references to The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense as well.Why is it that just about every joke fell flat for me? Are the lampooned movies too dated, or is it not my style of humor? Could it be that duplicating and exaggerating every scene of a movie that was already tongue-in-cheek is not a surefire recipe for hilarity? Or is it just me?Why you should see it You're high.Why you should avoid it You're not high.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some spoofs I like, and some I don't. Scary Movie is one of those I like. It is rather rushed for my liking, and Anna Farris overdoes it, plus I can understand because the humour is crude the film mayn't appeal to all. Crude humour is not my favourite kind humour, however I found the film hilarious. The script is witty, funny and pretty much laugh a minute and the gags and spoofs are mostly dead on, my favourite being the one with GhostFace and Shorty getting high. The soundtrack is fantastic as well, and the acting is better than I expected even from Marlon Wayans who I can be annoyed by. Overall, a lot of fun and the best of the series though I liked the second(despite its reputation), the third was okay and I didn't really like the fourth. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy a spot of lowbrow humour as much as the next guy?unless the next guy happens to be a Wayans brother. In 90s slasher spoof Scary Movie, Shawn, Marlon and Keenan Ivory Wayans have created a film so infantile and so devoid of genuine humour that it is hard to believe that anyone exists with an IQ low enough to appreciate its idiocy.A crass collection of obvious lampoonery, gross-out toilet humour, sexual innuendo and uninspired visual gags, this utterly puerile effort must represent the absolute nadir of spoof movie-making (with the possible exception of the Scary Movie sequels!). Rapid fire gags about farts, fat birds, genitals, drug-use, and sex all fail to raise a laugh thanks to their predictability, whilst jokes that might have seemed topical at the time now seem extremely dated and will probably make no sense at all to many of today's viewers (eg.,The Miller Time 'Wassup?' skit and a Spice Girls gag).In their desperate search for cheap laughs, the Wayans Brothers also unwisely cast their net outside of the horror genre, lampooning everything from Amistad to The Matrix with material that even Leslie Nielsen in his twilight years would have left festering at the bottom of the barrel.I rate Scary Movie 3 out of 10: one point for the delightful Anna Faris as winsome heroine Cindy Campbell, and another point each for the ample curves of Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth (it's always nice to have something good to look at when a film sucks so hard!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wayans Brothers are a Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious masked serial killer decides to slaughter six retarded "B.A. Corpse High School" students, after learning they accidentally murdered a man while joyriding. Planned victims include virginal heroine Anna Faris (as Cindy Campbell), horny boyfriend Jon Abrahams (as Bobby Prinze), subliminally gay Shawn Wayans (as Ray Wilkins), black girlfriend Regina Hall (as Brenda Meeks), busty beauty Shannon Elizabeth (as Buffy Gilmore), and studly blond Lochlyn Munro (as Greg Phillippe).Keenen Ivory Wayans' "Scary Movie" spoof ranges from clever to stupid. One of the best sequences is a dead-on hilarious opening, featuring Carmen Electra (as Drew Decker) parodying "Scream" (1996). One of the hardest laughs comes when Shawn gets poked in a movie theater's bathroom stall. Visiting "Le Sex Shoppe" must have been funnier. While it occasionally gets flaccid, there are laughs throughout, and the brothers score points for pushing the envelope and hitting a tired genre. Hard.****** Scary Movie (7/7/00) Keenen Ivory Wayans ~ Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Shawn Wayans, Cheri Oteri</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. It was just sick. I would recommend that you never watch this movie. There is hardly anything good about it. I don't care how funny you think it looks. It was a huge waste of an hour and a half of my life, and many others lives, and it is not even funny at all. Most of the humor is disgusting. I really could have gone my whole life without seeing Ghostface stick his penis through a mans ear while humming to himself in a bathroom. Sounds stupid doesn't it? Yeah well there is a whole that more where that came from. Just watch the movies that this was based on (which include the Scream series, The Blair Witch Project, The Usual Suspects, The Shining especially, Titanic, The Matrix or even I Know What You Did Last Summer, which was actually the only film in the movie to be spoofed well) or watch a more intelligent parody film. Seriously any parody film would be better. Just avoid Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, all the Scary Movies, and any more of these dreadful movies to come. Austin Powers, Tropic Thunder, Monty Python and the Holy Grail. They would all be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude and tasteless humor spoils a good spoof concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spoof is never a bad idea, but it requires wit and the Wayans brothers don't have it. Think back to the films that made the spoof a genre ("Airplane" and "The Naked Gun") and there you have a commitment to nonsensical but witty humor and most of all -- subtlety. "Scary Movie" might make a lot of people laugh with its literally balls-out mentality toward comedy, but the explicit drug and sex content is anything but clever. If the team of six writers spent half as much time making the jokes work for the plot instead of the plot working for the jokes, "Scary Movie" might have left a humorous impression on its audience. Instead, we leave feeling bad that we laughed at even some of the jokes in this movie because of how generally distasteful it is.Meant to spoof the wave of '90s horror films that brought back the slasher genre, "Scary Movie" combines the plot line of "Scream" with "I Know What You Did Last Summer" but fills it with goofy and/or stupid characters who make fun of these films' repetitive clichés.When watching this movie, you can tell that different jokes were written by different writers. At times, there's some actual cleverness, like when Shannon Elizabeth's character gets a standing ovation for a dramatic monologue in a talent competition, only she's actually screaming about her boyfriend who she sees being killed in the back of the auditorium. Another character taunts the killer by egging him on with descriptions of slasher clichés like "now I've broken my leg and I'm helpless!" That's the good stuff.Then there's other writers' humor: the killer getting high with a bunch of stoners, recurring female flatulence jokes and the gratuitous use of genitalia for a cheap laugh. It's like they were trying to sabotage whatever comedic intelligence they put into the movie because they didn't think people would like it otherwise.The characters are much the same way. Avoiding stereotype versus perpetuating it is a fine line. Some of them, such as Shawn Wayans' questionably gay athlete character, try so hard to make fun of clichés that they create new ones and others are just flat out tasteless jokes like the trans-gendered gym teacher who is preyed on for the sake of the ignorant people that find that stuff funny. On the good side is Cindy (Anna Faris), who gets on the map with her comedically believable performance. She plays up her stereotype of prude do-gooder but plays right into the best material i.e. the subtle jokes. Then there's Shorty (Marlon Wayans), the idiot stoner. I suppose the Wayans brothers have creative license to make jokes about black people, but there are so many that this humor forms its own subplot in ways, like it was intended to entice the black demographic that they worried the rest of the film wouldn't reach.For every three effective jokes that "Scary Movie" has, there's one horrendous one and that's how this movie negates itself. The franchise of spoofs that this movie launched (without having seen them myself) is certainly unprecedented and unwarranted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! OK, so, I watched Scary Movie 3 when I was younger. I was about 10, so I didn't understand all the raunchy jokes. When I was older, I then watched 4, with a better understanding. I then watched 1, and then realized I was cheating myself out BIG TIME for liking 4 the best. THIS is what Scary Movie is! It's original and laugh out loud funny! I NEVER laugh at movies, this movie on the other hand, it's just humor that's impossible not to laugh at! I just love it so much! My favorite comedy of all time! Brenda is soooo funny! Especially her at the movies! OMG HILARIOUS! There's just so many funny scenes! It's just all in all funny! Guys, seriously, don't watch it with wicked high expectations. I mean really, it's Scary Movie, it's not gonna win an Oscar. There are only 2 things you need to do in order to make your viewing of this movie successful:1) Don't watch with high expectations 2) Just laugh, smile, and go with it!8/10 grrreat comedy!

		<shortDescription>Funny - but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie in the "Scary Movie" franchise - a movie series that spoofs horror films. I've seen Scary Movie 3 and 4 and I would have to say that they are better than this. The plot on number 3 and 4 is just more interesting and I also found them more humorous. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie and I did find it funny but I believe it could have been better. I guess the Scary Movie franchise is one that gets better rather than worse - which is good because you can expect the next sequel to be better.This movie is basically about a group of friends who get stalked by this masked serial killer exactly a year after they accidentally killed a man on the road.This movie is good fun to watch (especially with friends) and I enjoyed it. Not the best of the franchise - but good anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" wants to be a parody of horror movies. I say "wants to be" because it fails, miserably, at achieving this objective.In the first place, a parody, properly speaking, is more than a parallel story with some funny jokes mixed in. A parody should be of the same genre as the work it is spoofing: the humour lies in the self-consciousness of the execution. There is nothing scary about "Scary Movie"; just some parallel plot elements to a couple of horror movies with some jokes mixed in. By contrast, "Scream" was universally acknowledged as a parody of horror movies--and yet it was a horror movie itself.In the second place, attempting to parody a parody will lead to an unmitigated disaster. Thus, if "Scary Movie" wanted to jump on the "Scream" bandwagon and parody the horror movie, it would have done better to take "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and, say, "Poltergeist" rather than "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Scream." (But frankly, "I Know What You Did Last Summer" is one of the many sorry films that parody the fact that movies--horror or otherwise--exist.)Finally... remember what I said earlier about a parody involving more than "funny jokes mixed in" and then mentioned that "Scary Movie" had "some jokes mixed in"? Notice that, in the latter case, I omitted the word "funny." This was deliberate. The jokes were not funny. I remember an occasional chuckle at the ludicrously implausible means of disposing of human life, but *LAUGHS* evaded me all throughout this obnoxious disaster. The fact is that death is not funny, and that sexual innuendos can make for a guilty pleasure only in the most moderate doses. A "Scary Movie" level of toilet-bowl humour reeks up the entire house.Grade: F-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Slasher Send-Up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This salacious but superb spoof of 1990's slasher sagas "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" qualifies as the best dead teenager send-up tale since Mickey Rose &amp; Michael Ritchie's "Student Bodies" (1981). Not surprisingly, this hilarious horror parody received an R-rating for frontal nudity, verbose profanity, and a couple of penises. Surprisingly, the prudish Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) permitted the filmmakers to show more close-ups of peters than any mainstream Hollywood movie had dared at this point. The best way to appreciate this inspired but irreverent lunacy is from the perspective of an infantile, four-year old boy who revels in blowing raspberries. Audiences that genuinely appreciate parodies will have one hell of a blast, too! Spotting the spoofs constitutes half of the hilarity of "Scary Movie," and the filmmakers knock off every recent major hit with an odd reverence for the source material. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans scores one of his best lampoons with a scene taken from the Stephen King movie "Thinner." Demographically targeted at young males aged 18 to 25, "Scary Movie" is fully guaranteed to offend females of the same corresponding age group. Crude genitalia jokes, farcical bowel humor, and outrageously blatant stereotyping provide the basis for most of its wickedly witty japery. The gifted Wayans Brothers are the demented intellects behind this splatter-brained spectacle. Not only do they deliver the standard buckets of blood and gore for a fright flick (yes, several characters bite the dust), but they also ridicule the clichés and conventions of the genre with consistently inventive flair. Indeed, Shawn, Marlon, and Keenen Ivory Wayans handed us the zany "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka" (1988) as well as the keenly subversive "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While You're Drinking Your Juice in the Hood" (1995). If you look carefully, you can spot variations on jokes from those two masterpieces. In "Scary Movie," they plumb depths lower than either the Zucker Brothers could with "Airplane" or the Farrelly Brothers did in "Me, Myself &amp; Irene." The column of semen that plasters heroine Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris of "Lovers Lane") to the ceiling in a bedroom scene hits a new ultra-low/high in gross-out humor. If you prefer subtlety in your movies, avoid "Scary Movie." Actually, despite their politically incorrect stance, the Wayans offer provocative commentaries. For example, a movie preview begins as a travesty of "Titanic" and then turns into "Amistad 2" with its star getting lashed by a whip. Few white directors would have had the pigment to lens such a scene. Similarly, the cultural bashing that blacks-as-audiences in a movie take in another scene when nearly everybody in a cinema as well as Ghost-face stabs, slashes, hacks, and disembowels one garrulous African-American male is hysterically funny.Shawn &amp; Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson &amp; Phil Beaumont, and Jason Friedburg &amp; Aaron Seltzer scraped the bottom of the celluloid barrel to contrive this no-brainer buffoonery. Some jokes are pretty obvious, such as the name of their educational institution: B.A. Corpse High School. Others reveal more depth than you could possibly imagine. If pop-psychology has constantly suggested that knives?like firearms?are latent phallic symbols, "Scary Movie" rams the comparison home by using a penis as a knife to stab one character through the head in a knock-off of "Scream 2." About every fourth or fifth joke really tests your sensitivity. The writes make fun of gays, women, transsexuals, stoners, and virgins. Seemingly nothing escapes the trenchant jibes of these scribes. What sets "Scary Movie" apart from recent parodies is the consistency of the humor and the headlong momentum with which the jokes are delivered. The Brothers Wayans never spare a second in this trim 89-minute romp to devastate everything in sight and leave you laughing.Like the slashes it sends up, "Scary Movie" concerns an anonymous killer that stalks a clique of high school students. A year before the killing spree commences, our teenage protagonists struck a pedestrian accidentally one night on the highway. While they argued about whether or not to call the cops, the guy recovered and tried to walk off. Inadvertently, one student flings a whiskey bottle into the air and it knocks the pedestrian unconscious again. Anyway, our inept heroes and heroines bundle his inert bulk into the trunk of their car. As they squeeze him into the truck, he revives again, but they slam the trunk lid down on him hard enough to knock him out again before they cruise away to dispose of his body.Shrewdly, director Keenen Ivory Wayans never lets the laughter lapse as he piles on pun after pun and slips in gag after gag in fast frenetic fashion. The first scene impales "Scream," while the second skewers "I Know What You Did Last Summer." Although Wayans mocks these movies, he celebrates them at the same time. While a tone of disarming sarcasm permeates the atmosphere, the filmmakers follow the formula, dutifully reenacting the ritualistic killing, sometimes with ridiculous but blood detail as when Ghost-face confronts Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth of "American Pie") and watches in amusement as she participates in her own death, another farcical stab at the slasher genre. The movie unfolds with a fart and degenerates gleefully into a series of low-brow but ludicrous "Naked Gun" style vignettes that deride the clichés and conventions of slash movies. The take-off of "The Matrix" is especially delightful, while the nostril gags from the "The Blair Witch Project" must be seen to be believed, too! If you missed either "Scream" or "I Know What You Did Last Summer," you're going to be baffled when "Scary Movie" satirizes them. Moreover, if you haven't seen any major blockbusters like "The Matrix," "Titanic," "The Blair Witch Project," and "The Sixth Sense," you'll be puzzled when the Wayans mock them. The Wayans Brothers don't push the envelope on tastelessness, they shred it! Call me a sicko, but "Scary Movie" still kept me laughing the fourth time that I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some kind of classic ... and in the worst possible taste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, inspired lunacy, (ok, so it dips now and again but with a gag rate of about one every 30 seconds what do you expect). What plot there is is basically a rip-off of "Scream" and to a lesser extend "I know what you did last summer", (here it's 'I know what you did last Halloween'), but this crazy spoof also manages to get digs in at "The Exorcist" and "The Blair Witch Project" not to mention such non-genre specific films as "The Matrix" and "The Usual Suspects".Sure it's crude in a frat-boy fashion but it's also very, very funny and a likable and talented cast, (in particular, Anna Faris), display real comic potential. Sequelitis set in early as it did with the "Scream" franchise but not having seen any of the other 'Scary Movies' I can't vouchsafe for their quality or lack of it but this feels like a classic, albeit a classic in the worse possible taste. (It's like an X-rated Mad Magazine spoof brought to life). So yep, Nuno, I have to say - you win again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst of those spoofs with titles that end with "Movie", but still bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, I saw "Epic Movie", which is horrendous, but that didn't surprise me, seeing that it was in the IMDb Bottom 100. Soon afterwards, however, I looked at the IMDb page for "Scary Movie", knowing that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the writers and directors of "Epic Movie", were behind this film as well (they were two of the six writers). I saw that it didn't have a very high rating, but not a low one, either (one well above those in the Bottom 100), I decided to give it a try. However, although it wasn't quite as bad, I have lost all faith in Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's comic abilities, and probably those of all the other writers as well! A group of teenagers (Cindy Campbell, Greg Phillipe, Bobby Prinze, Brenda Meeks, Buffy Gilmore, and Ray Wilkins) all find that their lives are at stake when a masked serial killer begins to stalk them! Last Halloween, while on the road, these six teenagers accidentally hit a man and killed him. Obviously not wanting to be arrested, they have kept this incident a secret. However, it appears that this serial killer may know about it, and that could be why he's after them! With a killing spree happening around town, what are these teenagers supposed to do?! I'm not going to get into the movie parodies in "Scary Movie" and what I think of them (I haven't seen all of those movies). Instead, I will just focus on what this movie is like as a comedy. As such, it's quite bad, in my opinion. I'll admit that unlike "Epic Movie", it did make me laugh or smile a bit at times early on (maybe a bit guiltily), but for the vast majority of it, I did not laugh at all. In fact, just like in "Epic Movie", I saw some terrible scenes that were supposed to be funny, such as the "I went poopy" one, several genitalia gags, and probably others that I can't think of right now, and don't want to! When it's not terrible, it's just boring. I assure you, I am NOT one of those people who hate all movies with this kind of extreme crudeness, it's just that those behind this particular one simply don't know how to do that kind of comedy.Well, I've only seen two of the spoof movies from this decade with a title that ends with "Movie" (all of which Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer had something to do with), but I think I've seen enough. I do not intend to ever watch any of the "Scary Movie" sequels, nor do I intend to watch "Date Movie". It's too bad I didn't watch "Scary Movie" before any of the others. If the rest are supposed to be worse than this one that started it all, seeing it first would have stopped me from watching any of the rest! I don't even understand the 5.8 rating, and I'm sure I never will! Even for those who usually like parody movies and/or offensive R-rated comedies, this could be sorely disappointing!</fullReview>

The ending was fantastic if a little predictable. Shaon Elizabeth was great. Overall it was soo funny and soo cool. Some jokes are bad and some really bad but on a hit/miss basis there is more hits than misses. At some point it can be scary in a weird way. its also quite gory, I'm not going to get into any detail because my reviews are spoiler free but if you watch it you will see.

		<fullReview>Scary movie was a fairly good movie, and I don't regret watching it. it was the first DVD that I ever saw. the jokes are funny in small parts but I think that this film just makes me laugh at the sheer stupidity of it. this was a spoof brought way too far.Some spoofs are funny but only if they are short sweet and to the point. such as how the show Family Guy spoofs on tons of old movies and shows. off subject yes but it proves my point. this movie became basically that perhaps went too far.I never saw scream, but I was a fan of "I know what you id last summer" I found it to be a fairly good horror movie. and though it's spoof was funny (And I know I've said this before) but it was brought out too far.This movie has a rating for adults but a plot line for the immature. this is an overdone movie that the world could have done without. this movie gets a 4 from me. (However, Scary movie 2 was very funny, definitely better than the first but still a bit over done with the spoofs.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a hilarious comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first seen this on commercial i was like i have to see it. So when my brother came to get me to see it in theaters i was excited. It was funny when i realized that they were making fun of "I know what you did last summer", "Scream", and "Blare Witch Project" I like the part when she was in the woods running away from the slasher. Saying "Kenny Kenny move you fat ass, and snot come out and i huge snot bubble. That was funny. It was more hilarious then i thought. I got to say it was funny beginning to end. It kinda got gross in the middle, but ill give it a 9 out of 10. Just for giggles go rent it and watch it. It will make you laugh till you pee your pants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent! I never let my kids watch Scream, but I watched this, and then let my kids watch it. It was that dang good!My favorite part was when he called that girl, and he said, "Where am I" or something like that, and she say's "You're behind the coach. I can see your feet!"This movie took my personal favorite movie, which I don't let my children watch, scream. and made it a comedy! I mean, how funny can a movie get. Even though it does have some bad parts, my kids loved it!NOTE: Cindy Cambell is so hott! But everybody knows she's a knockoff of Sydney Presscott. And that ghostface, looks much better than the ghostface from scream. This movie is fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" is a parody on all those horror- and teen comedy movies like "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and all those others. At least, that's the attempt. The idea is good, it could have been very funny...but the problem is that it isn't funny at all. I've seen several of those movies I just mentioned so I know how it was in the original movies, but the jokes just aren't funny. The only funny thing about the movie was James Van der Beeck's cameo. If you saw "Dawson's Creek" you will certainly agree with me when I say that his short appearance was hilarious! But like I said, that was the only funny thing about the whole movie. There are probably people who liked this movie, but I suppose it just wasn't my 'type' of humour..4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing I thought when I watched this was "What?" Seriously this isn't what you'd call a nice horror and comedy film. It's just plain nonsense. Nothing makes since. Oh they took a few things from a few other movies and placed it in there. What's up with that? This movie was just plain stupid. The villain being drunk? Nope that is not amusing at all. Not to mention that the sequels also took material from other movies and made a twist so horrible that it looked........um what's the word? Degrading. I would not recommend this or it's sequels at all. Watch Scream or something that's cool. This movie doesn't belong anywhere near the shelves of a movie store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scary movie". Very appropriate title. This movie scares the crap out of me because it reminds me about how rancid the movie business has become lately. This is a movie made for those kind of people who were too stupid to understand what "The Naked Gun" series was all about. My favourite hate-object, Anna Farris somehow managed to get the leadrole (I'm pretty sure how, but I can't tell you why, in risk of getting sued), and she manages to screw it up pretty good and she's still the best actor here. The jokes are not only dumb but they're so incredibly lame that it will make you want to burn everyone responsible for this tripe on the stakes. The reason it actually gets a 3 is because it has some funny gags. But then again, there are thousands of movies with better and more jokes. Go watch them instead.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rapid-fire satire, and old-style, hilarious Wayans comedy made this film a gem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A parody of a satire, indeed. Scary Movie tears through the faux-seriousness that boomed in the era of quick-buck teen slasher flicks. Not only are the jokes, gags, and overall performances hilarious, but the film progresses at such a quick pace, never letting a joke or gag die off after a big laugh moment. Now, if they just could have stuck to their promise of vowing not to make a sequel, the terrible parts of 2 and 3 wouldn't have had the chance to taint the original with their bad reputation.If only the Wayans brothers could recapture the hilarity of Scary Movie and In Living Color. Now, they make trash like White Chicks. It's a damned shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A genius movie! The Wayans Bros. are geniuses! They come up with the greatest stuff. If you put together an all-star cast of young comedians plus the funniest spoofs ever, what do you get: The funniest movie ever. You've got young comedians Marlon and Shawn Wayans(Don't Be A Menace...), Jon Abrahams(Meet the Parents), Regina Hall(Malibu's Most Wanted), and Anna Faris(Scary Movie 1,2,3), and veteran comedians Cheri Oteri(Saturday Night Live) and David L. Lander(Laverne and Shirley). Who more do you need to make a successful movie? A great director! Marlon and Shawn's brother Keenan Ivory Wayans directs this ultimate spoof movie, giving off the funniest jokes ever! As I said, this is a genius movie.Even though I love this movie, there is one thing I don't like in this movie: Excess sex jokes! There is no need for too many sex jokes in one movie! It's stupid! The Wayans do the same thing in the sequel; too many sex jokes! I can't stand it!Besides the too many sex jokes this movie was excellent! Anna Faris was funny, Marlon Wayans was hilarious, and Cheri Oteri was funny. That's all a movie needs: very funny people. Final comment: If you have a great sense of humor, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A witless parody of a worn-out genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A successful film parody needs to follow two rules. First, one needs to understand the conventions of the genre one is parodying. The master of this sort of comedy was Mel Brooks; films such as Blazing Saddles and High Anxiety are amusing precisely because he had both a deep knowledge of and a respect for the westerns and Hitchcock thrillers on which they were based.Secondly, one should avoid choosing as the target of one's satire a film genre which does not take itself seriously; in particular, it is hopeless to try and parody a parody. The classic example is the unfunny James Bond spoof Casino Royale, which seems to have been made in complete ignorance of the fact that the Bond films are themselves tongue-in-cheek send-ups of the secret agent genre. A related trap is that of trying to parody a movie which its makers may have taken seriously but which nobody else does. Even Brooks was not immune from this; Young Frankenstein has always struck me as being the least funny of his movie parodies precisely because the old Boris Karloff films on which it is based, although possibly regarded seriously when they were made in the thirties and forties, aged so badly that even by the seventies they seemed like unconscious self-parodies.The `teen slasher' type of horror film is one that is particularly bound by conventions, many of which it shares with the more general high school movie. Scary Movie has its fair share of stereotyped characters drawn from this type of film- the bitchy beauty queen who is dating the meatheaded musclebound jock, the shy virginal girl, the token black characters in an otherwise all-white school (who always date one another because of Hollywood's uneasiness about inter-racial romance), the lesbian gym mistress. Added to this are a list of well-worn conventions- the fact that teenage characters are always played by actors in their late twenties or thirties, the weird mask worn by the killer, the moralising tone whereby the killer's victims are all either sexually active or have some guilty secret, the girl-alone in-a-house-with-the-killer situation.Unfortunately, although the film blazes away at all these targets, it never gets much humour out of them. The reason for this is that the film makers have ignored the second rule of successful film parody. Scary Movie is too obviously based on films such as the Scream series, which was itself an attempt to parody the horror genre, or on knowing, self-mocking TV series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. (To drive home the point, one of the characters is actually called Buffy). The result is that it comes across not as a parody but rather as an inferior copy of those films and programmes. Moreover, even if the film had not been based upon models which are themselves tongue in cheek, it would have been very difficult to have got much mileage out of a parody of this particular genre. In the late seventies and eighties there might have been some point to films such as the original versions of Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street; twenty years later, they have been followed by so many inferior sequels and bad imitations that slasher movies can no longer be taken seriously. No deliberate parody could ridicule the genre more effectively than it has managed to ridicule itself.Deprived of the main source of laughter in any good parody- the contrast between a serious original model and a gently mocking humorous version- the makers of Scary Movie have tried to make good the deficit by relying on crude lavatorial and sexual humour. The result is a piece of leaden witless humour. Those who think that references to breasts, penises or homosexuality are automatically funny will find this film hilarious. Those who don't, won't. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had its moments, but I found too much of the comedy assumes you have watched all the scream movies and all the other lame teen horror of the 90's. So basically, it isn't a stand-alone spoof like Airplane or Top Secret. I have only seen bits and pieces of the scream series, so a lot of times I had to ask what they were making fun of. And what was with all the penis stuff...I don't think you saw one female part, but you saw plenty of the guys. The best part of the movie for me was the front part with Carmen Elecktra in the Drew Barrymore role from the first Scream. Not coincidentally, it is one of those scenes I have seen from the Scream series. The jokes come fast and furious making fun of scenes from this movie and that. Some of the other movies spoofed include "The Sixth Sense" and "The Blair Witch Project". The Witch one was rather good too, but I had seen that movie. This movie is not the best movie ever made, but it is worth a chuckle or two. How it did as well as it did at the box office though is mind-boggling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone remembers when this film first came out (which was so long ago now...boohoo) and everyone probably remembers laughing their asses off. SCARY MOVIE was probably one of the biggest hits in like, forever because everyone wanted to see the most recent parody of recent horror classics like SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. There were also about a million other spoofed films, but hey I can't list them all.I was very happy with the film and I enjoyed it very much. Other people were horribly disappointed by the film and didn't like all the sexual humor. Since that made up a giant part of the movie, that would create a problem.The Wayans Brothers are complete geniuses aswell as the other five or six writers that came up with some of the jokes and created the high laugh factor. The cast was also great. The film is one that looks like it was fun making it, and it is a classic in the parody genre. It is a classic film that will hopefully never be lost in film history...SCARY MOVIE: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a silly movie with some very funny moments but overall it is an amateurish effort that is nothing more but an excuse for a silly sick excuse for jokes referring to private body parts. The Wayans are relatively good but it is just silly overall. The premise is a takeoff on scream and the rest of those teenage slasher movies like I know what you did Last Summer and most importantly scream.The movie has all kinds of gorgeous looking people trying to act funny, and in that respect it does not really work as a satire. It tries to be sexier than it does satirical and it is dirtier than it is satirical as well. The Wayans are more over the top than they are funny but they always are. Overall if you like these silly sick teen movies you will love this one, everyone else I recommend you stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's obviously going to be tough for a movie like this to appeal to me: I maintain that this film is better tailored for American audiences. But seriously, this is really awful. A terrible excuse for a movie.If you're looking for a horror spoof, go with Psycho Beach Party or Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The 13th instead. Both of them are much funnier and don't have the distasteful nasty streak that was present here. The likes of Billy's orgasm scene and Cindy flashing her [somewhat deformed] breasts are some of the many moments in which this Scary movie crossed the fine line between the wearisome and the unwatchable.I could keep going. I could move onto the quality of the acting, the pathetic writing, the failed spoofs (turning The Matrix into Riverdance... what were they thinking?), but I just want this review to end.

It takes all the best bits from Scream (itself a SUBTLE parody of the slasher genre) and I Know What... and mixed it with Airplane and sub-Farrelly brothers humour to produce possibly the most joyless comedy ever. I had more laughs watching The Seventh Seal.It seems strange. The Wayan's brothers had previously made the hilarious I'm Gonna Git you Sucka, an affectionate and funny spoof of blaxpolitation movies.

The movie is really the "Scream" series and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" mixed together for the plot and given the style of "Airplane!" jokes that include silly visuals. This may sound fun but it's a bore. The jokes tired, the acting is pathetic, even if that was supposed to be a joke to show how bad acting has become. If the bad acting was a joke, it didn't work.

		<fullReview>Contains spoilersLet me start by saying that I usually like parody movies like Hot Shots, Naked Gun etc. Then I saw the trailer for this movie and it absolutely blew me (and the rest of the audience) away: it was VERY FUNNY. When I actually saw this movie however, it was VERY VERY poor.That's really a shame, since the movie contains a number of great parodies: "The Matrix", "Amistad", "The Usual Suspects", '"the Sixth Sense", they all get thouroughly and profesionally spoofed. Unfortunately, a lot of jokes are parodies on "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer", and those simply aren't funny. Also, this movies' "plot" is utterly stupid with some of the worst acting and most unlikeable characters ever seen in any movie. Way to many of this movies' jokes are about sex, and almost all of them are distasteful, stupid and offending. The most excruciatingly disgusting joke ever to feature in a movie was also in this one: the East German gym teacher and her "private parts". About half way through, this movie had lost all its appeal and became a burden to watch. For the first time ever, I saw an entire audience dislike a movie judging from the sighs and "oh my gods" after yet another terrible joke. In spite of some good parodies, this movie should be avoided like the plague. 1/2 out of **** stars</fullReview>

This movie doesn't pretend to be anything else other than what it is, plain and simple gags, and in some cases, those gags can be very funny if you have a good memory of what happened in the movies which it was taking the mick out of!(Short spolier here!) There are some moments in the movie tho that made me want to scream because they seem in such bad taste etc. The two major ones were the toliet scene and also "Mrs Man" Showing her private privates scene! I didn't really get the spoof of Mrs Man but with the toliet scene, oh yeh, i got it! I was just left hoping that it wasn't a real "thing" poking outta his ear!Ahh well, this movie was something spectular in my opinion, altho i think that its one of a kind and not something that can be repeated, i hope that the seuqal is something that can be repeated.... 0=]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Rules: Whats with the bad raps on it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think scary movie is one of the funniest films to come out last year. I am sick and tired of the votes that are cast on this wonderful film. Does it really matter that some of its humour is sick and grotesque? Those who say that this movie was awful because of its sick humour have got to be lying!If this movie isn't funny than why did it have my church-going mother in stitches? Lighten up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It either works, or it doesn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether I ever really wanted to watch this film or not was out of the question. I probably wouldn't ever have gone to see it, but it was played during a long coach journey. So I didn't really have much choice about it.It doesn't surprise me that this film is popular, as it has moments of comedy from the beginning to the end. The plot didn't really matter, nor did the characters, or the script, for that matter. It was just supposed to make the viewer laugh, even if it did it in the cheapest ways possible.I suppose that is where the movie falls down. If you find the humour funny, then great, you'll love this, nothing else matters right? But the film fails if you don't find it funny - and I didn't.It did make me laugh three or four times (out of about 500 supposedly funny moments), but even then I wasn't exactly splitting my sides. It simply works like this: If you find this sort of thing comical, then it's worth a look. If your humour is perhaps, a little more intelligent, then stay well away.4/10 - It either works a treat, or falls flat on its face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie is one of those films that looks good in previews, but isn't all that it's cracked up to be when you see for yourself. This film is a spoof on horror films, and uses dirty and prejudiced jokes. There are hardly any parts when i laughed in this picture. "Scary Movie" has a lot of crude jokes which were not funny... but beside the crude jokes, it had good ones as well (like the one joke when the man is on he top of the school building saying he's going to jump, and then the main character comes out and yells out to the killer 'What are you waiting for?' and the teacher says 'what am i waiting for?'and then he gets mad and jumps.) But overall "Scary Movie" is an okay movie. It's not a must-see but its worth watching.I give it ** stars out of ***** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty stupid and unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed about five times, but that could be a generous estimate. I was not counting. I found some scenes to be very funny, but most of them are very tired, old and shockingly stupid. The biggest joke is the 'R' rating this movie got, while an actual MOVIE like 'Requiem for a Dream' gets treated like something that stinks by the intelligencia at the MPAA..I could write a movie where a fart joke is the punchline, so that obviously does not take a genius. The Wayans do not care if I laugh though, I'm a 41 year old white guy and this was written to cater to another audience. Maybe they'll come up with something for me one day, and in the meantime I won't be watching this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The jokes in "Scary Movie" are on the whole so poor that at least one IMDb writer came to the conclusion that the Waylans chose poor jokes DELIBERATELY - in order to make a meta-joke at the expense of people who will laugh at any old rubbish. Let's take this idea seriously for a minute.Yes, I know, but play with me.Meta-jokes CAN be done well. Does anyone remember the "drinking party" episode from the second series of "Blackadder"? The revellers made the most hideously unimaginative double entendres possible, so that Curtis and Elton could make fun of their puerile sense of humour. It worked. The difference between this scene and "Scary Movie" is this: while the puerile jokes in the "Blackadder" sequence were not in the least bit funny, the scene as a whole WAS funny. The Wayanses, on the other hand, throw us a lot of bad jokes - and that's all they do. Even if all these jokes taken together make one big meta-joke, they don't make a good movie.Nor do they make a good meta-joke. Why did audiences titter at all the references to farting, or at the constant reminders that such-and-such a character was gay? Nine times out of ten, NOT because they were stupid. People who managed to laugh during "Scary Movie" by and large laughed out of good will. When one is told a joke one WANTS it to be funny. I found myself thinking, again and again: okay, I came for satire and instead I'm being bludgeoned by "Ha ha, he said the word 'bum'" humour; still, there is SOME satire here and there, and I don't want to be a grouch, so I'll play along." If the Wayanses really WERE trying to make me laugh at bad jokes so that they could make fun of me for finding them funny (N.B.: I'm sure they weren't) ... well, the joke's on them, not me. To the extent that I found the jokes funny at all I was only being polite.And note where the lamest of the lame jokes are concentrated: in the purely functional scenes, the ones in which all the plot exposition takes place. The Waylans clearly have no idea what to do with such scenes. EVERY scene in the film crawls along at exactly the same pace and in exactly the same way; but while the Waylans manage to crack some decent jokes in the horror scenes, in the non-horror scenes, the ordinary dialogue scenes, the standing-around-talking scenes, the Wayanses can think of nothing better to use as padding but irrelevant jokes about gays, blacks, drugs, sex, and alimentary tracts. This would matter less if they could be bothered to think up GOOD jokes about gays, blacks, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but tasteless horror parody/sex farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here's a clever idea, a parody of a satire. `Scary Movie' spends most of its time lampooning `Scream' which was a tongue in cheek satire of horror flicks. It also takes pot shots at various other successful horror flicks such as `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Blair Witch Project'. Unfortunately, this film's cleverness is overshadowed by its bad taste.This is a Wayans home movie, written by Shawn and Marlon and directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans. There really isn't any story, just a succession of skits based sometimes verbatim on various horror flicks. In actuality, this is more of a raunchy sex farce than a horror movie. It has a puerile sexual obsession throwing as much bawdiness as possible into every scene. The jokes are crass and vulgar guttersnipe humor. This is sledgehammer comedy, with everything bluntly stated and no subtlety whatever. Though the slapstick is funny, even hilarious at times, there are so many tastelessly offensive lines that the net result is negative. The Wayans take political incorrectness to its irrational extreme, taking the liberty of mocking just about every group possible with exaggerated stereotypes.The acting is nothing special except for Dave Sheridan as Sheriff Doofy who is worth the price of admission. The direction is also mundane. I must give the Wayans brothers credit for knowing their audience. This film is clearly targeted at the 18 to 25 demographic (in reality probably 14 to 25) and panders mercilessly to their fixations (sex, drugs and sex). It is likely to offend the sensibilities of a large number of people, but after grossing more than $150 million at the box office, the Wayans brothers can shrug that off as irrelevant (a sequel is already in the works).As I watched this film, I laughed hysterically in some parts and I was revolted by others. However, since the good is outweighed by the bad, I rated it a 4/10. Add one point for every year of age under 25. Those who are offended by foul sexual humor should steer clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once you eliminate the sex gags,the potty humor and the gay references,recast half of these characters and readjust the timing and flow of the script, you might just have a much better movie. Oh, who am I kidding, I loved it once I learned to ignore the fact that I was watching male genitalia on the screen. Why is it that girls rarely have a thing to say when breasts are flashed every thirty minutes [maybe they're used to it], but everyone complains when guys flash their,,,,,yuck,oh gross !!! Like Elaine said on "Seinfeld," a man's body is unitalarian [made for working], but the female form is a work of art. Anna Faris is as cute as she can be in this movie, and ought to become a big star, but even I who laughed at most of the scenes can find much to appreciate in this picture. Even still, I still can agree with anyone who can bad-mouth this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never funny! Sometimes disgusting! Always unoriginal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the worst comedy ever made!"Hot Shots!" and "Loaded Weapon" succeeded,... "Scary Movie" tries to join them, but fails miserably. Yes, we find ourselves in the genre of the comedies; and furthermore the comedies that make fun of other films: these are known as parodies.Now, it's not so easy to make a fine parody. Although "Hot Shots!" sets a perfect example of what a good parody should be like; all things considered it's still a risky business."Scary Movie" takes us beautifully through the whole process of how to make a bad parody:First of all: Make sure that almost the entire cast is full of teenagers that can't act and a director that hasn't got a clue what the hell he's doing out there. After all, there is no Bill Murray, Steve Martin or Jim Carrey to save the day.Secondly: make sure 90% of all your jokes are predictable and therefore not funny. The most important rule of a joke by the way, is that it doesn't spoil the funny part. No matter how funny the joke gets on the screen, if you know what is going to happen (because it's been done before), you're not going to find it comical enough to make you laugh. Also, try to make the jokes as disgusting as possible; this should also lower the quality of your film.Third: Try to stick as much to the script of the film(s) you're mocking. This one asks for a further explanation. Every now and then we notice how "Scary Movie" takes over the exact script of "Scream"; leaving us with nothing but a déj?-vu because, in this particular scene, we have to wait too long before the joke is told.People will probably say that I've got it all wrong and that I simply don't like this kind of humor. They're wrong! May I remind you that I really liked (and still do) "Dumb &amp; Dumber" and "There's something about Mary" regardless of one or two daring scenes? The difference between those two films and this one here, is simply the talent that the Farrelly-brothers have AND use on each of their films. They know exactly WHAT KIND of a joke WHEN to use. This is where "Scary Movie" fails and that is why the jokes on this film are ordinary and unoriginal.Please save your money for something that WILL make you laugh, because this film is so bad that it is truly a... SCARY MOVIE!</fullReview>

Some parodies are dull, some are flipping funny, but if you can stand some of the stupid antics, the final showdown between the killer and Cindy is really entertaining (if not too short).

		<fullReview>This movie was "recommended" to me so I hired the DVD. First problem ; it took me 20 minutes to get the film going since the system of menus is so complicated ( I should point out it is a French DVD and French people like to complicate things unnecessarily ). Having found the menu and opted for play movie, I found the dialogue in French, which is not what I wanted ( I mean just can you imagine the dialogue of this film in French ........). Once the movie got going, I wondered what what I d just been wasting half an hour doing ; pathetic jokes, continual references to sex, pricks, ejaculation etc etc. Whilst I like a bit of "dirty" humour, this was overdoing it ! Dialogues were pathetic, half the time they were speaking gibberish. I enjoy horror films, and have seen Scream 1 and 2 and " I know what you did last summer " . This film was a parody of those films like Airplane 1 and 2 parodies catastrophe films. But Airplane 1 and 2 was much funnier, the idea was more novel and the humour was more intelligent and subtle. Scary Movie just overdoes the whole thing and apart from the occasional moment of fun, just gets boring. Of course humour is a very personal thing which cannot be explained. I laughed my head off at "Meet the Parents" half enjoyed "There's something about Mary" but found Scary Movie totally uninspiring because of its lack of finesse and heavy handed scatological and sexual slant. But I quite understand that other people may find it funny because humour is such a personal thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie is the 2000 comedy hit that not only began a line of sequels in its own series, but got a lot of spin offs as well (Date Movie, Epic Movie and the recently released Superhero Movie).I don't know why I did not love this movie. I guess I had the impression that as a teen I would have to get something out of a teen movie, but I guess where I went wrong was watching this expecting something actually really funny and I was let down in that point, 'cause it is really only OK.The movie does have some pretty funny scenes, not any sex jokes really making me laugh like promised by praise by friends and cousins. The good lines came from the randomness. If I may show a bit here that made me laugh...Girl #1: Whats Wrong? She's gone and she is not coming back Girl #2: Face it, she is gone and is never coming back Girl #1: But Ginger was such an important part of the Spice Club...Now that was funny. It was stuff like the small penis scene that did not even get a small laugh from me, and it is partly due to that scene, and the blow job scene really made it hard to watch at times. You can see that some scenes looked really quickly added on just to make it MA like the two previously mentioned scenes. I could go on more about the bad sides about the movie but it is not really as bad as I am making it sound.I know it is not meant to be taken seriously, but I do think that they should not have gotten so lazy throughout the movies at bits. I know that I will probably get some backlash for this comment but I honestly think that Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Summer.Overall, this movie is worth a watch once and that is it. Once again, I will say that half the jokes in this are NOT funny and half of them are very, very funny. I rate this movie 54%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap laughs and not so scary thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard the buzz about this film being a bit crappy, but had to go check it out anyways. I have to admit that I laughed out loud a lot throughout the film. The plot involves Cindy Campell, star of all the previous Scary movie films, moving into a new house. But there are bigger problems than the job of house cleaning, as she soon find out her house is haunted by a little boy. To make matters worse, alien "TrIpods" are taking over the world. How is she ever going to escape this scenario? Scary movie is filled with laughs, but cheap laughs as you would expect from a Scary Movie film, but it doesn't make it not fun to watch. So if you find yourself bored with nothing to do...why not see a funny flick. Definitely entertaining and will pass the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] One evening a girl, Drew Decker, was at home alone. She was making popcorn and getting ready to watch a movie when she receives a phone call from a strange man. He asks her name because he wants to know who he's looking at. Yes, he's sitting in the parking looking at her in a nudie magazine. He soon comes to her house and chases her all around with a knife. He stabbed her and she was hit by her parents' car because her father wasn't watching where he was going. News of Drew's murder spread like wildfire. News reporters all over the school campus. Among them was feisty journalist Gail Hailstorm. A group of friends, Cindy Campbell, Buffy Gilmore, Ray Wilkis, Shorty and Brenda Meeks, Bobby and Greg are also saddened by the loss. Cindy points out that the murder happened exactly one year after a little accident they had. Yes, they had just come from a party and were drinking and making out in the car, not looking where they're going, they hit a shoe! Where's the foot? They soon hit a fisherman. He's not really dead but Greg knocks him unconscious with a liquor bottle so they take him to the pier and toss him in the water. Greg violently makes everyone promise not to mention this to anyone. Back to the present day, Greg is murdered by the killer and is witnessed by Buffy, but when she screamed for help, they thought she was doing a dramatic reading. The killer continued to plague the friends; Gail Hailstorm got information from Special Officer Doofy, a guy who's a few beers shy of a six pack; The killer even attacks Cindy one night and when Bobby comes to her aide, a cellphone and knife drop from his pockets so perhaps he's the killer! But he wasn't. Next, the killer attacks Buffy, who wouldn't shut up, not even when he chopped off her head.  Ray and Brenda go to the movies. Brenda kept talking very loud during the film so everybody in the audience drew knives and stabbed her to death while the real killer relaxed and enjoyed the movie. Finally, there was a big party at Cindy's. The killer attacks Bobby who comes back to life and kills Shorty. Cindy learns Bobby and Ray were copycatting the killer. They kill each other and the real killer escapes, identity still cryptic, but Cindy put the pieces together and found out it was Doofy! He only played a braindead ignoramous. He escapes with Gail. My overall opinion: a very funny movie. Good performances from everyone. The Wayans brothers are here! Keenen Ivory directs. Shawn is Ray and Marlon is Shorty. Also here is Cheri Oteri of Saturday Night Live, Carmen Electra, Rick Ducommunn, and others. The movie contains parodies of Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Blair Witch Project. Scary Movie 2 wasn't very good. I'd skip it if I were you. So in conclusion, if you like horror films and comedy films alike, I recommend this one!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny spoof drowned in vulgarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a spoof of television and slasher films of the late 90's this had potential to be funnier than what it ended up being. The Wayans are funny and talented but they decided to go a little to far into the gutter with a lot of jokes. Do not get me wrong I can understand the need to be raunchy sometimes but here they decided to push it a little to much and it becomes gross instead of funny. Basically the plot follows Scream but it tends to jump to other things and spoofs of other movies. Anna Faris is cast as the lead and target of the killer and she is very good and fits the part perfect. She is the highlight of the film. Carmen Electra also has a funny cameo but it is just at the beginning. Overall it is a good time killer if you do not mind the vulgarity but it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satire of a spoof, or spoof of a satire??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would never have paid to see "Scary Movie." I checked it out of my local library, just to see how bad it is. Critic Ebert gives a pretty accurate review of the film, however I don't rate it as highly as he does. I can understand why some think it is a great film, and I can also understand why some rate it "1". That kind of range is legitimate for a zany film like this.SPOILER - The best part of the film was the character "Doofy" who was patterned after Verbal in "The Usual Suspects." Throughout this film he was the "retard", half-cripple, and at the very end we watch his feet as he begins to walk normally, shed his "Doofy" clothes, and jump in a car with the beautiful girl. He was the slasher!"Dumb and Dumber", "Happy Gilmore", work for me because they make great fun of themselves. In all I didn't like "Scary Movie" because it makes fun of others, of ethnic groups, of gays, of religions, of other films. While a few jokes work, most of them do not. I understand why this movie was made, to satisfy the urge to lampoon things the writers found silly in other films. But it is too dirty to work.</fullReview>

Ratings in Canada were different than the US, and my 11 and 14-year-old attended with my husband and myself. What the trailer did not indicate was the extremely crude and offensive sexual content, far beyond what we considered allowable in a movie rated such as it was. We were thoroughly disgusted, from scenes of male climax to exposed body parts in a bathroom cubicle. We were shocked beyond description, and had much to explain to our 11-year-old in particular.

		<fullReview>The scariest aspect of this movie is that it made it to the screen in the first place, that some people apparently think it is funny and/or worth watching and that some well-known film critics who should have known better actually gave it fairly positive reviews. It is absolutely the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time....the bottom of the barrel.Replete with bathroom humor and tasteless, vulgar jokes throughout the movie, there is something in it to offend everyone. Supposedly a comedy or spoof, it is very rarely actually funny and succeeds primarily in being only boring and repugnant.It is easy to understand why the film industry has been so lowly regarded the past year or two (and feeling considerable financial pain as well) when it puts out dreck like this. Don't bother seeing it...save your money and your time for a movie that doesn't spend all of it's time in the sewer, as this one does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, Scary Movie should not be known as Scary Movie. Probably Perverted Movie. Why, I don't think this is even a movie at all. This has got to be the sickest piece of trash I have ever watched. And I thought Talos the Mummy was bad. This is unspeakably stupid in every way. The plot does not exist because this...thing for no reason switches to a needless sex scene or some other perverted scene just for the sake of putting one there. None of those scenes have any relation to the movie, if it was one. In fact, you might think you are watching a different film when the scene switches abruptly to a sex scene. As for the scenes that satrize films like the Matrix, Sixth Sense, Blair Witch Project and Scream, those were done poorly because the actors genuinely look like they were trying hard but unsuccessfully to imitate the scenes. The actors...are just pitiful. Anyone who would agree to act in such a film is either perverted or in desperate need of money. The acting is the same boring thing every time. For instance: person sees killer, person becomes supposedly "scared" and panics, killer stabs person. Whenever any of the main characters see the killer heading towards them with a knife, its always the same reaction. Their eyes go wide and the go "Oh My God! Its him! Run!" After about 5 times of the afore mentioned it becomes less funny and more stupid and pointless. I've heard a lot of good and bad remarks about this waste of my time. Please, if you're quite sane, save yourself from this sad excuse for a movie. Otherwise, open up and eat the bad trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to this film with great anticipation, having been led to believe it was in the same genre as AIRPLANE and NAKED GUN, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. I managed to catch it on opening night in a crowded theater, which should have ensured an enjoyable evening. However, from the opening scene to the closing credits I did not laugh one time and found myself mildly chuckling at only one or two scenes. For the most part I found this film to be one of the most vulgar, base, puerile, and downright offensive movies I've had the mispleasure of viewing. Had I not been sitting in the middle of a crowded section I most certainly would have walked out on this one -- something I've never done before simply because of a film's stupidity. By far this was the worst big-name film I've ever seen in my life. It's immense popularity deeply troubles me.</fullReview>

Very juvenile, and the bad, groan-inducing jokes outweigh the funny ones by a factor of 20. I mean, were the makers trying to set the cinema record for most fart jokes? I prefer a movie that keeps the number of flatulence gags in single digits. Another gripe-other than a nod here and there, the film was a send-up of Scream only. I would have liked some parody of older horror movies. But thats probably not where this film was targeted. Verdict-Skip if you're over 12.</fullReview>

But this movie was an offensive, misogynist, anti gay, sexist, and completely racist piece of garbage that did nothing but perpetuate stereotypes and beat already low brow, unfunny jokes into the ground. Was it the Wayans intention to promote this level of thinking? I hope so, because at least on one level they can feel a sense of accomplishment.This was one terrible movie. It didnt even seem like a spoof; it seemed like a bad horror movie, and the way they intended. There was very little irony, nor tongue in cheek wit to keep this thing afloat. The humor did not come from characters nor affectionate nods at past horror movies; where did it come from? This movie employed the same countless sketch comedy gags that this director was using 10 years ago in the Near Beer version of Def Comedy Jam meets SNL (In Living Color). The pop culture references will date this movie beyond belief in about oh, I'd say six months, and the sad thing, the references even for today are squandered. The WAAZAAP joke...can you say reshoot?The Farrelly Brothers do gross and somewhat offensive humor; Wayans tried desperately to make the same movie, only his humor came from heavy people and homosexuals, since they are in and of themselves "funny" and rip for the picking (is your sarcasm detector going off? Good). There is a joke about their show, The Wayans Brothers, being cancelled without even having a final episode. Seeing as this movie is a real winner, I can't imagine why is was cancelled.Please, keep Wayans and his youngest brother Marlon I believe (who has a supporting role as a stereotypical pothead and is UNWATCHABLE) away from movie sets. THIS MOVIE WAS HORRENDOUS. In conclusion, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I began watching this film the other night hopeful that I'd get some laughs. However a combination of inept attempts at humour and a rather unpleasant, obnoxious undercurrent soon made this film a chore to watch and I couldn't last the distance without fast-forwarding large chunks of the film. One reason I disliked the film so much was how low its standards were. With the exception of one or two jokes early on, the filmmakers seemed to think that merely making the audience aware they were spoofing a Kevin Williamson-type film was in itself enough to constitute a joke. Secondly, the film seems to have been described as "outrageous" by the LA Times for example but what exactly is so outrageous about this film? All the predictable areas are mined for humour. The only way anyone would think that the film's litany of jokes involving gore/sexual innuendo/cross-dressers/homosexuals/pot-smoking are 'outrageous' are those who haven't seen the 4000 or so films that have used this type of humour in the past. Perhaps, like 'Something about Mary', it's deemed outrageous because it pushes the boundaries of some of these jokes a bit further but it's still a variation on the same joke. After a while, the film's tone is so relentless and obvious that it's easy to see where the next joke is coming from. When I saw an overweight woman have a speaking part later in the film, you knew that there would a joke relating to her weight. As Hollywood deems, only 'the beautiful people' appear at the multiplexes. In reality, 'Scary Movie' is anything but outrageous as it picks safe, obvious targets for humour that won't cause any real controversy. This film is about the same standard as 'Silence of the Hams' from a few years back but due to a few factors (mainly marketing) whereas 'Hams' did zero at the box office, 'Scary Movie' was a major hit.</fullReview>

That is a good thing. Plus it is pretty violent sometimes too, which I always like and the trailer did not show the best jokes at all.

		<shortDescription>Scary Ventriloquism-scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple parody is played straight. It derives from, refers to a source, and caricatures it to the point of ridicule. A more elaborate type of parody isn't in itself funny, but after viewing it you retrospectively laugh at the original, though you might have taken that seriously originally. Political satire often takes this form. It is risky, because the ordinary joe doesn't quite understand retrospective humor. And they usually won't pay to see it.So the Waylons came up with a new formula. They make films that have this ventriloquist humor in it, and add in another type of humor to distract you from what they are really doing. The apparent humor here is juvenile sex jokes. But since all sex jokes are class jokes, the real humor is class humor, goofing on the stupid. The neat trick is that making you laugh at the first, underscores the second. If you are laughing at the dick jokes, the laugh is on you.So, the primary humor here is based on how stupid we are - how stupid the characters are (always choosing the path to death instead of the safe one even when marked by signs); and how stupid we are in being amused by such persiflage. Alone among directors, Waylon can get away with class humor (which is not racial humor) because he gets a free pass as a minority. And he paid his dues. Check out his other work. It is all based on making people laugh at how stupid we are. The dour Spike Lee should be taking lessons.So what this crew does is drag out a bunch of fart and genital jokes. Unlike with Eddie Murphy, the point is not to seriously amuse, but to amuse by not amusing. The worse these jokes are, the more funny the referent, so long as we accept that someone (like Murphy) really does use this stuff, and relative knuckleheads really do laugh at it.Think I'm making this up? Why would they end with the `Usual Suspects?' Not because it is horror, nor because it was juvenile. No, because it was just this sort of sophisticated retrospective reinvention. What you learn at the end completely revises everything you have just accepted. So here we have the scary movie revealing itself not from a dummy (Doofey), but from a master storyteller forcing you to go back and reinvent your perspective on what you just saw. Ventriloquist humor. Clever, but risky, because you are taking money from the people you goof on. (`The Matrix,' also cited here, also danced with this theme in an indirect way. But without the goof on the viewers.)With work like this, Waylon will do more to raise the consciousness of a few than Malcolm X ever could.</fullReview>

I was in the theatre with people from 16-60 and there was not a whole lot of laughter. The humor (apart from the crude sexual bits) seemed to be aimed at 8 year olds. Save your money and wait for the video. Or if you have the premium channels, save the $3 and watch it on HBO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a great time! I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always did love watching "Scary Movie", I'm not really sure why. I think when I just need a good laugh and a movie that doesn't require brains, I love to watch parodies. "Scary Movie" captured that very well with "Scream", "I know what you did last Summer", "The Sixth Sense", "Scream 2", etc. You are guaranteed to have some really great laughs with "Scary Movie".The cast, you can tell, they had so much fun making this movie and it shows. I just loved the scene where they had hit the man on the road making fun of "I know what you did last summer", and Elizabeth Berkley can't find the body but she sees a bloody boot like Jennifer Love Hewitt did in that scene, but instead says "Oh, my God! We hit a boot!". I know that sounds stupid, but it gave me such a good laugh.It has an amusing ending of making fun of The Usually Suspects with Doofy. No, this movie is not for everyone. It does have very crude and sexual humor, but like I said, sometimes when you just wanna let go and have fun, you just can make any movie into a good one. Except for Pooty Tang. :D But I'd recommend this for a good laugh and for a fun time with your friends.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More miss than hit and with a limited shelf life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a teenager is murdered in a small town, it is only the beginning of a murderous spree. One group of teenagers in particular are targeted as the killer claims to know about a man that they accidentally killing exactly a year ago.Inexplicably on it's third instalment, I figured that I must have given the series a raw deal by never watching any of it, so I went out to get the first movie and watch it. My lasting impression will be of a film that is more miss than hit - never a good thing in spoofs. All the best spoofs have miss-fires but the secret is to keep the gags coming so fast that it doesn't matter. Here however the gags aren't consistent and rely more on a mix of specific movie spoofs and some very crude jokes that aren't funny. It does have laughs in it but a film such as this lives and dies on it's laughs and this film needed more - far too often I was left waiting for a laugh.While the film does have laughs, it relies heavily on impersonation of other films rather than out and out jokes. While this is good in some regards it is mostly quite lazy and also gives the film a limited time where it is fresh and funny. For example, as these films fade from memory, so the jokes will become less funny or relevant. The best example of this is the Matrix spoof; I'm sure on release it was topical and original and drew many laughs, but seeing it now it just seems old - so many others have done it by now and it just seemed obvious rather than funny.The cast are OK but they are very wide characters and none of them really have the spoof ability of, say, Leslie Nielsen. The Wayans brothers are actually OK and seem happy to send themselves up. Marlon is not that good, just playing a junkie type but Shawn conveys himself as gay and makes light of his show being cancelled. Hall is cute and funny - her depiction of a black woman in a cinema may be slightly generalist but it is spot on! The rest of the cast are average - none of them stand out but they just about manage to do what the material requires of them (which ain't much).Overall this film has just about enough laughs to justify watching, but if you haven't seen the crop of teen slashers made around the time then you'll often not get the jokes. Sadly though, it is more miss than hit (with some crude `cum'n'dick' jokes being more unpleasant than funny).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst of the spoof genre but not too great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is probably the first of all these '(Insert here) Movie' spoofs which usually mock a certain genre with a bunch of gags so inept, so pathetically juvenile and so harrowingly unfunny that if they weren't also vulgar and offensive they could have been written by a class of 5 year olds. This is one of the first in the notoriously unsuccessful spoof genre. But, believe it or not, this one is perfectly OK. The jokes are hit and miss, but when they hit they are genuinely funny. The film feels considerably less desperate than many spoofs and is (slightly) less juvenile. It's extremely low and earns its 18 certificate with ease, but the vulgarity isn't always completely mirthless. It is offensive, but manages not to overstep the line. It is admittedly quite funny at times. The reason why my rating isn't higher is because not all of the jokes work, it can be very annoying and leans too heavily on crude jokes. The thing which really irritates me about Scary Movie is its spoofing of Scream, which was itself a parody. This is not the level of The Naked Gun, which is my favourite comedy ever, or Airplane, and does run out of gas before the end but this represents a partially successful parody of horror movies which at the very least is funny sporadically and is miles better than the cinematic wasteland of Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighten up and enjoy it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the various teen horrors's of the 90's and early 2000's, what else is better than to completely lampoon them in ridiculous style. Coming from a comedy styling much like that of films such as "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" but much more crude, comes Scary Movie, with it's jokes that are completely insane and plot that well, doesn't really make sense a lot of the time. I thought before I watched this that it looked like a movie I simply wouldn't like, but it surprised me, it is far far from perfect but still, a funny movie.It's all based around the fact the our main characters killed a man a year before and someone is out to get them all, but who?. Of course the story is just a rip off of "Scream" but that is the whole point, in fact at various times throughout it is alluded to. The narrative plays out like a child had tried to write a film but then some guys called the Wayans brothers came in and added some rude joke to the pot, oh and on that point about pot, well watch it and you'll see what I mean.The cast has people such as Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Shannon Elizabeth and of course Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans who all could of destroyed their careers here. I did though enjoy the cast, they mix the right amount of humour into the bad acting that when by the end, you don't know if they couldn't act or not. One of my favourite characters from this is Shorty played by Marlon Wayans who's stoner comedy is hilarious and makes some scenes truly laugh out loud. And on the point of laugh out loud moments, the scream masked murderer is hilarious, watch out for when their mask changes facial expressions, just very funny. That all said about the jokes, the film can be near hit and miss. It is true probably that this is way too crude and stupid to be OK but I felt it is, it's enjoyable, doesn't overstay it's welcome and as mentioned before, can have laugh out loud moments too. Sure the Wayans don't always make the best decisions in film and when your film has Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer co writing it, you may expect your movie's reputation to drop really low. A thing I think the Wayans do well here though is mix the crude with genuine jokes, not only is it a good parody of slasher movies, but can turn serious moments into hilarious ones in a second.Now who might like this movie, well of course this is right up some people's street when it comes to comedy, it's the kind of movie where you might expect a critic to recommend this to teens. The truth is though that teens or well maybe people who were teens when all these horror movies were around, will really enjoy it and probably laugh(well at least I hope as if you don't laugh at this there isn't much else to enjoy). Don't just watch this like you expect it to be bad, give it a go and like me you might be surprised how funny you found it.Overall a movie I personally found kind of OK, maybe wrestled with my thoughts a little as to whether it was pretty so-so but I think all in all it is funny enough to be mostly positive stuff. Wouldn't really say people who consider themselves "connoisseurs" of fine comedy would enjoy this but to the hell with most comedy, this is stupid enough to be fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neve Campbell sums it up best (and she's not even in the movie)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you don't know, Scary Movie is (primarily) a parody of the first 'Scream' film (although there are plenty of other horror movies made fun of). It was in Scream 4 when Neve Campbell declared, "Don't **** with the original." Since Scary Movie has been made, not only has it spawned several sequels, but a whole range of other parody movies from the same studio. There may be a few chuckles to be had from its successors, but none can compare to the first.Scary Movie is a very rare example of a parody movie that's actually funny. Yes, you may have to have watched (or at least be very familiar) with Scream to fully appreciate it, but I'm guessing that if you're thinking of watching a parody of a horror movie then you've probably seen the original horror movie first.The jokes come thick and fast, but they are pretty 'low brow' and most involve pratfalls or 'gross-out' gags, so you have to have your humour appreciation meter set to 'gutter.' So, if you've seen Scream and feel like watching basically the same movie again (as Scary Movie does tend to follow the original source material scarily closely), but with more - dirty - jokes, then give this one a go. It's by far the best of the series (although I found part 3 quite amusing, too).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Scary Movie' is a straight-out comedy, a spoof just like 'Airplane' and 'Top Secret' and 'Hot Shots!' and the only way to review it is to report whether you laughed or you didn't and in this case, I didn't laugh all that much.The movie pokes fun at the recent slew of horror movies like 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' by presenting a lot of visual gags, one-liners and tasteless sex jokes (there are a lot of those).The major jabs in the movie are at the expense of Wes Craven's 'Scream' series, that acclaimed (but I think over-praised) movie about kids who know their horror movies. I like some of the gags, like a moment when one character brings up the fact that, most high school kids in horror films are played by actors who are pushing 30.The movie was directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, the creative mind behind television's 'In Living Color' and the film 'I'm Gonna Git You Sucka', a very funny spoof of 70s blaxploitation films. There, the jokes were creative, and came out of the energy of the actors and their knowledge of the genre. But 'Scary Movie isn't much more then a long series of silly gross-out gags.Most of the time the set-ups for the laughs take too long and continue on long after the laugh has dried up. Here, the smaller jokes work better then the big ones. I liked the take on 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' when the kids run over a man in the street and try to figure out what to do with his body. Meanwhile they don't notice that he is standing behind them brushing himself off.Maybe I'm not the audience for this movie. Most of the jokes are gross sex jokes about bodily functions. It didn't work in 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' and it doesn't come off well here. I don't know, I just didn't have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scatter shoot jokes from the Wayans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wayans brothers bring a horror spoof based somewhat on the Scream movies. It also spoofs every TV and movie that the Wayans could get their hands on. The biggest question should be 'is it funny'. The answer is yes more than no. It starts with a funny opening with Carmen Electra. Anna Faris is adorable as Cindy Campbell, and is best when playing dumb.The movie is very scatter shoot with its humor. It leads to some hilarious jokes but also some groan worthy stupidity. Not all jokes work and definitely not for everybody. The scatter shoot approach should get some laughs from everybody. The best has to be when they inject some black people humor into the lily white Scream franchise. It takes the similar path as Zucker's Airplane without the cohesive story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before spoofing was the cool thing to do, this was one of the better one's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Minor spoiler*Scary Movie is far from a laugh riot, but it does contain many amusing scenes, which is something most spoofs fail to do. I wouldn't say I'm a fan of the sequels, but a couple of them are at least tolerable, which is something I can't say for a lot of other spoof films. Scary Movie spoofs movies such as Scream (Obviously) I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, among others. Dewey from Scream being spoofed as Doofy (a mentally challenged deputy was borderline offensive, but I did get a couple of chuckles from it) It helps that we have such a winning lead in Anna Farris. (Cindy Campbell?GENIUS!) This girl goes all out in making a fool of herself and plays it STRAIGHT! I give her all the credit in the world for portraying this role and making it as memorable as it is today. She's kinda cute in her own way as well. The Wayan Brothers do their usual thang. You'll either love them or hate them. I was personally in the middle. Shawn Wayans is the one I enjoyed the most. The dude is too cool for school. Marlon Wayans is amusing at times, and annoying at others. Jon Abrahams is pretty amusing as Bobby. He does a pretty good Skeet Ulrich impersonation. Regina Hall is involved in one of my favorite scenes, and she had me chuckling. She is good as Cindy's friend. Shannon Elizabeth is smoking hot and very easy on the eyes. She plays a b*tch very well. Lochlyn Munro plays a jock very well. Not much of a stretch for him. The best thing about this film is probably the twist ending, and I howled for it. Final Thoughts: It's not a laugh riot as I said, but it is often funny and amusing, and that's all my arse cares about these days. I've seen it at least 4 times now and it always gets the job done. If you want a good spoof movie, this is a pretty solid choice.6.5/10</fullReview>

The take off on "I know what you did lat summer" is spot on. Of course Shannon Elizabeth is her usual hot self and acts well enough. Carmen Electra's role, basically an opening scene cameo, is hilarious as they pan another horror movie, and I love when she gets stabbed and pulls out a breast implant and throws it away. To me that shows a lot of self confidence and she is comfortable with the fact that she had breast enlargement. Pretty cool actually.

		<fullReview>This movie is a spoof of the horror films and it's worth watching for kicks and laughs along the way. The whole film is absurd at times but entertaining most of it. I saw the television edited version which probably meant that some of it was probably best for me. I would have turned it off if I saw something gross and there were moments which I can't mention that was low bathroom humor style. If you like the bathroom style humor, you'll love this film. The Wayans brothers directed this and if you watched "In Living Color" series, you will know what I mean. We see him in the film although briefly. I love the spoofing in the high school. Cheri Oteri plays a hungry news reporter. Kelly Coffield plays a teacher. The story is typical spoof of a who did it. If you can stomach the humor, you will be fine.</fullReview>

I can't say the same of the other Scary Movie sequels, but the first and second are awesome. The writers are brilliant at stringing together all the different movies they make fun of and make them work as one big plot. Anna Faris's claim to fame is due to these movies and I love watching her on screen. She seems to get tired of it after the second, and who can blame her? The third installment seems tired and running out of good lines. This movie is good for teenagers, scary movie addicts, stoners, alcoholics, and 90's era lovers. Highly recommend for a bit of light hearted fun! Also remember that this movie is not intended to be a family movie and if you are sensitive about your kids (or even certain adults) viewing this movie, please don't do it.</fullReview>

It tells of teenage girl, Cindy Campbell (Faris) and her friends getting stalked by a goofy killer. M. Wayans plays pot-smoking teen, Shorty Meeks, S.

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece, but a mindless entertaining spoof of horror movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very easy picking out some comedies that you like. Films like "Airplane" and some of Mel Brooks parody movies including "Spaceballs" and "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" were great examples of making me laugh my head and butt off at the same time. So, when I heard that Davd Zucker plans to make a spoof of horror movies, I saw this on my laptop and boy did I had a great comedic experience.There are two problems that I do have with this film. There are times where it gets pretty rushed and some of the humor is a lot crude. With those problems out of the way, everything else turned out pretty good. The acting is amazing. Marlon Wayans, although annoying, wasn't that bad and Anna Faris did a pretty good job as the heroine. The parodies of Scream, The Sixth Sense, and other horror films including "I Know What You Did Last Summer" were clever and are a lot funnier that I've ever imagined. The best part is where a woman keeps talking out loud while everyone else is watching a movie in theaters quiet was so hilarious!It also has a very decent story and I liked the concept of parodying horror flicks that we've known about. The script is mostly witty, funny, and all-out hilarious! The soundtrack is also pretty good with most of the songs as my favorites.Overall, not a masterpiece, but Scary Movie is a mindless entertaining spoof of horror movies! Thumbs up!</fullReview>

Keenen Ivory Wayans had an excellent cast and one of the funniest plots ever; he and his brothers satirized some of the famous movies back in 2000. Even thought I believe this is the less funny out of the 4 scary movies, I must admit this is still pretty good. Cindy Campbell is a classic character that people won't ever forget, and you see, in this picture she still didn't have the big attention she has in the following versions-- she becomes the main role after this picture. All in all, this is a refreshing film that everyone should see, specially for making fun of the awful "I Know What You Did Last Summer"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scream took a certain kind of idolatry and played around with the rubric. This was far from novel of course but it was fresh at that level and that was enough.The next natural step was this. Even more abrasive sex but now modeled as a joke after the Zucker films, violence forced to be as ludicrous as an ordinary slasher made excuses about, and the whole horror setup conspiratorially staged as a farce together with the viewer. This means the viewer is trusted to be in the know well in advance, for example that this is going to parody the Scream franchise.So key moments in The Shining, The Exorcist, The Blair Witch Project, The Matrix, of course Scream, that were either chilling or inspired awe in their context, are rendered here as inane giggling between stoners.So of course an audience erupts in applause at the slutty bimbo's awful performance which is her being punished with murder, another murder is actually a collaborative effort between irate viewers inside a cinema, while the actual murderer is pulling a fast one over everyone's heads and is actually the smartest of the bunch.The whole point here is something that you laugh together with because it lampoons the manipulable viewer in you, and let's face it, that guy who was awed by wire-fu acrobatics in The Matrix or felt shivers at REDRUM, in retrospect, is a pretty goofy guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film, so much so that I have watched it three times in the past two days. I found it hilarious because it is exactly my humour but I think films like these are completely hit and miss. I hadn't seen scream at the time but then went on to watch it and found that the films are so similar! I thought that the idea of the whole 'I know what you did last Halloween' was funny. I found that Anna Farris delivered a hilarious performance but I also really liked Buffy's character. Some bits were a bit inappropriate for my age but other than that I would say Scary Movie is hilarious but approach with caution if you don't find toilet humour or sexual humour funny. I would give it a 9.5/10 and say it is suitable for anyone 14-15+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For every joke that hits the mark, another one misses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of (****)"Scary Movie". What was once hailed as a modern classic in the realm of parody, is now a faded memory. And... I could see why. The 2000 gut-buster is actually pretty funny in some areas. The director realizes the typical horror clichés so he mocks those, sometimes intelligent, other times not. But see, that's just it. For every knee-buckling gag, there's also a tired one. That's why I'm so disappointed in "Scary Movie". It has the potential to be there, but it never reaches that point.What jokes work? The ones that wink at the horror downfalls without going in for the kill. Subtle, yet effective. Which ones don't? The gags that involve sex, racist stereotypes, utter stupidity, and homosexuality. Now I'm no prude, and with these subjects the humor could've still been there, but the way the jokes are handled are very child-like and quite painful.All in all, the 2000 Wayans concoction isn't a bad one, but it could've been better. About half of the jokes work, but the other half don't. And you know, that half does count even if you think it doesn't. This might not be a "Meet the Spartans", but it sure isn't any "Airplane".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so Scary Movie may have virtually no plausible plot line, which jumps around and bends purely for the jokes. Technically, it is absolutely terrible. But there is just something about the Wayans that makes it absolute comedy gold! It is a spoof of mainly scream and a few other horror films, and it just does the perfect job of tearing them to shreds. The ghost face killer is no longer going to make teenagers shiver, but rather fall on the ground p***ing themselves laughing and reminiscing this fantastic comedy. The scene where ghost face killer gets high with shorty is one of my personal favourite comedy moments.If I have to point out one or two flaws, firstly, this is not for everyone. The humour is as crude as it comes (haha, cums), and not every attempt at laughs pull it off. However, the humour is so often, that you are ;laughing at least once every minute. One last miner nag is that this is a boys film, and if you are a girls or a boy on your own, you will not find this movie nearly as funny without all your mates round. That goes for all the scary movies, and indeed most immature comedies. But overall, this is a landmark comedy, an icon to most black, white and every other comedy fan that was from the era and generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American junk food for cinematic lunatics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that one shouldn't take this kind of movies too serious and the main public of this kind of films might still be twelve year old boys and girls that are excited to see a movie with many sexual allusions, exaggerated gore scenes and absurd slapstick humour.The problem that I have with this movie is that the jokes are permanently repeated and quite superficial. You can laugh about fake oral sex scenes in the beginning but when it turns out that every pun of this movie is orientated towards this, it gets quite silly, boring and even somewhat embarrassing. Another bad point is that there are not that many movies that get parodied by this film so that it stays quite one-dimensional all the time and mainly focuses on two well known movies ("Scream" and "I know what you did last summer"). A little bit of diversity would have been more dynamical, funny and enjoyable. The last bad point is the really atrocious acting. The characters are mostly so ordinary and boring that you can't even laugh about them. The next parts of the series have done a better job and included some truly gifted actors like Leslie Nielsen for example.Nevertheless, this is a short and entertaining movie made for parties to have some good laughs in a good company and where it doesn't matter if you are drunk, stoned, chatting, gone fishing or simply falling asleep during the movie and miss some bits here and there. It somewhat because of those curious twelve year old teenagers that this has become a cult movie as I know many better parodies in that key like "The naked gun" or "Wrongfully accused" but there have also been movies that have been worse like "Epic Movie" or "Meet the Spartians". This is pure entertainment, but nothing groundbreaking or truly interesting. I would call it typically American junk food for the cinematic lunatics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie is the start of a bunch of hilarious spoof movies that are the all time best from 1-4. Even though I really liked this one, the last two were the best. But this is where it all got started. Obviously this movie spoofs Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer with a little Matrix added in.The plot is pretty hard to explain because it's a spoof. But the basic points are a group of teens are trying to a avoid a ruthless killer in a mask.Now there are many hilarious scenes. I loved the ones with the Scream guy. He just made things funny as he tried to kill people. Anna Faris is funny as the girl who doesn't have a clue about life.Overall, this is a good spoof that had plenty of laughs. Since some spoofs are now pretty bad maybe that affected my rating. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Airplane created a template for spoof movies - take a movie genre and an absolutely standard plot, take a scattergun approach to gags, and see what happens. Airplane set the bar high - so high, in fact, that few spoofs since have come near it.Scary Movie comes near. It doesn't reach it, but it's a fair attempt.Using as a template the recently successful Scream movie by Wes Craven, but cramming in references to every other movie which is halfway relevant (and a fair number which aren't), Scary Movie offers a mixture of sight gags, plot gags, dialogue gags, movie reference gags, in fact every type of gag you can think of. Not all of them succeed (I tended to lose patience with the stoner gags, for instance), but enough of them work to enable the movie to be marked a success.And it is fair to comment that far, far worse was to follow.It is also fair to note the movie as being Anna Faris' break-though film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A killer comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It truly is a killer comedy. A timeless, hilarious masterpiece! 10 years on and it is as still as funny as ever, i remember watching this when i was young in 2000, to tell the truth i didn't understand much being at such a young age! But i took the liberty of buying the DVD as i walked passed it a couple of days ago and boy did it bring back funny memories.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans accomplished exactly what he wanted to do; A laugh-out-loud spoof of horror films. (including the scream saga)Ignore the low ratings and the criticism, people are mistaking this for what it's actually worth, a brainless, pointless, stupid and absolutely hilarious comedy. And that's all it is to it, don't expect a high budget comedy (that to me, usually attend to be very successful with high ratings but not funny at all, makes no sense?) This world needs more spoof movies like the 'Scary movie saga' even though the latest attempts at it (such as Epic movie, Superhero movie, Disaster movie) have been Epic failures due to the Certification (all being 12A) The actors did incredibly well the Wayans brothers, who were hysterical and arguably them at there best. This movie was directed at just the right audience, it knew exactly what it was out for, being rude and over the top at times. Okay so it's no way near to be Oscar material or anything like that, but that's not what it's for!It's rude, crude and stupid. But most importantly it's a definite spoof classic, without Scary Movie the spoof industry will be dead. If your one of the million that haven't yet seen it, do yourself a favour rent or buy it (as it should be very cheap!) and with a OPEN MIND, when your in the mood for pointless laughs, kick back with a can and watch! Ignore the low rating, definite recommend it your a Wayans fan. If you don't like it then well you can't like every movie you've seen!</fullReview>

I think if you are a child up to 12-13 years old it is understandable, some of the violent scenes might be too rough for a child though.I can't believe people class this as one of their best movies all time (any genre) Bad acting, lousy script, failed cheesy humour. (Watch fletch instead, cheesy but funny as hell and good script) I didn't laugh any second in this movie and I am not that hard on movies even if I prefer deeper movies. I like zoolander and it can be a bit too immature but it is still funny.A message to IMDb crew. unmature is the same as immature it just sounds better. Neither is humour. You can spell it humor or humour. You must be bored as hell to watch this.This is just naked gun &amp; hot shots revisited in the horror genre.I hope they give up soon with the sequels.There are no spoilers from my side, you know why? I forgot it right after I saw this.I am sounding like a troll, but trolls like movies like this.I saw that nobody wrote a thread about how bad this movie is but people always write thread and criticize good movies like ninth gate.Sorry, but this really grind my gear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the bombardment of horrid spoofs, I didn't think it possible to get even close to the two best classics of spoof: 'Airplane!' and 'Naked Gun' and then came the genius 'Scary Movie.' I just recently watched the 'Scream' trilogy again, and it was so hard to watch parts 1-2 due to remembering all the lines/scenes from 'Scary Movie;' it made me laugh out loud when I suppose 'Scream' was supposed to be frightening, even for a bit. After now watching 'Scary Movie' for probably the 12th time, I still laugh hard. And though it was not perfect, only a slight few of the gags were silly/bad ('Dawson's Creek' bleah). The rest were ingenious. Plot line: it didn't just follow the events of 'Scream' (and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and others) it completely mimicked the sets, scenes and even dialogue. They even point that out. And as much as I liked 'Scream,' when they point out major plot-holes and corny dialogue, I have to actually rethink my review of 'Scream.' (All the way through 'Scary Movie,' I kept thinking, "Oh, yeah, they're right, that part was bad.") And even though they were set out just to make a spoof, the acting, the spirit and depth was actually performed by these actors. Farris, both Wayans, Elizabeth, everyone, actually were excellent in their roles and really gave it their 100%. The lines were fantastic, and quoted by me and my friends for the longest time following. The creativity of the set-ups and even the background gags were hilarious. (Heck, even their names.) I don't want to ruin too much of the movie, it's clear that I highly recommend this movie for horror/comedy/spoof buffs. Honestly, 'Airplane!' still ranks as my favorite comedy, but this comes in close, at least in the top-5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' will never be the same again after you watch 'Scary Movie'.Just like the Austin Powers movies made fun of the James Bond movies and 'Superhero Movie' made fun of the superhero genre, 'Scary Movie' takes the slasher genre and totally turns it upside down.There's really nothing complicated about, since it's basically 'Scream' with more humor, lots and lots of humor.It sets a new standard for gross-out humor that really shouldn't be hated by people who say that it's just gross and unwholesome.If Roger Ebert liked this movie, which he did, then it's surprising that so many people dislike this movie.Are people starting to lose their taste in movies or is the director trying to hard to make people laugh? If I'm giving this movie a good review, then there's no point in telling you which question is correct.Here are three tips that you should know:1) Don't take this movie too seriously. 2) It's a comedy, not a slasher movie. 3)TRY TO HAVE FUN.Be sure to check out the sequels as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the spoof movie seemed to live a quiet life for quite some years, Scary Movie did resurrect it. Seeing what movies it brought us, it should be charged. But let's stay focused on this movie. A movie which makes fun of ... well "Scary Movie"(s).As a basic storyline "Scream" is being ripped off, which originally was called, yep you guessed it: "Scary Movie"! While it tries hard to get as many laughs as possible out of that concept, it is doomed to fail (in my eyes) from the get go. Spoofing a movie, that is already a funny/cynical take on the horror movies, doesn't really quite work as good as it should. In contrast to classics, such as "Airplane!", where the object/movie that's being spoofed took itself seriously, "Scream" was meant to be funny. So how many jokes can there be? Well not that many, because other movies (or TV Series) get dragged into the mix. Unfortunately it never really hit a high point (one of the best things is the "Wassup" call) with me ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A way too rambling comment that honestly does try to keep to the point. V1.01</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amanda Bynes is not in any of this series. After Hairspray and She's The Man I had felt a need to get to know her other work and, me being a big baby, I did feel a longing to love such as her first ever feature, Big Fat Liar, real wow baby stuff there, just there is some scary stuff too. I am finding Amanda's stuff to mostly end in a way that I can find to be scary and I was wondering how to find a way to more fully love that when I found that I had a vocation to have another look at Scary Movie I and 2. I got that vocation by finding disks of the last two features in this series. * Used to be I found Scary Movie the first to have lots of high comedy but lots of putridity too. I was coming at this from a background of long term religious fundamentalism so the queasiness should be no surprise. Those who hoped to do things by the book in the 90's risked getting heavily mangled and distorted. Scary Movie 2 turned the pressure up on that, the exorcist scene was too strong. The servant is too difficult too, as an ex religious fundamentalist I do know that everyone should feel a duty to give one's neighbour a big helping hand? June 2009 I was looking at all of the Scary Movie features and yet this one I did not bother. Scary Movie 3, difficult. Me having a love for The Ring, this seemed, at first, to be the special one. Except have you noticed how the transgendered are portrayed? Even the clergy fare better. I have watched 3 a few times but it really is not my choice of viewing. Except Cindy is so cute, this role maturing through the four features. The feel of the humour is often so different in 3 and such as the 8 Mile battle, vomit excepting, took a while to accept as having anything to do with humour. As if 3 has big chunks of the fun humour of the first, but mixed with a sort of emptiness and alienation, given my own particular taste. Sympathies to Clinton, the only US president who, from a distance, seemed to be a real person. Scary Movie 4, following in the footsteps of 3. The difficulties that I had in 3 are there in 4. The transgendered one is portrayed as in Natasha Lyonne's Trickbaby, an impressive feature but the transgendered one is definitely a baddie. Religious fundamentalists get a roasting here too, though there is a gem of a toilet joke. The positive aspects that I could experience in 4 were mostly because of Cindy, Anna Faris in that particular role. I have noticed that some others have also noted that in their user comments re the series. Rachel stands out for me too, she is the girl who has a role similar to the girl in 3, just Rachel is heavily influenced by Jodelle Ferland of Tideland (2005)? Other comments are more likely to mention Brenda instead. I have since seen Fanning in War Of The Worlds and that actually made me find a love for Scary Movie 4, while I still do not like a lot of it I prefer it to the Spielberg. * Those who deal with perceived target classes can feel pure about raining in a special sort of way, churn o' ville. This takes some modern target classes and vomits on us. So, the rest of the characters are diseased too. There is a nice bit of kiddie humour re the Hamish in M.K&amp;A's witness protection feature Our Lips Are Sealed but I should be shocked that they get the treatment that they do in Scary Movie 4. So now I have seen all of this series a few times, each. I can enjoy chunks of most of them if I only watch them rarely. There really is some magnificent humour here. Just there is that other side. I also, so far, mostly like it that favourite movies are quoted. I can definitely like it that Cindy and Buffy G quote two Rose Byrne movies, Frank and Wicker. The enigma of Amanda Bynes. Still to be resolved, though the spirit is typically more comfortable than the Scary Movie series. Big Fat Liar is the most difficult Bynes, for me, but also the best. I am more at the level of Mary-Kate and Ashley. Their Double, Double Toil And Trouble, a scary movie but no problem in lapping it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the endless, utterly moronic ". . . Movie" films flooding theatres on a regular basis with their particular brand of "parody" and non-existent humour, it's easy to forget how genuinely funny and fresh the one that started it all was.The humour is of course very stupid, very base, and very crude but it mostly works, with the dialogue being just as funny as the plentiful sight gags. The performances are generally spot-on - star Anna Faris being the standout in a turn that isn't exactly a tour-de-force but is cute and perfectly suited to the material - and the parody works.There are one or two hints of things to come with the random Riverdance moment and the Budweiser commercial spoof but this one sticks to the gameplan and is frequently very funny indeed.</fullReview>

Sure they've got the silly, unspeakable characters, all the sexual, religious and racist humor; but it turns out to be quite funny and overall very enjoyable. The movie takes characters from successful horror flicks such as Wes Craven's Scream and the realistic Blair Witch Project, and semantically turns it into very silly and stupid characters. It's wickedly funny, rather stupid at times, but still overall enjoyable.

		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" is a movie that parodies many scary movies, mainly "I Know What You did Last Summer". It follows a group of teens, most of them dying by the end, who are being killed by someone masked like the killer in "I Know What You did Last Summer".Unlike most parodies that aren't in this franchise, this is not a tongue-in-cheek parody. Tongue-in-cheek parodies mock the original, but still stick with whatever theme they are parodying, "Shaun of the Dead" is one. But Scary Movie is just stupid.One big complaint I have is that it doesn't really point out any stupidities in the movie it parodies, it just uses really immature humor that doesn't mock Last Summer at all. The only thing they really pointed out is the odd plot in Last Summer, or the sequel, I forget.I give this film a three out of ten, since it's not some ungodly abomination sent to Earth my Satan's little helper, but it still sucks big time.</fullReview>

Maybe the next one will be R-rated.Scary Movie is basically a spoof of slasher horror films, mostly Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.All the Scary Movie's are like that, spoofing popular horror films.The plot of the movie is basically like all other slasher films, there is a killer on the loose who is killing all the friends of this one girl.So now she must stop him before she is next.Pretty much the same story as the others, but this film cleverly spoofs those other slasher films.Scary Movie is a very funny movie and I recommend watching it if you want a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immaturity at its most prevalent. But so funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is packed to the rafters with immature and potentially offensive jokes to nearly every society that we can imagine. Yet it still remains hilariously funny in its own way.The performances, made deliberately terrible are the most fantastic of all the laughs and it makes itself as a great parody.Whilst Scream was a pretty average slasher flick, with pretty average characters, Scary Movie is a pretty average comedy with intensely funny characters; sometimes the gags go a little over the top and you wonder to yourself, why in gods name are you watching this heap of trash, but all in all, not bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When an teenager (Carmen Electra) got murder by a crazed killer.An year earlier, When a bunch of teens (Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Jon Abrahams, Regina Hall, Shannon Elizabeth and Luchlyn Murno) accidentally killed a man in the road. Now the crazed murderer knows their secret, they keep-ed. Now he's going to kill them, one by one, ending their stupid little lives.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans (I'm Going Git You Sucka, Little Man, A Low Down Dirty Shame) made an very funny spoof, based on popular slasher films like "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and countless different movies genres. This was actually an Surprise Blockbuster in the Summer of 2000. The cast are likable and it has some memorable gross-out gags as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD extras are a brief behind the scenes featurettes, deleted scenes and DVD-ROM Content. This was certainly a new look for comedy spoofs movies in a big way. Although this is not for all tastes. Followed by Three Sequels. This must have been a difficult script to write, since it was written by Six Writers! James Van Der Beek, David L. Lander and the director appears in amusing cameos. Super 35. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Start of the End of Parody Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie (2000, Dir. Keenen Ivory Wayans)StoryA group of teenagers including Cindy Campbell and Bobby Prinze, accidentally hit a man when driving, and dispose of the body, but now they are being stalked by a very recognisable masked killer. The victim count increases, whilst Cindy must survive the carnage that has she has seen in so many films before.ActorsAt the time of the release, many of the stars featured in 'Scary Movie' are young and very unrecognisable among the audience. They don't do a bad job in it and really fit into the world of parody films. They seem to fit in so much that at times, they do seem a tad bit annoying, but for the tone of the film they seem suitable for it. Music'Scary Movie' is simply a parody of horror films, and it only seems right that the music of the scenes fits the film in which it parodies. The films which it's parodying, especially 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' have a deep, beating, suspenseful theme, and 'Scary Movie' produces music very music like it. Special EffectsLike many parody films, the special effects are seen ad more comedic effects. Instead of using digital effects in this film, there is a more common use of physical props. Sometime, they look quite realistic and disgusting, such as the testicles appearing and sometimes look quite unrealistic and again disgusting, such as a dummy of Cindy being sprayed with seamen. Overall, most of the effects in this film are either disgusting or sex related. ConclusionWhen the film was originally released, it was quite entertaining, but as the years go on, it starts to lose its comedic factor. This movie really seemed to be the start of the downfall of parody films, as we are now presented with such "gems" as Date Movie and Epic Movie. You would be better suited if you have seen the movies it's parodying first, before you see this film, as you would understand the scenes more and find it a lot funnier."What is it?"? Bobby (Jon Abrahams) "What is it? She's gone and she's not coming back" ? Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) "Its been over a year, Cindy" ? Bobby (Jon Abrahams) "But Ginger was such an important part of the Spice Girls" ? Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris)</fullReview>

Within seconds I was laughing so hard I almost died of laughter.This movie isn't all good though because there are a few ups and downs but they are not to bad like this one for instance, the ending is the exact ending of 'Scream' but with different characters etc. so it copies the main spoof movie too much as it would have been better with a different ending.Other than that its thumbs up for me.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, as expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a parody of all the horror films (and more) that flooded the cinemas in year 2k. These films (which are quite bad) are absolutely changed, perverted and teared apart. No one saves the jokes, though gross are funny and that's all. There's no coherent plot, no good acting anything but a bunch of sketches mixed and put one after another. The film is quite bad, as the only thing it is good are the jokes, in case you like it. If not, the film will be horrible, If you happen to like this kind of movie, and you have watched the parodied films (Scream, the blair witch project, the sixth sense...) probably you'll enjoy a little the film. There's nothing more to say, as the film shows anything more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie spoofs a number of horror movies including Scream, The Sixth Sense, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and the Blair Witch Project. Here, some teens try to find out who is terrorizing their hometown in a string of serial killings. There are some funny scenes, including the killer from "Scream," who was making a terrorizing call to Cindy; she spots him hiding from behind her sofa. Another funny scene was when Cindy hurls objects downstairs against the killer, including her grandmother. Though meant to be a funny spoof, this movie focuses much too often on sexual overtones, which could gross out some viewers. And, I thought the acting was somewhat overboard and overexerted. The plot to the film is very basic as well. So, if you want a good Scary Movie comedy spoof, watch Scary Movie 3, which is much more entertaining and serves much better as a parody of scary movies.

		<fullReview>There's Something About Mary, The Matrix, Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and The Blair Witch Project. These are just some of the many movies that get parodied and parodied some more. No movie or celebrity is safe from the Wayan Brothers as they form some sort of plot out of many, many different movies of many different genres. This movie gets a lot of flak from critics and the general public. Most of it is because it is extremely crude and low-brow humour and let's face it, it is just that. There are fart jokes, sex jokes, drugs, racist jokes. You name them, they're there.Cindy (Anna Faris) while driving with her friends hit a body on Halloween. They dump his body only to have him stalk them a year later, or is it him? Cindy and her group of wacky friends: Brenda (Regina Hall), Shorty (Marlon Wayans), Buffy (Shannon Elizabeth), Bobby (Jon Abrahams) and Ray (Shawn Wayans) all have to solve this mystery before the killer wipes them out.All the actors in this may not be Oscar winners but they all give great comic performances. They are all funny and it's partly due to the actors because they all seem to like their roles. They go the full nine yards to gross out with many odd gags (Ms. Mann the funniest).To anyone thats looking for a hilarious parody that just doesn't take itself seriously, Scary Movie is that one.3?/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Spoof Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One year ago, a group of dumb teenagers dispose a man they accidentally killed. One year later, the teens are being stalked by a serial killer. Could the dead man be alive?The film's main spoof is obviously Scream, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, and Scream 2. The famous "first ten minute" scene in Scream is spoofed in the prologue of Scary Movie, where Carmen Electra comes in to make a cameo, like all Scary Movie film does.This film is very funny, crude, and gross. No wonder the franchise is a huge success in the box office. Anna Faris, the main character, is the heroine. She gives a funny performance. The teens are REALLY DUMB in this film. If you like smart comedies, stay far away from this series. When the killer kills the characters, we wouldn't care because it might be funny or because the characters are just too stupid to die.There are many "laugh-out-loud" moments in this film. It has some really clever jokes and some just gross out, which spoofed a sex scene in Scream. This film ranks #3 out of the 4 (or even more) films in the series. It's not bad considering the higher two are even funnier.If you're just looking for a comedy that you can shut off your brain on, then watch this film. If not, then don't. This film is clever, funny, and just plain stupid. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very funny movie about teens who one night ran over and killed a man. Exactly a year later, there was a killer on the loose only killing their group of friends. The teens are Cindy (Anna Faris), Brenda (Regina Hall), Shorty (Marlon Wayans), Ray (Shawn Wayans), Bobby (Freddy Prinze), Greg (Lochlyn Munroe), and Buffy (Shannon Elizabeth). They are fighting for their lives in this hysterical spoof of the Scream Trilogy, Buffy, and more comical spoofs. This movie is rated R by the MPAA due to profanity and graphic sex jokes and pictures. Some of the highlights of this funny movie are Brenda in the Movies, and the flashback of the killing.

After a beautiful classmate(Carmen Electra)is murdered; a clueless group of friends realize that there is a serial killer among them. Laugh out loud funny. Is this a spoof of a satire or a satire of a spoof? A man is accidentally killed and the body is disposed of...while a masked stalker likes to strike terror among the misguided teens. Cindy Campbell(Anna Faris)and her close friend Brenda(Regina Hall)try to comfort their friends as well as stay one step ahead of the killer.Strong crude sexual humor, violence, vulgar language and depiction of drug use guarantees an R rating.

		<shortDescription>An overall tasteless horror parody, despite some good bits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On paper, Scary Movie must have sounded like a great idea: after all, this film spoofs a series of slasher flicks, mostly Scream, which was a clever satire on horror traditions. How hard can it be to take those traditions and make fun of them, yet in a more extreme way than Wes Craven's opus did? Judging from the finished movie, it's very hard.The Wayans brothers, who came up with the whole concept (one of them directs the film, two act), seem to think the only thing you have to do is insert as much (gratuitous) crude humor and tasteless situations as possible. Movie opening with a big-breasted woman (Carmen Electra) who gets killed while running around in her underwear? Check. Bunch of stupid teenagers who, when not thinking how to defeat the killer, only talk about sex and drugs? Check. Endless rude jokes involving the aforementioned topics, as well as some puerile gay stuff? Check.That said, not everything is that bad. All the scenes featuring the Scream killer are quite funny, mainly because he's the only character the filmmakers can mock in new, unseen ways. Everyone else, however, is a boring stereotype, particularly Shorty (Marlon Wayans), an obnoxious stoner with almost no comedic charisma. Imagine my surprise when I found out Wayans could actually portray a drug addict convincingly in the harrowing Requiem for a Dream.Those who haven't seen it yet might find Scary Movie amusing the first time, otherwise it's just another throwaway comedy.5,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie lampoons the teen horror flicks, prevalent in the late 90's; especially Wes Craven's Scream (1996) and follows the same basic plot and characters as that film (high school kids picked off one by one by a masked slasher). SM also pokes fun at I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Blair Witch Project, and the Sixth Sense among others.Seeing as SM is a parody of other films you may be wondering if you should watch those movies first. I wouldn't say its essential (I hadn't seen Scream before), though an appreciation for the satirized material definitely adds to the humour. For instance the scene where the killer is casually washing the school floor in the background is a reference that viewers will only pick up on if they've actually seen Scream.I'll be the first to admit that SM is stupid, cheap, and cheesy? but hey, hear me out! It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to be, a funny, irrelevant stab (no pun intended) at popular culture. Lighten up, don't go in expecting something epic, and enjoy SM for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Scary Movie" years ago when it was really popular, and it's one of the best spoofs I've seen. The plot revolves around innocent teenage girl Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who finds herself wrapped up in a horrible mystery. One year ago, she and some friends accidentally killed a man on a road, and dumped his body in the water. Now, someone has come for revenge, in a white mask armed with a knife. As more bodies begin to pile up within the halls of B.A. Corpse High School, and all around the town, Cindy must fight against the killer and save her friends and herself."Scary Movie" is a film that can't be taken seriously. It's not meant to be taken seriously, and it's proud of it. The entire film is basically making fun of numerous entries into the horror genre, and the result is satisfying and amusing. The film mostly spoofs "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer", but throws in a few handfuls of others, all blending them into one big horror-comedy. The movie itself is pure slapstick comedy, so if you have seen a lot of horror films, you will understand easily what movie is being made fun of in what scene. I found myself laughing on many occasions, which is rare for me when I see comedies. There are some fairly good jokes in the film, although they also do throw in some of the tired, racy sex humor, but I was expecting that. The acting is great, everybody gave extremely funny performances, and from what I know they say that comedy is the hardest genre to accomplish, because you have to make people laugh. Well, this slick crew of actors did it for me. Some particular spoofs that stood out for me were - number one, the opening with Carmen Electra, spoofing Drew Barrymore's performance in "Scream", and number two, the sequence between the teens and the fisherman spoofing "I Know What You Did Last Summer". There are many more, but those are ones that I found most amusing.Overall, "Scary Movie" is one of the best satires I've seen, although I can't say I've seen a whole lot. The jokes were good and on pitch for the most part, the acting was funny, and the film delivered plenty of laughs while spoofing loads of recent horror films. If you are a horror fan and are fond of comedy too, I'd highly recommend this, because more than likely you will get most of the jokes. This is a good way to spend a couple of brainless hours, just don't expect to take any of it seriously. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original send up of the horror genre craze tore into primarily "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer", with the Waynes brothers coming out swinging with it's full on R rating of extremely crude sexual shenanigans and twisted humor, hardly letting up throughout the rampant craziness while mirroring (down to certain exact quotes) the plot line of the original Scream flick. While as expected, viewers are subjected to many hit or miss gags throughout, though the ballsiness (such as when when they show...balls) displayed through the Waynes' irrepressible urge to always accentuate our lowest common denominator, will keep things relevant, funny, and edgy enough to get decent sized laughs at decent sized intervals throughout their franchise debut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoof of the SCREAM/I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER movies, has a group of teens stalked by a black robed, knife &amp; hook wielding, ghost face, masked serial killer, that may or may not be the same man they accidentally hit on the road the previous summer, soon he starts stalking &amp; killing each teen, until the lead heroine decides to fight back. Plainly put, this is a shot for shot remake of SCREAM/I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (As well as their many sequels) only the scenes are all played for laughs, not terror, however I was half &amp; half on this one, while some scenes are just down right hilarious, a lot of the jokes fall flat on their face &amp; are usually sex jokes, jokes about gays, horror movie jokes etc. &amp; some of the jokes are merely in this film for shock value (i.e. I can't believe they just did that/did I see that correctly!?) &amp; despite the fact that it's a full on spoof, some of the killings are very violent &amp; bloody &amp; feel out of place in the story (Shannon Elizabeth's death in the girls locker room being a very good example of this) other films are spoofed as well, such as THE MATRIX, SIXTH SENSE, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT &amp; many others. The actors are all fairly well cast however, KURT FULLER as the cop is just pure gold! the lead actress playing Neve Campbell's role in SCREAM, the guy playing DEPUTY DOOFY (He's Hilarious!) &amp; SHANNON ELIZABETH is both sexy &amp; very funny in the Sarah Michelle Gellar role from IKWYDLS &amp; the rest are great as well! Like I said some of the jokes are laugh out loud funny, but others bomb, plainly put, if you don't mind endless sex gags/gross out gags/horror movie jokes or if you liked any of the Waynes other films, you may very well enjoy this one, if you don't, then don't bother with this one, you'll hate it. Followed by four sequels! Beginning with SCARY MOVIE 2 *** stars</fullReview>

Pure parody fun in the tradition of "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun" as the Wayans brothers (actors/writers/director) do their best with a whirlwind start that slowly begins to run out of steam as the production hits its half-way point. Anna Faris, Shannon Elizabeth, Regina Hall and Carmen Electra dominate the action as "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Scream", "The Sixth Sense" and "The Matrix" are the primary pop culture punching bags that cannot escape the fun-poking stick.

		<fullReview>Usually movies with the sole purpose of lampooning other movies are quite bad because it's all the plot consists of. Here we have a hilarious, though at times disgusting movie that has a plot all it's own even though much of it is made up by parody. Scary Movie is a spoof of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer with tidbits from other horror movies thrown in throughout.It tells the story of Cindy Campbell and her group of friends trying to survive a serial killer stalking their town a year after they accidentally killed a man with their car. The comedy type in this movie is pretty good. It's all visual gags that are at times funny enough to make your ribs hurt. However, there are times in the movie when the comedy resorts to immature bathroom humour, like a penis impaling someone's head, or a huge amount of semen blasting someone into the ceiling.The Wayons' Brothers did a good job with this movie, and it's definitely going to be recognized as one of the great comedies of the decade. If you're in need of a laugh and you're looking for a good time, Scary Movie is the way to go.7/10</fullReview>

Then when Cindy runs and he falls over the plant you probably thought that that was it, falling over the plant was the funny part but then he says "Man, I gotta stop drinking." That is hilarious.

		<fullReview>Very funny Wayans brothers parody of the teen slasher movies so popular the last 15 years. My favorite character in the movie is gail hailstorm played by Cheri Oteri. She plays your typical arrogant loudmouthed TV reporter. The first time you see her she spots a policeman investigating the latest slashing and that's when she tells her cameraman "Hold my gum, Kenny" and spits it at him while she rushes to get her interview. She even tries to interview the slasher while he's killing a teen and he gets mad at her too and says something like "Leave me alone; I'm just doing my job." Also love the doofy character played i believe by Trevor Roberts. I don't usually like to see the mentally handicapped ridiculed but doofy is hilarious as a 25 year old make-believe cop at the high school. Has a vacuum cleaner called Christine and does not like to be disturbed while cleaning his room.It's an ensemble cast with no one person really the star. Anna Faris has a big part as Cindy the only semi-normal person in the movie and marlon wayans is great as shorty, an obnoxious black teen. Shannon Elizabeth is hilarious as buffy, a super bitchy friend of cindy's. Lots of characters in this movie that you love to hate.My favorite piece is when the killer is in Cindy's house chasing her and she calls 9-11 on her computer and when asked "nature of emergency" she types "white woman in trouble". In five seconds every cop in town is there.</fullReview>

It's deserves to be buried 1000 feet underground and never see the light of day for eternity! I give it a 1 out of 10. And place it on one of the bottom 100 films lists.It's not worth buying nor worth seeing more than once. Save your money for something good! If you dislike this review then go ahead and place No on "Is this review helpful". Cause this would be the last choice I'd pick for a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... it is not so bad.However it is composed recreating the other scary movies, movies basically thought for teens.Movies that have success cause they are planned for them,naked women, and so on. If you are a teenager you probably will love this kinds of films.By random tonight I saw this movie.And I laugh a lot.Because it is plenty of other movies references, not just about scary movies.Sixth sense, for example a marvelous movie, The matrix just to mention two movies.I have not seen "I know what you did last summer" and other movies like that and I saw little shots of " Scream" basically because I do not enjoy much these kinds of movies. I think it is worth to see at least by random or desire. You choose.Ana</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first (and best) of the Scary Movie trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie (2000) was a horror parody of the recent films of the genre to come out in the past several years. The movie that it parodied the most was Scream. Ironically the title was the original name of Scream before they changed it (for marketing reasons). The Wayans brothers co-wrote the script (with a few others) and they had their older brother Keenan direct the picture.The film is about a group of high school friends who learn that one of their circle (Carmen Electra) was killed in a brutal fashion. They felt that it might have to do with something that happened last year. A secret that they swore to never have mention again. After a brief mourning period, the gang goes back to there usual business. But a crazed killer is stalking the student body at their high school and the circle of friends grows smaller every day. Who or what is behind the killings? Does it have to do with their secret? To find out you must have already watch SCREAM. Better yet go get yourself a copy of SCARY MOVIE!!A funny film for those who actually watched the teen slasher films they reference. Some of the jokes were from the Wayans Brothers other script (DON'T BE A MENANCE....) whilst the others seemed to be either tacked on or picked up from the cutting board. Too bad the uncut version isn't available on D.V.D. That version runs smoother and several of the lamer jokes and dated references were omitted. I prefer that version over the released one. But it's still funny. Beware of the sequels because they get progressively worse. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly stupid, but for once I don't care.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie first came out in 2000 I remember to have laughed with regularly. I just loved all those references to the for the nineties typical teenage slasher / horror movies like "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer". And even the fact that they had used a scene that was clearly inspired on "The Matrix" and one that referred to "The Sixth Sense" were direct hits. But since then a lot has changed and the genre of horror movies on which this was a spoof, no longer seems to exist. So I found myself posing the question whether I would still like it all that much...Telling something about the story isn't very easy. I guess that you can best try to find a resume of the horror movies that I mentioned in the previous paragraph, since this entire movie more or less follows the same story lines. The entire movie is in fact a literal, but comical version of these movies.If you are looking for a somewhat intelligent comedy, than this movie will once again be a huge disappointment. The Wayans brothers know no shame and find humor in every bodily function. What you'll get are jokes about farting and sex and sometimes one about smoking pot. Personally I still could laugh with most of the jokes, because I already knew that I didn't have to expect anything decent from this movie, but I can imagine that there are people who will be very offended by it.I'm not even going to tell something about the acting, because there isn't really any to be seen in this movie. This was just a bunch of young people re-enacting several scenes from all kinds of (scary) movies, behaving like a bunch of fools, but also having some excellent fun while doing so. And it shows. It's probably the best reason why you should watch this movie. It's completely over-the-top, couldn't be more opposite from subtle humor and hasn't got anything to offer that comes close to a story line, but I still like it because it's so absurd and that's why I give it a 7/10, maybe a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

It has funny moments, but is brought down from crude jokes that are more sick than funny.With that said, there are also good things. The scene with Regina and Shawn in the movie theater was absolutely laugh out loud hilarious. In the end, though, it is hard to spoof a movie that is a spoof itself(Scream). Spoofs include Scream, I Know what you did last summer, Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Scream 2, and the Shining.Tommy's review:2.5/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Scary Movie is a really good film. Having only seen only one of the movies (I Know What You Did Last Summer) that was mentioned in it, I was worried I wouldn't get the "in-jokes" in the movie, but it turns out they only used the most obvious jokes, that most people would know, had they not seen the movie. I also liked the cleverness in the character's names: 'Buffy' Gilmore, Greg "Phillippe" and Bobby "Prinze". Classic.I think that Anna Faris and Shannon Elizabeth were both brilliant actresses in this, and thought I have not seen the sequels yet, this movie has definitely made me want to see them. Altogether, a brilliant, funny film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how freaking funny this film is! It is definitely one of the funniest films I have ever seen in my entire life. Horror fans will get a lot more out of this, because they will understand a lot of the things that are being spoofed rather then the average movie goer who would think that they are just trying to be perverted. Either way, SEE THIS FILM!The film revolves around a group of teens who accidentally killed a man one year earlier, and then they covered it up. Now, they are all being stalked by some strange guy in a ghost face mask. Is it the once dead man, returned to life? Or is it some kind of sick minded stalker who saw the whole thing and wants to make they're lives hell for what they did?This movie is so funny! It spoofs all of the cheesy 90's horror flicks that were made specifically for the teens: I know what you did last summer, Scream, The Blair Witch Project, and many more! A definite must see! Go pick it up today! Get the sequel while your at it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary movie is not actually a movie. There is no plot, no story with a start and an end. It's just an excuse to throw in a series of gags and jokes taking a shot at scary movies like Scream, I know what you did last summer, The Blair witch project etc. And it is essential to have seen these films (at least the first two) to make any sense of this movie.Still, it was a funny and entertaining movie. Sure, there were some bad and crude jokes, some scenes that didn't fit in, but most of the time I was laughing. The only problem is that it was funnier the first time I watched it, the film loses it's appeal with each subsequent viewing (unlike airplane or other satire/parody movies).Worth watching once, you are sure to get a few laughs. I give it 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slamming a genre that deserves it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I say anything else, let me point out that this movie CLOBBERS "Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth(2000)(V)." I only saw that movie, because I wanted to find out what the reference to DARIA was all about, proving once again how difficult it is to break the habit of seeing movies for miniscule reasons. Believe me, that reference is brief and worthless. The movie starts off as an obvious spoof of the trailers for SCREAM, with Carmen Electra as Drew Barrymore makes the same stupid mistakes that lead to her murder, like so many victims in these movies. Somehow the story leads up to six friends at the dead girl's high school(aptly named B.A. Corpse High) who think that her killer is a fisherman they thought they killed in a hit and run last summer. Unlike the one in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, this guy survives and holds no grudges, but these kids are too stupid to figure it out. Anna Faris is the Neve Campbell-clone who takes a lot of lumps, not from her boyfriend Bobby(Jon Abrhams), who's more than ready to have sex than she is, but from her friend Buffy's(Shannon Elizabeth) beau Greg(Lochlyn Munro), who's got a short-fuse an some sexual issues of his own. Of course he's not the only guy in this clique with sexual issues, right Ray(Shawn Wayans)? Anyway, like in all the movies this flick makes fun of, one by one Faris' friends are being bumped off by the allegedly mysterious serial killer. Some might say that if you haven't seen SCREAM, you wouldn't understand this movie. I say you don't need to in order to understand any of the cultural references. The Trailers for Scream, IKWYDLS, The Sixth Sense &amp; The Blair Witch Project are enough to help you get the jokes. Plus, this movie had perhaps the funniest sex scene shown in the movies in a long time. The sequels, on the other hand aren't as good.A little tidbit, though: Before Scary Movie, there was Student Bodies(1981). There was also Saturday the 14th(1981), but it wasn't as good as Student Bodies or Scary Movie.</fullReview>

Lander (also was in this movie for a short period)Rated R for Strong Crude Sexual Humor, Language, Drug Use and ViolenceGenre: Horror/Comedy/MysteryStar Rating: **** out of 5Scary Movie is about six best friends named Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams), Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth), Greg Phillipe (Lochlyn Munro), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) - are being stalked by a serial killer. A serial killer that is after them because of an accident that they caused last Halloween. A serial killer that seems to have come out of every other scary movie. The body count's already started with Drew Decker (Carmen Electra), the local town slut, and it's starting to build up. This movie is also spoofing famous movies and horror movies that are famous also. Scary Movie spoofed these movies: Scream, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense, I Know What You Did Last Summer and The Matrix! The most funniest part is where the serial killer was in Cindy's house and he is on the phone and he tells her that she might not know where he is and the serial killer was hiding behind the sofa and then he told her to turn around so that he can hide some place else. Another funny part was when the part where the six friends were thinking back about the one time where they might of accidentally run over this one man and he was okay and one of threw a beer bottle at him and then they concealed him! I liked it in the beginning where Carmen Electra was running away from the serial killer and she got her clothes ripped off and you she her with her underwear and getting wet with the sprinklers and I thought that was sexy! Considering that Carmen Electra is one of the most sexiest celebrities alive! Another funny part was when the guys and the serial killer were all getting drunk and kept saying Wassup! Another funny part was when Shorty and Brenda are at the movies and Brenda keeps being so loud and talking through the movie and the other people want her to shut up! This movie cracks me up big time! It's outrageous and crazy!BOTTOM LINE: HELP I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP BECAUSE I AM STILL LAUGHING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit this movie had some really funny moments. Scary Movie was really hysterical at times. So so funny! This was a true parody and to me, was as it should be and what I expected, a hilarious spoof on those trashy horrors we all love to hate and hate to love so much!This movie was refreshing in it's sheer funniness. It's not a movie to be taken seriously and it's almost a roast on all the major horror movies that have been popular over the years. The movie isn't deep and it sure isn't for everyone, I almost think you have to moderately like, or at least have seen, many horror movies to really get into this(how would one get all the jokes otherwise either?) Basicaly, If you like parody movies and haven't seen this, I suggest you go out and rent it now. Not a dull moment-and you'll laugh your head off!PS:I enjoyed this much more then Scream and even though it's an absolute absurd and silly movies-they can be fun sometimes. For sheer giggles, this is a great choice.</fullReview>

That being said, there are some good moments of parody targeting cell phone rudeness, "The Usual Suspects," and the hilarious preview for "Amistad II."

		<fullReview>Scary Movie to me was a GREAT movie. I enjoyed watching the movie very much. My sister who made fun of Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, basically the movies that this movie made fun of, LOVED the movie. She was laughing the whole way. She even had to stop it about 40 times to go to the washroom because she almost wet herself laughing. This movie was very funny. The cast excellent, the story unforgettable, the characters memorable. The story was brilliant, course it was written by the Wayans brother who I think are hysterical. The cast was phenominal, I loved Anna Farris in this movie. I also love Cheri O'Teri, who I used to love watching on SNL. I think Gail Hailstorm (Cheri O'Teri's character) has got to be the most memorable character for me. Anna Farris though, she did an awesome job. She played the role of Cindy Campbell terrifically. The tagline for this movie is sooo... true, you will die laughing. I know when I was done watching this movie, I had to take a few seconds to catch my breathe because I was laughing tooooo hard. Lochlyn was also funny as Greg, it's nice to see a fellow Canadian in the movies once in a while. He was good. The spoofs were more than words can describe. I give this movie 9 out of 10 stars in the comedy category, the only thing that was wrong that I can think of... is that the killer looked toooo funny, but I guess it's a parody, so, it's 10 out of 10. GREAT MOVIE!</fullReview>

Some of the sex stuff is justdisgusting, not funny at all (especially when Cindy's boyfriend, uh,sprays her on the ceiling). Maybe if some of the sex parts weretaken away this movie would be funnier.However the horror movie spoofs are really funny and are anexcellent parody of those teen slasher movies everyone loves tohate. Some of the actual humour (what are you waiting for) is justpriceless.Scary Movie 3 looks rather promising, though. However I have justseen there is to be a Scary Movie 4!

		<fullReview>This movie has so many sexual jokes sprinkled throughout (especially the scene with a penis going through a guy's ears), that it's a wonder it didn't get slapped with an "Adults Only" rating in Canada. It was rated "Adult Accompaniment" which means that children under 14 must be accompanied by an adult, but if you ask me, this movie was way too explicit for under 18s. It's basically a soft-core porn and horror movie spoof at the same time. If it were re-released today, it would receive the new "18A" rating, which means anyone under 18 must be accompanied by an adult. Personally, I thought "Scary Movie" was a stinker, hands-down. The sequel wasn't much better, and perhaps "Scary Movie 3" is just as bad. If you've got a sense of decency, stray far from this one.Rating: * out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Airplane" on one engine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The preview for "Scary Movie" was a pretty popular workplace download back in 2000, when you could pull the latest commercials off of one of a plethora of websites now shut down. The goofy drug-addled Shorty jumping up and down in front of the news cameras saying this was better than the time he was on "Cops" was just one highlight of one of the funniest minutes ever put together on screen.Unfortunately, the makers of the movie had to fill some 90 more of them, and this they could not do too well. "Scary Movie" isn't bad bad. It has funny sections throughout, an unattractive but capable newcomer in lead Anna Faris, and three of the Earp Brothers of comedy, the Wayans, director Keneen Ivory, Marlon (Shorty), and Shawn (not-gay Ray) putting down their considerable talents to the enterprise. I like Cheri Oteri here, too, though the other characters are pretty cardboard, even for a farce.Ultimately this movie is a blend of two better films, the classic "Airplane" and, more obviously, "Scream." Sometimes it works, like in the solid opening with Carmen Electra, a banana, and the funniest non-cameo cameo I've ever seen. That scene works because it plays off the recent memory of "Scream" in theaters. But the movie quickly drags into a series of elongated, who-cares refs to such lesser fare as "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Dawson's Creek." The more it runs, the more you're reminded of how it's been done better before.2000 wasn't all that long ago, but a lot has happened since, and this film feels as lost in time as a high-tech IPO. Take one bit this film has in common with "Airplane," the commercial parody. I still laugh when I hear the woman in "Airplane" think to herself how "Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home" not just because I'm one of seven people left on the planet who still get that joke but because it's over and out fairly quickly. The "Wassup" gag in "Scary Movie" just goes on and on, a memorial to a commercial that lost gravity faster than Spuds McKenzie on Skylab.I really want to lambaste this movie, but it's hard. I liked Faris, as I said (she's prettier in "Scary Movie 2", maybe because she isn't sharing that one with Shannon Elizabeth), and the film's eagerness to make you laugh does win you over, at least a little. Even the stupid "Riverdance meets Matrix" fight scene makes me chuckle, and there are some actual good moments not worth spoiling by enumerating here.Maybe I missed this one by a generation, but I'm not sorry I did. "Airplane" and "Kentucky Fried Movie," even "The Cheap Detective," were pretty good for its day, and I guarantee you will hold up better 20 years later than "Scary Movie" will by the time Bill Gates is ready to retire.Really high raunch factor here, too. Did they really need to have scenes like Ray in the men's room and Carmen losing her implant to get laughs? Buffy's final scene is just too sado-bizarre (probably unintentionally), and the whole Doofy experience leaves an uncomfortable aftertaste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a fun film that makes you laugh if you look at it as your basic comedy but if you compare it to other spoof films over the past 30 years this one stinks. Unlike other spoof films such as Airplaine, Naked Gun, Fatal Instinct and others Scary Movies takes the entire plot out of 2 horror movies ( Scream and I Know what you did last summer) and make it their own. The characters are supposed to represent other characters from the films etc. In other spoof films they create characters and write scripts and plot that are original but take certain events and scenes of classic films and make it into their own. Also Scary Movie is suppoosed to be a parody film of Scream which itself was a parody of other horror -films if people don´t know it by now. And those who didn´t know that Scream was supposed to be called Scary Movie. Anyways a good idea and many laughs however not very good filmaking or for that matter spoof film making.

		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a parody of Horror movies such as:Scream,I Know What You Did Last Summer,The Blair Witch Project,The Sixth Sense and The Matrix. The story revolves around a bunch of airheaded teenagers that are being chased by a killer in a scream mask because he knows what they did last halloween. This was a very hilarious movie, sure it's stupid and gross but it's just so funny! I would give Scary Movie 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER*********BE WARE SPOILERThe film `Scary Movie' is a movie that is designed to make people laugh instead of being scared. This film is a `rip-off' of two other films `Scream' and `I know What You Did Last Summer.' This film tries to make fun of these other films, and that is the only real purpose this film has. Of course, there is a story line and plot but is a combination of these two films. First we should look at the characters. In this film they are trying to make fun of the characters as well as the other films. They make the other characters in the other films look so bad. For example, the killer in Scream was a normal everyday kid, but they took his weird personality and made him into white trash that lives in a trailer with a huge family. They change one of the characters from `I know What You Did Last Summer' from a strong masculine sporty guy played by Ryan Phillippe, into a guy that has a small penis played by Lochlyn Munro. This of course was done to make the other guy look stupid. They also have Officer Dewy from Scream, and turn his character into a mentally handicapped person in this film which they call Doofy. Finally, we have the actual killer who wears the same costume that was used in the Scream Trilogy. They change him from a scary mass murderer into a stupid murderer who actually hangs out with some of the characters. Overall, almost all of the characters have been altered in some way to make them look absolutely absorb. Finally we have the main character named Cindy, and in `Scream' her name was Sidney. What they do with her character is show the how prude she is about sex, and make it funny because in the `Scream' Sidney will not have sex until the end. They show this prudeness by the electric underwear, and the boyfriend's propositions that she refuses at every turn. These are the major changes of the characters, it is hard to go into all of them because there are more characters in this film than were in the other two films, and a lot of characters overlap. This film is interesting because it goes back and fourth in between the plots of the two films constantly. It starts of being like `Scream' and rapidly the characters remember what they `did last Holloween' which is exactly the same scene from `I Know What You Did Last Summer.' However, these are not the only films that are used in this one. They also have parts that are characteristic of films like: `Matrix,' `American Pie,' `Sixth Sense,' and `Blair Witch.' Adding all of these other films in gives it more appeal because each of these films is mocked in some way, and this makes it really funny. Even though this film looks downly upon these other films, it does not decrease the enjoyment of these other films. In fact, the scene that was similar to the `Matrix' made me want to watch the `Matrix.' These type of rip-off films are important because they make us laugh, and the find anything that is stupid in a film and makes fun of it. For example, in this when the did the rip-off of Blair Witch, they had the girls noise dripping snot, but it was absolutely pouring out and not the same little drips as in the real Blair Witch. In a way rip-off films are very similar to Saturday Night Live, in that they find something stupid and overplay its importance and make the person who thought of the original idea look and feel stupid. This film had to of been liked by many because they even made a sequel to it. Overall, this rip-off film is hilarious and is a definite film that you need to see if you have not watched it, and it is also good for helping to understand what a rip-off film truly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a comedy not intended for any past generations. The Wayans brothers pull off what many people wanted to see - all those teen "Horror" flicks to be redone in such a stupid fashion that it is actually funny. The sexual humour is perhaps a bit to over the top, but for anyone who has seen "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Blair Witch" and didn't like it, this is one movie you will enjoy. For those of you who did like those movies - this is still funny anyway.</fullReview>

I don't really need to explain the plot, just combine Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer with humor. My favorite character was Doofy, he was hilarious. So were Shawn and Marlon Wayans. This is a spoof that you will not want to miss. Watch Scary Movie 2 if you loved this movie.2.5 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 6.3/10.

		<shortDescription>Will offend the elderly, but for most others, this is a laugh riot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie closely resembles movies such as Airplane and The Naked Gun, by Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker. The primary difference is that Scary Movie probably won't appeal to the same audience. After all this is a teen movie, but even though, this film is often laugh out loud funny and crams in as many jokes as it can into it's 85 minute running time.Few of the jokes miss, and when they hit they get a bullseye. While there are some knob jokes and other somewhat offensive scenes, they make you laugh instead of winching at the screen.It's not afraid to be racist, controversial and chauvinistic but it sure is funny. This is far superior to it's one joke sequel and Shriek If You Know What I did Last Friday The 13th, Scary Movie is a very memorable film, even though it is hated by critics. 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo, Wayans brothers!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My stomach hurt for days after seeing Scary Movie. Not because I was sick from the gross-out gags, but because I was sore from laughing so hard and so often. Yes, the humor is, in most cases, rather crass, but this is easy to forgive because the parody is so well done. The Wayans' intelligently capture the shallow spirit of teen horror flicks like the "Scream" trilogy and lampoon them perfectly. Mainstream (non-teen) films are also thrown into the mix, resulting in hilarious parodies of movies like "The Sixth Sense" and "The Matrix." I'm not normally a fan of shock humor, but the reason it works so well here is that the Wayans brothers do not *rely* on it alone, but use it as spice only. Beneath the gross-out gags is a foundation of intelligent parody. The humor is non-stop. If you can take the crude adult jokes, I highly recommend this very funny movie. Be prepared to laugh loud, and laugh hard. And, maybe even feel a little guilty about what you're laughing at. My rating: 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 'scared' me with all of the male nudity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** 1/2Starring: Anna Farris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, and Jon Abrahams.A parody of numerous scary movies, this movie follows the "Scream" plot. A woman gets stalked and her friends start to get killed by a man dressed as ghost-face. Of course, this isn't meant to actually scare you, but make you laugh.I know, I know what you're thinking. If this had female nudity I would be happy. Yes, probably better than seeing male nudity. Why? Because this movie is intended to target the male audience, and the male audience does not to see all these shots of men's nudity. Luckily, I took off no points for it.This movie is a very funny movie. A little tired in some of its jokes, but for half the time, it entertained me. Although, it did have some funny scenes, it still never launches off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I loved the way the spoofs from all the scary teen movies were incorporated into one story line. There were two really funny scenes in the movie. The first one was when Greg beat the crap out of Cindy. The second one was when Ray and Brenda are at the movies. The whole story line about Ray being gay is hilarious. Even though all the characters in the movie are really funny, the best one had to be Deputy Doofy.This movie will keep you laughing all the way through the end. If you're one of those types of people who don't like stupid comedies, then this movie is probably not for you. I mean, the stuff that they do is kind of stupid, but the way it's done is soooo funny. There's a lot of movies that they spoof on that you should see before you watch it because you might not get the jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is it spoofing more, I Know What You Did Last Summer, or Scream?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is probably the most unique, and original spoof films ever made. While it is taking plots from some old slasher films, it is it's own movie. The plot is pretty funny, Cindy Campbell (played by Anna Faris) is supposed to be a spoof of...well Cindy Campbell from Scream. Cindy and her friends, consisting of Greg, Buffy, Bobby, Ray, and Brenda, one night, hit someone with there car (i.e. spoofs I Know What You Did Last Summer), they dump the body in the harbor, and a year later, someone dressed up in a ghost face costume is killing off all of her friends. Cindy thinks its the man that she hit a year before. This movie takes memorable movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Scream, and turns certain scenes, and characters, into funny ass s*it. The character Doofy alone provides a great portion of the comedic material. Scary Movie has some great actors in it, and to me, Dave Sheridan (I) (he plays as Doofy) is the best actor in the movie, in fact, in my opinion, he is the best actor on the face of the earth. Another good portion of the comedy in this film, is the very, very clever lines, such as "I went poopy" (that lines was said by Doofy). Overall, Scary Movie delivers some great jokes, great acting, and an original plot. The only flaw that this movie has is the fact that it gets tiring after watching too much. Scary Movie, is funny, but the second is better. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It didn't take long for me to realize that "Scary Movie" is largely apeing the "Airplane" comedies: basically, "anything for a laugh, no matter how stupid." And it lives up to that mandate.The difference, though, is that "Scary Movie's" brand of comedy is far less subtle, mostly consisting of sight gags and physical humour (how many times do people need to get hit with things?) It does have it's subtle and surprising moments, and as far as I'm concerned those are the best ("Oh my God, we hit a boot!")Another difference is that, believe it or not, "Scary Movie" is even LESS subtle in it's style of parody than "Airplane!" was, often outright naming the films it's spoofing, which comes across as pretty desperate. As well, it tries to be topical ("Whazzzup?") which will probably result in a film that ages very badly.All things considered, though, I did enjoy most of it. While it was hilariously ironic to see Carmen Electra make fun of somebody ELSE'S acting ability, the principal characters -- especially the women -- did a great job. Did nobody else thing that Cheri Oteri's "Gail Hailstorm" scenes were the funniest moments? Next to Hailstorm (and including Brenda's hilarious movie-theatre death, and Buffy's "Is this the climax? Do you mind if I fake it?"), the men in the film are pretty dull, actually.This film features jokes for everybody. How offended you are by the huge number of jokes that DON'T suit your sense of humour will probably dictate how much you enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

In a nutshell, it's what Airplane! was to disaster movies, only here it's lampooning horror movies. A lot of the jokes fall face first leaving the starting line but a lot of it is actually pretty funny. I especially liked it when the killer started freestyle rappin'. That was hilarious. And it's incredible that the MPAA, fascists that they are, let them get away with as much as they did. They do stuff here that's just wrong. But a funny wrong, ya know?

		<fullReview>I thought "Scary Movie" was a great film, it was absolutely hilarious! The comedy is usually right on and is executed perfectly. Although, I must admit that some of the humor is a little raunchy for me. For the most part though, I really loved this film.The acting is pretty much what you'd expect from a movie of this nature, nothing great, but not bad either. Shannon Elizabeth, Carmen Electra and Anna Faris alone make the film worth watching! The rest of the cast does just fine and is very entertaining throughout the film.There really isn't a whole lot to say about this film. If you like raunchy comedies like "There Something About Mary" then you'll probably like this film. But don't say I didn't warn you, there is some really bizarre comedy in this film. There are also a huge number of movie references and spoofs in this film, so pay close attention and see if you can pick them all out. I hope you enjoy the film.

		<shortDescription>A Deconstruction of Ludic Elements in Contemporary Parodistic Cinematic Syntax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose there are three major elements to consider in figuring out what kind of spoof you're watching. (1) The dumbness of the gags. (2) The kind of genre being referenced. And (3) the level of self awareness of the characters.The gags can range from elegant to really visciously vulgar. The stupid ones have broader audience appeal and probably make more money. This movie probably made a lot of money. (Eg., one of the gay characters is assaulted by having a phallus thrust in one ear and out the other.) They're not all that gross. When Cindy runs to her room and contacts 911 on her PC, she gets the question, "What is your problem?" and types in, "White woman in trouble." But the run of the mill gags are pretty lowbrow. Over the final credits is a rap song with lyrics like, "Take your tongue, and cut it out your mouth. Take it home, feed it to my trout. Fry him in a pan, shoot him out my can, right into your face, so you know your place." If you find that level of wit funny, it's your kind of movie. The genre being spoofed here is the teenage horror/slasher flick. Not something like "The Shining" or "The Innocents," but something like, "Scream," and "I Know What You Did Last Summer." I can catch most of the cliches being skewered in something like, "Big Deal on Madonna Street" (a caper movie) or "Fatal Instinct," (a private eye noir) but I'm certain that most of the allusions here got past me because I don't find the original films very entertaining so I'm not familiar with them.The characters here are more self aware than in any spoof of recent memory. They know they are in a movie -- all of them. At one point two young people are going to make love for the first time and the guy says, "Just like in a movie." The girl says, "No, this isn't a movie." And he says, "Sure it is," and begins naming the crew while we see them gathered around the camera. It isn't that this hasn't been done before. There's a deliberate, fleeting shot of the director and crew in "Candy," and in "Blazing Saddles" the characters break into the set of a musical being filmed on the neighboring sound stage. "Shakespeare in Love" flirted with this, when one of the characters says, "I own tobacco plantations in Virginia. I think there may be a future in tobacco," and glances furtively into the camera. It's just that here, we are always aware of their awareness, whether we actually see the camera or not. I didn't find the movie very funny. It doesn't seem instrinsically funny when a retarded character named Dufus walks around with his lips twisted into an odd sneer, any more than it was funny when Mel Brooks made twitching faces as the mayor of the town in "Blazing Saddles." Teenagers seemed to enjoy "Scary Movie," or at least that's the impression I get. There must have been some respectable activity at the box office and at Sam's Blockbuster after all the hype that accompanied this release. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great parody of scary movies. Keenan Ivory Wayans directed a very excellent movie and I think he's a very good director. Shawn and Marlon Wayans are very cool in this and they made me laugh almost every time. Anna faris does good as the "scream queen" in this and she was good. All of the other characters were really cool and I liked the jokes they made.Overall the movie was very good but lost a point for showing male genitals. Rating 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror movie spoof (mainly I Know What You Did Last Summer &amp; Scream) is about a killer on the loose at a local high school who tells dirty jokes, gets high with his victims and then kills them. After a terrific opening sequence, the film falls flat on it's face in a desperate attempt to get laughs by making fun of anything and everything in sight including River Dance and The Matrix. Shannon Elizabeth seems to raise above the material though.Rated R (This should of been a NC-17); Graphic Violence, Strong Sexual Content, Graphic Nudity, Crude Sexual Humor, Strong Drug Use, Strong Adult Themes, and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayans Brothers Know How to Make Laughs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of both the horror and comedy genres and when the two genres are combined like this it's the best. Marlon, Shawn, and Keenan Ivory Wayans bring us a spoof of 90's genre more specifically the Scream and I know What You Did Last Summer series. As the laughs start piling up so do the bodies. I remember sitting in the movie theaters with my friend and actually falling out of my seat at some of the more hilarious parts. Just like the trailer says " They didn't make the rules, they're just too stupid to follow them" that is certainly the truth. The cast stars Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell, Shannon Elisabeth as Buffy Gilmore, Carmen Electra as Drew Decker, Marlon Wayans as Shorty Meeks, Shawn Wayans as Ray-Ray Wilkens the sexually confused jock, Jon Abrahams as Bobby Prinze, Regina Hall as Brenda Meeks. Keenan Ivory Wayans has a cameo that pokes fun of Amistad and Titanic. As for the DVD its okay, but most of the features you get on the VHS version.

		<fullReview>Shameless, goofy, highly 'offensive' parody which takes the basic plot of Scream and other popular horror movies and spoofs it in hilariously overboard fashion. A group of high school teenagers?stricken with grief after concealing a crime?find themselves the target of a serial killer who seems well-educated in the ways of horror movies. Sound familiar? Film's raunchy, wickedly warped sense of humor will both repel you and make you laugh uncontrollably; occasionally falters when it resorts to cheap toilet humor, but even by the lowest standards it's still pretty funny. An acquired taste for sure, but still likely to be remembered for pushing the boundaries with its racy subject matter. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of most genres and comedy is no exception. I have enjoyed many comedies throughout the years such as the Police Academy movies and I like to think I have a sense of humour. This film did nothing for me really.Okay, it had it's moments. I must admit to laughing when a piano was heading down the stairs towards the killer but most of the jokes were unfunny in my opinion. I personally don't think you can mix horror and comedy and I don't think you can make a good satire of horror because horror is truly a dark and disturbing genre. When horror and comedy mix the results are usually quite poor. Mixing horror and comedy is like missing whisky and lager.Younger viewers will probably appreciate this a lot more but I didn't find it funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gross, but funny in parts (possible spoilers?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This infamous Wayans brothers horror/comedy spoof rivals "Freddy Got Fingered" for sheer tastelessness. To begin with, there's the "penis attack" scene. Yes, you heard me. A character is attacked by a penis. And that's just a warm-up. Later on, we get the part about the geyser of semen. No, that was not a typo. The writers of "Scary Movie" act as if they had never heard of good taste. Given the evidence (the Wayans gave us "In Living Color") that's probably not too far from the truth. The criteria we must use to evaluate the film is extremely simple: is it funny?Well sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. In addition to those mentioned above, there are countless gags and horror movie parodies. Some of them fall flat, but there are enough hits to compensate for at least some of the misses. I laughed several times, but the film suffers from too many dead spots, especially during the third act. How you respond to it is purely a matter of taste. If gross-out comedy isn't your thing, what are you doing here anyway?In closing, I must give credit where it's due. Anna Faris provides a strong screen presence, guiding us through the movie's weaker moments. She's not gorgeous by any stretch of the imagination, but she has an undeniable appeal. In fact, she would have been right at home in an actual horror film. Let's take it a step further. She could have replaced Neve Campbell in "Scream" and it wouldn't hurt the film one bit.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by Dimension Films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yup! I finally managed 2 watch this movie tonight on channel 17 (1st time. This movie was kind of funny, but was very, very, very, very disgusting! A cool idea 2 takes some scenes from other scary movies such as "Blair Witch Project", "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and other scary films. I didn't like none of the sex scenes at all, they all disgusted me, the only scene I liked was when Ray (Shawn Wayans) told his girlfriend 2 put on the football outfit and then they went in2 the bed, that's about it! Other than that, the movie was terribly disgusting! I vow 2 myself that I'm never going 2 watch it again, NEVER AGAIN! I can't stomach nasty rubbish like that, it just makes me so sick 2 my poor little stomach! The movie was good, and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and his pothead friends were funny as hell! What's up with the bathroom scene and the girl on top of Bobby, especially that "it" that had "its" balls hanging out (that was very disgusting) I REALLY, REALLY hated that scene, didn't like it one bit!

		<fullReview>It's very difficult to rate a movie which is a parody of a parody. In fact, I think that in order to rate it properly one should work out all whole new system for thinking 'what is a good movie'. When I saw this one the first time I thought 'this stinks'. Lots of bad puns over gays, blacks people, gangstas, bimbos and well american high school over all. In short, I thought it sucked. But then I realized that I had used the wrong measuring tools. I mean when you do a parody you have to work your mind in a special way. When your making a parody of a parody, you have to take the whole thing two steps further. And really freak out. This is what this movie has done. Although they have filled it with clichees and really cheap jokes it is done with such a selfirony and distance that one just has to applaud. This is a good parody</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess that my expectations were not very lofty when I sat down to see this film. I mean it was conceived by the Wayan Brothers, who have talent but must repulse to get most of their laughs from a younger audience. What do I mean by repulse? One sexual joke(and I don't mean the subtle kind) after another. The jokes are crude and offensive. Some of the scenes are in incredibly bad taste. I know that is what the Wayan Brothers wanted to do. They wanted to have guys like me say how offensive they are and what an offensive film Scary Movie is. They got it. That doesn't make it good. This is not a good film. There are some flashes of brilliance in it. The first fifteen minutes are extremely effective. Some of the jokes are very humourous. The obvious homages to recent horror movies like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Blair Witch Project, The Matrix, etc... are well-conceived. I even liked the part where a girl is killed for talking during a movie. Met many like that! The audience targeted though is definitely a younger, "hipper," type audience that thinks drug use is funny, sex is as necessary to life as air, and good acting is a bunch of young actors and actresses that will be inducted into the Hall of Obscurity upon turning 40. A real pity. And that is more scary than anything you will find in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a funny movie this was.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I was in the theater for Gladiator with one of my fellow movie-going friends when I saw the first preview for Scary Movie. It looked like it was going to be the most hilarious movie ever created, and fit right in with my interest in horror movies. It was so promising; full of potential.So, did it live up to my expectations? Sort of. More a comedy than anything else, Scary Movie manages to make fun of recent horror movies, commercials, and even itself in an extremely short time. The characters are hilarious parodies of the original characters (Doofy/Dewey, Cindy/Sidney, Gale Weathers/Gale Hailstorm, etc), the killer is a wise-cracking half-wit, and even the soundtrack manages to be a parody, namely with the fake "Don't Fear the Reaper" in the bedroom scene with Cindy and her boyfriend.Probably the most enjoyable parts of the movie are the ones that feature the killer. I'd consider him the best source of humor, with his out-of-place interactions with other characters. He's got a laid back attitude, smokes pot with his victims, does freestyle rap, and has casual phone conversation with other characters, claiming that he's just "chillin'...and killin'...", sounding just like your normal lazy guy with a slight twist. The Budweiser "wasaaaaap" spoof had me laughing so hard it hurt. The camera work, the changing voices, the goofy expressions, and the acting just came together so well. It was a great scene. My only real gripe about the movie is it's use of sexual comedy for the majority of the short 88 minutes. I guess it could be seen as a different take on the tastelessly frequent sex scenes in teenage horror movies, and is indeed funny the first few times. But it gets old. Fast. To me, it seems as if the sexual stuff is thrown in there as much as possible to entertain the types of people who are amused by "Stiffy Lube" novelty shirts, and is sort of an insult to intelligence. It feels like the movie's trying to cover up a lack of humor, but that's not necessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Thing Is That I Actually Smiled A Few Times!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can anyone possibly say about this movie. It's stupid, features awful (admittedly probably deliberately awful) acting, juvenile humour at its worst - in short, it accomplishes what it sets out to do!It's a parody of horror movies - largely "I Know What You Did Last Summer," and "Scream," with a handful of references to others thrown in. I have heard people say that they laughed uproariously when they saw this. I find that very hard to believe. There were a few scenes that brought a smile or soft chuckle to me, but nothing side-splitting. None of the "performances" are worth a mention, but, as I said, the movie was certainly designed around deliberately bad performances, so maybe the actors were all first rate! Perhaps there should have been Oscars for these performances! OK, I'm going a bit overboard. The movie was OK; nothing great, but not a disaster. Probably on the downward side of mediocre. Not being a huge fan of Keenan Ivory Wayans, it's exactly what I would have expected from a movie directed by him.The one thing that intrigued me throughout was a casting decision that I still don't really understand. David L. Lander ("Squiggy" from the old TV show "Laverne and Shirley") was cast as the high school principal. OK. But I couldn't for the life of me figure out why he was cast as "Principal Squigman!" In other words, he was playing "Squiggy" as a high school principal! Maybe I've missed some obvious point here, but why the fascination with "Squiggy?" Greater minds than mine will have to work on that.Overall, I rate this movie as a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny as hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the sickest film, but the funniest film of 2000. It makes fun of all of the teen flicks from the past years such as Scream and I know what you did last summer. It also made fun of non-horror movies like the matrix and Titanic. Although, there is one problem that I have with this picture. It have a lot of male nudity in it which cause me to lower the score. If it isn't for that, I would give this movie a perfect score.Rating: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obnoxious and stupid motion picture with scenes that bring out annoyance instead of laughter. The film is supposed to be parody of the big hits from the late 1990s and yet seems more like a remake of Scream(1996). The writing is horrible and the acting is just as bad. Richard Pryor has written much funnier and more daring material than what passes here for laughs. One of the few films that director, Keenen Ivory Wayans did not write himself. I've seen skits from the show In Living Color that I enjoyed more than this movie. For a film that is supposedly a comedy, there is plenty of serious violence that belongs in a regular horror picture.Carmen Electra does an average job in parodizing her public image along with the character played by Drew Berrymore in Scream(1996). An another example of why the year 2000 was not a creative or great year for motion pictures in Hollywood. Hollywood during the last five to ten years have bathed in creative bankruptcy and imaginationless ideas. The scene where Shannon Elizabeth is murdered while still talking is the only funny sequence in the film. This scene in Scary Movie(2000) is done in the manner of the old Monty Python show. The reference to Usual Suspects is very good but the take on The Sixth Sense are done in poor taste. For people who want to see a great parody of horror films, I suggest the motion picture Young Frankenstein(1974).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" was a big disappointment. Even though there were some funny moments here and there, this movie, which targets the "Scream" films, didn't make me laugh as hard as I thought it would. So I have one question: why did this movie gross $157 million at the box office last summer? It's a shame that "Scary Movie" has made more money than far more funnier comedy spoofs like "Airplane!", "The Naked Gun", and "Blazing Saddles". "Scary Movie" isn't even close to matching the same kind of laughs as those movies generated. Other comic spoofs like "Spaceballs", "High Anxiety", and "Top Secret!" have more laughs than this movie. This film just goes to show that Mel Brooks, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker can do comedy spoofs better. Why couldn't this movie be made by one of those guys?** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's not a re-do of that 1983 Dudley Moore epic "Romantic Comedy." This one's in the tradition of Airplane! et. al, as nouveau-horror movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer are gleefully lampooned. Oh, and there are references to The Matrix as well, and other movies whose names escape me at the moment. The film is the handiwork of Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and it's as if they took the scripts of the gee-aren't-we-hip horror movies of recent years and shot the hell out of them. Ripped asunder, these scripts are funnier than ever. You've got the opening scene of Scream where the sexy starlet is terrorised by the guy on the phone who can see her, you've got the scene in I Know What You Did Last Summer where the joyriding kids run over someone, plus you have scenes from all those old horror movies where the hero/heroine is running up the stairs, chased by a madman (Halloween comes to mind).Your main characters are an amalgam of the kids from IKWYDLS and the Scream monstrosities. You remember: the Romeo, the virgin, the slut, the BMOC (big man on campus), and at least one African American tossed in for some good ol' ethnic diversity. You see, while the Scream series thought it was poking fun at other, more revered horror films while not taking itself seriously, you don't need to have Protean intelligence to realise that the in-jokes were just dumb and overwrought, like elitist coeds snickering at something they didn't understand. Well turn those frowns upside-down, folks! The Wayans boys know what they're doing. The simple vacuousness of the characters in those lesser flicks is exaggerated perfectly in Scary Movie. There's not a sacred cow left untipped!I won't delve into the plot, they introduced a whole stoner subplot that had me in stitches, too. This is lowbrow humor executed perfectly. I might not care a whit for Scary Movie in a few years, but for now it's one of the hippest, funniest movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crying and Laughter, Two words I would associate with Scary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a very funny film that re-lights the spoof genre. Many recent spoofs have been a bit of a flop as the jokes seem redundant and very over used. However this film takes the Farrelly Brothers approach with using many crude jokes that include gallons of the Hair Gel in There's Something about Mary. The film mirrors the storyline of scream with similar dialogue but this is part of the joke. I think the target audience for this film is between 16-25. I would definitely advise anyone younger than 16 not to watch this, as it might be a little to crude. I think to increase the viewing pleasure of this film I would recommend seeing several films first which are Scream 1+2, IKWYDLS and the Usual suspects. The others will not make that much difference to understanding the gags because they are funny anyway.This film features several young talented actors who are willing to make fools out of themselves for the films sake. The direction on the film is good but nothing spectacular, You just want it to be straightforward. My favourite Characters in this one has got to be Shorty and Doofy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie without a sequel (except for Scary Movie II)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of movies that include Scream(I-III), I Know What You Did Last Summer, Halloween, the Matrix, Titanic, The Usual Suspects, the Blair Witch Project and Sixth Sense and the 35 or so movies parodied, this comedy spoof is made for you. If you haven't seen any of these but still enjoy a gross-out comedy, you'll probably enjoy it and laugh in all the wrong places (one of the most interesting things in watching it is that different sections of the audience puzzlingly laugh in completely different places). The basic story concerns a bumbling killer who uses the Scream movie cloak and techniques to hunt down a group of teenagers who accidentally killed someone years ago. Laughs are in two categories - totally gross ones that push the limits of acceptability and the censor, and in-jokes based on parodies of other movies. For instance, many will remember the "I'm so scared" scene from Blair Witch where the girl's nose runs: in Scary Movie, the nose runs, and runs and runs and eventually starts hilariously blowing bubbles. The gross-out jokes make There's Something About Mary look definitely prudish. There's a retard who has sex by putting his penis into a vacuum cleaner hosepipe, a man who doesn't realize he's gay but chases men (and, when an erect penis is offered him through a latrine wall, finds it goes, quite literally, in one ear and out of the other.) The real nastiness of the reporter from earlier movies is made obvious. And so on. Scary Movie II follows on soon - but meanwhile I will be going to see this one a second time to see how many hilarious film references I can spot! Don't wait for the TV version - it's been heavily edited. Very vile, very funny, very un-pc. . . oh - and it has some scary bits too! Stay to the end of the credits for an extra treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SCARY MOVIE / (2000) **1/2 (out of four)The original title of "Scary Movie" was "Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween," and I would guess there is no coincidence that the original title of "Scream" was "Scary Movie." Director Keenen Ivory Wayans, getting back into the groove of parody after his previous "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka," and his writer/actor brothers, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, create a motion picture comic in so many ways, not one homosexual reference is left out, no racial gag is too offensive, not a minute passes without some kind of dirty joke occurring: every kind of crude bodily function and exaggerated sex possible. Many are clever, funny, and unexpected; others fall flat. Regardless, "Scary Movie" contains the maximum amount of comic sexual content that the R-rating allows, thus is this years envelope pusher.The movie provides a wide variety of targets, but aims squarely at the work of horror writer Kevin Williamson, like the "Scream" trilogy and the first and second "I Know What You Did Last Summer." The film also offers spoofs of and or refers to "The Matrix," "The Exorcist," "Titanic," "Amistad," "The Sixth Sense," "Pulp Fiction," "Carrie," "Shakespeare in Love," "The Crying Game," "The Usual Suspects," "The Blair Witch Project," "Kazaam," and even the television teen romp "Dawson's Creek." These parody scenes take the position a plot would normally occupy. There is simply an outline of characters, mostly teens played by actors in their late 20s and 30s, who attend B. A. Corpse High School, for the ghost-faced killer with a hook for a hand to spear out breast implants, chop off heads, stick a penis though a character's ear, and cause a riot inside of a movie theater where a profoundly rude pedestrian is mulled by the upset crowd."Scary Movie" has the correct timing to spew such raucous humor at audiences, in the middle of a summer where effective comedies are few and far between. The film is amusing with the same kind of raunchy style teen sex comedies get away with. I have always enjoyed screwball films a great deal, and its no coincidence that I know Leslie Nielsen to be the ultimate in slapstick. Like Leslie Nielsen flicks, "Scary Movie" is at its best with slapstick parody and will undoubtedly deliver your dollars worth if you have an education in this film's many targets. Unlike Nielsen movies, however, "Scary Movie" provides less comic edge and tries instead to beak new ground in offensiveness. After watching one of Nielsen's better credits, I walk away with a smile on my face, feeling like I have just been tickled. As I walked out of this comedy, I felt like I had just been flicked off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Scary Movie expecting to see some better gross-out jokes than in both There's Something About Mary and American Pie. After seeing the preview, I expected that I was going to leave the theater holding my sides, and with my cheeks aching from laughing so hard. What I got was an hour and a half of the exact same jokes that I had already seen in the previews, with a few disgusting and boring sex jokes. The spoofs were put in almost verbatim from such films as the Scream trilogy (obviously), Urban Legend, I Know What You Did Last Summer, the Matrix, and even the Usual Suspects for some odd reason. Because of that, what you get is not a film that stands on its own, but a conglomeration of skits based on the above horror films. Watching Scary Movie is almost like watching a sick version of a Saturday Night Live-type TV show. While I was watching Scary Movie, I found myself laughing at the jokes almost entirely because I WANTED it to be funny, but then I found myself feeling stupid for laughing out loud at something that was not even remotely amusing. This truly is a terrible film, and I can't say that I recommend it to ANYONE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is possibly the best comedy I've seen this summer. Of course I may be a bit partial because I'm a huge Williamson fan and admired the way the Wayans brothers spoofed his work. Is it just me or did everyone, including the critics, seem to missed the Brady references? Cindy, Bobby, Greg...sure they were subtle, but I like them, especially how it when with the Wayans' commentary on the "whiteness" Williamson's films. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Williamson fan but I appreciate humor in any form. Going back to the "whiteness" commentary, the Wayans' have several references in the movie that are funny including a reference to Williamson's commentary in Scream 2. The best part of the movie is that you're guaranteed a laugh or groan from scene to scene with just enough time to catch your breath. Going back to Williamson, the movie takes pot shots at his films' self-awareness which I found amusing, fans of Williamson's work will also be rewarded with a semi-unexpected cameo. The film loosely ties together Dimension's Scary Thriller plotlines well enough that anyone who's seen them will get a good laugh out of them. I was a bit disappointed in not seeing any spoofing or reference to the last of the Scream Trilogy. As for the, "Oh my god, that's offensive" stance some seem to have with this film and others such as "Me, myself and Irene"...why don't you tight &lt;explicative&gt; calm the &lt;explicative&gt; down and laugh. The whole point of these films (to me) is to point out how erroneous those types of views, stereotyping and such are...a movie isn't real life, movies can comment on real life, but in the end it is we, the viewers, that make that commentary possible. Don't protest to change a movie, protest to change reality. (Note: I am a minority) Overall, a great movie spoof. Over-analyzed or under-analyzed, don't take it seriously...it is, after all, a comedy.</fullReview>

Be warned however, that some of the humor is very vulgar and if you are easily offended, you may want to think twice before watching. I hope this movie continues to rake in the cash - it deserves every penny it makes!!</fullReview>

So ask yourself if you really enjoyed the adult humor or if you're p***ed off at your kid because you couldn't laugh too hard in front of them at the humor?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't exactly an example of great taste but still you can't help laughing at it.It's one of those movies that is humor filled, with means that you are being bombarded constantly with jokes, of which some are just too lame for words, while others will make you laugh surely. Really a movie with hits and misses but luckily in this case the movie its hits make it worthwhile.Because it spoofs so many movie, the movie isn't really being a one-joke movie. Its plot line provides the movie with plenty of opportunities to let spoof-sequences fill up the movie. It lets the story flow rather well and keeps the pace high but pleasant. Even though it's all quite silly and very childish, it's a movie that entertains and that was of course also exactly what this movie got made for. It's a spoof in the same trend as the Naked Gun movies for instance, which on its own also aren't exactly great movies but hilarious and entertaining ones nevertheless.You can say that this movie got made at the right time. Horror movies were starting to regain their popularity again at the time and the Scary Movie-series perfectly exploits this. It makes these movie very profitable ones and it also adds to the popularity of both the modern horror and comedy genre. I sort of feel that the Scary Movie movies are also somewhat responsible for the many horror remakes of classic movies. These movies showed, by spoofing them, how popular and still well known these classic movies were by the young movie goers and therefore also profitable and interesting to do for the big studios.This movie is simply good and fun for what it is!6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was stupid. Albeit some of the gags were noticeably funny, there were some that were either too gross or too lame.This movie is not very innovative on how it is spoofing "Scream." In fact, it follows "Scream" too closely only by adding on exaggeration and overrated gags. Not to mention that it's integration of "I Know What You Did Last Summer" was fairly pointless, and also followed its segments a little too closely as well.Much of the drug humour is not very funny. Sexual humor way too gross. The WAZZUP gags was too lame and pointless, even when that gag was at the height of its popularity. "I see dead people?" How about "I see dumb people?" The memorable garage scene from "Scream" was totally pointless in this movie. The Blair Witch parody also pointless. Even the climax of the movie followed Scream too much to the point where you have to ask "why bother doing that?" You'd get more laughs if you were watching "Scream" through the eyes of "Mystery Science Theatre 3000." So if you had a choice between this movie or the other "Scream" parody, "Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th," choose "Shriek...."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making a comic film that searches in parodying several movies is in itself a funny idea, so long as the film-maker makes it with talent, freshness, sharpness and a minimum of vulgarity. David Zucker understood very well this lesson when he made the trilogy of "the naked gun". Here, "scary movie" goes to the opposite extreme. The scriptwriters must have exploded while writing the screenplay. They increased the shocking effects and the movie is affected... but in the wrong way.By telling the zany story of an investigation by certain students in a high school about a serial killer who commits crimes, you can quote a parody of "scream". At first, this starting point turns out to be promising but you must quickly become disenchanted. Indeed, the screenplay probably ranks among the worst ever made in the cinema's history. It's a pretext to a flood of sequences full of vulgarity, of heaviness that are supposed to be parodies of famous horror movies such as "scream", of course but also "I know what you did last summer" or "the blair witch project". As a consequence, all these permanent silly things are spoiling the plot and you don't really care for it. It's useless to say that Weegan broaches with a lot of easiness, the trendy subjects of adolescence like sex, drugs and horror moviesMoreover, Keenan Ivory Weegan draws up a distressing portrait of his young actors; not only are they real cowards (which is normal) but they're also crude, dumb and above all sex maniacs. They're also kings of showing off. And a poor film-making doesn't add anything to a very bad taste set. To sum up, an ugly and sinister movie and if you laugh at a few (and rarely good) sequences like the Matrix' parody, you don't feel proud for all that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like this film. Mostly due to the fact that I found it more or less a complete rip-off. "Scary Movie" is not so much a parody on horror-movies as it is a blended mix of "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer". Unfortunately i doesn't stop at making references to these two films - it's more or less the exact same plot(s). Even the lines are sometimes the same. One joke for instance is exactly the same - just the name of the actor is different. There *are* some good references to other films like "The sixth sense", and yes - if you haven't seen the two (base-)films mentioned you might like this one but probably not otherwise. "Scream" was quite a good parody but this is more like a clone of a clone. Even the title is the same as the working-title for "Scream".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but more importantly, very intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are going to spoof some of the biggest films of the last few years, you had better know what you are talking about. You better make sure that you have something funny to say and an intelligent way of saying it because audiences, at one time or another, have already done, in their minds, what you are putting on film. We've already made cracks about how slow Michael, Jason and Freddy walk. We've already made comments about how it always seems to rain when women are running around with their see through blouses on. And we have already commented on how stupid Jennifer Love Hewitt is in I Know What You Did.... So to make a film that pokes fun at these films is not an afternoon excursion. It takes time, energy and research. And as a horror movie buff, an obsessed horror movie buff, I didn't have high hopes for this film, even with it's funny trailer. I thought that all the funny parts would be in the trailer and I would be left feeling cheated again as an apathetic spoof film about horror films came and went. I am glad to say that I was wrong. Not only is Scary Movie intelligent at it's look at scary movies over the last ten years, it is intelligent with many of it's other jokes. There is nothing prosaic about this effort.Scary Movie doesn't hold anything back. And I think it has the benefit of having Keanen Ivory Wayans direct it. Because some of the funnier jokes in the film are at the expense of black people. And since it is written by the Wayans ( who are very black )they can get away with more than a white guy could with some of the same material. For example, there is a scene in a movie theater when Regina King is talking too loud and she ends up being sliced, knifed and diced by the all white crowd. It is a very fuuny scene but one that a white director would have taken flack for no doubt. And when Marlon Wayans is telling another character about how there was a shooting at an all black showing of SCREAM, and everyone just left, again, it is funny but it is more accepted because it is a black person directing a black person. This is not to say that all the humour in the film is directed at blacks, because it's not. It's just that many of the scenes where blacks seem to make fun of themselves gets some of the best laughs. Some of the funniest jokes were about penises. One in particular when the Ryan Phillipe character from I KNOW has a picture delivered to him and it is him with an incredibly small member. He then shouts out, " This isn't funny. Having a small dick is a disability! You wouldn't make fun of a guy in a wheel chair now would you? " The crowd didn't stop laughing at that one for quite some time. There is also a funny parody on the "Whas UP!!! " Budweiser commercial and in one of the funniest scenes I have seen in any film in quite some time, a weed cutter is used to shave someone's pubic hair that has grown out of control. Scary Movie has a joke in every scene in the film and that is going to mean that not all of them are going to work, but most of them do. And not only is this film funny but it is smart. You will recall in Scream, the high school principal was from a 70's T.V. sitcom, well, so is he in here. You will recall in I STILL KNOW.... that when Jennifer Hewitt screams at the top of her lungs " What are you waiting for?" as the camera shoots an overhead view of her with her shirt wide open, so does Wayans. And the impression of Dewey is priceless. Also, Shawn Wayans does a pretty good impression of Mathew Lilliard from Scream, when near the end of the film he almost spits his word out to the camera. There are so many great moments of familiarity in here that if you do know the films that are being parodied, you are almost tempted to say to yourself, "Oh that's stupid, that part is so easy to spoof" until you realize that it takes a great mind that has at least somewhat of a love for the kinds of films he is making fun of. Scary Movie is funny, there is no doubt that but it is also smart and familiar. And that's not easy to do. This film is also raunchy, gross and it will probably be one of the top films of the summer. This has sleeper written all over it and that can be attributed to the Wayans brothers. They have written and directed a wonderful spoof of horror films and of films in general. And I highly recommend it.7.5 out of 10... Also watch for the smart take on the Usual Suspects. And see if you can figure out when it is going to come. It is also one of the funnier parts of the movie and it will make you curse yourself for not seeing it coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Onother one on the list of terrible parodies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with a summary, I hated it. To give a balance, I generally like parodies, going back to Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, up to Airplane, plus 'college' comedies like Aminal House, so possibly I've been spoilt by the best, by I also know and understand offensive, toilet humour. This film mainly tries to parody 'Scream' which was a parody in itself. How do you parody a parody? Other films included are generally the likes of 'I know what you did last summer' and also 'The Matrix', 'The Usual Suspects and 'The Sixth Sense'. However some, if not most of the parodies of those films fall extremely flat, or simply replay a certain type of scene without any real parody or joke.As said, Airplane is one of my favourite ever parodies, and it would be hard for any movie to match that, and many have tried and failed, but this movie seems like an attempt by a junior class of 12 year-olds. The 'funny bits' are bashed together generally, almost as if the different writers did all of their stuff separately, and didn't bother to a) make it gel and b) check if it was funny or not. The only way I can describe it is, a sub-sub-sub standard of other fairly okay parody movies. Zero out of ten from me.</fullReview>

I think these films that like to go laugh at stuff like this is to keep themselves from laughing at their own stupidity.I never really thought that acting stupid in a movie was funny. Now, if people were doing this stuff for real and not faking it would be funny. Ha Ha, but no it is obvious that watching this is like watching a stupid comedy play of how to be stupid and try and make people laugh at the dumb crap they can do on a movie set.

		<fullReview>As a long-time parody fan (Blazing Saddles and This is Spinal Tap come to mind), I was looking forward to this movie. After reading the reviews, I was expecting something great. I was sorely disappointed. It seemed like at least 75 percent of the film was lifted directly from the films it "parodied", sometimes almost word for word. The constant crude humor quickly became grating. It isn't possible to create a memorable film out of dozens of dick jokes without backing them up with good characters. This is why "Something About Mary" succeeded for me while "Scary Movie" failed. In fact, the only character I remember now is the stoner character, and this is only because I found him to be the most annoying of the lot. That this film broke the 100 million dollar mark shows the degree to which juvenile attitudes have pervaded modern cinema. I have enjoyed past Wayans (Keenan and Damon, anyway) projects and look forward to future endeavors, but please, take the word processor away from Shawn and Marlon before they strike again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting anything Oscar caliber nor was I expecting the next great comedy. I was, however, expecting to laugh and I can confidently say that I didn't laugh even once. It didn't offend me, it didn't gross me out. SCARY MOVIE was terribly unfunny, unoriginal, and uninspired. At one point, Shawn Wayans pretends one of his murder victims was responsible for the cancellation of his show. If that's the case, he should have been stabbing himself and his brother Marlon because, newsflash: THE WAYANS BROTHERS ARE NOT FUNNY. "In Living Color" was a good show until it lost its primary cast - "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" had its moments. "Don't Be a Menace . . " was forgivable. But through all of this, if you couldn't tell the yucks were stilted, you were kidding yourself. It's making tons of money, so we'll unfortunately be submitted to another Wayans tragedy in the near future.People have accused me of having no sense of humor in reference to this garbage, that I'm a movie snob, etc. The only thing scary is the fact this drivel now passes as comedy.</fullReview>

If the writers could truly write a funny script, it wouldn't have needed SO MANY sex scenes to the extent of being really SICK!It wasn't all that funny anyway, even though I saw most of the movies the parody was about. I definitely think the movie could have done with more jokes and less sex. I mean it, it was just too much! Don't go with your parents/children/siblings, cause you'll be in for a very uncomfortable and awkward time.In my opinion, this movie wasn't worth the ticket, and it most definitely wasn't worth missing "Jesse" and "Veronica's Closet", two shows that were on TV while I was at this movie.Bottom line: Forget about it, if you want a good comedy, see "The Whole Nine Yards", or any other movie, cause this one just isn't funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I came into Scary Movie with high expectations-- ready to laugh and have a good time-- and I actually giggled at the first few jokes, I soon realized what an awful disgusting movie this was, and that I was in for an hour and a half of unfunny racist, classist, sexist, homophobic, genitial/fellatio obsessed attempts at humor. This movie is so unbelievably awful that I almost can't stand to listen to anyone talk about how it was funny. (Note: most of these((the afore-mentioned people who think it was actually funny)) people are under the age of 13 and shouldn't have been able to see the movie anyway) When I left, I was so ashamed, especially when I looked over and saw ten year old children walking out as well.This film is really an argument for the toughing up of admissions at movie theaters. Though everyone accepts the fact that underage kids get into see movies-- especially R rated movies-- maybe things should be made much more difficult for them: the parent or guardian must be with them at all times.But the blame for this disgusting movie being brought to the public lies also in the ratings administration-- How could it not be NC-17! "Orgasmo" had 1/5 of the adult situations-- and in the companies from which it came: Dimension, through Miramax, and back finally to Disney, of all places. Parents, if you're upset- call Michael Eisner! You really can't blame the Weinstein brothers, they're just a pair of pimps-- exploiting foreign movies and artists, then taking the credit. But please, don't go to see this revolting movie. If you do, you're just reinforcing a terrible idea. As a knowledgable parent would say: "Don't encourage them." A note to the Ratings Board and to the Wayan's brothers: I've seen less Penises in double XX pornos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can a movie that spoofs a genre be adequately spoofed itself? Scary Movie answers that question with a resounding NO! First, let's clarify: When a movie genre begins spawning spoofs of itself, it's shoved into the "post-modern" category of film evolution. To make fun of Scream is to try and one-up a bigger, stronger, faster, smarter version of yourself! The Wayans brothers should have known better than to spoof a spoof. The movie emulates Scream too heavily to actually be a send-up. It's more like a remake with dirtier jokes. The parts that spoof other fright films are few and far between. It's like a REALLY LONG (read: repetitive and mind-numbing) skit from In Living Color/Mad TV (read: not even SNL quality). If you're a frat boy or a 13 year old (not old enough to get in, mind you), you'll probably enjoy it. Everyone else, stay away. It's horrid. I feel dumber just having seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to be that blunt but this is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. I understand that comedies are hard movies to make but there is no excuse for this film.I liked American Pie. I liked Something About Mary. I liked all the Naked Gun movies. Top Secret is a masterpiece of comedy. I'm not some crotchy old film critic; I'm a twentysomething college kid that loves fart and sex jokes as much as the next guy. But this movie was horrible.The acting and plot: subpar. But this was too be expected. The gags and jokes: all very predictable and poorly delivered. There's no subtelty. The jokes are forced down your throat. The references to Blair Witch, The Matrix, and The Usual Suspects are ridiculous and totally out of context.In summary, if you consider yourself to be a respectable member of our society please do not see this movie. It insults your intelligence. I cannot emphasize to you enough my disgust with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the trailers I thought this would be a funny horror spoof... mostly it was just kinda gross, not a "Something About Mary" gross, just nasty bodily fluid gross. The acting was ok but the same jokes over and over wore out pretty quick. The violence extreme and was almost exclusively against women to the point where it made me uncomfortable and I own "I Spit on Your Grave" on DVD. I will admit to laughing for the first 20 minutes or so but after that I just wanted to leave and it would seem that the rest of the audience agreed as it was incredibly silent in the theater. A few brave souls walked out but I tried to have faith the film would get better. There was nothing original or subtle about the humor ... everything was obviously lifted from other films and then went nowhere. I suppose if you're up for a few, ok more then a few, penis jokes this would be your film, but if you're looking for a good horror spoof save your money and hit the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene is fantastic and set me up for the horrific disappointment that was to follow. For every hilarious scene (and there were a few) there was something so ridiculously perverse that it made me think I would have better spent my money by simply flushing it down the toilet. I do not understand why people find these sickening displays so amusing. Even more disturbing was the way people in the theater screamed and even applauded the most immature sexually explicit scenes. I actually regret that I enjoyed any part of the movie. It's a shame that the good scenes had to be completely overshadowed by material that I'm reasonably sure some of my old junior high classmates could have composed. To me, in reference to all movies, romance as portrayed by graphic sex, action as displayed by graphic violence and humor as displayed by throwing in every curse word or sexual term you can think of is not very impressive. Romance that doesn't focus solely on sex (Playing by Heart), action without a massive body count (Twister) and humor without resorting to restroom stall scrawlings (Rocky and Bullwinkle) is truly creative.</fullReview>

I have nothing else to say of this film and I say nothing to the people that give this movie good reviews. This belongs in the bottom 100, where all those parody movies belong.

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst "comedies" I have seen in a long, long time. In fact, the only so-called "comedy" that was as horrible as this one, was "There's Something about Mary"."Scary Movie" is an obvious, desparate attempt at duplicating the humour of classics like "Airplane", "Top Secret" and the "Police Squad" / "Naked Gun" series. Unfortunately, "Scary Movie" fails miserably. I am a huge fan of parody movies and tend to prefer this type of comedy over plain Hollywood cookie-cutter comedy. But if you're a fan of good spoofs and parodies, if you think this movie is going to be anything like those - think again! This one is a true stinker. It's not about the acting, the storyline or direction. I'm talking about the movie as a whole. Entertainment value = zero.Highly overrated - save your money and instead go rent an *actual good* comedy, like "Fatal Instinct" or "Police Squad".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STUPID Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" is a parody film about Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) and her dimwitted and muttonheadedfriends, who run their car over a guy whom they think is dead, and they dump his body into the water. Soon, only a year after the incident, Cindy's friends are dying thanks to some phsycho killer who is just as stupid as the teens. Alright...in the film, they say, "Does Scream have a plot? Noooo...!!! Did "I Know What You Did Last Summer" make any sense? No!"Well, let's put it this way: Compared to this movie...they do!My friends saw this movie before me and they took me last night to see it. Well anyway, while they are laughing their asses off at almost every scene in the movie, I just sat there and thought to myself, "Why did I even bother?!"I will admitt, I've seen quite a few really boring movies this year (excluding "Frequency"), but this one was THE WORSE!!!! I will say, though, that I happened to have found maybe only three parts funny, but everything else was pointless!What do you get when you watch this movie? You get parodies of a few 90's horror films ("Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "The Blair Witch Project", "The Sixth Sense"), a really, really pointless plot that makes NO SENSE whatsoever (not even the ending made any sense!), and everyone knows what you get when you have a horrible plot...a horrible script!!! Speaking of the script, perhaps the worse was when Cindy says, "But Ginger Spice was an important part of the Spice Girls!" That line came when Anna Faris and Jon Abrahams (who plays Cindy's boyfriend Bobby) do a parody of the "She's gone..." part in "Scream" between Neve Campbell and Skeet Urlich. And of course...it has nothing to do with the film!I cannot tell anyone not to go see this movie, because everyone has different tastes in film, but let's just saying that the ONLY thing I enjoyed while watching this movie was the popcorn I was eating (Yummy!)!!! I voted "1" for AWFUL!!!! Yet if you like dumb-witted comedies such as these, have something which I didn't have - FUN! :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Trey Parker and South Park, and for that reason some people would call my sense of humour "sick". But when I saw this movie I was severely disappointed by the overuse of offensive material that just wasn't funny.My favorite parody movies are Naked Gun-type parodies. Another favorite of mine is "Orgazmo".Scary Movie just was not funny enough to warrant all the disgusting material. With the exception of the opening scene I didn't laugh at all. The rest of the theatre laughed quite a bit, but it was mostly out of horror, shock and necessity. My laughs seemed forced. They were artificial.And to top all of that off, some of it made no sense. The "riverdancing-in-midair" scene made absolutely no sense.Most of the jokes were unoriginal. I've seen the Blair Witch Project flashlight scene on about ten different television shows and commercials. Why did Keenan Ivory Wayans think I'd laugh at it just one more time? There wasn't anything special about this movie, with the exception of an overabundance of male genitalia.If you're into movies with some offensive material that are ACTUALLY FUNNY you should check out some Trey Parker films, such as the under-rated "Baseketball". You might actually laugh at something funny.</fullReview>

I'm a rabid fan of b-films, pre-80s slasher films, Troma Films, britcoms, and all sorts of other bizarre genres, but SCARY MOVIE is Hollywood eating its own biowaste, folks.THIS FILM SHOULD BE ERASED FROM THE TIMELINE. And its creators with it.No plot to speak of. No acting. No class. The lowest, most degenerate form of entertainment, surpassing Jerry Springer and watching beached whales die. We watched it at the Drive-In, hoping for a Drive-In sort of movie. Afterwards, we all but made a blood oath to rid the world of SCARY MOVIE and its responsible parties. Shaft came afterward, and what a relief to watch such a miracle of filmmaking after suffering through this trite (anything could have been seen as a miracle after this film)! AVOID THIS MOVIE!I can imagine how popular this film will be, and by looking at it's opening-weekend sales, I am now convinced that perhaps someone should push the red button. If anyone reading is responsible for the making of this film, please seek therapy. The humor in this film might promote a few suicides and make a few citizens wretch with disgust, but it will also entertain a large number of Americans. This is sad. And true.AVOID THIS MOVIE! Paying for it will encourage Hollywood to make more, and we don't want that unless it creates a serendipitous moment, a terrible on-set tragedy which might rid the world of anyone with the desire to make another one like it.</fullReview>

I thought this would be a funny thingg, since the Trilogy is done, and now we have something to laugh at, and I knew it was a parody...So I thought it would be pretty cool. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, this movie basically copied Scream. I had to double check my ticket to see if this was Scream or Scary Movie! They took about 3/4 of the lines from Scream...which, some lines are okay, but I mean, comon! I know they were poking fun, but did they have to say exactly everything that happened? And...the acting I felt was horrible. If you are going to use the same lines as Scream, then at least ACT them like the movie did. The trailer makes this movie look much better than it actually is. The only death that was funny was Shannon Elizabeth...And, I didn't even know half of the characters names!!! I thought Shannon Elizabeth did pretty good...But everything else...was just Godawful. And, what is with all of the Sex jokes??? They were gross and stupid...I would've paid $4.50 to see American Pie if I wanted to see sex jokes...I know that this was just a parody and these movies shouldn't be taken seriously, but when you're spoofing horror movies, you don't need the same lame jokes over and over!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got to see the sneak preview of Scary Movie last Thursday night - for free. I remember first hearing about the movie back when they were going to call it, "Scream If You Know What I Did Last Summer," and was looking forward to it. I heard last week that Mom &amp; Pop Wayans left during the premiere. I now understand why.The movie had its funny points where I laughed heartily. Those were few and far between. Most of the time, I was embarrassed to be in the theater, with the people I was with. Many of the sight gags had me gagging. This movie was definitely more gross than funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this movie incredibly bad?? Surely they could a comedy movie much better than this! Anyway, what kind of comedy is this? I have never once seen a film like this. I think this film is *VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY* overrated. *****.6 out of **********. WHAT?! I think it should be * out of **********. I've only watched this first scary movie. I would not want to watch the other three. But i want to know how the sequels to this can be even worse because its just...there's no proper word for it. All i can say is that i think this film should have never been made...WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS FILM SO MUCH? what a bad comedy film. If i could change the rating for this on IMDb i would...and if you could to a zero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I have to say: This is simply the most awful thing I have ever seen. I'll never get those two hours back! I think I saw this when I was 16(?) and even then I couldn't believe just how awful this movie was. I hope to god I can help prevent at least one person reconsider seeing this awful, awful, awful piece of trash. It's not even funny! Obviously it's crude, but many movies are very funny as a result of crude humour. This movie just does everything wrong. I would rather sit thru Santa With Muscles or Baby Geniuses 2. This is by far the worst thing I have ever seen on a movie screen. I could die happy if I knew that no one else would ever see this movie again. Thanks for listening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Scream' for Idiots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 0 (out of 10)Let's talk about parodies. A parody movie is made or broken at its basic concept with the filmmaker's understanding of how a good parody movie works and a knowledge of what it is parodying. From that understanding the movie is pretty much all or nothing. 'Scary Movie' gleefully flaunts itself ignorance around for 80 minutes and invites it's audience to revel it their own ignorance as well. This turkey doesn't know the first thing about parody, its supposed objects of ridicule or even how to ridicule them. And it just gets worse as it goes, dragging out a barrage of eye-rolling, groan-inducing, shock value based jokes that aren't really jokes but the appearance of a joke.It amazes me that the `scene specific parody' is even considered a legitimate subgenera by most critics (Roger Ebert gave this garbage 3 stars!). It's content is simply to lazily recreate scenes from other movies and change them up just enough to avoid having to pay royalties. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and co-written and co-staring brothers Shawn an Marlon Wayans (fresh from the recently cancelled WB sitcom) the movie seeks to poke fun at `late '90s slasher movie conventions' - all to obviously meaning the resurgence of the genera since 1997's `Scream'.The Wayans seem blame that resurgence on `Scream' and devote much of this movie to recreating scenes from that trilogy, sometimes without changing anything at all (Matthew Lillard's 'Psycho' quote is repeated verbatim). It is so blatant it recalls Gus Van Sant's reworking of 'Psycho' in which he simply gave Joseph Stephano scriptwriting credit. Where `Scream' tapped into the 11th (or Y) generation's ironic sense of humor, all `Scary Movie' does is assume teens like sex jokes/gross out humor. The `jokes' in 'Scary Movie' are the changes themselves (such as Carmen Electra stopping to strip off her clothes while running from the killer through a sprinkler, or a disembodied head talking back to its killer) with no regard to putting any substance or bite beyond an intrinsic level. Its base level pandering to the lowest common denominator: display a `joke' about sex or drugs or recreate a popular catch phrase or trailer moment from another movie and the audience will laugh it up on cue like a pack of Pavlovian dogs.The problem with `Scary Movie' is on its basic level: it doesn't seem to understand what `Scream' was about and doesn't know how to parody it. The Wayans brothers view the series as part of the cliché universe of slasher movies when it was actually a self-mocking satire of those clichés. They think `Scary Movie' is clever when it's just being a redundant parody of a smart parody that already covered this same territory. All the Wayans brothers have done here is created a parasite that's stand-alone purpose is to live off and suck out the vibrant life, wit and timely social commentary of a great movie. (Mostly, I speak of `Scream' and `Scream 2' as great since they where the movies that inspired the late-'90s rip-offs and the 3rd merely rode the wave across the finish line with it's early 2000 release.)But there's more. The movie doesn't stop at `Scream', `I Know What You Did Last Summer' &amp; `The Blair Witch Project' (2 movies so bad they set up ample targets to be mocked and the Wayans still can't hit them), but the assembly line writers attempt to take on anything that was popular at that time. Yes, actors lean back and dodge flying plates in slow motion, run around desperate to loose their virginity, and look into the camera and tell us they see dead people for no other purpose than that it would look good taken out of context in a trailer. If you ever wanted the ending of `The Usual Suspects' ruined for you this is the movie to see. It is all so scattershot and without vision that it appears all the writers wrote it separately and then threw their drafts together without giving it a once over to see if anything fit together. There are even moments that the jokes double back on themselves such as when a killer claims his motive is "lack of sex" despite having sex in the previous scene.The Wayans brothers don't get that the fun of a parody is when it is slipped in subtly with an existing story and the audience is able to feel clever when they pick up the double entendres based on their own movie knowledge. The more subtle and well woven the parody, the more satisfying and funny it is for those of us that recognize it. The more we feel the movie is talking directly to us. Think `Dogma' (or any Kevin Smith work), `Seinfeld', `The Simpsons' or, well, `Scream`. `Scary Movie' doesn't talk directly to anybody. It casts it's net far and wide laying out things as plain as day so that no one will feel left out. The dirty little secret here is that you don't even have to have seen the movies in question to get the references. Who doesn't know that the phrase `I see dead people' is from 'The Sixth Sense'? The only people who will think this movie is clever or funny will need to have been living under a rock, going out of their way to ignore every trailer, commercial, fad and catch phrase of the past 2 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Slightly Smarter Than Scream 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming out in 2000, the Wayans and their parody entrepreneurs were up against another film stomping on the Scream license, that being Scream 3. One would end a franchise (for a while) that started with greatness and the other would start another franchise that wish it could be as clever as the other film however dumb it is.Much how Craven revisited Woodsboro eleven years later, there was a morbid curiosity in seeing if sixteen years later Scary Movie ever deserved even one sequel. Almost guiltily the potential for a franchise is there in a lowbrow if decent enough comedy. Perhaps it's an ironic form of nostalgia having witnessed the desolate laugh vacuums that were the later entries such as Epic Movie or Disaster Movie but the original is not that bad at all.It's biggest compliment being it actually resembles a film. In that it follows a basic three act structure, has a natural pace adopted from source material, and even characters that abide by basic archetypes while showing a smidgen of actor personality. These all seem a given however after enduring the quality of the latter films, the restrained assemblage of film parodies here all compliment each other well, tied together and flowing along with a sense of competency long gone now.After complimenting the actual ability to parody horror films, this is also a Wayans film. It's not entirely unexpected that a fair 80% of the punchlines are basically "the joke is I'm black" with the other percent being "I'm gay". While the diet-homophobia is fairly tone deaf (the killer's motive simply being he's gay, oh wait, one of them just 'acts' gay... cue laughter) the Wayans do manage to land a solid amount of racial humour. One timeless if easy gag being the all black news team reporting they're "getting the f*** outta here!" before speeding off. It's also funny in an ever-so-slightly awkward way watching Scream afterwards the sheer complete absence of any PoC actors in that film, which seems to be intentionally and heavily corrected in the sequel.It's this humour that seems to answer the age old debate of whether a bold and uncompromising comedy like Blazing Saddles could be made today. Let's be clear: the Wayans are no Mel Brooks. That being said, it's almost disappointing that after a first solid entry, the Scary Movie franchise could've improved over time and become almost respectable in skewering of the genre. Unfortunately it strayed from scary movies like Icarus attempting to tackle all of cinema and forgot what the word satire meant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Shameless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie is a parody of the teenage slasher genre, and luckily a very funny parody indeed. Keenan Ivory Wayans is the mastermind, and he has assembled a fairly standard group of teenagers and a psychopath, and gives them the opportunity to completely spoof the slasher genre. The "plot," such as it is, happens as a result of the teenagers out cruising with much hard alcohol accidentally hit someone, mistake him for dead, and then accidentally kill him when they throw his body into the bay to dispose of it. We suspect that somehow the victim rose from the dead or recovered to be the psychopath, but we are never quite sure. The psychopath, with a bunch of hilarious changeable masks out of the Scream movies, attempts to kill all the teens, but has some misadventures along the way.This movie is completely shameless, and anyone with a sense of decency should be warned. If you do not mind this issue, however, the movie has some great laughs. One scene that sticks out in my mind pretty much encapsulates this movie's strategy: at one point, the killer opens the door on a bunch of teenage boys who are watching TV and smoking ridiculous amounts of pot. They are completely helpless and about to get slaughtered when one of them has the presence of mind to offer the killer a smoke. After a few puffs, everyone starts laughing hysterically together, and then they all decide to start making threatening phone calls to potential victims (giggling all the time). The scene has an ironic ending that I will not give away for fear of tripping the spoiler alert. The killer has lots of moments where things don't go right and you think, man, it is tough to be psychopath. The teenagers are a study in human superficiality and often seem to preoccupied with their own issues to notice that they are slowly being sliced and diced. The sight gags are quite good and their are some legit surprises that keep you guessing. All in all, it is an hour and a half of quite effective tasteless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wazzup?...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie" is a funny spoof, for sure. But it is not the best of all the "Scary Movies" in the franchise. That being said, don't get me wrong here, because this movie is fun and entertaining, especially so if you enjoy comedies that is a spoof on other movies."Scary Movie" does have an overall storyline, which is very similar to the storyline found in "Scream", although elements from other famous movies are thrown into the mixture to spice it up. And it does work out quite nicely.The list of movies and TV series that are being spoofed is just great. I didn't catch all of these spoofs and references, not by a long shot. And if you enjoy spoof comedies, then you should check out those listed under the "Connections" heading and then "Spoofs".The laughs are bountiful throughout "Scary Movie" and the comedy is really great. It was right up my alley, so I was really amused by the comedy throughout this movie.The cast list in "Scary Movie" was also quite good, and those cast for the roles were all doing good jobs and individually brought something unique and nice to the movie. And this really lifted up the movie quite a bit.And "Scary Movie" is also the movie that brought the 'wazzup?' thing and made it popular."Scary Movie" is entertaining and funny, although you must like spoofs in order to really appreciate this movie (or the franchise as such).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless 'remake' of "Scream"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, the makers of this movie (the Wayans brothers-who also star) decided to pretty much, in my view, make a scene by scene remake of the vastly superior horror/comedy "Scream"."Scream" was a witty hatchet job on all the conventions of the horror movie which we now take for granted-take for granted because of movies like "Scream".Now, presumably, the Wayans brothers missed all the wit of "Scream" and thought it would be funnier with low-brow humour. It definitely isn't.From memory (it's been a few years since I saw it on network TV) it also 'parodies' other movies of around the time, like "I know what you did last summer". Can't really remember too much about it...it's more a narrative movie than the latter sketch comedy movies in this franchise. In any case, if you've seen "Scream", you'll know how this movie plays out, but it will just have a more lowest common denominator sense of humour to it.Even though I did find this movie a dud (glad I didn't pay to see it!), I do recommend the sequel-the second one I think, which parodies such movies as The Exorcist. That one, especially, really marked the high water mark for these comedy makers.Not sure how many of this franchise I've seen afterwards...I do know that I saw the last cinema release (Scary Movie 4) and was again disappointed by the Wayans' efforts. Some of the latter movies had the involvement of the guys behind the brilliant comedy "Flying High" (a.k.a. "Airplane!") (Zucker and Abrahams), which I've reviewed here. They couldn't quite recapture the magic of their past efforts though.Overall-Scary Movie is a film to avoid. The second movie is well worth watching though-it helps if you've seen films like "House on Haunted Hill" for that though, to get some of the parody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very funny and it spawned a series of sequels, there's talk about a fifth one coming out. Shawn and Marlon Wayans are hilarious, loved them in the Wayans Brothers TV show. This movie is hilarious, it takes all those teen horror flicks and parodies them. What movies does it parody you might ask, well flicks like "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and the unforgettable, "The Sixth Sense".I love Anna Faris as well, she's so talented, hard to believe this is her first movie. She's very funny, Baywatch fans will love Carmen Electra in her cameo role. Jon Abrahams, he's very funny to, all around good guy. Lochlyn Monroe, totally loved him in this, Shannon Elizabeth too, she's great at doing a parody of Sarah Michelle Gellar.The movie is pretty funny, if you thought "Scream" was pretty hokey, you'll love this movie, it's pretty good. It does have some toilet humor, but hey, what teen movie doesn't. It's really funny. I remember when this movie came out on VHS, I had to rent it at least 3 times, before I bought it, just so I could show everybody how funny it was. There's a lot of great lines, as well great acting, oh they also parody the "Matrix" it's good. Watch it and see how many movies you can see that they made fun of. It's great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should've gone straight to video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find the fact that this movie is so highly acclaimed is an unfortunate indicator of the collective IQ of 75-90% of the human population under 30 (hint: it's the same number as the rating I gave this film). I'm sure there were one or two funny things, but hell if I can remember. The matrix parody where Cindy freezes in mid-air is done extremely poorly. A lot of things they parodied have already been parodied better, and many of them are the kind of things that only need to be parodied once.For instance, they parodize a zoom-in shot by accidentally going too far and bashing Cindy in the head with the camera. This was already done in Spaceballs, and it was done better. When Dark Helmet got hit with the camera, he fell to the ground unconscious and they went on to the next scene. In this atrocity, Cindy just backs up and fakely says "OW!" like the stupid brown-haired blonde she is. Some people may say the fact that the "OW" was fake was funny. It was not. Bad acting is not equal to comedy. Plus, she gets hit by the actual lens, which at this point looks like it must be the size of a TV screen, and obviously doesn't have that shroud around the front of the lens. But all that aside, the parody was done in Spaceballs. We get the point. Don't turn a funny thing like this into something that gets thrown into all parodies just as a cheap way to increase the lulz factor.A good indicator of how funny someone is, is whether or not they can think of real jokes without having to resort to blatant and profane references to sex and drugs. The sexual innuendo was old before they even started it. I can just imagine some bozo behind a desk saying, "hey, I can't come up with any real jokes so let's just have the guy say 'LOL I WAS HOPING TO HAVE MY BALLS LICKED'". Yeah, that's good comedy right there. "Stop sticking your dick in the vacuum cleaner"? Wtf? As if that joke wasn't lame enough, two shots later they've got to show Doofus walking around the house with a vacuum cleaner hose and a hardon. The drug jokes aren't much better. "Lunch isn't a subject." "It is when you've got the munchies!" How is this even remotely funny? Because it's an obscure reference to the fact that the character is on cannabis? Please. His acting is an all too obvious indicator that he smokes more weed than your local police chief, and even if it wasn't, the joke is just not funny. Someone needs to realize that just because a joke has blatant references to sex and/or drugs does not make it remotely funny. And the shots of partially naked male actors, well that's just disgusting. Go back to your fraternity, you're a disgrace to real men.If this movie wasn't bad enough, they've got to make not one, not two, but three sequels. Come on! Three movies is the limit in almost all cases, the only exceptions being ongoing series like Star Trek and Star Wars, and series that focus on one "ultra-hero" like James Bond, Indiana Jones, and Columbo. Even the Godfather, which was a series, was still only three movies, with no conceivable reason to make a fourth. They knew when to quit. The Terminator? Terminated, after three. The way they left it, I see no reason for them to make a forth. But Scary Movie's got to pass that three movie barrier, even though there's not enough content unique to the series to even be able to carry through so many movies. Why? It's not like the cast qualifies as an ultra-hero, because they lack character development and - no brainer for "ultra-hero" here - HEROISM. If the movies were simply better I could understand three. But without adding a lot to the movies as a series, even if they were good movies to start with there'd be no reason to break the trilogy barrier.If they were good movies I could understand three. They're not. Two was already pushing it, but I could understand them wanting a second hit after the crack high the first movie seemed to produce. For some inane reason, though, people just keep lapping these movies up like antifreeze in a dog's bowl, and the producers keep selling out by laying more of these cables on the collective intelligence (or lack thereof) of society.</fullReview>

The film is about a group of teenagers who are being stalked by a killer. There is a large cast of characters who end up in different situations and who risk to avoid being killed off. This is another one of those throw-away films that you will either love watching a couple times or hate before it is finished. It's generally a film for teenagers with some crude humor and situations, which can be funny if you appreciate that sense of humor. There is no artistic merit here nor any novelty.

Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and written by the Wayans Brothers (Shawn and Marlon Wayans - they also star in this). While some of the jokes are a way too raunchy, for the most part, the script is very smart and the dialogue very funny (with great spoofs including the Scream movies, The Sixth Sense, and Amistad). While the acting is strong all around from this ensemble, the best actors are Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell (a Scream name spoof) and Regina Hall (as the hilarious Brenda Meeks) - both of these actors will come back for each of the films so far (try to figure out how Brenda keeps coming back for each film!). The Carmen Elektra cameo at the beginning of the film is a riot too! A solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt in my mind that this movie achieves its main objective - yielding a lot of laughs from the viewer. While parodying various scenes from well known scary movies, the Wayans brothers have the knack for adding one-liners that are just hysterical. Cheri Oteri as Gail Hailstorm is golden with her delivery, some of the funnier examples include chasing after Cindy for an interview and yelling "Cindy, your ass looks fat!", and as she recollects herself after being floored "okay, who copped a feel?". Anna Faris as Cindy is a real find, and spot on with her feigning of Neve Campbell-esquire fear. However, the big winner in this movie for me is Regina King, who plays Brenda. My friends and I have often found ourselves replaying her scene where she is watching Shakespeare in Love, where every line is pure gold. A must for the DVD collection.</fullReview>

A good deal of the jokes hit the funny bone greatly (well those that don't involve Dookie, or lame dated Matrix gags). Yeah it's VERY juvenile, potty humor, but I'd be darned if it doesn't work. I found myself laughing countless times. Don't see this film if you're an overly sensitive PC wuss, but for fans of this brand of comedy it's a real treat indeed. Followed by two god awful sequels and at last one more in the works. This is the only one that contains ANY laugh out loud moments and I'd advise you to actively avoid it's sequels.My Grade: B DVD Extras: 6 Deleted scenes; a 7 minute Behind-the-Scenes Featurette; Theatrical Trailer; trailers for the "Scream" box set, "Gone in 60 Seconds, "Don't be a menace while drinking your juice in the Hood", "Senseless", &amp; "Hellraiser: Bloodlines"; and a Scary Movie soundtrack promo DVD-ROM Features: Screen Saver, Screenplay Viewer, Character Profiles and Scary Movie: Guide for the Culturally Challenged</fullReview>

For example, doofy, the retarded deputy shares a hilarious moment with his sisterDoofy: "mom says that you have to start respecting me now that i am a police officer"To which is sister replies "mom also says that you have to stop sticking your dick into the vacum cleaner!"OK, sure it's stupid, but all the best comedies (in my opinion) are. Comedies aren't meant to make you think, they are there so you can laugh at ludicrously stupid and unrealistic situations. My bottom line, if you liked "American Pie" or "Team America" then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was the sentiment I experienced while waiting in line for this movie. It isn't clever or witty. There is nothing intelligent to be found within. It parodies practically every horror movie ever made, and those left out will undoubtedly be picked up with the subsequent sequels. I won't bother naming them, as it really doesn't matter.This was a fun, but inane endeavor. It entertains, but only on the most base level. I'm not surprised it wow-ed at the box office, as there are many herds of the mindless flocking about. I say mindless, as this does nothing to pique your imagination, creativity, or cognitive abilities. Now, I realize not all theatrical attempts can be an intellectual exercise. But this is intellectually in the negative.It was mildly amusing, but nothing more. This work exhibited the lowest form of juvenile humor and grossed some $200M in box offices around the world. Just goes to show you, there's no accounting for taste.It rates a 2.3/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the people found this movie was too much, too gross. Well I have to say that I love this kind of stupid movie. Taking Scream and follow its script in literally making all situations funny, is a great job. Just look at Ray the guy who doesn't even know he is gay, and the killer who makes me laugh everytime I see him. I have seen this movie 5 times now and will probably see it again and again. Much better than the second one, Scarymovie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it hard to put into words how bad this film is. Scary movie is supposed to be a spoof of all the horror movies that have hit our screens over the past few years. The problem is i thought spoofs were meant to be funny. This is so amazingly unfunny it is hard to believe.I sat through this movie , stunned at how bad the so called jokes were. The was only one funny moment in this film and that was when the Gym teacher revealed her secret. One funny scene in 90 minutes is as bad a it gets when it comes to comedy. I find far too many Hollywood films stink like Scary Movie and i have come to the conclusion that it is the childish American sense of humour that does not appeal to me. Why does every US comedy involve farting? It was funny first time round with Blazing Saddles but why have we had to endure it in nearly every other American comedy since? Have they never heard of overkill? This film is so bad that the only way to sum it up is to say Please, please dont waste an hour and an half of you life with it. 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pure evil. Undistilled, simple, heinous evil.The 80's were about bigger and bigger explosions, the 90's are about bigger and bigger disgusting, unreal sex jokes. The Wayans boys thought: "Hmm, the Farrelys are making money. Let's just make an incredibly stupid movie for frat boys everywhere!"This film is degrading to humans and other life forms. The lead character is subjected to forms of sexual abuse that would make people picket a porno theatre (and people are letting their kids watch this). The makers thought that parodying a self-parody like "Scream" somehow makes sense; instead they end up recycling exact dialogue from other movies and we're supposed to laugh at it?If you give it a second of thought, this movie is disgusting, insulting, and frankly about as funny as "The Sweet Hereafter." To be blunt: I'd rather have my entire body shaved by a jittery chimpanzee on a caffeine high before ever watching even one second of this piece of crap ever again!

		<fullReview>'Scary Movie', itself part of a long lineage of movie spoofs of culturally prominent movies, has provoked a similarly ancient critical kneejerk reaction, whereby the present offering under consideration is deemed beneath contempt, puerile, imbecilic, lacking any kind of wit or invention, especially when compared to a recent, once reviled predecessor. Last year saw the bizarre sight of 'Porky's' being used as a stick of quality with which to beat the wretched 'American Pie'. Now 'Scary Movie' has none of 'Pie''s saving graces.Of course it doesn't. 'Pie' was an extremely rich and intelligent comedy of manners, with strong emotional underpinning and humour firmly rooted in character. And I said so last year. 'Scary' cannot be a comedy of character, because protagonists in a spoof are mere ciphers, at the service of the satirical demands of each scene. So, Brenda, streetwise and coolly cynical at the beginning of the film, becomes a shrieking boor at the screening of 'Shakespeare in love' (an understandable response). This isn't a development of character or situation - the filmmakers have different things to say in each scene. Interestingly, the first scene is based on a kind of realistic, character-based comedy, however mocked - the move towards abstraction is typical of the movie as a whole.It is initially dismaying how crude the satire actually is, merely a re-enacting of a handful of scenes that weren't terribly serious in the first place. A far more devastating spoof would puncture the pretensions of 'Schindler's List', say, but no-one would ever dare. You could say the same about 'Airplane' - the original 'Airport' films were hardly weighty philosophical tracts - but its spoof's humour has actually transcended its source, whereby it is eminently possible to enjoy 'Airplane' without ever having seen the originals. If you have not seen the 'Scream' trilogy or 'I know what you did last summer', at least, you will miss 99% of this movie; and even if you have, the humour rarely stretches beyond recognition.A lot of people have complained, as they did with 'Casino Royale' or 'Austin Powers', that you cannot spoof a spoof, that the original 'Scream' itself was a sly wink at a jaded genre. But look at how quickly the fresh air of that film became dank with complacency, how its codes and practices quickly became the mainstream, unassailable, monolithic. 'Scary Movie' is perfectly right to attack it, but it only scratches at its superficials - never catches the deeper currents of Craven's work, the analysis of play and family, the Shakespearean pretensions.Once one gets past dismay at the primitive satire, the casual homophobia, the fact that the creator is in his late 30s and severely out of touch with the milieu he's describing, 'Movie' is still a very, very funny movie in spirits, outrageous physical humour being timeless in its appeal. There are some good serious points - the overwhelming whiteness of a genre not quite deconstructed by Craven; the casual racism of arthouse snobs; the brilliant 'Amistad II' joke which exposes the double standards of Hollywood worthiness more effectively than a thousand wordy articles.Many of the jokes are deadly accurate male adolescent fears - fear of the reality of female sexuality (brilliantly visualised in the dismemberment of SHannon Elizabeth, straight out of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'), concomitant anxieties about gender. But the truth is we watch - and enjoy - 'Movie' for the pendulous testes and volcanic ejaculate jokes. Yeah, fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this collection of scattershot gags was made in Hong Kong in the late eighties, people would be acclaiming it as a masterpiece in Film Comment. Since it had the poor fortune to be made by a black man with a checkered television career, the makers will have to content themselves with the fortune it will no doubt reap in the coming weeks. But let there be no mistake: SCARY MOVIE is less a spoof of Kevin Williamson than a flurry of comic aggression that takes the pulse of the culture in this moment better than anything else around.First ogling, then demeaning, then physically damaging a passel of hot white women, the movie seems more an expression of the unconscious of one Orenthal Simpson than Keenen Ivory Wayans; then, a minute later, along comes a Chris Rock-style joke about a black woman making a big noise in a screening of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE that's so shocking you'd think Wayans was remaking PUTNEY SWOPE for the millennium. Psychotically fixated on closet cases, and brandishing body-part surrealism that out-wacky's the Farrellys, SCARY MOVIE needs no more defense than that it sustains the unsustainable for a painfully funny 85 minutes. But look a little harder and you'll see--though no doubt no one intended this--a perfect slapstick-surreal time capsule of America in this moment: racially confused (though in the middle of some weird miscegenational sex act), sexually angry, inexplicably giddy, and--as a masterful wrap-up image notes--headed for a big old car crash.</fullReview>

Even "Dracula-Dead and Loving It" is better than this garbage. The jokes are there in "Scary Movie"... they're just not funny. If you find a man asking his girl to dress up like a football player because he doesn't realize he's gay hilarious, or penises going through a man's ear a real scream, this one is for you. As for me, I found myself cringing and cursing the people who said this was funny as I sat in the theater with my friend wondering why we'd spent our hard-earned money to watch it. We ended up leaving the theater, and I almost never quit watching a movie, no matter how awful (I sat all the way through Robin Williams' "Being Human," no less). I'm telling you, don't waste your time or you'll regret it. It's not even one of those "so bad it's funny" movies like "Cool as Ice" or "Stone Cold."

		<fullReview>Seriously, I turned this movie off. I thought it would make me laugh out loud. I heard it was smart and funny. I have been lied too.Scary Movie has to be the worst spoof I have ever seen. It is not at all funny, just dumb and offensive. The horrid jokes include dumb teenagers accidentally touching each other, policemen defecating, stereotyping and people cross-dressing. There is even one scene where a girl gets stabbed in the breast and, when the knife is pulled out, there is a chunk of ice attached to it. (I later found out that all it was stating was that the actress had breast implants. Bad joke.)Instead of actually laughing, I found myself saying "What?" when trying to figure out the humor. The only funny part was the man who was thought to be dead, but really wasn't, and that was hardly funny at all! I turned it off after the movie showed a picture of a man's genitals. How repulsive. That is solid proof that it is a bad movie, because I have sat through the Cat in the Hat and Jaws: The Revenge. On a second viewing, I found two funny parts. The first was the "Can you see me?" part, and the second was "Does Scream have a plot?", but they couldn't hold back on the disgusting scenes, could they? The cross-dresser scene and hair coming out of the underwear scene were very, very disgusting and repulsive.This movie is the first movie I have ever rated a 1.1/10</fullReview>

Having said what it is, I consider this the worst movie I've ever seen because it qualifies as a hollywood movie but is no different than an underground porn flick. The parodies were weakly done and overused. The acting, needless to say, was stupid. The plot, there really is none. This movie took little effort to make, yet it is popular among many of the youths today because all you need in a movie to make the general teen populace laugh is a comedic porn movie, and thats exactly what this movie is. -10/10</fullReview>

If you want to see a really smart comedy check "Shooting fish" and omit such movies.

Overall the Scream and the entire Trilogy and among my favorite films of all time. So the idea that the cynical banter would be lightened and made fun of as cynical banter sounded like it was capable of holding at least some humor in it.Despite these low expectations it was still a disappointment. In fact this is now among the highly select group of movies I have walked out of, consisting only of the Touch of Evil rerelease and the live-action Spawn movie. This movie takes bad taste to a new level and attempts to out-gross anything that the Creators of American Pie or the Farrely brothers could even dream of. It lacked any sort of value and the humor was entirely geared towards the stupid, hormone driven teenage male.This movie is a complete and utter waste of time and money and despite the fact that I didn't pay for it at all, I still wish I had been given something to at least somewhat equal that squandered hour of my life that will never be returned.</fullReview>

This movie disappears below the surface entirely because there is almost nothing funny in it. Indeed, many scenes have been lifted whole from "Scream" and "Scary Movie" without the addition of any humorous twist whatsoever.OK the movie theatre scene is quite funny and Anna Faris is as good as the script will allow as the terrorised virgin, but that's all I have to say in favour of this limp and tasteless attempt to rip off moviegoers.If the horror spoof mini-genre appeals to you I would recommend the similar, but mildly amusing "Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth".</fullReview>

It was lame. It appears as though the cast got together had a few cold ones and said 'Wouldn't it be funny if.....' and then filmed it. It was simply a romp through current pop-culture references with no sense of humor or sarcasm or irony. Just imitate this scene, imitate that movie. It falls completely flat. I do not think I laughed once. Maybe crakced a smile here or there. Maybe.

		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead!I saw Scary Movie on the big screen. The cinema was crowded and all the people really enjoyed the movie, me too. Even the most weird jokes, like the fountain-like ending of a sexual encounter made me laugh loud. I was amused, while my friends kept saying that it was a bad movie. Half a year later I wanted to see it again, to think again about this film. I rented it on video recently. Well, and again I was laughing hysterically at some times. The job of a comedy is to make me laugh - Scary Movie made me laugh. But.. I see myself as a sentient being, and I realize that Scary Movie is bad. Really Bad. The humor is beyond stupid. One half of the film is f*rt-jokes, another half is about oral-***. Add some p***s-jokes, and some stuff about being/looking homosexual. Everything is mixed together with the help of a lot of references to other scary movies. Is it funny? No doubt! But only when your brain is on stand-by while watching. Otherwise you'll notice the the unbearable quality of the script. People deliver strange lines, but it goes unnoticed by the other characters. It's as if while somebody is saying something, all the other chars are deaf. They don't listen to each other. (Like the loud announcement of the party - Sidney does not react.) This kind of joke somehow annoyed me. Being at things I disliked.. I hated the reference to "The Usual Suspects". A bad movie does not get better by quoting from an intelligent one. Other borrowed scenes were better. (The 'dancing in the air' following the Matrix rip-off was the worst S/FX in quite some time.) I recommend seeing this film for it's trash-value. It's surely funny, but it's extremely bad nonetheless.I gave it 1 of 10. (1 being the worst, of course)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I thought "Space Mutiny", a real low budget B grade sci-fi flick, was bad, "Scary Movie" takes the position in my list as the absolute WORST movie that I have ever had the misfortune to see. This film is just terrible for any reason. It's not funny, it's not intelligent, and it's certainly not thought provoking. And anyone who thinks this movie is really good needs some serious help. This film is disturbing, perverted, profane, and utterly vulgar. Like one other member here has said, "Anyone with good taste will be offended." How the Wayans had the green light to produce this dreck is beyond me, and how a sequel is being planned is even more of a bad surprise. This film, along with other lousy movies catering to the "teen" sector, which now seem to be the majority of films being churned out, is an indication that American cinema is entering its dark age, approaching self-destruction unless someone starts getting sense and begins to make more GOOD movies which respects the intelligence of their viewers. Now I best leave this comment the way it is. Right now, it feels like I've not said enough bad things about this waste. Unless you're sick, dellusional, researching the possibilities of deteriorating intelligence of the general populous, or an idiot, do not watch this movie. - Reinhart</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I get it. I know this movie is supposed to be all irreverent and entertaining and hilarious. But, I'm sorry, sometimes just being irreverent and revolting and disgusting all by itself is not funny. At least not for a feature length movie. They say, "if you like 'Don't Be a Menace...', you'll like this movie. Well, I liked "Don't Be a Menace..." a little, but I didn't even find this marginally entertaining. You see WAAAAYYY too much to justify an 'R' rating, especially when you consider the flack the MPAA gives many sexually explicit films. This may not be very popular to say, but I'm guessing they got away with it because the film makers are, how should I put this, of the "ethnic" variety?? And I'm sure having Bob and Harvey Weinstein as executive producers didn't hurt either. I think those guys are crooks or something.It seems like they just wanted to see how much they could get away with in Hollywood using their aforementioned "ethnicity" card...Despite this movie's supposed "outrageousness" it feels like it has no heart. It was obviously only directed by Keenan because the other Wayans are too lazy to learn how to do it. I hate the Wayans brother that plays the stoner. Why do I get the feeling he is really like that?I liked South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut and I'm a big fan of whacked-out movies, but something about this movie was just wrong- and I don't mean that in a good way.Most bad reviews pique my interest, but seriously, don't waste your time- rent an old Mel Brooks or Jim Abraham movie for way more laughs...

		<fullReview>The idea for this movie is a good one. A parody of all the teen slasher movies that have been coming out recently. The trailer was good, the commercials were good, and I was pretty excited about this movie. The excitement passed when I sat down to watch it. Words can't describe how bad this movie is. I've seen some bad movies, but a lot are so bad that they are really good and fun to watch. Not this one, it's just awful. If you've never seen it, here's what to imagine. Take a penis joke, then another one, then another one, then a lame sight gag, then more penis jokes, then some pot jokes and then about 500 more penis jokes. I laughed twice for this entire movie while the rest of the time I just asked "Is this supposed to be funny?" But the worst part is that everyone else I know loved this movie. They all say "Well it's like sick comedy." No it's not, it's like idiot comedy. Now they're supposed to be making a sequel, this time I know not to spend $8.25 on it. All the funny jokes in this movie were killed because you've seen them on the commercials. Save your money, save your brain cells, and do not see this movie. Ever. Even if you just wanna see how bad it is. Avoid it at all costs. I only wish IMDB had negative numbers to rate movies on, because this movie would be a -4...or is that too nice?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I debated over whether or not to waste my time commenting on this film (and I use the term "film" very loosely.) But I decided that if I can prevent even one person from wasting 5 bucks to rent this movie, then my time will have been well spent. It's pretty bad when a movie which is labeled as a comedy relies on a scene parodying the "whazup" commercials for it's only (somewhat) funny moment. The nod to the Usual Suspects was clever, but it's inclusion in this disaster of a film is an insult to the original picture. Don't worry, I'm not spoiling any crucial plot elements, for there is no plot to spoil. For the film's entire running length (thankfully, it's less than 90 minutes long) I simply rolled my eyes at the ceiling while my viewing partner was laughing hysterically. Maybe I missed something? After reading user comments, I doubt it. Not one joke hit the mark. Not one scene was worthy of a chuckle, let alone an actual laugh. The thought that there will be a sequel to this movie is even scarier than all three "Scream" films put together. Consider this my Public Service Announcement to the movie renting population.

		<fullReview>I was so disappointed by this movie! The trailer looked absolutely hilarious, but it turns out that that was only because the preview was packed with the thirty seconds of funny moments in this movie. It started out promising enough, with Carmen Electra's campy turn as the clueless opening-scene victim, but immediately after went totally downhill. Thereafter "Scary Movie" only tries to get laughs through mindless shock value. Someone gets impaled with a penis, ejaculation and erection gags occur at least once every other scene, and twice we're supposed to laugh at how callous and uncaring people are as they watch and actively enjoy people getting stabbed repeatedly. I like horror movies, and I do enjoy comedies. But when a movie relies solely on shock value it loses credibility. It's easy to make people laugh at stupid jokes like these. Shock value for entertainment fades over time, how often can you laugh at something that was only funny because it caught you off guard? Not long, and I for one look forward to the day when movies like this are long gone.</fullReview>

Just one sex joke after another. While anyone of these jokes might be funny on their own, the film collapses in a sea of them, and they just become tedious. Most of the bits are from the "Scream" films, and "I Know What You Did Last Summer", a film that was funnier on its own merits, than "Scary Movie". There are also tired references to "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Sixth Sense". The movie-going public's endless appetite for junk, never ceases to amaze me. This was a big hit. It is aimed at the most sophomoric of tastes. It could have been funny, but the writers just went for the easy joke, and there isn't any wit about the film. Just ugly, unfunny sight gags.

		<fullReview>Rented the DVD over the holiday weekend, and boy am I sorry about that. What a waste of money. Totally unfunny! The only scene that made me laugh was when the girl was being chased by the killer up the stairs and she was pushing things down at him, (bike, grandma, piano). How this 'comedy' could have possibly earned the kind of money it did is beyond my realm of thinking. The Wayan brothers and company should have sent it back for about a thousand re-writes. I love comedy, and I'm not a prude by any means, but this kinda of gross out gag comedy got stale very fast. Dumb and Dumber made me laugh, as did Something About Mary, but not this. Keenan Ivory Wayans, (I hope I spelled it right, comments about taking this kind of comedy to the next level was way off the mark. Does he think outdoing the hair gel scene in 'Mary' by having a girl plastered to the ceiling by a stream of semen make it ten times funnier? Sorry, the answer is no. Not only is it not funnier, but parodying another comedy is just plain dumb. And simply re-making 'Scream' into a comedy is a one-joke routine too. I hope 'Scary Movie II' is a bit more original, (yeah right!). The first parody films, (Kentucky Fried Movies and Airplane) were hilarious because they were original in the material based on previous work. And they spoofed normal life, ('No stopping in the red zone' routine). Scary Movie was simply an un-funny ripoff piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see there is a lot of people who like this attempt of a movie, so I feel obligated to post my opinion:This is the WORST comedy movie ever made.The reasons:a) The jokes are predictable. b) The jokes are bad. c) The jokes are predictably bad.Even worse, it takes lines from the movies it "tries" to make look stupid and reproduces them literally, thus looking stupid. Not funny stupid, stupid. Very stupid.I don't mind gross humor, in fact I like it, but it's risky because if it is done poorly (which is the case) the result is horrible (which is also the case).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is pure filth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gosh, this movie is awful. I cannot stress it enough. "Scary Movie" calls itself a parody. It's not. I really don't know what it is. It tries to parody the "Scream" series, which is, in fact, a parody of slasher flicks! How can you make a parody out of a parody?The only good thing that I have heard about this film is that it is funny. Well, I guess it is pretty funny if you're still calling your friends poo poo heads. This is a rated R movie (a very rated R movie at that), so I don't think the Wayans brothers were trying to target an elementary school audience. What were they trying to do? I actually thought those guys had comedic talent until I saw this film. Well, if your idea of a funny movie is one that constantly makes fun of gays and the mentally handicapped, plus shows a lot of wieners and uses jokes that everyone in this world has already heard, than this movie is for you.My condolences to all the actors and actresses (and their families) who starred in this movie. I hope they paid you guys a lot of money. Why did you have to star in this movie, Henry Winkler????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I wasted $2.50 to see this movie. As many others have already noted, they showed all the funny scenes (a total of four, maybe five...) in the trailer. The rest of the movie lacked taste and was designed for the many desensitized teenagers who are raving about this film. I should hope that the Wayans troupe will do better with a sequel, as they've had success in the past (in both TV and movies).It seems like they were striving for a "Naked Gun" or "Airplane" sort of slapstick comedy with this movie, yet it comes off as images of male body parts and homosexual activity and crude jokes - none of these were necessary in those other films to make people laugh. It also seemed like the director was trying to fit as many different film references in as short a time as possible, and this just causes confusion for those of us who like a good parody.I wouldn't honestly recommend this movie to anyone. The humor is too adult for young kids and teens, and too crude for adults. This could have been a much better (funnier, smarter) film if it had been put in the hands of another group of writers, directors, actors, etc...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just the idea of making a parody of Scream should get you suspicious. Scream is already a heavily self-ironic movie, which is part of its greatness. Making fun of a movie already this self-ironic is a difficult matter. It can be done, but this is a very bad attempt.This movie is essentially Scream covered with stupid sex jokes and lame references to other movies. They routinely manage to spoil even the potentially good scenes with disgusting infantile "jokes", if that is what to call them.If you manage to sit-through the whole movie, you will probably find some scenes you find funny, but overall this is a disastrous movie, the world would be better of without.

However when I reached the scene where Ms. Mann drops her balls I got out of my chair and left. Not that I was shocked or anything, but it just wasn't funny. That simple.

		<shortDescription>"We'll pretend it never happened, like the time we went down on each other." OK spoof.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie starts with a young attractive girl named Drew Decker (Carmen Electra) being killed by a masked killer. Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) her boyfriend Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) her boyfriend Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans) along with Greg Phillippe (Lochlyn Munro) &amp; his girlfriend Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth) are all good high-school friends who hide a terrible secret, the secret that they accidentally killed a man (Craig Bruhnanski) while drink driving &amp; didn't tell the police. Cindy gets a sinister message that refers to the incident &amp; she become convinced that the killer is after revenge &amp; wants to kill them...Co-produced &amp; directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans I thought Scary Movie was OK &amp; had a few funny moments in it but it was rather repetitive. The script by Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg &amp; Aaron Seltzer is basically a spoof of Scream (1996) with a large dose of I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) for good measure. In fact there are scenes which are virtually shot for shot, obviously Scary Movie mocks &amp; spoofs those films to varying degrees of effect. The emphasis is on crude juvenile gross-out humour that relies heavily on childish immature sexual jokes &amp; gags which while some are genuinely funny they get tiresome quite quickly &amp; the script doesn't have any real variety about it. It's just a constant stream of sex gags with very little else, some of it is funny while some of it isn't. It tries to spoof the traditional horror film clichés &amp; rules which it does with some success I suppose. The film plays out almost exactly like Scream even the ending &amp; as a whole the only real interest in Scary Movie are the bad taste gags which are very hit &amp; miss, it really depends on your sense of humour &amp; your knowledge of films it pays homage too on exactly how much you will enjoy Scary Movie.Director Wayans does OK, there are loads of references to other films but is that enough to sustain your attention for 90 odd minutes? I'd say not really.With a supposed budget of about $19,000,000 it's well made &amp; has that glossy Hollywood look to it. The acting isn't up to much really although the young cast are suitably attractive.Scary Movie is an OK watch, there are some funny moments &amp; some not so funny moments while as a film it's virtually the same as Scream. It's quite fun to watch &amp; pretty entertaining but too shallow &amp; limited to really stand out. Followed by the hilarious &amp; so much better Scary Movie 2 (2001), then Scary Movie 3 (2003), Scary Movie 4 (2006) followed &amp; according to the IMDb Scary Movie 5 (2008) is set to follow...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film in what would become an on-going series of spoof movies parodying the latest horror films, television and popularised celebrity news, unfortunately it also gave birth to the various other terrible spoof films from the same "writers", e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, Vampires Suck, but at least this film has some alright laughs. This film predominantly parodies the teen slasher movies, specifically the Scream trilogy (the fourth film came much later) and I Know What You Did Last Summer (and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), as well as spoofing or referencing Baywatch, The Exorcist (quoted), Dawson's Creek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Election, Halloween, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Run Lola Run, the Budweiser "Wassup!" adverts, Candyman (quoted), The Blair Witch Project, Titanic, Amistad, Murder on the Orient Express, The Sixth Sense, American Pie, American Beauty, Psycho, The Matrix; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Usual Suspects, The Shawshank Redemption, Final Destination, Beetlejuice, Clueless, Cruel Intentions, The Dead Zone, Die Hard, Friday the 13th, Friday the 13th Part 2, Friday the 13th Part III, Grease, Gridlock'd, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Heathers, Kids, Men in Black, Trigger Happy TV, Twin Peaks and Xena: Warrior Princess. Basically Drew Decker (Baywatch's Carmen Electra) is murdered by a psycho killer wearing a Ghostface mask, her high school classmates Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), her boyfriend Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), her gay boyfriend Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), Buffy Gilmore (American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth) and her easily angered boyfriend Greg Phillippe (Lochlyn Munro) think it coincidence that was she was killed exactly a year after they accidentally killed a man on the road and dumped his body. The psycho killer is now stalking the teens and one by one killing them and a couple of other students, and in the meantime news reporter Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri) is trying to get the exclusive story with her hopeless cameraman Kenny (Dan Joffre) and seducing Buffy's mentally disabled "Special Officer" brother Doofy (Dave Sheridan) for police information. Greg is killed at the beauty pageant, Bobby is arrested but released being innocent, Buffy is killed in the locker rooms mistaking him as a prankster and sarcastically playing along with killer clichés, and still mocks after being decapitated, Ray appears to die getting stabbed through the ear by a penis through a bathroom glory hole, and Brenda is stabbed not by Ghostface there but the various cinema-goers who are getting agitated by her constant interruptions during a film. At a house party held by Cindy to keep everyone safe a fat girl (Marissa Jaret Winokur) is killed being crushed by the opening garage door collapsing on her, Bobby and Cindy have sex and she is no longer a virgin, and Brenda's stoner brother Shorty (Marlon Wayans) is in the basement with his friends as they get more and more stoned, along with the killer. Bobby turns on Shorty shooting the gun at him and killing him, and Ray turns up to join him, they corner Cindy claiming to be the ones who committed the crimes, Bobby explaining because he was refused sex and being gay with Ray, he denies this, and planning to give themselves stab wounds to look like survivors, but the real Ghostface pops up to kill them. The killer and Cindy have a Matrix style fight until he goes through the window and disappears, the Sheriff (Kurt Fuller) informs her that the killer is not the man who they accidentally killed as he is buried, then she works out that it is Doofy, and he walks out the station becoming normal and throwing away the Ghostface mask, and Cindy screaming gets hit by a car. The final moments of the film see Shorty on a surveillance camera giving a posthumous message telling the viewer three rules to help survive the situation, but he is actually explaining how to get away with a snatch-and-run, and we also see Doofy trying to break up with his first love, the vacuum cleaner he uses to masturbate, because he has fallen in love with Gail, but he does masturbate with it one more time. Also starring David L. Lander as Principal 'Squiggy' Squiggman, Keenen Ivory Wayans (the director) as Slave and James Van Der Beek as Dawson Leery. This film is certainly reminiscent of the classic spoof films, like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, where most of the characters are pretty stupid and the jokes are laughably ridiculous, the best characters of the film are obviously Cindy who would go on to do three sequels with Brenda as well, Ray is funny making it obvious that he is gay, and Shorty is my favourite with his moronic personality, constantly being off his head and high-pitch voice, laugh and catchphrase "S*** son!". If you have seen the films being parodied it makes it all the more fun, and if you can't you can simply enjoy the spoofing of all the clichés and tricks that go into real horror films, it should be noted that Scream was originally meant to be called Scary Movie, so it is good that it wasn't and you can see the irony with this title, a not bad and funny horror comedy spoof film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not on the same level as "Airplane!" or "The Naked Gun," but still a fun brainless spoof...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no "Airplane!", but it works.Scary movies were destined to get their comeuppance sooner or later. After a reign of bad slasher flicks since John Carpenter's "Halloween" came out in 1978, they've all been the same: homicidal maniac chases virginal teenagers. The thing is, "Scream" knew this, and was self-aware; it wasn't a typical slasher flick. It was tongue-in-cheek, and the Jamie Kennedy character--the movie geek who's memorized all the clichés--was proof that the movie was having a bit of fun with itself and all the other really bad horror films.So it comes as a bit of a surprise that "Scary Movie's" primary target is, in fact, "Scream," when the film itself was a half-spoof in the first place. "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1" came under heat when it was released in 1993 because it poked fun at a series ("Lethal Weapon") that was already a bit of a spoof. But I liked "Loaded Weapon 1," and although "Scary Movie" is definitely not on the same level as "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun," it works because it has fun with a lot of the clichés of other films. And one of my least favorite horror films of all time, "I Know What You Did Last Summer," finally gets poked fun at. It's about time."Scary Movie" comes out of the mind of the Wayans Brothers, who approach their film with a ZAZ style of silly comedy. (Ironic, since Jerry Zucker, one of the two Zucker brothers behind so many spoofs of the 80s, just directed "Scary Movie 3" with Leslie Nielsen and Charlie Sheen.)"Scary Movie" has gags every second, only all the gags in "Scary Movie" are cruder and grosser than anything that Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker would ever have come up with. And they're also, quite often, a whole lot weaker in terms of quality and originality. But hey, I laughed a lot at some scenes--such as when a killer hides behind the virgin's sofa and thinks no one can see him. She points him out over the phone and he then tries to hide somewhere else. You probably saw this scene on the ads for the movie when it came out a while ago. That's because it's one of the funniest.The movie is certainly not a soft R--there is an abundance of sexual gags, mostly male innuendo such as rubber testicles and puppet penises. It's disgusting, and the film tries too hard to make a name for itself by being "the crudest mainstream horror spoof of all time." I can't believe that mothers took their 11 and 12-year-olds to see this in the theaters when it came out. I never would have been allowed to see something half as crude as "Scary Movie" at that age.Basically, the plot is this: Cindy (cute Anna Faris) is being hunted by an obsessed serial killer with some sort of personal vendetta. That's all. The rest is filled in with a horde of jokes, some funny and.some not.It helps to be a regular filmgoer before you decide to watch this, since the majority of almost every single joke is targeted at films. You don't need to know the classics--this is a film spoofing the last decade of horror films. So you may want to make sure you've seen the "Scream" movies, in particular, before you see "Scary Movie."It's hard to write about a spoof, since you always resort to giving away good jokes. I won't do that, but I will give away some of the films I noticed being spoofed: "Scream," "Scream 2," "Scream 3," "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer," "The Sixth Sense," "The Matrix," and "The Usual Suspects." Even "Shakespeare in Love" gets picked on. (Or is it the African-American film audiences that get picked on by the Wayans Bros.? I'm not sure. But I found the entire scene that takes place within the movie theater very funny, since I often encounter loud people with cell phones ringing during movies, apparently oblivious to the big warning PLEASE TURN OFF CELL PHONES that appears on screen prior to the film's beginning.)The film is certainly at its best when it's having a silly, good old-fashioned time. Unlike, say, "Naked Gun," the film's gags are mostly pretty lame. But a lot of them are funny, such as when the killer has a rap showdown with one of the Wayans brothers and scares all his friends away by rapping what he's going to do to them.I also enjoyed the character of Doofy (played by a David Arquette look-a-like), who (spoiler ahead) is revealed as the killer at the end of the film in the classic "Usual Suspects" style. (A coffee mug shatters on the floor of the police station and we see that the company that manufactures the ceramic mugs is called Doofy Ceramics. Doofy is then revealed to not be Doofy at all, which doesn't really make sense, since he grew up in the town all his life and even had a sister. But that's why this film is just so stupid. In a funny way, of course.)Molly Shannon's character, a rip-off of the Sarah Michelle Gellar character from "I Know What You Did Last Summer," is named Buffy, by the way, which is no coincidence. And if you don't understand that joke, then you probably shouldn't get anywhere near "Scary Movie."3.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all make mistakes. Mine was to watch this movie. I actually quite like spoof comedy movies, like "Airplane", "Hot Shot", "The Naked Gun" et al, so, thinking I was in for a good laugh, I tuned in. I guess I wasn't properly aware of the difference in the directorial method of James Brooks back in the eighties and the Wayans in the noughties. Maybe if I was also 40 years younger, I might have got a kick out of the shenanigans which unfolded here.Really, this is just a frat-boy's paradise, meaning lots of low humour, vulgar jokes and crude banality. I got the references to contemporary thriller - horror movies, like "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Scream", "Blair Witch Project" and "Sixth Sense" amongst many others, but really just found the humour way too obvious and infantile to connect with.Even in the earlier movies mentioned above, I accept there's some risqué humour, but for every clean, even clever smile-inducing gag, (like when the subjective camera bumps into the lead actress, although they even borrowed that from Mel Brooks) there were twenty- plenty other wince-making, below-the-belt and often just embarrassing so-called jokes. I could go on by saying that the largely unknown cast failed to demonstrate any great originality or distinction in their acting, but to be honest, they're largely secondary to the non-stop barrage of cheap sex-jokes right from the start.Successful enough to spawn a horde of sequel movies, I won't be tuning in for any of them anytime soon. Last one in class, turn off the lights please.</fullReview>

Chock full of the usual gross-out funny schtick, "SM2" tries hard for a sequel but comes up short for want of scary teen movies to slam. The result is more of the same - so if you liked the first one you'll probably enjoy this one - with the slampooning of unscary flicks such as "Charlie's Angels" and "Hannibal". If you haven't seen either, beware of lots of in-your-face potty, crotch, and biodischarge grosser-than-gross humor requiring a sort of demented taste in comedy.

		<fullReview>Scary Movie looks like a rapidly fixed comedy to mock the success of Scream and all its clones. In the tradition of films like Airplane and Hot Shots, the audience is being attacked by a never-ending series of brutal gags. Not one joke in Scary Movie has a little depth or range and they merely focus on ?dirty' sex-jokes. The characters are constantly being humiliated and portrayed like empty-headed jocks and bimbos?Really anything goes for the Wayans brothers apparently! Many of their jokes either glorify drug-usage or handle about adultery, women-beating or bizarre fetishes. Yet, even though the entire screenplay is a mess, some sequences really do prove the writers know their classics. The more subtle references in Scary Movie are the best ones, like for example the spoofing of `Blair Witch Project' and `The Shining'. I would even go far to call some aspects downright ingenious. Presenting Deputy Doofy (David Arquette's character in Scream) like a complete retard for example! The cast is merely filled with unfamiliar faces that look dumb almost naturally. Shannon Elizabeth is offered another change to show how gorgeous her body is and the casting of playmate Carmen Electra for the Drew Barrymore intro is another successful gag. Enjoy Scary Movie 1 as much as you can, since it was almost immediately followed by two inferior (and disgustingly irritating) sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Sad Example Of Today's Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's yet one more example of a modern-day comedy that has its funny moments but unfortunately, to me, was more of a sleaze-fest that a parody or a straight comedy. This movie is spoofing horror films. That's cool, I like a good spoof, but why all the irreverence and sex jokes? Why is that necessary? Don't writers today have the intelligence to make people laugh using clean material? This is just one R-rated scene after another. The language is brutal, too: tons of profanity in this film.Funny, but comedies for years made the public laugh without having to resort to profanity and sex remarks, like this film does. The really sickening part is that movie was geared for a young audience. The film business has no shame. What passes for comedy films today is, by and large, low-class material. This movie is Exhibit A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And they just keep on coming, don't they?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 10/10 rating of course only applies to people who would desire to watch such a movie (for anyone else, it's a zero). A spoof of "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", and other such movies, "Scary Movie" is another in the gag-a-minute genre associated with the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, the "Airplane!" crowd, and so on. Some scenes were kinda gross (they can't go without scatological humor, can they?), but overall harmless. The end was a real surprise. I never saw "Scary Movie 2" (I assumed that it was the same), but I did see "Scary Movie 3"...and it was pretty much the same. And there's a "Scary Movie 4" coming out soon (we can probably assume that it's the same).</fullReview>
