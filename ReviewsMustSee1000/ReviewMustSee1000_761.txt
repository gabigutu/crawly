		<shortDescription>Zelig is a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, a masterpiece. The entire premise of the movie is wildly original, even coming from WOODY ALLEN who continually cranks out one interesting film after another to this day. The label of mock-umentary just doesn't do justice to the uniqueness of this film. ALLEN and his amazingly talented staff created a movie that no other director could have made nor even thought of doing. Some of the humor is rather modern like the forward references to self-gratification during the psychiatrist scenes with MIA FARROW. But mostly, it's filled with humor from another time and place which we'll never return.To me, one of the wonderful aspects of this is the period music dispersed throughout with joyful admiration. We are lucky that ALLEN has continued to use music from the early part of the 20th century. I think no other director has so consistently had such a reverence for this wonderful music. Perhaps no other director has such a strong knowledge of it either.That WOODY ALLEN normally portrays himself as a nebbishy character in many of his own movies works so well in this movie. A more aggressive person who becomes a chameleon would not have worked as well at all. I am glad that MIA FARROW was still associated with him when he made this film, I think no other modern actress could have pulled this off as well as she did. She has that timeless look that is appealing but has a far-off feeling.The flavor of the period-looking cinematography and photography is part of the genius of the implementation here. It is so right on the money. The flickering of projectors, the out-of-focus look to so man scenes shot today meld amazingly well with the contrived shots.THINK ABOUT THIS - this is years before CGI took over Hollywood...years before FORREST GUMP and countless of other knock-offs have proliferated in movies. Gee whiz, there is CGI in so many movies these days. I watched a DVD of a recent movie recently which used special effects in the most unexpected, unlikely and unnecessary parts you'd be surprised.Yes, ZELIG is a masterpiece and I only feel sorry for those who cannot see the astounding piece of cinema this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful Story In An Engaging Format</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was this the first "mockumentary"? I checked out IMDb and it predates Guest, Reiner and co.'s This Is Spinal Tap by a year. Not only was it a fake documentary, it sustained the format throughout, never once breaking into an enacted scene. Allen told his story, set in his favorite time period, The Roaring 20's, using special lenses to create the old style newsreels. Using photo stills, mixing real footage with his, and providing exposition via modern-day "historians" and aged characters, he gave this innovative film such an authenticity that if one didn't know any better, you would swear there had been an actual Leonard Zelig.Allen plays Leonard, a man so devoid of identity, so eager to assimilate, that he literally takes on the appearance or, at least, the attributes of anyone he comes in contact with. Mia Farrow plays his psychiatrist, Dr. Eudora Fletcher, and taken in smaller doses, she actually is perfect in this role. There are a few moments when you get to see an extended dialogue between the two, most notably when her brother is filming "The White Room" sessions at her country estate. This is the only time that Allen's shtick gets to flex, as he cracks jokes about teaching a Masturbation class. Advanced. I also loved Zelig groaning about Eudora's terrible cooking under hypnosis. Eventually, Dr. Fletcher is able to cure him, and with his newfound personality, he and Eudora fall in love.Allen also introduces the idea of Zelig's story being filmed as a movie, so he inter cuts some of the news sources with scenes from the film (very funny). The one thing that really stood out for me, though, was this revelation towards the end of the film. Woody as Leonard Zelig was smiling. A lot. It was kind of weird to see, but his happiness actually imbued the film with positive emotion and charmed the pants off me (not literally, of course) to such a degree that I will undoubtedly be repeating my viewing pleasure many more times.I'll be honest. There were moments early on that I perhaps wondered if he was going to be able to sustain my interest. I thought he might be playing this conceit a little too long. What had, in the first 20 minutes, been enchanting and amusing seemed to dwindle in the middle of the film. Would he really succeed at telling an engaging story in this method? Well, I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. He layers so many meanings into his character's transformations, and all of his historians offer different interpretations. The importance of being yourself. How Zelig's journey was America's journey during the tumultuous and wild 20's. He also has a great running gag about Moby Dick that lampoons the Great American Novel.Will Allen ever be this innovative and original again? Well, it appears he's making an attempt with his newest film, Melinda and Melinda, in which he tells the same story twice, with one tone being humorous, while the other is tragic. If nothing else, he at least continues to strive for an authentic voice in this littered landscape of movie franchises and ridiculously insulting comedies. Go Woody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zealous about "Zelig"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leapin' lizards! This film is brilliant, brilliant, brilliant."Zelig" was a revelation in 1983, an utterly ingenious faux-documentary, without any precedent, at least not on this scale. Hilarious then, it still is today. That quick glimpse you get of the all-Hasidic production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is priceless. It gives renewed meaning to "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"Allen's technique is extraordinary. "Zelig" has the best bogus documentary footage quite probably since "Citizen Kane".As the film urges, everyone should "Do the Chameleon", by seeing "Zelig". Woody Allen creates a trenchant comment on people's desire for conformity: "Everybody, go chameleon." We all tend to do that to some degree, but it's not usually so amusing. Try to blend in with the crowd rushing out to find "Zelig" on video.It is probably worth noting that a Jewish Nazi is not as ridiculous a stretch as Woody makes it seem. Reinhard Heydrich, the vicious organizer of the Final Solution, fell into that category. The top Nazis were all misfits in one way or another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody strikes again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody can be clever. Woody can be funny. And when Woody's clever AND funny, you get "Zelig".Telling the story of Leonard Zelig (Woody Allen, who else?) who transforms himself chameleon-like into anyone just to get people to like him, he finds himself the object of on-going observation from a kind doctor (Farrow), who eventually falls for him. But lest you think this is simply a love story, there are also pot-shots at fame, fads, the 1930s (!!), medical conventions, product cash-ins and the joys and pitfalls of celebrity.Then there's the sheer joy of the technical wizardry that allows Woody's Zelig to stand alongside such figures as Josephine Baker, Brickhouse, William Randolph Hearst, Marion Davies, "Red" Grange, Al Capone, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Lou Gehrig and Fanny Brice. This is the same type of FX visible in "Forrest Gump", and eleven years before the fact! Nice going.But you haven't lived till you've seen Woody trying to blend in at an Adolph Hitler speech.There's a lot of slapstick but there's also a lot of great lines ("I have to council a group of chronic masturbators", Zelig complains, "and if I'm late they'll start without me.") Classic.But at the center of it all is Woody himself, just like his Zelig character, wanting only to be liked, if not loved. He succeeds. Once you see "Zelig", you'll love it.Eight stars, plus one star more for watching Woody be serenaded by Fanny Brice. He's the cat's pajamas!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen Does the Chameleon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zelig" is a very clever movie, the kind you just know Woody Allen is capable of. In this "mockumentary," Woody plays Leonard Zelig, an insecure man who goes to the ultimate length to fit in. Mia Farrow offers the love interest as Dr. Eudora Fletcher. In "Zelig," we get to see Woody spliced into old footage, including the Nazi rally. This came before the effect became used more often, in movies like "Forrest Gump." I see this as a transition in Woody's movies. It comes somewhere between his early funnier movies, like "Bananas" and "Take the Money and Run," and his later, more introspective ones, like "Hannah and Her Sisters" and "Husbands and Wives." It makes a statement about individuality, and produces laughs in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Identity Crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before FORREST GUMP told the story about its eponymous main character managing to find himself at the center of this country's main events we had this oddity of a mockumentary that only the uber-intellectual mind of Woody Allen could come up with. Appropriately narrated in that self-important newsreel voice-over that is the template of most documentaries, we are taken into the life of this 'human chameleon' called Leonard Zelig. Zelig has the ability to show up and blend into whomever he is around with at any given moment and pops up in the most interesting of places.Soon he catches the interest of psychiatrist Dr. Eudora Fletcher who decides to undertake the task of 'curing' Zelig. She subjects him to a series of sessions to find out the meaning of his condition and thus further her own breakthroughs in psychology. At the same time we see comments from real-life celebrities as diverse as the day is long which pretend to explain his effect on events in general, his marriages, the man and the myth. Their presence lends an air of veracity and at times it's hard to believe one is watching an extremely clever mockumentary due to the footage utilized. Allen, in making ZELIG well before CGI, was able to painstakingly age film and process photos as to make it seem that Zelig in effect was "there" when things happened. Viewers at the same time will feel tempted to look for the dividing line between montage and real footage; one memorable scene is a rally led by Hitler (an actor playing Hitler, not the real man) which Zelig witnesses as a German Nazi. Dr. Eudora Fletcher follows him there and hilarity ensues as she points him out in the middle of Hitler's rousing dissertation. However, there is a greater irony as this event becomes a grossly fictionalized "film version". Allen is clearly toying with the viewer in saying that even when he is presenting "the facts" about this personage, events will be glamorized, and the line between fact and fiction will be blurred. Clever, indeed.ZELIG falls short of being one of Woody Allen's great films for the reason it's a mockumentary; it barely has his presence and that of Mia Farrow as familiar faces and is a visual attack of archive footage and old jazz tunes. At the same time, one of his much shorter tales of self-existentialism in the threat of blending in, it does serve as something of an allegory that bears his indelible mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Minor Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zelig is, I think, my favorite Woody Allen movie. It's strange to prefer it over Annie Hall or Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters, and perhaps it's just my trivia loving personality that points me toward Zelig rather than one of Allen's more traditional movies.Regardless, it is an incredible film. Years before computer animation, Allen was able to insert himself convincingly into old movies. His ability to replicate both the look and sound of old newsreels, in addition to the scratches and discolorations, is remarkable, but this is just window dressing for something that exists on several different levels.At one level, Zelig is a simple satire, a fake documentary about a made-up "human chameleon" celebrity of the 1920's. It's rich with typical Allen touches and lines. But at another, it is a serious examination of how we adulate then try to destroy celebrities in America. At yet another, it is an examination of the Jewish compulsion to assimilate into whatever society we happen to be in.But there are even more layers to this film. Allen manages to be laugh out loud farcical through most of this movie, but in the way of all great screen comedians, injects pathos into the film when Zelig, about to be sentenced for multiple crimes committed when he was in his "chameleon states" disappears leaving his heartbroken fiancée/psychiatrist behind.And at an even deeper level, it's a rejection of the modern tendency to have to understand what things mean, rather than just appreciating them. This latter bit is shown by an actor discussing his book, "Interpreting Zelig," immediately followed by the late Susan Sonntag, playing herself, disputing this while the subtitle identifying her shows her as the author of "Against Interpretation." Indeed any film that manages to have Dr. Bruno Bettleheim, Irving Howe, Saul Bellow and Sonntag playing in it, commenting on the fictional Zelig, is something that can appeal to many people in many ways.Undoubtedly, this reflects the complex character of Zelig himself, who could be so many different things to so many different people. This complexity is, like it is for Zelig, both a curse and its redemption. Rather than just a silly little fake documentary or a complex dissertation on art and philosophy, it's both and neither.All this creates a remarkably rich cinematic experience which is genuinely unique, even among Allen's several "mockumentaries" like "The Harvey Wallanger Story," "Take the Money and Run" and "Sweet and Lowdown." See it once, or a hundred times, there are always details, either on the screen or in the ideas presented, that seem new and wonderful.If it isn't Allen's great masterpiece (which in my mind, it could be), it's a minor masterpiece worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Identity Crisis and Its Relationship to Personality Disorder "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most sophisticated, cleverest, funniest, exquisitely shot and edited, scored, and acted movies ever made, "Zelig" is a masterpiece and astounding work even for Woody Allen whose mediocre movies are way above the regular Hollywood fares. With the modest running time less than 80 minutes, this mockumentary tells the story of a "human chameleon", Leonard Zelig, Leonard the Lizard who possessed an extraordinary ability to transform himself in anyone he met (or should I say, an extraordinary ability possessed him?). Leonard is a shy, little, meek Jewish man whose rare personality disorder consists of not having his own personality at all and successfully and effortlessly adapting any personality he came close to and fitting perfectly to any surroundings. His skin turns black when he is with the Black people, with the Native Americans, he became one; attending the dinner with the intellectuals, he speaks brilliantly with F.S. Fitzgerald, when on the baseball field, he is Babe Ruth. The meeting with an intelligent and compassionate psychiatrist, Dr. Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow) will begin the slow and long process for Zelig of searching and finding his own personality and possibility for love and happiness. The movie provides laughs and smiles but it also makes the viewer think of more serious subjects. Are we all have a Zelig inside? Don't we all want to be liked and try to adapt to our surroundings to feel comfortable? The movie can also be viewed as the meditation on the nature of the acting ability. While watching "Zelig", I kept thinking of a book I read recently. One of the characters was a great actor who had the similar to Zelig's disorder - he had no personality at all until he was given a part to act on stage. That Actor made the best and most convincing and complex Shakespeare's heroes - he was a brilliant reflective Hamlet but his greatest success was tragic Othello. The actor's transformation to Othello was so real that he acted it at home with his wife whom he suspected in cheating - he played his role perfectly with the same as in the play results. He ended up in the asylum where he could not act but he was allowed to read...Dostoevsky's novel "The Possessed" from which he chose to adapt the personality of Nikolai Stavrogin with rather unpredictable results. When his doctor finally realized what happened, he took all books with the exception of "The Idiot". Finally, the actor became a gentle and kind Prinz Myshkin, and that was the end of book.Both, the book and the movie "Zelig" made me think of the price the artists pay to achieve perfection in their art. Are they vampires sucking the life out of their victims only to use them as characters for their acting roles? Is that the ultimate price the artist is paying for being a great artist? Does he need lives and souls of others to be able to create? This is one of many subjects "Zelig" makes you think about.Allen seamlessly weds Black and white newsreel footage with his humorous but deep and fascinating tale allowing Zelig to be exactly where and when History was made. Using special lenses to give the movie the old style, mixing his own footage with the real documentaries, including his favorite music, dances, feeling perfectly forever gone era, Woody recreates The Roaring 20Th with breathtaking authenticity.

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fascinating pseudo-documentary with an intriguing premise, the footage shown looks very authentic, edited well together, with apt sets and costumes. A number of original songs written especially for the film are included, and they sound exactly like the type of tunes expected in a 1930s musical. The non-original music choices also suit the project. Woody Allen superbly acts out the interesting character that he has written for himself: a very different type of insecure, neurotic person to what he usually plays. Even at less than eighty minutes, the material nevertheless wears thin by the end, but some great ideas are developed along the way. It also feels a bit odd to watch, as the film is not really a comedy, nor a drama - not fitting into any genre - then again, in general real life are not meant to be straight comedies or dramas, are they? With the limitations of the style that Allen has chosen for the film taken into account, he does a pretty good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Layered into Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Woody's films, enjoyable or not, represent a walk though all the larger philosophical observations and experiments in film. Most of those - at least in this period - have to do with how the camera distorts reality.We get this in the reinvention of history overlain on the very nature of a fake documentary. It is echoed in the story, of course, which gives Woody a chance to mug and romance his new girl. (She `saves' him.)Anyone who thinks this is about a man needs to have his license to watch Woody revoked.I consider this a practice session for his best film: `Sweet and Lowdown,' which deals with these same issues, in the same way but so much more subtly and powerfully. That's in part because Woody's biggest liability as a director is Woody the actor, and he substituted the best folded actor in the world. But it is also because `Sweet' didn't have the distraction of manipulating old film.Still, this is a pretty sweet idea, the idea of having a character be sufficiently powerful that he is able to actually modify existing filmed history.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite Woody Allen film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all Woody's movies, this is my all-time favourite. Deep and meaningful, a perfect blend of drama and comedy. It was filmed in black-and-white, like Manhattan, but this time in the mockumentary style of Take the Money and Run. Less comedic than that film, though, but just as entertaining. The special effects (blending the actors with documentary stock footage) are simply astounding for their time. It was only 10+ years later that another film (Forrest Gump) managed to pull this thing off with the same success. (Now that I mentioned it, Forrest Gump may have a lot more in common with Zelig... There are clearly parallels not only visually, but thematically, as well.) It is also very concise. Lasting only 70 minutes, there is no unnecessary fat at all. A time very well spent for anyone who loves bittersweet, heart-warming movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that even though Zelig is less than 80 minutes, I was deeply saddened by it being over. I actually wanted more of it. Woody Allen is brilliant as Leonard Zelig, a human chameleon, who can transform to other races, religions, and ethnicities. Anyway, Woody Allen does it subtly and brilliantly without going over the top. Woody Allen is a genius with his neurosis. In this film, it's a love story before doctors getting intimate with patients had become a frowned upon today. Zelig came alive in the 1920s and 1930s. His character always seems to be looking for a place to fit in society. Woody Allen's brilliance is really about examining his life in film especially his relationships. The psychiatrist is played by Mia Farrow who was involved with Woody Allen at the time. The cast is usually New York actors like Deborah Rush. But I enjoyed seeing Susan Sontag in this documentary spoof. Zelig is perhaps one of the best spoof documentaries of all time. When it's over, you just want more.</fullReview>

The funny premise is polished to some astonishing level of trickery with editing and matte effects seamlessly blending real 20s with recreated 20s adding Allen and Farrow and dialog and interviews that will have you recalling and roaring with laughter for days. I had not seen it since 1983 and now in 2008 to be reminded how stunning and hilarious this creation is, well, I am just delighted to be back on the wavelength of this genuinely brilliant hoax documentary. Now I can see how FORREST GUMP came about, given that it is a similar 'historic' premise using real footage of events and eras mixed with the lead character. But ZELIG is another perfection altogether; if you know your 20s, silent films, the imagery, the early sound newsreels and all those silly songs, then ZELIG is a superlative treat. It even features Mae Questrel singing a new Betty Boop song and for that alone I cheer this almost perfect film. What a delight. If you also get to see the early Peter Jackson hoax documentary FORGOTTEN SILVER or Stanley Donen's MOVIE MOVIE you will be equally rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, insightful and extremely informative documentary (Yes, I know it's a mockumentary and complete fiction but I wanted to have a little bit of fun!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A respectful exploration of the life of the so-called Human Chameleon Leonard Zelig, this is an excellent, insightful and extremely informative documentary about the trials and tribulations of one of the most famous men of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Since he fell out of the limelight in later life, Zelig is nowhere near as well remembered as he deserves to be, which is surprising since that it is such an amazing story. This documentary went a long way towards redressing the balance but he is still not a household name, in stark contrast to other celebrities of his era such as Charles Lindbergh and Babe Ruth. I was already somewhat familiar with Zelig from having seen the very romanticised but very entertaining 1935 biopic "The Changing Man" when I was a child. This documentary was meticulously researched by its director Allan Konigsberg, who was able to compile clips from numerous sources in order to give the audience a true reflection of Zelig's strange life. However, it is worth mentioning that the film would not have been possible without the cooperation of Dr. Eudora Fletcher, who is interviewed throughout, and Paul Deghuee.Zelig first came to prominence when he was admitted to Manhattan Hospital in 1928. Within a short time of his arrival, there were numerous newspaper reports that he had the ability to assume the characteristics of anyone that he met, not only in terms of their personalities but their physical appearances as well. For instance, as can be seen from the extensive footage of him, Zelig was a slight white man. However, upon meeting two extremely overweight men, his bulk increased insignificantly. Upon meeting two black men, his skin colour changed to match theirs. Doctors were not immune either as they invariably diagnosed him with a malady that they themselves possessed. In one particularly tragic example, a doctor named Birsky diagnosed Zelig as having a brain tumour and gave him only two weeks to live. Within two weeks, Birsky had himself died of a tumour.It was Eudora Fletcher who was able to unravel the mystery represented by Zelig. In contrast to her more conservative male colleagues, she became convinced that he was suffering from a psychological disorder rather than a physiological one. Over the next several weeks, Fletcher began to make some progress with her diagnosis but Zelig was removed from the hospital by his half-sister Ruth and her sleazy showman / crook of a boyfriend Martin Geist. While Fletcher attempted unsuccessfully to have him named a ward of the hospital, Ruth and Geist created a sort of cottage industry around Zelig and toys, games, earmuffs and songs were created in his "honour." He met the great and the good such as Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Josephine Baker, Jack Dempsey and the legendary nightclub owner Bricktop, who recalls several encounters with him at her club in Paris in a fascinating, if short, interview. Zelig was essentially the main attraction in a freakshow and his own personality was totally subsumed by those around him. When Geist killed himself, Ruth and her new lover Luis Martinez ? not in that order ? in a fit of jealous rage, Zelig became a Manhattan Hospital ward as Fletcher had hoped. It is a terrible thing to say but that grisly lovers' quarrel was the best thing that ever happened to Zelig.Fletcher almost immediately took him to her country home and arranged for her cousin Paul Deghuee to film their sessions together. These are known as the White Room Sessions and extensive clips are used throughout the documentary. It is absolutely fascinating to see this material as it serves to make Zelig's story seem very immediate. While her progress was initially slow going, she eventually made a breakthrough and succeeded in bringing Zelig's true personality to the surface, seemingly for the first time in years. She went too far in the other direction and he became violently intolerant of any opinion that conflicted with his. With some tweaking, Fletcher managed to bring his condition under control.Over time, Zelig and Fletcher fell in love. However, two weeks before they were due to be married, a scandal broke when an ex-showgirl and aspiring actress named Lita Fox revealed that he was already married to her and the two of them had a child. Zelig had married her while under a different personality and had no recollection of doing so. This revelation opened the floodgates and he was sued for everything from bigamy to performing unnecessary surgery by dozens by people from all over the United States. He soon fled the country and may never have surfaced again had Fletcher not caught a glimpse of him in newsreel footage of a Nazi demonstration in Berlin after months of fruitless searching. Long story short, she tracked him down and, after interrupting a major speech by Hitler, the two of them were able to fly home to the US. Zelig set the record for the longest continuous upside down flight across the Atlantic, which he still holds more than 80 years later. Incidentally, Fox later found some success in Hollywood, most notably playing Rita in the 1935 RKO film "The Purple Rose of Cairo" under her more sophisticated sounding stage name Ann Rayburn. She was never far from scandal while in Tinseltown and was rumoured to have had an affair with her co-star Gil Shepherd.Overall, this is an engrossing documentary on perhaps the most unusual and intriguing man of the 20th Century. He was described by the celebrated psychoanalyist Bruno Bettelheim as "the ultimate conformist" but every intellectual had a different interpretation of him which often said more about them than it did about Zelig. I am looking forward to reading Professor John Morton Blum's book "Interpreting Zelig", generally accepted as being the definitive work on the subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could well be a review of 90% of Woody Allen's oeuvre. The film is a smorgasbord of fabulousness - exquisite concepts, very clever lines and very funny ones. No film maker has ever had such a grasp of irony, sarcasm and the ridiculous, and still imbue it with wit and (occasionally) subtlety. But it is the relentless self-deprecation and extant feelings of worthlessness that eventually become wearing after you have watched as many Allen films as I have. This is the film that most impresses you with his confusion over identity however. I could go on about self-analysis for pages but it's unnecessary...just watch any given Woody Allen film. He mellows it out with a rather forlorn sense of romance that becomes endearing rather than pathetic...a skill that is essential to engage with his films. This is a fine film.

Technically Zelig looks fabulous, one of his better-looking and most interesting early films along with Manhattan and The Purple Rose of Cairo. And it's actually more interesting in this regard than either of those films, because among Allen's films it's his most unique and ground-breaking. As far as I can recall, none of Allen's other films use the technique of inserting a character(in this case Leonard Zelig) into existing footage like newsreels and archive photos, and so cleverly. Well, What's Up Tiger Lily? had a dubbed over commentary over an existing mystery film but with mixed results and that's not really the same thing. The music suits the period brilliantly and gives the sense that you are there, it's great-sounding and memorable too. The screenplay is among Allen's cleverest, it's laugh-out-loud funny but also very poignant with the romantic parts really sweetly done. It's also very intelligent and has a lot to say on the issues that it deals with. The characters are not as neurotic as in some of Allen's other films, though they are unmistakably Woody Allen. They feel real, and I did find myself relating to Zelig in his struggles and desire to fit in(that was exactly the case with me in school), the characters' relationships and chemistry were more than believable. The story is heartfelt, funny and makes great use of his mockumentary style, there are some rambling moments but not to an interminable degree. Allen directs thoughtfully as ever, and he gives a great performance that is among his most physical, energetic and relatable. Mia Farrow also gives one of her most sympathetic performances, and is touching in doing so. In conclusion, a great film that deserves more attention, despite the high rating and reviews holding it in great esteem elsewhere people talk about Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanours and Manhattan as well as more recent stuff like Midnight in Paris and Match Point but Zelig is rarely talked about and that's a shame because people are missing out on Woody Allen at his most unique. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was good as most Woody Allen films are in my opinion. If this were not a Woody Allen film I wouldn't have given it a chance since its about a man who is a human chameleon but since is Allen, you have to suspect there's something deeper than a man who can change identities and of course it was. Zelig is a man that has an "extreme" longing to be liked by others and transforms to be like the people he is around assuming their identities, as humans tend to do consciously or unconsciously, some more than others but once he over comes his disorder he becomes too outspoken and needs to be trained again to act in conformity and the cycle I'm assuming just continues. If you like Woody's humor you will like the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to blend in the funny way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's genius, intelligence and wit are often only hampered by his insistence to play the same character over and over again in a multitude of films, or at least a version of that archetypal protagonist: a whiny, talky, at any rate neurotic American Jew with never ending problems in the romantic area. This makes him a welcome guest for shrinks, and the resulting filmed self-analysis is all garnished with the typical sophisticated Woody Allen humor. In "Zelig" he is all that and more. As this time our hero proves more adaptable. Literally. And it's a good thing.Allen, who brought the world such fresh comedy ideas like film stars stepping out of the screen, characters sensing that they might be out of focus, writers lost between fiction and reality to name just a few, created with "Zelig" one of the best mockumentaries to date. Subject of course is this peculiar director/writer/actor, who loses himself in the role of a human chameleon, a freak of nature, who has anything but an identity to count on. Apparently his former roles as time traveler, dictator by accident or Vulgarian "spy" were not enough, so Allen pulls out all the stops and turns clown, dentist, professor, Indian, black, fat, mustached and what not - all in one picture. Adapting involuntarily to anything regardless of profession, ethnic or political orientation, the Zelig character goes all the way through, even finding himself consequently in Nazi Germany at a Hitler rally. And he makes a point. Aside from the comic effect of this premise and its perfect execution via newsreels, photo manipulation and the like containing mystifying historical details that never happened, there's that other level to the film as well: "Zelig" deals head on with the complex relationship between individual and society, poses questions about identity and assimilation, and in bringing up all those serious issues is simply hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zelig: a mix of reality and fantasy Allen NThis is my undertaking of Woody Allen's movies .Both its reality and absurdity staggered me and the discussion on possible multiple personality impressed me. The director visited colourful real characters and mixed them with fictional narratives, to achieve the convergence of reality and the past. This approach in shooting biographies of historical figures is not unique but may be the first.Story Leonard Zelig was a celebrity in 1920s in America, famous for the ability to mimic other people and changed his personality into another person's entirely according to the environments. His deeds were always hits. People hated him or liked him just because of his legendary sense. He finally met a psychologist who could make him back to normal person and he married her.Telling story The story was told with time going. Changes had happened on main characters, especially the hero.Actor The director shaped a little cute and a bit confused public person who was actually a morbid man.Photography Normal The virtual parts had been done to old style and speeded, so it could look like historical data more and could be called ''documentary''. Music Normal Shortcoming Using "documentary" as classification does not seem right and ''biography film'' might be more appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Woody's very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing film technically, with a lot to say about society, conformity, and how we see ourselves. This mock documentary about a 'human chameleon' in the 1920s and 30s who would involuntarily change his appearance to fit in with those around him in a desperate effort to be liked and accepted is hilarious and heartbreaking, often at the same time. Some of the visual effects are still astounding by modern standards. And Allen gives a performance that is surprisingly subtle. There are a few slow moments, and a few jokes feel self-conscious, but not enough to really damage the greatness of the film in any way. It's tied with 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Hannah and her Sisters' for my 2nd favorite Allen film behind 'Annie Hall'. Worth seeking out if you've never seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many Woody Allen movies I really, really like. Most of my favourites are from his comedy outings though I've also enjoyed some of his more serious works. Zelig falls halfway between the two and has shot straight up there as a contender for his very best film, in my opinion.It's the story of a man who, in an effort to simply be liked, ends up becoming a bit of a human chameleon. Literally. When surrounded by black people he turns black, when chatting to socialites he becomes a socialite, etc, etc. But after doing this for so long it seems that Zelig may never be able to just be himself.Taking the mockumentary approach and mixing in old footage with fantastically recreated material, Zelig is as technically brilliant as it is smart and funny. It's a perfect blend of all the things that make Allen such a great film-maker. The main support comes from Mia Farrow, who does very well in her role, but this movie is all about its titular character.A fantastic film that should be seen by everyone, in my opinion, and it may well remain Allen's finest hour, despite stiff competition from a number of other movies.See this if you like: Forrest Gump, Forgotten Silver, Kaméleon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The inventive mind of Woody Allen has little to prove. He has consistently managed to capture our hearts and minds with humorous entertainment of a superb quality for years. In this surprising offering entitled " Zelig " a strange phenomena occurs when Leonard Zelig (Woody Allen) a common man is able to morph himself, like a chameleon into anyone around him. This includes resembling Blacks, Orientals or different cultures, nationalities and even professions. What begins as a trick, or illusion becomes a world wide sensation which further transports him into the NEWS of the Day. Zelig comes to the attention of Dr. Eudora Nesbitt Fletcher (Mia Farrow) who decides to dedicate her life to the study and understanding of the unusual man. Using a documentary style Allen captures the sites, sounds and feels of the 20's and 30' with success. With such results, the film becomes another triumph for Allen who wrote, directs and stars in this sure to become a Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zelig" is another terrific film from Woody Allen, about a chameleon who lived earlier in the century and was treated by a psychiatrist to become one, whole person. Done in documentary style all the way through and narrated by Patrick Horgan, it's difficult to tell sometimes who is real and who is acting. Leonard Zelig is a young man who, simply by standing with someone, becomes just like them - if he's with a black person, he becomes black; if he's near a fat person, he becomes rotund and so on. He is the subject of articles as well as songs ("Leonard the Lizard," "(You Have Such) Reptile Eyes," and "You May Be Six People, But I Love You," to name a few) and inspires a popular '20s dance, "The Chameleon." Dick Hyman composed the songs perfectly in the style of the '20s, and one, in fact, is sung by the voice of Betty Boop, Helen Kane. Zelig is attacked by Labor Unions because they claim that, as a chameleon, he's holding down six jobs. The KKK doesn't know what to make of him - he can become anything they hate in seconds. While working with a dedicated psychiatrist, Eudora (Farrow), Leonard's sister and boyfriend take him out of the institute and use his chameleon qualities to commercialize him and make a bundle. After a murder/suicide, Eudora gets Leonard back and continues to work with him.The best part of "Zelig," of course, are the film clips and photos from the '20s and '30s that place Zelig and/or Eudora actually in them. The old film was apparently matched to the new by such technical things as stepping on it, putting it in a shower, and crumpling it up. The production used actual cameras and lighting from the '20s to give the right effect, and a technique used in a series of Time-Life specials that inserted Dick Cavett into archival footage was used - and actually was the inspiration for the film, it fascinated Allen so much. All of these photos and film clips are remarkable, but the best is the appearance of Leonard Zelig on the podium near Hitler while Hitler is giving one of his impassioned speeches."Zelig," though, is more than a technical wonder. It's the story of a man who has no identity of his own and, through the dedication of one doctor, develops one. It's also very funny in parts, particularly one of Leonard's sessions under hypnosis when he talks about the meaning of life.A wonderful film with jaw-dropping editing, done meticulously. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Mia Farrow looks exquisite here and genuinely glowing. You can tell her and Allen loved each other deeply in real life. A shame how their relationship ended up so bitter and full of hostility.

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's "Epic" film of a man finding his place in society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's Zelig is a funny, but that's to be expected. Right from the start one gets that this is a "mockumentary" done mostly with archival footage and interviews, so it would be hard for Allen (working in this form the first time) to keep a straight face as a filmmaker. He has to make jokes, as a character and as a writer, and it would be hard not to when having a 'chameleon' like the one Leonard Zelig is in the film, going from scene to scene, place to place, historical event to celebrity to circus act to scandal-celeb and, finally, anti-Nazi hero.But there's more to the piece than I remembered first seeing the film when I was younger. It's a very smart and precise account of what a person in society becomes when he tries, and succeeds, to become like those around him. What happens when conforming- or just getting people to 'like' you or respond well to you- goes too far in a direction? We see how Zelig, who first got this gift/curse to be a human chameleon after being beat up as a child (there's a funny story to that, by the way, if you can believe it), does this trick with some people not quite noticing at first, then it spreads like wildfire that this guy can go along with any group he's in. He can be a fat guy, a black musician, a politician, a man with a mustache, anything. We're not shown him being a woman at any point, but that option could be open as well.Zelig is also an epic, in a sense, and as perceptive- maybe a lot more focused in its approach- as Forrest Gump. Where that posited a man drifted through the highs and lows of the 50's through the 60's, with Zelig we're treated to what a man goes through in the world of the press and high fashion and glitz and glamour and living high in the 1920's and 1930's. Allen loves this time period, and the footage he puts together (what he filmed exactly and what wasn't is hard to spot, making it all the more masterful and exquisite, aside from the laugh factor) is infectious in its spirit. And it looks and feels so much like a documentary that it immerses the viewer into its subject matter without a moment's thought of thinking "oh, that looks fake". Often, I was laughing at the specific photos, the way people are put together, and Allen's wit as Zelig that I wouldn't bother to notice its "fake" elements.But beneath its satire on society and what it means to fit in, or not, and the trappings of fame and the fun with psychology ("Freud and I disagreed on Penis Envy," says Zelig as a "Psychologist", "he said it only worked for women"), is a heart. We do feel for Zelig, as well as his state of being and finding of himself with the doctor played by Mia Farrow. So, when these crazy things do happen to him, or around him, or little visual puns are made (San Simeon clips are some of the best), he isn't just some running one-note gag. Allen makes him a character, and even delivers one of his finest performances. He'd have to - he's everyone and no one at once. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing concept, diminishing laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zelig (1983)Amazing concept, diminishing laughsWhen this starts, it's astonishing, and funny, and inventive. And very very well done. Starting with Susan Sontag, the real Sontag, is a leap of reality that seems like it'll carry the whole 79 minutes. And there are truly moments that show up throughout that are good for a gasp or a laugh, the Hitler scene for one. But the concept is the key, and to some extent it's been done before, at least in stills. And once you get it, which might take three minutes or might take ten, you've got it, and it depends more on acting or cleverness from then on. And for me it falters too often to really make it worthwhile (Mia Farrow is really a bore throughout, and even Allen is sometimes straining). I have to say, the first time I saw it I didn't get as tired of it, so if it's the first time you might be thrilled. And if you've seen the 1994 Forrest Gump (and liked it), you owe it to yourself to see Zelig for being first, and in my small view, better, technically.Because technically this is a complete marvel. The original footage is as authentically 1920s and 30s as anything authentic (an odd post modern truth), and the newly composed music and dance numbers are really fabulous, and funny. The team Allen has during all his films this period (many of them my favorites) is none other than Gordon Willis behind the camera, Susan Morse editing, Juliet Taylor casting, and Santo Loquasto costumes. The music by Allen veteran Dick Hyman, who is now more famous for his ragtime renditions, is key, of course, and really convincing (sometimes convincingly bad, very period).So whatever my reservations, this is in many ways a fresh, unique, brilliant film, a small one with big brief moments.</fullReview>

I realize most folks would say that either "Sleeper" or "Bananas" or "Annie Hall" or "Take the Money and Run" or "Hannah and Her Sisters" is his funniest, but I liked "Zelig" best. I loved all the sight gags (especially when Leonard Zelig, surrounded by 250-pound men, starts expanding himself), but the best scene is when Zelig is under hypnosis.Anyway, you're welcome to yell at me, declaring how ignorant I am to have laughed more at "Zelig" than "Annie Hall", but this is just my opinion.

Minute after minute after minute that documentary style when on and on and on endlessly and that joke was always the same. Somebody help me!What a frustration! In this movie there is no acting.When the end titles came on my DVD player read 71 minutes. How about that? A movie that lasts 1 hour 11 minutes? The last time I saw such a short movie was BELLBOY of Jerry Lewis but it was explained in the extras that production put pressure on Lewis to absolutely finish the movie before Christmas (of whatever year that was) so poor Jerry Lewis only managed to come up with approx. 70 minutes of footage.What is Woody Allen's excuse for such a short movie?

		<fullReview>This movie looks and feels just like a real documentary. Real 1920's newsreel footage (into which Woody Allen has been seamlessly inserted) is impossible to tell from the faux-footage Mr. Allen filmed himself. Scenes from the fake 1935 movie telling the Leonard Zelig story, which are shown periodically throughout the film, not only look like a film of that era, but are written and acted as such as well. And interviews with real experts, on the fictional character of Zelig, complete the effect quite nicely. There can be no doubt that this movie looks terrific. But the problem lies in the content.Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon, is a fascinating character. But someone besides Woody Allen should have played him. Mr. Allen is (or can be) a brilliant writer/director, but his range as an actor is limited. And so, though we see plenty of brilliantly done, authentic-looking footage, photos, etc. of Leonard Zelig blending in with his surroundings, we hardly ever see him interact in those surroundings. The pictures and clips of Woody Allen as a rabbi, a fat person, a Nazi, etc. are amusing, but they are not substantial. We are told that he is able, not only to look like those around him, but to converse like them to. But the only time we see him do this is when he's playing a psychiatrist: no stretch for Mr. Allen, who discusses psychoanalysis in many of his films (though usually from the recipient's point-of-view). And so the only time we actually hear from Zelig is when Dr. Eudora Fletcher puts him into a trance, at which time he has no personality of his own. It's a shame; he's such a fascinating character, but the only way we really know he's a fascinating character is because we are told so by others. In lieu of scenes that help us get to know the characters personally, we are given narration and talking heads. This is not the way to make any film, not even a documentary.When it comes to Woody Allen mockumentaries, I much prefer Take the Money and Run. It's not as researched and authentic-looking as Zelig, but it's far funnier, and far more engaging.</fullReview>

This is a one-joke movie, and that joke is stretched much too thin to produce any laughs. There is also just one message: conformity is bad. The joke and the message are exhausted in the first 15 minutes. However, the film then drags on for another hour of repetitious footage as Allen belabors the point. The main purpose of this film is for Allen to show off the technique of merging new footage with historical footage, something that had never been done on this scale. It's an interesting exercise for a short, not a feature film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human Freak of Nature/Curiosity Gets Woody Allen Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before giving us the campy "Purple Rose of Cairo", Woody Allen created "Zelig", another very unique film. The title character is a man who, like a Chameleon, changes his physical appearance to blend in with whomever he is sharing present company. When getting acquainted with an obese man, Zelig suddenly develops a pot-belly; among Asians, Zelig changes appearance to resemble the people near him; no matter how different the person in Zelig's company, he changes to adapt.Mia Farrow plays a psychiatrist (an unusual occupation for a woman in the 1920s &amp; 30s) determined to figure this case out. The predictable romantic involvement ensuing adds to the confusion. The film is enveloped in countless news real excerpts and newspaper headlines. The elaborate "joke" may have been even more effective if kept to a shorter format. A 30 minute short is not always improved by an 80 minute feature film.The Woody Allen character is depicted as not only a curiosity or a freak of nature, but as someone incapable of functioning independently. A human chameleon may be a curiosity, but it does not render an intelligent person as helpless and in need of guarded confinement. Although offering many chuckles and even big laughs, the idea of caging someone who is different, treating him like an "E.T." or "Elephant Man" can make viewers uncomfortable. Our society has not fully evolved to accept such differences. I'm not certain if this film is an argument for or against acceptance of human curiosities. Although the special effects, mainly authentic "aged film footage" and period music are outstanding, the story line is somewhat disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Allen's earlier Take the Money and Run, which was one of the first ever mockumentaries, Zelig has a whimsical perspective on life. The distanced, self-serious retrospective that the faux-documentary style comes with therefore is a great match for Allen's comic sensibilities. In Zelig, he engages with the many facets of the eponymous Leonard Zelig's identity, and takes aim at even the most prominent of targets, namely the Catholic Church and Hitler's Nazi party, without ever seeming like slowing down. Of course, although the format presents itself as informative and possessing great insight, it is anything but. Zelig's conditions allows Allen the openest of conveniences to slot himself in any historical moment he pleases without the slightest hint of illogic or absurdity. Well, perhaps less the latter, but Allen is smart enough to not over-do any of his gags, or to draw too much attention to them. Sneaking into Hitler's elite seamlessly and then suddenly wondering and waving about as if he has no idea why he is there could be such an easy and tasteless joke to make, but here it is played completely straight. The narrators address the event with such concern and serious regard (even a former SS Obergruppenfuhrer grumpily recalls the scenes) and Hitler was reportedly "extremely upset". Mild, and at the same time, a hilarious image is formed. It is nothing at all like what happened in the film adaptation of the fateful meeting. Allen is particularly fond of these deconstructions within his work: see The Purple Rose of Cairo for an entire film on this treatment. Partly why this approach is so believable and successful is because of the technical lengths and achievements that went into integrating the bluescreen footage into the various archival scenes. Fervent critics of Allen might accuse his ego of taking over his films, making himself the centre stage of all the events - imagine if Allen had been as explicit as Forrest Gump. But what makes Zelig work is precisely the opposite; his knack for blending into a scenario like a chameleon renders the thin, pasty face of Allen (and there is no spotting that red hair) almost unrecognisable, and the delight is in how long we can accept a scene for what it is before we suddenly realise where he is. Long- time collaborator Gordon Willis has done a brilliant job of this - the filters, the grain, the decay of the negatives, it all looks authentic. This allows Allen to play with the format in his own way, slip in jokes that would be much less effective overtly. My favourite is the solemn voice-over concerning Zelig's overconfidence which leads him to adamantly disagree with other's opinions. The elderly Fletcher narrates this as some grave medical condition, and all the way during, we see Zelig get comedically violent with a rake with the group of doctors. The exaggerated, slapstick movements are nevertheless visible in the film grain. There is another subversion of the format; Fletcher uses hypnosis in order to draw out intensely personal confessions from the childhood of Zelig (Allen has always had an intense fascination with psychoanalysis). He drones off with the usual beginnings ("My brother beat me" "I just want to fit in") and then trails off in awkwardly hilarious monologues about cheap rabbis and the terrible quality of Fletcher's pancakes (at which point Farrow, red-faced, tries to look away into the distance even though Zelig is not even aware of her). Take the Money and Run was funny enough, but the humour was a little disjointed, and a lot of the jokes felt like leftover bits that Allen wanted to no go to waste. This, on a whole, is more sophisticated and integrated, and knows exactly how to use the mockumentary format to its advantage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it a few days ago and it's now definitely among my top 10 Woody Allen favorites. From start to finish I was amazed by how the story was told and it just felt so real. It could be a real documentary! I also admire the job of the actors doing the part of the testimonies and when we are showed the old photos with the Ken Burns Effect. It's incredible they made this in 1983. I don't know if it was the first mockumentary ever done but I'm sure it influenced a lot since then. There are also some good messages and great lines, even it's not your typical Woody Allen script. All the actors are fantastic and the make up is pretty impressing. When it was over I wanted the movie to start again. It is really a different cinematic experience, original, fresh and funny. I recommend it to everyone, while I know not everyone will be as amazed as I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the only two Woody Allen films to impress me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a Woody Allen fan--yet two films he made are remarkably good--"Match Point" and "Zelig.""Zelig" is quasi-documentary at its best. When you are watching Allen and Mia Farrow, you realize you are also watching "the real Dr Fletcher in color," who does resemble Ms Farrow. Much later you realize the "Real Dr Fletcher" was also an actress. The question is not whether you like Zelig, the real question is when can the viewer be fooled into believing what Allen wants you to believe. Color or B/W do not provide clues here. Great stuff.Watching the real Saul Bellow interview recording was a bonus--a clever bonus from Allen.And for me the best part of the film was the real Susan Sontag interview recordings--she was more attractive than Ms Farrow any day! She could have been a great actress as well as the great thinker we know her as.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Though Not Allen's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Documentary" about a man who can look and act like whoever he's around, and meets various famous people.I found this film clever and the filming techniques are inspired, but it is far from Woody Allen's best. The joke wears out about 45 minutes in, so even with a brief 80 minute run time, it is more than necessary. Strangely, they filmed an interview with Lillian Gish but did not include it. That is probably the film's biggest fail -- Gish would have stepped this up one more notch.This also happens to be one of the few Allen films my library does not carry. Not sure what exactly that implies... draw your own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film with very good music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film I saw back in college and that I now got a chance to see again through the magic of Netflix streaming vid. I joined a bus load of students going up to a multiplex near the Cities, and everyone else was going to see The Big Chill. But I wasn't interested and went alone to see Zelig. That makes me the opposite of the protagonist...t in this film, Leonard Zelig, who wants so much to fit in and be liked that he literally changes his appearance to match whoever he's with.The "Mockumentary" was a brand new art form in 1983, and Woody Allen pulls it off very convincingly. Framing this as the story of a human curiosity from the 1920s, he shoots most of it in black-and-white newsreel format. The story centers on Zelig and the "lady doctor" who tries to "cure" him of his problem, and while she is successful in getting him to stop transforming into whoever he's with, we get the sense that maybe he's getting the last laugh. She has to trick him into letting his guard down so she can put him under hypnosis, but while he's in a trance he seems to tell her what she's always wanted to hear a man say, thus morphing into the man of her dreams. Sure enough, she falls for him, so maybe he's not as "cured" as she thinks? The film keeps us smiling throughout, but the deadpan seriousness of the delivery tends to tamp down any real belly laughs. The two exceptions are the human interest reporter who tries to do a puff piece interviewing the doctor's mother but gets more than he bargained for, and the faux German newsreel documenting Zelig and his fiancée's daring escape from the Nazis, in which the announcer calls them every name in the book, in German! The music is also a very nice touch, with some original songs like "Chameleon Days" and "Doin' the Chameleon" interspersed with actual songs from the '20s. So, while it didn't quite "wow" me, it's still a fun little movie that, in the words of Zelig, "just goes to show what you can do when you're a total psychotic." Seven stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviews for this flick were justified words of praise, although someone name Fiore couldn't figure it out. He probably has not yet learned to count to 10.Viewers, including, it seems, every critic in the books gave it the highest praise. Count me in. It is extremely clever, extremely innovative, and way ahead of its time using special effects that later movie makers borrowed.It slows down every now and then with too much narrative, but when Zelig becomes intertwined with the personalities of the '20s and '30s you don't know whether to sit there and be intrigued of just laugh like a loon, so you do both.To say the least, Woody Allen has always been offbeat. In this case, to coin an appropriate new word, he is off-beater.If you are looking for something very different, and very funny check Mr. Zelig. You will probably do it more than once.On a personal note, I was born in Manhattan (General) Hospital looong, looong ago. I think I recognized the doctor who brought me into the world. No, it was Woody Allen. I am grateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shifting shades of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's Zelig can be considered, if nothing else, an anomaly in every sense of the word. Certainly beyond the parameters of what his prior films had explored in terms of form or theme, Zelig adapts the trappings of a historical documentary exploring the life of a man whose curious affliction (a tendency towards conformity so pronounced that his actual physical form is transformed to match those around him, a literal human chameleon) makes him a national celebrity. However, the crucial distinction lies in the fact that the subject of the 'documentary' is played by Allen himself, thereby eliminating any pretensions of realism. As such, it becomes clear that Allen's film is entirely more sophisticated than a 79 minute film coasting by on a single joke premise, but a nuanced, tragic and ultimately tremendously uplifting meditation on identity, whether individual or collective (or a hybrid of both), the function of celebrity, media and audience, and the role of genuine interpersonal feelings within the shuffle. And beyond all that, it's accessible and funny too!Disguised within pristinely re-created crackly historical footage and Patrick Horgan's acute replication of traditional documentary narration, Allen's Zelig drifts in and out of recognizable historical settings and events, every time perfectly blending with his surroundings, before being entrapped by a more standard 'therapy-turned-love-plot' by ambitious therapist Dr. Eudora Fletcher, played crisply yet warmly and with entire credibility by Mia Farrow. Nonetheless, despite the fearfully contrived nature of the latter half of the plot, there is nothing in the film that doesn't somehow hit home as genuine or acceptable, as even the foray into romance functions equally as either reflexive social critique (what audience member wouldn't assume or yearn for a budding romance?) and as wholly heartwarming in spite of itself, infusing a largely intentionally dry, thoughtful film with some offbeat, quiet warm and sentiment. There also lies a peculiar case of art seemingly anticipating life reacting to art in this regard, as in the film, the widespread turn towards criticism and ostracization of Zelig once he stops doing what the masses expect of him, could all too easily be theoretically applied to Allen as filmmaker, whether in regards to this specific film or throughout his career. The real question throughout is who or what Zelig is actually supposed to represent. Allen himself, his own identity consistently misconstrued throughout his numerous, allegedly life- like film personas? A figure emblematic of the mutability of film and performance themselves? Or simply an empty signifier, slyly intended to be, like the character himself, consistently having interpretations and judgments passed upon him? Allen's motivation remains typically unclear, but the ambiguity lies as part of the film's genius, consistently leaving the audience questioning how aligned they are with the frantic, fickle crowds depicted within the film, thus lending the film an unshakable, lingering impact. It would seem, however, given his inclusion of contemporary interviews by respected intellectuals (a device mimicked in later faux- documentary Sweet and Lowdown), that Allen's key focus is not only to provide food for thought, but largely an extensive joke on the pretensions of authenticity of the documentary medium, intended to be chuckled at more than scrutinized at every turn. Finally, the film's reputation as "Woody Allen meets Forrest Gump" also proves to be somewhat of a misnomer (particularly as Zelig predates Gump by over a decade). Rather than being simply a gimmick, Allen's insertion of himself into historical footage (including a particularly iconic appearance at a Nazi rally), while a particularly impressive early special effect, is all the more impressive in its keeping with the film's overall tone of subtlety, blending into the background for the sake of highlighting the film's theme of the cultural celebration of conformity rather than showboating. In many ways, the literal transformations of Allen (turning him obese, Chinese and African American among others, all surprisingly convincingly) by way of prosthetics and makeup are far more impressive, simply due to their ability to actually credibly depict the most unlikely transfigurations of the iconic Allen while still making them appear remarkably unassuming and natural. Equally interesting is Allen's treatment of his own performance as Zelig. While playing the part with wonderful flatness yet subtle charisma, it is intriguing to note that during the few excerpts of his dialogue, Allen's Zelig, the "man without a personality", spouts out witticisms and one-liners exactly along the lines of the traditional Allen persona, as if Allen could not resist repressing his usual 'character' even when portraying a blank slate of a man. Rather than a self-indulgence, this again feels a deliberate commentary, whether on the viewer assumptions of Allen to "play himself" as per usual, to question the seemingly black and white distinction between 'having' or 'not having' a personality, or to further posit Allen himself as ultimately empty, like Zelig, without his persona. At any rate, Allen's performance as such emerges as both enjoyable (and frequently hilarious) and fascinating, again furthering the film's continual vein of satisfying both sets of expectations.A seemingly simplistic film which, upon closer inspection, unearths fascinating layers of complexity and cleverness, Zelig proves equally capable of satisfying those reading it as a Freudian self-analysis and rumination on the character of art or those interpreting it as a chance to see Woody Allen be silly in a different context (and particularly those looking for both). Certainly a unique film from whatever stance it is examined, Zelig, like its protagonist, threatens to innocuously fade into the background of cinematic history, potentially only examined by Woody Allen enthusiasts or scholars. Nonetheless, a film of such unique, understated creativity and whimsy deserves ample appreciation, and as such should be viewed by those familiar or fond of Allen as well as those generally turned off by his traditional output. -9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great experience, oscillating between pure woody allen territory and serious film ideas that woody places before absolutely every one of his films, even the failed ones.Here he places himself apparently in the middle of the narrative exploration that Welles started with Kane. But only apparently. In Kane, we had several views of the same story, in that case the story was the life of a man. Each view was from the direct perspective of a specific narrator (newsreel, ex-wife, best friend...). It broke a lot of rules and, together with Toland/Welles' impressive visual work, it changed the course of cinema, we all know.This Zelig also uses visual elements from apparently different sources to put up a story. It also teams up one of the best cinematographers ever, whose pairing with Allen produced a number of unsurpassed quality films (including the incredibly moving Manhattan, disparaged by Woody himself!). The story here is also the life of a man. And that life is also heavily self-biographical to its author/actor.But something is fundamentally different. Each different medium, each different visual language is here to show us some insight on one story. Every bit completes the others, it never competes with them. So the narrative strategy is that we the narrator (one single narrator) is (apparently) collaborating with the audience to show them the story he proposed to tell. That's why the fake documentary form fits perfectly. We are given every sort of ordinary TV documentary tricks, from testimonies of witnesses now old to bits of newsreels "from the 20'". Visually it's well stitched together, and i admit it was probably very hard to keep the pace of such a film, because this form is fitted for real stories, where the interest of wanting to know the thing makes you want to keep on watching. But this is well put together.Whenever we deviate from the rules Woody established for this film, we are on his grounds of comedy. Of all the bits, the white room sessions with Mia Farrow are the funniest, also because we step out of fiction and see Woody's personal passion in those days.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pop Culture goes *pop*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an engaging mockumentary about Leonard Zelig (writer/director Woody Allen), the undisputed medical phenomenon of 1929. So serious is his neurological condition, that he will assimilate the physical, mental, and even cultural attributes of whomever with he spends significant time. That's right--around fat people, he gets fat. Around black people, he becomes black. He'll develop a beard and orthodox learning before your eyes if he's around rabbis. The only one who understands, and consequently, fights for him, is the long-suffering Dr. Eudora Nesbitt Fletcher (Mia Farrow), determined to find the cure.It's just a shame that this film didn't win more awards than it actually did, and a near perfect crime that it's not discussed more often than it is. For one thing, it's far and away among Allen's VERY BEST. The textbook subjects that he confronts so well, such as disease and physical yearnings, are present, but are righteously treated as window dressing for the presentation of the story. The insertion of Allen, Farrow, and a cast of their pals (all of whom perform to a T) to the pre-war era is eye-popping, to say the least. As said before, it's a mockumentary executed so nicely that it could make Christopher Guest turn stone with envy. The highly improbable plot is considerably well-handled, leading us to the inevitable comparison that follows.Now, if you run around praising "Forrest Gump" (and I KNOW you do), and you haven't seen this, you're really missing it. As fun and briefly interesting as "Gump" was, this classic edges past it, for the simple reason that it knows better than to take itself seriously. This is a comedy, start to finish. The gags are gags, and never manipulate. When we feel for Zelig, Eudora, or both, it's real. After all, who HASN'T tried to fit in somewhere? Finally, the ever-changing way in which the public views/treats Zelig through the whole ordeal that was his "career" exposes the fickle nature of pop culture, showing it for the joke that it is. This was truly Woody at his finest, in a work that definitely should have a little more admiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual and hilarious mockumentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zelig", Woody Allen's follow-up to his "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy", is a hilarious faux documentary focusing on Leonard Zelig, a man capable of transforming himself, and his bizarre adventures. "Zelig" is a successful film not just because it's a remarkably funny movie with, hands down, some of the best dialogue Woody Allen has ever written, but because it reaches past its premise (which would have been amusing only as a half-hour short or something of the sort) to become yet another Allen film with psychological preoccupations. It really does have depth, but doesn't go too far in that direction to distract from the comedy, which really is brilliant.The film is only 80 minutes long, but its flaws are still entirely due to the length. It's a mockumentary that feels a little like watching one of those documentaries where you wish the subject's life didn't suddenly get boring towards the end. It's still an excellent film, but I definitely feel sorry that it wasn't mind-bogglingly brilliant as it definitely had the potential to be.It's shot as and looks like most documentaries do, but the archive footage, thanks to Allen and Gordon Willis, looks absolutely spot-on and just about completely convincing, and the film's best visual moments come with faux footage of a 1935 Warner Bros. feature, "The Changing Man", which top to bottom looks and feels like a thirties studio feature. Those scenes are among the funniest in the film as well.With its typical preoccupations with psychology and psychoanalysis, "Zelig" is a look at familiar subject matter from Woody Allen, but through a fresh and different perspective. It's one of the best mockumentaries around, in spite of feeling a bit dragged-out, and it is absolutely hilarious in places, with some of the energy of Allen's stand-up shining through here and there. Tremendously entertaining.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inventive Allen mockumentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen delivered Zelig in the middle of a particularly strong creative patch. He had successfully navigated from pure comedies to more serious comedy-dramas. If anything, Zelig falls into the former category. But it's really quite different to anything else he had directed at that point. It's a pretty experimental movie in many ways, one that uses technical wizardry like no other Allen movie. It takes the form of a mockumentary, and in order to successfully achieve its aims, it blends old and new films such that Woody himself appears seamlessly in old footage depicting various historical figures and scenes. In this sense, it pre-dates the Oscar winning Forrest Gump by a decade.Its story revolves around a strange figure called Leonard Zelig. He is a man who had a significant effect on world affairs but who is now forgotten. Historians and people who knew him discuss his life in a talking heads format, while we see a variety of stills and clips taken from different parts of his life. It appears that he was known as a human chameleon, in that he was able to change his appearance and personality at will, so that he could blend into any situation; in this way he was, for example, able to turn black, put on excessive weight, speak new languages, etc at will. The premise is of course entirely fantastical but it is treated with sober seriousness by the narrator. This mixture of silliness with a dry academic documentary style is what makes it the film that it is. I guess it has some things to say about conformity and celebrity but in essence it's an amusing inventive docucomedy. It reminded me a little bit of Peter Greenaway's The Falls in it's absurdist humour and documentary realism, except this is a good deal more accessible and, of course, funnier. Having said all that, it isn't among Allen's best works in my opinion. It's neither as funny as his best comedies, nor as emotionally involving as his best dramas. Nevertheless, it is one of his most original. And where else can we see Allen goofing around behind Adolf Hitler at a Nazi rally? Overall, it's a film that once again proves Allen is a highly original talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even when I highly respect Woody Allen as a filmmaker, I'm not a big fan of his movies.However, if I had to choose one of all the movies that he has done as my favorite; "Zelig" would be my first choice.It isn't only wonderfully directed and has the subtle sense of humor displayed by the other films of Woody Allen, but it also has an incredibly story, which fits perfectly well with mockumentary visual style used on this film. The balance between the comedy and the sentimental parts of plot (which tells an honest, truly endearing love story) is perfect, being displayed in a very convincing way, containing also a healthy dose of irony and satire that completes all the virtues previously mentioned. The result is a very rewarding experience, which could be easily considered as the best film directed by Woody Allen to date.Personally, I think that this is one of the most intelligent and better written comedies ever made in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When to be 'like' is the key to be 'liked' ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What pair of words can give the most proper description of Woody Allen's "Zelig"? Fictional documentary? Nostalgic mockumentary? Social commentary? Psychoanalytical enigma? Thought-provoking comedy? Poignant romance? An even harder question: tone-wise, what is the film's most defining aspect? Egomaniac self-derision? Intelligent self-deprecation? Ingenuous irreverence? Experimental experimentalism? Or just fun, fun and plain fun ? and where the heck am I going with all these interrogations? Simply to the point of their pointlessness, "Zelig" surely is a remarkable genre-bending piece of art, but it's also into everything that made its AUTHOR so unique, irresistible and appealing.Yes, I insist on the authorship, because in the very case of "Zelig", it's not pretentious to call it 'cinema d'auteur', on that level, it even redeems the dreadful "Stardust Memories" precisely disappointing because Allen tried to copy a style that didn't belong to him. "Zelig" is definitely Allen's film, it is an artistic masterpiece because it can't be compared to another film and because it found the perfect format to handle its subject:: mockumentary? What is funnier than something funny except something funny handled in a very serious way?Indeed, when real-life intellectuals are interviewed and speak about this strange pop-culture phenomenon that was Leonard Zelig, it's not only subtly hilarious; it also elevates Allen's talent to a level of wizardry. It's almost magical how not only Allen is able to capture the zaniness of the roaring twenties but also to make the whole thing absolutely realistic. He makes the 'fantasy' aspect of the basic plot's premise totally believable, by encapsulating the era into many relevant archive footage of the era, and inserting several cameos of its most influential people from Chaplin to Lindbergh, from Capone to Hitler, and using the reel voice-over narration with the perfect tonality.That's the trademark of the greatest films, they don't just take their story for granted but they try to transcend an already qualitative content. And "Zelig" is also a remarkable technical achievement on the field of photography and cinematography, I don't know much about the use of lenses and the possibility to make a picture look dated and deteriorated, but let's just say that one decade before "Forrest Gump", they were able to put Woody Allen behind Adolf Hitler and make it look quite seamless. This level of perfectionism is vital because the format chosen by Allen wouldn't have allowed a fake look; it's precisely because it looks real that the gags work.And the more I see "Zelig", the more I realize that the movie works on a self-reflexive way as if it was deliberately trying to embody the very condition of its titular character, a man who tries so hard to fit into every human group, to be liked by everybody that he mysteriously develop the same physical characteristics and mannerisms of the personalities around him. It's as if for the first time, Allen abandoned his self-absorbed neurotic lovable loser character to let express the most hidden part of his personality, a man uncomfortable with what he is, lost in an era where everything is dramatized for the sake of it.Mia Farrow enriches the story with her part as Dr. Eudora Fletcher, the psychoanalyst who wants to understand Leonard Zelig with the well-intentioned motive to help him to overcome his condition. Their interactions are handled with the perfect mix of comedy and poignancy, especially during the hypnosis, one of the film's best moments. Between many laughs, we understand the insecurity lying beneath Zelig's strange behavior, a ferocious and unconscious desire to fit in the crowd, to be like everybody as if it meant liked by everybody. If you extrapolate this, you'll end up realizing that there are the very aspects of human personalities that were exploited by totalitarian movements, hence the cameos of some infamous characters.The zany 20's provided larger-than-life, eccentric, charismatic characters fittingly heroes, stars, gangsters or even dictators, people who could inspire both jealousy and admiration in this orgy of entertainment, before the crashing climax left people with a painful hangover that would plant the seeds of a coming War. Zelig not only fitted his entourage but also his era, a pure product of a time where the world reached two extremes, where being different and forming one was two different norms defining two sides of the world that would collide in 1939. That's the intelligent poignancy of "Zelig", humorously dealing with History's facts, just as "Radio Days" would do, four years later.And to a certain extent, the conclusion of Eudora Fletcher's therapy reflects the self-reflexive aspect I mentioned. The film is a cinematic chameleon, and not just one of Allen's most ingenuous, but one of his best. I don't think it had to do with the Allen's envy to please his fans by any means, after the average "Stardust Memories" and "Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy", but probably a desire to become himself again, and to redefine himself as the major comedic director he's always been. How? Simply by bringing something new in the screen as he did in his directorial debut "Take the Money and Run" in 1969, and it's not too much of a coincidence that both have the same format.Like a more confident and perfectionist "Take the Money and Run", "Zelig" marks Woody Allen's rebirth, a new impulse of his creativity during the 80's that would reach a splendid pinnacle with "The Purple Rose of Cairo", "Hannah and Her Sisters" and "Radio Days". And after watching "Zelig" a second time, I genuinely found the film better than the much more applauded "Broadway Danny Rose" and like many cinematic masterpieces, very insightful about their author's psyche and Zelig is simply Woody Allen reconciling with himself through one of his greatest characters.Bill Cosby said : "I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody." Both Leonard Zelig and Woody Allen would have probably agreed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Personality of an Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zelig [1983] is undoubtedly one of Woody Allen's finest works. Coming shortly after and maintaining the brilliance that Manhattan [1979] and Annie Hall [1977] shared with us, Woody's writing and directing in Zelig makes it perhaps his best work. Taking on documentary fashion, this mockumentary seeks to comment on a man with a dissociative identity disorder, or as the movie calls him, a chameleon. The mental illness or perhaps genius of the man is his ability to take on characteristics of those around him. Woody presses this to the extreme as we see Zelig transformed from a baseball player to a mobster to a black musician even to a Native American. Leave it up to his comedic routine to establish a connection with satire and cultural stereotypes.Nominated for cinematography and costume design, one can see and breathe the Jazz Age. We hear the chameleon song and see a movie made after him. The social commentary sets in as he is treated by a doctor played by Mia Farrow. She can't seem to break him as he soon assimilates the role of doctor. After much turmoil, she assumes the role of patient, which sends Zelig into his own role as patient. Of course, there is nothing there, as his world crashes down on him. He then starts on about some Freudian childhood memories, and she can begin to treat him.Dare I say that this is Woody's greatest commentary on the social condition? He seeks to describe not just the whirlwind that is mental illness, but carries it all the way to the personality that is an era, and the effect it has on man. I have to be honest here and say that I too fell victim to being a chameleon. Growing up in a military family and moving around a lot, I became well versed in the ways of getting new friends to like me and assuming my role in the new culture. The next question takes us back to the patient-doctor situation, where Zelig assumes the role of doctor, and the doctor the role of patient. If being a chameleon is bad, then how does one not fall entrapped when one seeks to remedy the cause at its root, by becoming the identity of another, for surely all are somewhat something that they are not, and one cannot cure everyone? Woody drives home his doctrine that bending to the opinions of others makes one a fascist, as we see Zelig become a fascist Nazi, literally lost in the masses. Escaping death, Zelig uses his disability as genius to become a pilot, and flies a plane across the Atlantic upside down. We may not always know everything, but if we use our talents and creativity to inspire us, there is little we cannot do. At the end of the movie, Zelig is seemingly cured and lives happily ever after, married to his doctor. The ending goes on to talk of love, and how it can shine a light in our own lives to help us find our own identity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen's brilliant mockumentary over a funny and chamaleonic figure of the 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jewish, socially rejected, and then a enigmatic figure coming out of the mind of Woody Allen, Leonard Zelig, the main character in one of the first mockumentaries ever made (I believe it is the first) is a chamaleonic guy who transforms himself with the same clothes and personal characteristics of the person he talks or appears at his side. Famous personalities like writer Saul Bellow and others talk about the mysterious and famous Zelig and his cultural influence in the American society of the 1920's and 1930's with his ability to change of personality in a blink of an eye.Here's a story of a man who wants to fit in the society, be accepted to it but he doesn't know how to because he seemed to lost his persona after a event involving his desire to read "Moby Dick". Someone asked if he had read the book and his positive answer "transformed" him into a human chameleon changing from Asian, African American, a obese man, a nazist and many other figures. Not only the physical characteristic but he thinks he has the ability to work in the same profession of the person he follows, so you're gonna see him delivering babies without knowing how to, or becoming a aviator ? la Charles Lindbergh. To help him overcome with this hilarious and problematic skill a doctor (Mia Farrow) is going to make a groundbreaking medical research on Zelig and discovers the reason behind this changes. And of course, there's a love story between them.Helped with a excellent and complex cinematography by Gordon Willis evoking the memorable News Obituary from "Citizen Kane", "Zelig" tells the story of its character with a grained but very stylish photography, making the film with a realistic look of the 1920's and 1930's, where Allen has the chance to be closer to many personalities of the time, or attending a Nazi party while Hitler's speeching. It has the same quality that made "Forrest Gump" a interesting and remarkable film where a character passes decades meeting famous people in unusual events.But "Zelig" is a comedy and being so it has some of the funniest lines of a film written and directed by Allen. His opinion on baseball; his wish to read "Moby Dick" quoting the book as the most intellectual book of all; and all of hypnosis sessions where he says things about a masturbation class and his childhood where everybody beat up on him and in his family are among the most memorable and funniest lines in the film. Writing, directing and acting Allen succeeds in a spectacular and positive film with a impeccable mise en scene that is very believable in recreating the old era of Jazz, the American society of the period and it is a very entertaining and very historical film even though Zelig never existed. But sometimes we think he could have existed. But he's very real to many of us in this great film! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody along with Willis perfects his invention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen who arguably invented the mockumentary with the hilarious Take the Money and Run brings it to another level in Zelig. Allen along with cinematographer Gordon Willis manage to take 20s and 30s newsreels and apply it seamlessly to Willis's footage of Allen's fictional creation Leonard Zelig, the chameleon man.Leonard Zelig (Allen) is a typical nondescript average Joe with one remarkable trait-the ability to morph into any situation with convincing expertise. He gets close to world figures (on a balcony with the pope, on deck behind Babe Ruth)and later finds out he's been performing surgery. Before this is revealed though Zelig becomes a popular celebrity (further solidified by a dance song entitled The Chameleon) taking his place with all of the other popular celebrities of the day. Dr. Eudora Fletcher tries to get inside the head of Zelig through hypnosis and he falls in love with her (in spite of her pancakes) and they plan to marry. At this point dozens of women make the claim he married them while others sue him for (one for delivering her baby with ice tongs) malpractice. With pressure mounting Zelig does what he does best, disappear.This sober faced faux documentary with its outrageous central character is filled with things to both laugh and marvel at. Getting the grainy footage to match so well with newsreel you find yourself being fooled more than once. Stills of Zelig and other celebrities, crackling audio, retro doc music score and staged scenes from the era are impeccably adjusted to create maximum believability, evoking humor through Zelig's responses as well as through the clinical narration of the absurd goings on.As Zelig, Allen is charmingly ambiguous and comfortable in his many skins. Since his conflict is with himself Allen is free of the de riguer whiny rants he has with female leads in many of his other films, flashing a genuine smile at press conferences and claiming being psychotic can lead to a world of opportunity.Where Allen really shines though is in the exacting detail of capturing the period's history in look and sound and injecting an implausible character into the proceedings without missing a beat. Zelig is one brilliant and original satire that a quarter of a century later remains the template on the perfectly executed retro fit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"My one regret in life is that I am not someone else." - Woody Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's Zelig studies a made-up "chameleon man" from the jazz age, a man who appears to have no identity of his own, who instead assumes the attributes of people around him. Allen takes the concept to humorously absurd levels. It's not just that Zelig is bashful around bashful people, outgoing around outgoing people, and pretends to be a doctor around doctors or a musician around musicians. No, Zelig also becomes black when around blacks, fat when around fat people, Chinese when around Chinese people, and a Nazi when around by Nazis. Of course he becomes a huge cultural phenomenon, though he's treated by a psychiatrist, one of Mia Farrow's best performances. Naturally at first her work is foiled by his inclination, when with her, to take on the persona of a psychiatrist, but she seems to make progress when she hits upon the cunning approach of claiming that she is not a psychiatrist but only pretends to be one.Together with flourishing as a hilarious and light-heartedly enjoyable film, Zelig engagingly traverses the universal dilemma of personal identity. Rather directly, given all of the ways in which we're different from the people we were at ten, fifteen and twenty, in what way can it be said that we're the same people as those young men/women, teenagers and kids? Of what exactly is one's individual personality comprised? Because the eponymous character transforms more excessively and more spasmodically than most do, the character of Zelig arouses this question more palpably.One might see the film as an analysis of falsehood, the inclination to go along dormantly with the crowd, to do what others do, to believe what others believe, trustingly, instead of thinking for oneself and behaving in kind. There is the notion that those who live this way miss the chance to live their own lives, but instead ultimately die having lived the lives merely of the others or of the crowd. Allen's portrayal of Zelig as becoming a Nazi when surrounded by Nazis explicitly raises the ethical and party-line concern of phoniness, as well as the existential one. It might be viewed that the whole reason for the film's time and place is so that it can lead to the idea that genocidal onslaught and warfare does not occur because thousands go insane, but because millions will submissively and compliantly follow the orders of the few who are. One explanation for why they do so is that they want to fit in, and to be free of the blame or strain of self-reliant thinking and doing.Zelig is so convincing in its portrayal of a documentary, and yet it's not one. It's a purely fictional, wildly over-the-top story. It's ingenious in taking on the same all-encompassing inauthenticity as its title character. We're in some sense meant to pretend it's true or realistic, when it's anything but. It's comprised of antiquated newsreels, grainy black-and-white footage, old photographs, old recordings, all-encompassing voice-over, even interviews with such contemporary intellectuals as Susan Sontag, Saul Bellow and others, all of whom play themselves offering critique and perspective. The fictitious characters are flawlessly assimilated into images of Hitler, Pope Pius XI, Eugene O'Neill, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Charlie Chaplin, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, James Cagney, William Randolph Hearst, Babe Ruth, etc. Allen never taints the deception that we're watching a documentary about an actual historical figure.It would also seem, however, that the most pertinent description of Zelig could be self-alienation, as he leads an inauthentic life, with the modern tendency to coast through life submissively, trustingly assuming the views, principles and manners of others instead of attentively shaping his own intentions, principles and concerns, based on his own experiences, of which he has an inordinate many. It's simple to taunt and belittle such pretended compliance as gutless. It's evident that Allen doesn't like it, but even so he suggests a compassionate answer to Zelig's motivation, essentially by pointing out that Zelig is right to be worried about his security. When he was a kid, his brother beat him, his sister beat his brother, his father beat the three of them, the neighbors beat his family, and the people down the block beat the neighbors and his family. He was constantly bullied by anti-Semites. His parents, who never took his side and always blamed him, sided with the anti-Semites. It's easy to see why someone in such an environment would fearfully want to be invisible, to be liked, which is safe.All this, and the movie's only 79 minutes long. Nevertheless, Zelig is a cheerful and uplifting film. Eventually, we see the character fall in love, overpower his life of incoherence, find individual purpose and fly an airplane upside-down across the Atlantic. He is also not the only character to be intriguingly elucidated. They have to be their own individuals, and make their own moral choices. "Otherwise, you're like a robot, or a lizard."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding- a 10*+++</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So often, members of ensembles like SNL or Second City have less success when they make feature films, because they attempt a presentation of 2 hours or so on the large screen, more appropriate to a 10- or 15-minute skit on TV. The same is true for some hugely-successful sitcom stars, who become virtually billionaires from TV, but whose films have modest success, or are box office disasters. Again, they seem unable to translate to the 2-hour/big screen venue material which played well for the 22 minutes or so during their half-hour programs.Like many of his films - and perhaps the best example of all - Allen's "Zelig" takes a premise and shtick which would play very well in a 10-minute to half-hour TV venue, and makes it thoroughly engrossing and entertaining as a full-length feature movie. In fact, I've never seen a single Woody Allen movie which I wouldn't have enjoyed if he'd made 50% longer.Everything about this movie is outstanding: the humor, both oral and visual, the superb film artistry in creating a complete feel for the period of the film, and the technical expertise displayed without any disturbance of the impression of this being filmed with earlier, more primitive resources.If somebody placed a gun to my head and insisted on a criticism, it could only be that I'd wish that he place the names of the real-life personalities, portrayed as commenting on Leonard Zelig, on-screen every time they were shown, and leave them on-screen a bit longer.My liking of Allen films is so complete that if I were to rate all in order, the lowest on the list wouldn't be below a "9.9," and I can't think of any I wouldn't accord a "10." My personal favorites (both with Mia Farrow, and both black-and-white with the intentionally "grainy" filming technique) - this film, and the equally- and delightfully-quirky "Broadway Danny Rose."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether a comedy meets the test of time takes, well, time... and Zelig passes. I originally described Zelig as a "one joke movie," but added it is a pretty good and very original joke (even if there are echos of Robert Crumb's comic book history of the early mysterious life of Mr. Natural). Now I see Zelig as much more.Woody's deadpan faux history is a very loving evocation of the 1920s and 1930s through its use of tasty bits of period film. It also manages to mock documentaries themselves, and (with its riotous use of prominent real world geniuses who deliver many of the funniest lines of the film) to mock intellectual pretension generally, and psychology in particular.But in the end it is a love story, and a metaphor for the struggle of immigrants to assimilate, giving the film a bittersweet quality not often seen in Woody's films.Silly, ridiculous, and giggle-ishious. You keep expecting the inventiveness to flag and it never. Fun &amp; highly recommended.Til</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Films Of The 80's: Zelig</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zelig (1983): Starring Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, John Buckwalter, Patrick Horgan, Marvin Chatinover, Stanley Swerdlow, Paul Nevens, Ralph Bell, Richard Witing, Sol Lomita, Mary Louise Wilson, Sharon Ferrol-Young, Erma Campbell, Director Woody Allen For me, Zelig was Woody Allen's greatest film, despite the success and overall genius of Annie Hall, which put Allen on the map. His creative comedy, a blend of intellectual humor, Jewish culture, psychological and sexual jokes, a tendency to romanticize and glamorize New York City's past, all which would continue to be prominent in other films throughout the 80's, notably in "Hannah And Her Sisters", is at the core of this film, which is directed so as to resemble and parody a serious black-and-white documentary about an actual 20th century man. This man is Zelig (Woody Allen), a shy, unassuming, meek little Jewish man with a rare identity disorder. He cannot live a normal life as himself due the serious problem of his ability to transform himself to adapt to his surroundings, i.e. when he is around Native Americans, he becomes Native American, when in the company of black people, his skin turns black, when around overweight people, he gains weight. His body changes to the skin color of every ethnic group he is around with. This miracle of biology earns him the title of "Chamaleon Man". Consequently, he makes friends, wives, lovers and enemies. With such an absurd and fantastical premise, Zelig becomes a fun and brilliant escapist fantasy, though presented as if it were a true story and a true disorder. Actress Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby, The Great Gatsby) who was romantically involved with Woody Allen at this time, stars as his therapist, Dr. Eudora Fletcher. She records hypnotic sessions with Zelig and studies his disorder extensively. The time they share together as patient and doctor gradually becomes a romantic relationship. An attractive aspect of this comedy is the fact that Zelig's celebrity status draws famous personages of the 20's, 30's and 40's into his life. He is so loved that he is able to hob-nob with silent legend Charlie Chaplin, newspaper millionaire William Randalph Hearst, novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, Broadway star Fanny Brice, actress Dolores Del Rio, black French exotic dancer Josephine Baker, gangster Al Capone, aviator legend Charles Lindbergh. In one scene, Zelig has fled the US after a polygamy scandal (He can't recall having married different women because he was different men at the time!). He hides himself among the Nazis, and we get to see Adolph Hitler himself at a speech rally. All this is done using actual footage of these historic people, with the camera trick of putting Woody Allen into the footage. This is exactly like "Forest Gump" 10 years later, only in that film Gump appeared in various footages of the late 60's and 70's. The movie can border on cartoonish sometimes but it's highly enjoyable. The Jazz Age is well-rendered, and the original songs resemble popular styles of the time, especially in the song "Chameleon Days" which is modeled after a Charleston-like dance song sung by a vocalist who sounds a lot like Betty Boop!! This is my favorite Woody Allen film. If you haven't seen Woody Allen movies and want to start, this is one you should definitely watch, along with "Annie Hall", "Hannah And Her Sisters" "Midsummer Night's Dream Sex Comedy" and "Alice", a film which Woody Allen directed but did not appear in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome piece of film-making a true Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a keystone in Woody Allen's career. It truly shows him to be the definitive descendant of Franz Kafka. Hundreds have imitated &amp; paid homage to Kafka in the 80 years or so since he wrote his masterpieces but no one has come close to metamorphosing Kafka's vision &amp; mindset to contemporary American culture as Allen has. Leonard Zelig's relationship to other people, worldly events, "identity" &amp; the "otherness" in society exactly expresses the the points of view of Joseph K, Gregor Samsa, the Hunger Artist &amp; the rest of their brethren.On a personal level one can view the "chameleon" message of the film as Mr. Allen's gentle explanation of how &amp; why he makes so many different kinds of films, imitations to some, homages to others, to great authors, directors. Classic comedies, domestic dramas, social satires, you name it, he does it. He truly speaks everyone's language, he thinks &amp; feels like them (us), he becomes them (us).On top of which the purely film-making aspects of Zelig are stunning. The seamless integration of newsreel footage with contemporary invention. The 100 percent authentic feel of the music, dance, film grain, sound, with the time depicted. All of it a major accomplishment of a giant artist.No question in my mind that this is Woody Allen's greatest achievement among many many stupendous accomplishments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is why we love movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something of a chameleon in all of us when we enter a movie theatre or sit in front of the TV. We leave ourselves behind and hope to enter the life of someone else and proverbially walk in his or her shoes for two hours. We also go to see visions we've never seen before and to perhaps feel an overwhelming enchantment with the magic of cinema. `How did they do that?' we say ? or an even more exciting question is `How did they think of that??' Ultimately, it is the imagination behind the magic than the slight of hand itself that becomes ingrained in our consciousness.Woody Allen has always been a master of absurd ingenuity, from dubbing over a Japanese pulp thriller with a ludicrous plot involving an egg salad recipe (What's Up Tiger Lily?) to creating a film where a character in a movie walks off the screen (The Purple Rose of Cairo). But this film takes the cake! There's social satire (of Warren Beatty's film `Reds' as well as the social pundits he chose: all with their tongues firmly in cheek). There's an AMAZING array of 1920s-1930s footage that not only is choked full of some of the most influential people of the twentieth century, it also contains a lots of footage of the streets and the popular forms of entertainment of the day -including a wild variety of songs. There's footage of Woody himself standing in frame with these influential people (including Hitler!), blending in so naturally that you have to do a double take each time to figure out what's `real' and what isn't. And then, in between gasps of awe and spasms of laughter, the most profound bits of magic shine through. You care about this guy. You ARE this guy, and he is you. The most human vulnerabilities of feeling like an outsider (like fears of not fitting in or of not being liked) rise within your own memories. Also, your desires to be like those beautiful ghosts on the silver screen. To be glamourous, graceful, heroic, funny, not to mention (at least temporarily) black, Asian, Indian, or a notorious gangster or a jazz musician. Who wouldn't want to hang out with Charlie Chaplin at Hearst Castle, or stand next to the Pope as he delivers his Easter Sunday sermon? That's why we go to movies, to be there. To be everyone and everything and retain just a bit of it in our daily lives to add dimension to our own ?character'. Sometimes we retain some of the lingo, or perhaps a hairstyle or an `attitude', or maybe if the film is powerful enough, we even find a bit of personal bravery to fight through the hard times we're having. No wonder Leonard Zelig is a hero! He's a composite of all we'd secretly desire to be.I also think of Zelig as an analogy of America, with its constant demand to assimilate yet its wonderful contradictory stubbornness in retaining individuality. We are a generic society, but we still celebrate the pioneer spirit and the rebel. We may be infested with shopping malls and advertising, but we will always retain our true spirit as long as we have jazz and rock and roll, and cinema icons like Woody Allen. Yep, Woody is a rebel, as much as Jim Morrison or James Dean because he supplies us with the adventure of imagination. I've been a Woody Allen fan for thirty-four years, even though I must admit there are only a few films of his that I've liked in the past thirteen years. But I think he's more than made up for it with his ingenuity, and with his ability to fuse into our vulnerabilities and liberate us from them. I hope one day they put on a ticker-tape parade for Woody. If anyone deserves it, it's the Woodman!</fullReview>

The fake documentary about 'the chameleon man' takes places in the jazz era in the 1930's and counts with great acting by Woody himself and Mia Farrow, who plays Dr. Fletcher, a psychiatrist that will take a great part in Zelig's life. Filmed in black and white and showing many fake interviews, the "documentary" shows many of Woody's greatest jokes and one-liners, and it's completely amusing. If you have the chance, don't miss it.

		<fullReview>Unlike "Take the Money and Run" and "Husbands and Wives" -- to choose two Allen films from opposite ends of the spectrum that also use the trappings of the documentary form -- "Zelig" could actually pass for one thanks to the care that was taken in bringing it to the screen. While it can be outlandish at times (e.g. when Zelig is given an experimental drug that literally drives him up a wall), the narration is spoken with such deadpan sincerity that you have no choice but to swallow it. The contemporary interviews also help in this regard (a device that was later employed in "Sweet and Lowdown," also to good effect).It's no wonder Gordon Willis's fine cinematography was nominated for an Academy Award. In fact, the whole film is carried off so well -- and the documentary aspects so convincing -- that it possibly obscures Allen's achievements as writer and director. (No matter; he would be recognized for both the following year with "Broadway Danny Rose.") And his acting is also frequently overlooked. The scene where, under hypnosis, Zelig reveals that he hates Dr. Fletcher's pancakes is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can a person have more than one masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zelig is an utterly remarkable film. It works on several different levels. First, it is presented as a documentary. Of course, no one is expected to view it only on this level. It's obviously a joke, a big, grand, long, beautiful joke. But, it does function on that documentary level (as opposed to, for instance, Sweet and Lowdown, which has lots of documentary-looking interviews, but is dominated by a dramatization... Zelig consists entirely of "archive" footage and interviews). The second level is the level of the comedy. This is not a documentary, but a so-called mockumentary, and it's loaded with humor. But unlike "This is Spinal Tap", it isn't merely the subject of the documentary that it funny... the format itself is subverted through the innovative and extremely effective device of giving the narrator jokes. The third level is as a commentary on conformity. If not for this third level, "Zelig" would be just another in a long line of good, funny, solidly enjoyable Woody Allen movies. But this comedy has a strong point to make, and its made incredibly well. Everyone has Zelig tendencies. Allen created a character who takes this need to be accepted to a ridiculous (and thus highly comic) extreme. What makes the film especially remarkable is that it can be viewed with either an optimistic or a pessimistic slant. Certainly, Dr. Fletcher manages to rehabilitate Leonard a great deal, and he manages to exist, for a time, as a fairly regular member of society. Of course, then he relapses and ends up a Nazi. But even at Leonard's peak, one can interpret his success a merely another chameleon effort to fit in. He was surrounded by people who wanted him to have his own opinions, and lauded him with celebrity status when he did. "Zelig" exposes the insidious, unintended effects of societal pressure and influence. There is no escape from this influence, of course, but it's important to remember that it's there. It also creates a moral distinction between the conformist and that to which he conforms. While Nazism can rightly be judged evil, the worst you can say about Zelig is that he is weak.</fullReview>

He had already parodied the documentary format once before, in "Take the Money and Run," but at that time he had not yet matured enough to do it in a realistic way, which always makes a parody funnier. Here he is in total control of the medium.People who think of Allen mainly as a writer, or who dismiss him as old-fashioned, should see this film to realize just how state-of-the-art his films are cinematically. When he wants to, he can be as impressive a technical wizard as the big-budget Hollywood honchos, albeit on a quieter scale. This visual splendor is evident in many of his films, but none more than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zelig is a fictitious biography of a man named Zelig. Zelig happens to be a human chameleon, able to take on the shape and personality of anyone who is in the room with him. The film is shot in such a way as to make it seem like an authentic documentary (with fictitious news footage, interviews, etc), which it of course isn't. It's filled with trademark Woody Allen humor, it's inventive, and it's entertaining. I thought it was an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty, amusing and technically impressive mockumentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a documentary about the story of one Leonard Zelig, a man who came to prominence in the 1920's when police found him living as a convincing Chinese man and, on arrest, his personality and appearance changed again. He became a medical phenomenon and everyone lined up to have their say. One doctor in particular, Eudora Fletcher, dedicates herself to "curing" his condition and finds that she becomes part of his fascinating life story.Zelig was a film that I heard about but had never gotten round to seeing for year and years. Recently I had been catching up on some of Allen's modern films and decided to make the effort to find and watch some of the older ones that had slipped past me. Bananas was one, Zelig was another. Bananas didn't impress me that much but I enjoyed this film a lot more simply because it seemed a lot more assured in what it was doing. Typically for Allen, the concept is based on personality order and issues over not fitting in but it is taken to the extreme in Zelig's case. This "fantastical" edge to the material doesn't produce as many big belly laughs as I expected but it is constantly witty and amusing, with lots of silly material made funnier by how straight it is delivered. The documentary style really suits the film and gives good lines to the narrator and also embedded into the archive footage.Indeed without the archive footage and the approach I think the film would be a lesser one because it is technically impressive throughout. I was taken by how Allen captured the period and blended his material so well with stock footage. OK there are one or two moments of being inserted into famous footage that don't work as well now that Gump has done that to death but it is sparingly done and not as tiresome as in that film. The grain of the film, the movement of the actors, the movement of the camera all come together to produce a really convincing look and feel ? which is only more convincing by including the modern day talking heads by contrast, the modern style making the other more dated. Within this the performances are impressive because they engage as well as technically convince. I enjoyed Allen's physical comedy and nervous energy as much as I liked Farrow. Horgan's dry delivery as narrator can also not be overlooked.Overall Zelig is not a hilarious comedy that gets easy laughs off inserting a character into historical footage like they did in Gump. Instead it creates its own history built around an amusing concept and, as a result delivers a witty and engaging little film that is not only fun but also technically is very accomplished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "Zelig", Woody Allen took a completely different approach to everything. It's a pseudo-documentary - maybe the first one ever - in which he plays Leonard Zelig, a human chameleon in the 1920s: he literally changes his personality and physical appearance to accommodate the people in his surroundings. Mia Farrow plays Dr. Eudora Fletcher, trying to cure him.This has some of the things that we would expect in a Woody Allen movie, namely Leonard's explanation of the kind of class that he teaches. But, he keeps it going. The "Reds"-style interviews really help the movie (there's even one with Susan Sontag), as does the '20s soundtrack. This is one movie that you're sure to like. Too bad that Allen started making movies about neurotic rich New Yorkers later on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of a deep psychological crisis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers possibly.*ZELIG is the story of a man with the ability to assume the social identity of those around him. In the film, Zelig is the child of a religious Jewish household, one whose values he rejects. Having done that, he has lost his psychological anchor and is a man without a personality, and so he "borrows" the group persona of whatever society he is in. Professor Neil Postman, in reference to the film, calls the character the ultimate "other-directed man," in contrast to a person being self-directed.As nature abhors a vacuum, so does Zelig's ego. This comedy has at its heart the frightening image of a man who not only lacks direction in life, but everything that makes-up what we call individuality. He is the very icon of the ultimate Yes-Man, ready and able to obliterate himself for the group.A great film-paradox: comedy blooming from tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Flawed Genius of Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen has long been considered a genius of cinema, and here again is another example of how he has always been ahead of his time. The story is about Leonard Zelig (Allen), who when in the company of academics or famous people can morph himself into them, regardless of race, colour or creed. Allen cleverly superimposes himself onto newsreel footage so that he appears on screen with such recognisable figures (for example, there is a scene where he is seated just behind Hitler at a Nazi rally). Yes, the intelligence of this kind of footage was explored to huge commercial success with films like Forrest Gump, but, as that film was released well over 10 years after this one, it again shows how Allen was trailblazing a path in cinema long before others. Most of the film is naturally therefore in black and white, and told in a documentary style, and there are numerous clever sequences that uphold Allen's reputation as a master film maker. For me, there is no doubt that the quality of the piece is visible pretty much from the first frame of film, but conversely, this for me is also the problem. You can't slate the film because it is obviously something very unique and well made, but I fidgeted, because I think the germ of the idea was not (in my humble opinion) strong enough to extend over a feature length movie. To be honest, the mood and feel of the picture got on my nerves, and that is my problem with it, but I cannot doubt the obvious work of genius that is going on underneath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Woody Allen's mockumentary "Zelig", a historical error creeps in during the new-shot footage of Leonard Zelig with his psychiatrist, Eudora Fletcher, when they visit with an aviatrix at an airport. In one shot they are walking towards the camera and a pair of fabric-covered wings are seen stacked against a wall in the background. The partial registration number visible on the surface of one wing is N15. If this were the 1930s as the footage purports, the civil registration would have begun NC15. The Bureau of Air Commerce, later the Civil Aeronautics Authority, and then the Civil Aeronautics Administration, would not drop the "C" portion of the United States national registration until 1948.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only briefly in the past had I heard about this Woody Allen movie,that being only the title and not knowing it was by Woody Allen.Once again,my local library comes through by attaining a copy of the movie on DVD. With no knowledge of the the story or plot,I watched it the other night.I did like the idea of a made up documentary about a "human chameleon" who can take the form of others around him as a deeply sub-conscious effort to fit in with others and be accepted. The inclusion of Woody in historical moments is amazing also,given this was accomplished 11 years before being done by Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump.The comedy on the other hand, some good funny moments and lines but after the first hour,I felt the movie kind of grinding to a halt. Now,that could just be me, for I know others here have given it higher marks. For me,the point had been made and once that was done,it had little left for me to be interested in.I know Allen can be ingenious in his comedy works,I have seen nearly all of his movies. This one just needed a few more touches of comedic writing and maybe even a little more manic-craziness related with the era Zelig lives in.So, 6 out of 10. It was good Wood but you've made better before. : END</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A homage to Peter Sellers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite among Woody Allen's movies. I also think it is his best. It has real depth, there is less incoherent babbling than normal. The message here is clear and really touching. The idea to make a pseudo documentary, with pseudo old record scores and all, was a great and resoundingly successful experiment. It shows the extent of Allen's genius. To set the story in the Roaring Twenties and early thirties seems to be a decision that is dead right. It really enhances the quality and the message of the movie.I wonder if the character of Leonard Zelig is motivated by the personality and the performances of Peter Sellers to whom Allen is somehow indebted. There is no doubt for me that Sellers must have influenced Allen as an actor quite profoundly. And it was Sellers who used his uncanny chameleonic talents that sometimes made him appear as a sort of a freak. Sellers died in 1980, Zelig came out in 1983. Pe-ter Sel-lers, Len-nard Ze-lig ... is this Allen's personal secret? Or am I mistaken?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt trapped in this film, and to me it was a misery to sit through. It's 80 minutes of the exact same gimmick repeated ad nauseum, a gimmick that the audience "gets" in the first 5 or 10 minutes, and then we are ready to move on to another joke. But no other joke is forthcoming -- it's just an endless, mind-numbing repetition of the exact same thing, a joke that wasn't that funny (to me) to begin with. If the fact that certain people are social chameleons is news to some people, then those people may, perhaps, enjoy this film. Otherwise, I'd admonish: Stay away.I personally advise skipping this film. In my opinion, it's a one-note film based on a joke that isn't funny even the first time you hear it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I need to point out that I generally don't like Woody Allen movies. This is not just due to his weird off-screen antics but the fact that over the years his movies just stopped being funny. Instead, introspection and artsy-fartsiness have replaced genuine humor. Take the Money and Run, Bananas, Sleeper and Play It Again Sam were good (though not great) films. However, starting in the late 1970s, he tried too hard to "say something" and forgot humor. Despite this, in the midst of his unfunny phase, he created a gem. In my opinion this is his best film and no others come even close. However, I will freely admit that this movie is not for everyone. To understand and appreciate Zelig, you really need to understand and care about our history. Since I am a history teacher and LOVE history, it was not hard to follow the historical references. I knew who nearly all the people were who were shown in the documentary films that were spliced into the film. But, for the average viewer, this could be a real sticking point. They may know who Hitler was, but haven't the foggiest notion who William Randolph Hearst, Marion Davies, Charlie Chaplin, Al Smith or any of the other people were who show up in the movie. To make matters even worse, the first time I saw this movie, someone I know said "gee--I never even knew this Leonard Zelig guy existed". In other words, despite the movie's preposterous elements, this dunderhead believed it was ALL true! This is an extreme case, but feel that in general this movie is "too smart" for the average viewer and as the years pass, this problem will become greater. This is a real shame because they also will not, in many cases, understand the context in which this movie was made. The amazing computer enhancements we come to expect today were not available in the early 80s when this film was made. Instead, painstaking blue screen shots were made and superimposed flawlessly into archival film and some scenes had to be created using modern actors who doubled for the real historical figures. The amazing detail and time needed make this a great film and an important one as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the 20's, Leonard Zelig (Woody Allen) becomes a popular sensation. He's an unassuming person who seems to fit into any situation. He is taken to a mental hospital where he's misdiagnosed. Dr. Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow) is more compelled by the new patient and diagnose him as a "human chameleon". She treats him as his fame grows. Then he disappears and resurfaces in Nazi pre-war Germany.I don't get it. It's definitely not funny to me. Woody Allen creates a faux documentary using the old fashion style. It's an intriguing idea but with no voice, Zelig is a mystery. He is not compelling. I can't get a handle on the character. This could be an intriguing drama but there is not a single laugh or even a single smirk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant magic trick, a successful experiment....but not much of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically, "Zelig" is brilliant. Others have explained how and why in lengthier terms. It's an ambitious experiment from Woody Allen, who seems to have gone through with it just to prove that he could do it....and he was right. However, it's also one of the last films that I would recommend to someone new to Woody Allen to start with - yes, I consider it more difficult to "get into" than "Interiors" or "Stardust Memories". The main problem is summed up by the movie itself, when the narrator (a magnificently deadpan Patrick Horgan) calls Zelig a "nonperson": it's hard to stay interested in a movie where the main character has actually no character (in fact, he barely even speaks) at all, at least in the first half. It's no coincidence that "Zelig"'s most enjoyable scenes are those where Woody slips back into his usual persona while Mia Farrow attempts to hypnotize and psychoanalyze him, and throws 2 or 3 (but no more than 5) hilarious lines (my favorite: "I teach a masturbation class, and if I'm late they start without me!"). Woody's point ("Be yourself") is a valid one, but you'll get it quickly, and then you'll mostly be left to admire the film's technical brilliance. One thing that does shine through is Allen's love for cinema itself. **1/2 out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, this film is defined by the printed paper and his metamorphosis. The bustle, the delicate ash, the music are principal words of Cervantes masterpiece definition. So, the film must be a success at least for impressive presence of Woody Allen.In fact, it is not a film but a huge monument, the Baroque interpretation of Woody Allen has the talent to create a fantastic world.The pathetism of opera is part of gorgeous sophisticated fine expression Only values for a verdict in this case are subjectives. A legend of Russian Opera is Zelig. Every feature of character is slice of a subtle science of chimera's revelation. Every gesture is a form to describe sweet secret of fragile world. And Zelig is Zelig.But, more important, it is statute of testimony. The trip between symbols and facts, between refuges and truth. "Zelig" is not a ordinary picturization, it is a propaganda instrument.The three versions, "Zelig: Man and Mask", the recordings , Zelig: Thaetrical Version, the shows in Europe and the fame are elements of a special artist portrait who gives to his character not only a special soul but a subtle vision about life and illusion.I believe that this movie was for Woody Allen an adventure. His art is same, his acting is interesting and correct. For he, the hero from New York is an alter-ego not ordinary character. So, the force of interpretation is charming, strong and pure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Defines "Unique" !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another great movie from the once-great Woody Allen. It's layered when it comes to the reasons of singularity.It's a story of one gifted human who doesn't work well with people. His abnormal power, which's also unmatched sickness (looking and acting like whoever he's around), comes from his only desire to fit in, and be loved. This is a delicate wonderful subject, as the problem of every special person, in a fantasy/superpower movie. The script is no less unique; since it follows the story seriously and comically in the same time without losing any merit of both.The thing about Allen is that he doesn't stop at handling the lead's power/problem as yet another Jew's calamity. He rises above it to make a more human concerned movie in which the main point is the talented' calamity, and that's exactly what makes Allen's work international before being long-lived as well.The way of making the whole matter as mockumentary, a very early one by the way too, gave the movie a distinct form and a realistic flavor. Furthermore selecting taking place during the 1920s served Allen's satire about America in such an age where people longed for any heroes, enabling him to mock freely at the period's everything (songs, movies, news reels, ..etc.). He succeeded also at saying all what he wants around the period, and his movie itself, through the opinions of his fake documentary's guests; this is a dream of every talkative worry artist comes true and so smartly; without alienating the viewers or causing a feeling of something extra.The quality of the image is ahead of its time. Now I know that (Forrest Gump) isn't the first one to mix new image in old ones. 11 years before it there was (Zelig), yet without the computer's magic. The way this movie resembles the old movie's looks is fascinating. I believed it in many times to be an old one itself. Not to mention how the moves of the characters, in the pseudo-news films, seem outrageously like what we watch in the oldies; recall how every man behind the one who talks in the microphone whispers, in unexplained sullen features, to the other with what we don't hear ! The romantic core of it is solid. It even has a crazy adventure as a big finish (Zelig flies over the Atlantic, beating the Nazis, rescuing his love, and returning home as a glorified hero). I loved how when the lead didn't find someone beside him he went to destroy the world (with Hitler). And the meaning that the drama propounds at last got me utterly : "you don't need the acceptance of the whole world, just the one of a woman loves you". Re-watch this movie again, then compare it with what Allen makes lately to know what the "once great" remark in the start is all about.(Zelig) defines the unique person, and the unique movie too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I definitely enjoyed watching this little movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zelig" is a fake documentary done by Woody Allen, which is set mostly in the '20's and '30's of the last century, about a man who is known as the human chameleon because he can transform himself psychically into every person that gets close to him. It's of course a real silly concept and it's also a quite quirky movie, though you can probably still believe this is something serious when you fall into it because it is done that well.Because the fake documentary is set for most part in the '20's and '30's it also uses camera's and techniques from those days. I was really impressed with how the movie looked and at times I was really confused about whether I was watching some original stock footage back from those days or some newly shot footage done by Woody Allen and crew. It's definitely great that they used some of the actual techniques available at the time and did not just used some editing tricks to make the movie look old. It's also really great that the cinematography for this movie got actually nominated for an Acadamy Award, as was its costume design, which also really seemed to fit the time period it was trying to re-create.They also did quite a great job with blending in the actors with some of the original stock-footage. We see Woody Allen for instance hanging around with Charlie Chaplin and even Adolf Hitler at one point. I remember it actually being a big thing back in 1994 when "Forrest Gump" came out and people being amazed by seeing Tom Hanks shaking hand with John F. Kennedy for instance but it just seems that those techniques were already available way back earlier.Even though the movie is of course a comedy it got made as a straight and serious one. It makes the subtle humor work out all the more great. The movie does not attempt too hard to make you laugh out loud and is instead more constantly funny through some of its ridicules moments and witty dialog. A great trick Allen also used was every now and then also putting in some 'modern' scenes with the elderly characters within this movie, reciting some of the events. It breaks the movie and I'm not sure if the movie would had been all that good to watch if it had entirely been done in '20's and '30's style, from start till finish.It's one of those unusual and somewhat more experimental movies of which I say it works out well but at the same time I'm thinking what is the point of it all. Yes, I was surely entertained and also somewhat impressed but at the end I did not feel as if I had just seen a great movie. It's somewhat of a perfect in-between movie to watch and you'll surely have a good time watching it and it luckily also isn't too long. It's definitely not a must-see and a movie you can easily do without ever seeing but nevertheless you will still have a good time when you catch it on somewhere.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody's Take on Conformity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole deal with conformity is that it's a balancing act in which you walk a tightrope. Too much of it and you fall off one side; too little and you fall off the other. Like water, conformity is a prerequisite to social life but it must be kept within bounds. A soothing shower, yes. A raging flood, no. Wait. I think I was just swept away by one too many analogies. "Zelig" is Woody Allen's illustration of what can happen when you have too much of a good thing. The time is the 1920s. His character, Zelig, has the capacity to not just blend in with, but physically resemble any group he associates with. We see glimpses of him as an Indian chief, a member of a Mariachi band, a Black Shirt supporting Hitler, that sort of thing. He also frisks around with William Randolph Hearst, Charlie Chaplin, and Jimmy Walker -- thanks to some highly skilled process work and editing.Finally he winds up in a psychiatric hospital under the care of Dr. Eudora Fletcher, played by Mia Farrow. (In the hospital, Zelig assumes the role of psychiatrist and begins writing books on "delusional paranoia" and giving lectures on masturbation.) Fletcher finally cures him and the two become a famous couple and finally marry. Zelig is now able to voice his own dissenting opinions. He even begins a physical fight with one physician who remarks that it's a nice day.Then Zelig begins to pay the price of a relatively normal man who achieves celebrity. Single mothers come out of the woodwork claiming that he's the father of their children. The public turns against him. His Hollywood career is in tatters. So he disappears.Fletcher tracks him down to Berlin and rescues his from the Nazi gang he's joined and they make a perilous escape by airplane. Fletcher is the pilot and Zelig has never flown before, but he assumes her aviatrix identity and when she loses consciousness he establishes a world's record for flying across the Atlantic upside down. They live happily ever after although, on his deathbed, Zelig expresses regret that he's been reading "Moby Dick" and now won't be able to see how it turns out.And so it goes, full of Woody Allen's adult-oriented jokes and sight gags in this meandering tale of a man who wanted to be like everybody else. I said his gags were adult oriented for a reason. The level of cultural literacy that we can take for granted seems to have undergone a cataclysmic collapse over the past few decades. I'm not sure how many youngsters will recognize an allusion to "Moby Dick." I mean, not the heavy metal band. I'm not even certain that they wouldn't have to really REACH for Adolf Hitler. Those who get it, who get the whole issue of the limits of conformity, will find it rewarding. And conformity really IS a perennial social question, if a little banal after its treatment by French intellectuals. Just yesterday I wore a toga picta to work at the bank and -- well, you'd be surprised.Oh, and the movie gives Woody a good chance to use his favorite 1920s tunes as a score.</fullReview>

In the company of blacks he becomes black, with greeks he becomes Greek etc. etc. Mia Farrow plays his Psychiatrist whom he falls in love with and so does she with him. Technically it is done so well with all the narration and live footage and with absolute dead pan that you actually believe that you are watching some documentary till of course you realize what exactly is being shown. The scene with Hitler is hilarious and really well done and makes you realize that Forest Gump was not the first movie to try this kind of thing.It is a great satire, it is absurd and it is dead pan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continues Woody's decade-plus streak of peerless comic gems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody is in genius form as the eponymous chameleon man who can adapt to any situation by morphing into the appropriate guise, a rare psychological trait born of a fear of not fitting in. I think what distances me somewhat from this very clever, very funny concept, is the sleek professionalism that drains the film of the uncomfortable intimacy that characterizes much of Allen's work. An odd criticism, but here it is: I guess you could say it's too complete, its imperfections paved over in seamless collage photography, sleight-of-hand, and an uproarious case history, which contains invaluable bits of absurdity, but distances us from the characters (let it be said that this is much the intent and effect of the storytelling artifice). Funniest of all is the way Leonard Zelig is able to integrate himself into some of the WWII era's watershed moments, and Woody's take on the irrational measures by which ordinary (or in this case, not so ordinary) people are selected for celebrity and vilification is consistently engaging. I feel like a complete churl for saying this, but I think Zelig may have been more effective if Allen had chopped 20 minutes off and aired it on The History Channel (or its 1983 equivalent), purportedly as a straight-laced doc. This may seem an unfair conflation of artistic and business strategies, but what is Zelig without its flabbergasting, utterly deadpan presentation as something that it isn't? This continues Woody's decade-plus streak of peerless comic gems that started for me with the incomparable Sleeper (1973).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Woody Allen movie from the 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fictional biography of Leonard Zelig, a man who can change his appearance to an equivalent of the people around him, is in many ways the best movie Allen directed (and acted) in during the 80s. Allen combines edited newsreel footage in which Zelig meets various famous politicians (it should be noted that Allen did this several years before the highly acclaimed Forrest Gump used the same technique), real interviews with actual authors and actors discussing the "fake" past of Zelig and an ever serious narrator which at times can make you forget that the Story of Leonard Zelig is fictional. Allen used cameras and lenses from the 20s to create an even more realistic atmosphere, it's not too hard to figure out that he had several movies from the 1920s in mind (probably even the 1925 classic Bronenosets Potyomkin or any Chaplin-directed movie) when he shot this movie and arranged the lighting. The acting is quite convincing, Allen offers probably his best acting since Annie Hall, Ferrow is solid as usual. Worth mentioning are also the hilarious One-Liners and excuses of Zelig. The only major relationship, between Zelig and his therapist (Ferrow) is probably not as deep as it could have been but all in all its a movie definitely worth watching (8 of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the strangest movie on Woody Allen's resume, a technically brilliant fake documentary about a human chameleon so insecure in his own skin that he mimics and becomes anyone he is exposed to. Including historical figures and sports legends. Leonard Zelig, the chameleon, becomes a national phenomenon, and it's up to a no-nonsense psychiatrist to cure him. Since the good doctor is played by Mia Farrow, and this was their second of several movies together, it's safe to say the relationship does not remain patient and doctor. The film is a piece of art--although, truth to be told, not one of his comedy classics. There are plenty of laughs, but the movie seems somewhat overburdened by its technical aspects. Woody did win back some of the critics he lost with his previous two films, both underrated (Stardust Memories and A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy), and Zelig's critical (if not commercial) success paved the way for his mid '80s classics with Farrow. But safe to say that this movie is for his die hard fans only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's "pseudo-documentary" about the chameleon life of Leonard Zelig.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zelig is a Woody Allen film with an original style. Set as documentary on the life of a Woody Allen creation, Leonard Zelig, Zelig opens with the premise that people have "just forgotten" about one of the most influential person of the 1920's. Allen, probably realizing that a joke can only be taken so far, elects for a shorter than usual running time (79 minutes) and still is able to convey the joke: Zelig (played by Woody Allen) is a human chameleon who underlies a greater sociological problem in this world: the necessity people feel to "adapt to their surroundings" in order to feel safe. Dr. Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow)is the psychiatrist willing to help Zelig return to one personality. Zelig's life is not peachy, and in fact later he has to overcome adversity as he regresses in his treatment. However, this and other loopholes in plot are masterfully explained by documentary-type interviews with such people as Saul Bellow and Susan Suntag. Zelig is an excellent film that is enjoyable to watch both for its idea, its subtle comedy (it would harldy be Woody Allen any other way) and its technical aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm starting to think that I've underrated Woody Allen. Sure, he can make some half-hearted stinkers but his good stuff is the best of the best. It's remarkable how he can take this simple surreal idea and have it blossom into a unique experience with a mockumentary style. Not only is it profound and heartfelt, but also hilarious every time Zelig's chameleon-like condition effects him. From the plot line, I thought it was some kind of gimmick, but the fact that it's involuntary and Zelig is played as such a blank and naive slate makes him brilliant and sometimes quite relatable. It touches on one of the greatest social dilemmas of the human condition. Blend in at the expense of personal identity or be opinionated and ostracised? This idea hits the gut. Hard.The cause-and-effect of Zelig's condition is highlighted by its broad stroke documentary style where information is given by a narrator or talking head interviews. Consequences are shown immediately and allows the film in its 70 minutes runtime to explore a vast amount of detail, especially in studying celebrity culture and how icons are embraced then ignored. We only get snippets of Zelig himself which are often Allen delivering sharp punchlines but it's Mia Farrow's involvement that gives it a heart. I usually don't feel too engaged by Allen's romances but this one I really wanted to see them get together. With its technical prowess in its innovation matching its profound ideas and creativity, this is one well-rounded picture and one of Allen's best works.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine watching a badly made, dated documentary about a historical figure with no personality. Now imagine that this documentary isn't even real - the people and events you're seeing are all made-up. This begs the question: why? Oh, it's meant to be funny. However, Zelig is very immature and stupid and works far better as a depressing waste of time than as a comedy. It is full of predictable set-ups and cheap jokes.Woody Allen is a terrible actor. He is always the same in everything he does. He isn't naturally funny. Perhaps he's talented as a director or writer, but not as a performer. Nevertheless, Zelig confidently invests almost all of its focus into Woody's character with little else going on. There is no social commentary, no relevance to real world events, no deeper message. Just an indulgent mess of missed jokes.This movie starts slow and then slows down. It's one-dimensional. It uses a familiar format - a 1930s newsreel documentary thing about a mysterious man named Zelig. They interview boring old people. And they even show names for these people. Do they have funny names? Of course not. Why even bother to show their made-up names? This is torture. Every documentary ever made is worth more than this excruciatingly abysmal "movie". At least you might learn something or get a look inside another world.Zelig is a completely pointless exercise. It's an excuse for Woody Allen to dress up as different stereotypes and stare blankly, emptily at the camera. They took the time to record a bunch of fake 20s songs about a "chameleon" craze. We're shown a bunch of random stock footage from the 20s. I'm more interested in those parts. At least they're real people with real lives. At one point Zelig is under a trance and tells a joke about a Rabbi. It takes ages to set up, has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and is probably much funnier if you're familiar with Jewish stereotypes. Facepalm.I'm reminded of the huge personal disappointment that was Duck Soup. I don't find dark films or music or books "depressing". I find the likes of Duck Soup and Zelig depressing. They make me not want to watch movies. I feel empty, confused and frustrated because of them. Confounded at what on Earth the people making them were thinking. Did they actually think this would be funny or entertaining?Let me write about some good movies to heal myself a bit.Dr. Strangelove had ridiculous characters but they were played with sincerity and energy. It was a brilliant satire with great acting and lots of irony (and it's just funny). The Great Dictator openly mocked Adolf Hitler when he was at the height of his power, had beautiful physical comedy, made fun of politics in insightful ways and had an incredibly powerful speech at the end. This Is Spinal Tap made people believe in a fictional band, was full of hilarious ad- libbing, had perfect timing and was a satire of rock bands with many easy-to-miss references.Zelig is not even a decent attempt at a film that simply went awry. It's pretentious, self-absorbed, lazy film-making. A random sequence of average YouTube videos would have more laughs and more cohesion that this abomination. Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen's "Zelig" appears to be a wispy-thin string of sketches about a chameleon man who can radically alter his appearance to fit into any given situation, and theatergoers in 1983 may have found the release an Allen-underachiever. It has no higher aspirations than getting quick, momentary laughs from its flaky visual jokes, and a leading character who isn't meant to be memorable or even personally intriguing. The film is pure film-making style, a triumph of creating a whole feature from technique, although Allen's satirical side is as sharp as ever. Mia Farrow has a negligible role as Zelig's psychiatrist (she amusingly--perhaps intentionally--resembles Liv Ullmann, magically transferred from "Autumn Sonata"), while Woody, in the lead, has great fun with fads, fashions and nostalgia. The humor here isn't cutting-edge, although the effects are remarkable. "Zelig" is so slyly silly it may pass right under your radar, but it has some very amusing bits and pieces. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really strange mock documentray that takes place in America in the 1920s--a man, Leonard Zelig (Woody Allen) is a human chameleon--he takes on the physical characteristics of any man he is with. He's regarded as a freak but a caring doctor named Eudora (Mia Farrow) tries to cure him.This came out in 1983 and was a huge hit. With it's truly incredible trick photography (inserting Allen and Farrow in actual newsreel footage of the 20s) it was fascinating to watch--and still is. But critics overpraised it ridiculously. It's a very good little comedy but no masterpiece. Some critics were comparing it to "Citizen Kane"! As it is it's good but not totally satisfying--there's just not enough material for a full-length film. Even at its short running time--79 minutes--it feels too long. At about the 50 minute mark it should have ended. When it was over I was still "hungry" for another movie.So, it's worth seeing for its photography and a few hilarious moments, but it's not enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen's "Zelig" is a documentary about a man so desperately insecure he adopts the physical attributes of whomever he's around. Much has been made of the psychological "statement" the film makes, and many critics have compared the premise to the immigrant's struggle to assimilate to American culture, particularly the Jew's, but let's not get too presumptuous yet."Zelig" is less than it seems, and I mean that in a good way, because Woody has such a joyful time exploring the mockumentary format that Zelig the man winds up as only one of a thousand cultural phenomenons, no more or less significant than flagpole-sitters or the fat guy who takes the cannonball to the stomach. The triumph of this film is its technicality: Woody clearly worked hard to insert Zelig into old newsreels of the 20's and to age every frame and soundtrack to convince the audience we are actually watching a remnant from another era. It works seamlessly.What doesn't always work is Zelig's character, or lack thereof. It's difficult to feel for a man with no identity, and the extended therapy sequences are just as often flat as they are engaging. It's difficult to believe Woody ever truly understood Zelig the man; the scene in which he "wakes up" from being a Nazi while Hitler gives an impassioned speech only five feet away is both brilliant and anti-climactic. The lights are on but nobody's home.If you come to "Zelig" expecting the brilliance of Woody's golden era you will be disappointed. If you approach it as nothing more than an interesting detour you will be pleasantly surprised. As the man-on-the-street declares in my favorite line from the film: "LEONARD ZELIG IS THE FINEST American IN HISTORY!!!" Something like that.GRADE: B- (NOTE: If you like this movie check out "The Kids In The Hall" Cyril St. John Escapist short!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, one-joke pastiche with some genuine elements of technical innovation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enjoyable little romp from Allen, though one that might be appreciated on a more technical level, as opposed to the more conventional, cinematic likes of Annie Hall (1977), Manhattan (1979) and Hannah and her Sisters (1986), etc. It's essentially a one-joke film, creating a mock documentary around the fictitious character of Leonard Zelig, a man so stunned by life and desperate to go unnoticed that he develops a strange psychological condition that allows him to mimic in both tone and appearance the look and demeanour of anyone in his presence. As ever with Allen's work, particularly of this period, the film is played for laughs, with the silly concept eventually giving way to elements of sly satire, wicked one-liners and a great deal of comical absurdities, as we follow the life of this extraordinary character and his relationship with the radical female psychiatrist that tried to save him.It's not one of my favourite of Allen's films - feeling at times a little too strained or limited in scope - but it is, regardless, an impressive one, filled with wit, imagination, character and of course, a genuine sense of technical invention. The way that Allen seamlessly blends himself into the ancient, black and white stock-footage featuring a variety of iconic names and faces is still incredibly impressive twenty-five years after it was first released, with the hard work of cinematographer Gordon Willis, editor Susan E. Morse, production designer Mel Bourne and costume designer Santo Loquasto all going towards the evocation of an impeccably convincing period setting alive with atmosphere and integrity. If it wasn't for the recognisable appearance of Allen and his then leading lady Mia Farrow in the role of Dr. Eudora Fletcher, then it would have been fairly easy to stumble across this film and, without knowing anything about it, take it as a genuine life-style biographical documentary on a forgotten social/historical phenomenon.The general look and feel of the film is incredibly effective throughout, especially when combined with the talking-head interview sequences with people like Susan Sontag, Bruno Bettelheim, Saul Bellow and John Morton Blum, all adding a sense of context to Allen's absurd, manufactured imagery. Once again, it confirms Allen's place as possibly the greatest living American filmmaker, and of course, continues his firm grasp of the mock-documentary format; something that he had already mastered with his first film, the great Take the Money and Run (1969) and would return to some years later with the underrated Sweet and Lowdown (1999). As a whole, Zelig (1983) is not as immediately satisfying as some of Allen's more cohesive films, such as Stardust Memories (1980) and Broadway Danny Rose (1984) produced around the same era, though it does remain, nonetheless, an impressive film that is definitely worth experiencing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's Mockumentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After scoring big with "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan," Woody Allen had a bit of a dry run in the early 1980s with the forgettable "Stardust Memories" and "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy." "Zelig" found him back on track, and feels like a return to the screwball hijinks of his early 1970s films.Allen films "Zelig" as a documentary, and takes as his subject the life of a man who is able to blend in with his surroundings. Allen himself plays Zelig, and keeps everything -- both his performance and the film's tone -- utterly deadpan. There are a ton of funny one-liners and sight gags, but they're played completely straight."Zelig" isn't one of Allen's most ambitious films, but it's very funny and is many times better than most of the movies he's making today.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a highly enjoyable film. Perhaps not quite (but nearly) a great film, because I don't think that the underlying psychoanalytical story quite works, but it is a hoot nonetheless. It is in the mocumentary style of "Citizen Kane" and "F for Fake" and is propelled by some very deft editing - almost a decade before "Forrest Gump".In actual fact the idea of an insecure man who via some biological glitch turns into a close reproduction of his (male) interlocutors, is brilliant. The problem is that it is wonderful idea concerning the craving for normalcy in an age of fads and silly dance steps, and of superficial engagement in a mass culture, that needs a film of its own. Whereas in this case it is simply overwhelmed by the hilarious footage. Mia Farrow's part is therefore very nearly wasted, and the counselling sessions that take place at her home - though they are witty and engaging in their own right - struggle to compete with Woody Allen (Leonard Zelig) standing alongside Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, or William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies, or swinging a bat next to Babe Ruth, or (best of all) Fanny Brice on a Manhattan rooftop singing "Say Mister Zelig stand by,/ 'Cause I've got a feeling I'm falling,/ Falling for nobody else but you!" with 'Zelig' substituted for 'Parson' (from the 1929 song by Billy Rose, Fats Waller and Harry Link).The pastiche songs by Dick Hyman (especially the chameleon song) are a particular pleasure. Even a deliberately crass and corny number in the up-tempo style of the 1920s is a delight when compared with the aural ordure that passes for contemporary popular music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a technically brilliant spoof documentary. It starts in the 1920s using grainy silent film and stills, goes through the sound era and ends in colour in the 1980s. It makes clever use of library footage and newsreels so that what you see on the screen is always plausibly what could have been shot at the time. For example, when Dr Fletcher goes to a nightclub it is illustrated by stock footage of a 1920's nightclub plus stills of Dr Fletcher that a nightclub photographer might have taken. The scenes of Zelig's treatment are explained by Dr Fletcher's being an early exponent of the use of film to record a case history. Some of the newsreel is completely faked and some is doctored so that, for example Zelig appears to be at a Hitler rally or appears to be sung to by Fanny Brice. There are also excerpts from a fake 1935 Hollywood biopic based on Zelig's life. All this is intercut with a modern commentary in colour featuring an elderly Dr Fletcher and real personalities such as Saul Bellow and Susan Sontag.The pastiche musical numbers such as Do the Chameleon, Chameleon Days and Leonard the Lizard, were a joyThat said, the film is not very funny. I sat there thinking: ?Wow, this is brilliant' but with only a half-smile on my face. Even at 75 minutes I found it a bit too long and repetitive like an idea for a short story that has been stretched too far.</fullReview>

I enjoy this type of "fantasy" movie (like Purple Rose of Cairo, but I didn't like the documentary style in which it was brought to us in.Mia Farrow plays a psychiatrist who tries to "wean" Leonard off of his changing ways by giving him more self-confidence. He changes because he wants to fit in with everybody else.I didn't find it too funny, but there were a couple scenes (like the pair of Siamese twins, for example), that cracked me up. I liked how Allen took old news reels and transfixed himself in it (I love the Hitler scene). It would be used almost 20 years later in Kung Pow!.I believed Farrow's and Allen's romance, because he didn't seem to be double her age. As I've said before, the documentary style is nice, but I didn't like it. If it had played in "real movie format", it would have been better.Also, the movie laster about 80 minutes, yet it still seemed too long. The droll of the narrator, and the "historians", droned on and on. The plot I liked a lot, but if they didn't do it in a documentary style, it would have been nicer.Don't get me wrong, I liked this film a lot. There just weren't too many laughs.

		<fullReview>Review: What was Woody Allen on when he was making this film? I must admit, it's shot extremely well and he really looks like he's in some of the old footage, but the storyline is completely bonkers. It's about a human chameleon who seeks treatment for his weird condition. I really wondered what was going on while I was watching the film because it looked so real. The added commentary and interviews also made it seem really realistic but the storyline does go from one extreme to another. Watching Allen's character change into a Jew and a black person was cleverly done for a movie that was made in the 80's, but I was wondering what was Allen trying to attempt. It's shot like a documentary so there isn't much comedy but the concept is original but weird. I did stick with the movie because of the crazy storyline, but I don't know if I liked it or just thought that it was mad. Watchable!Round-Up: Personally I think that this movie would have been much better if he had some top class actors in it. The scene were Zelig was sitting behind Hitler trying to get his wife's attention was impressive and Allen played his character well. When all of his wife's started to pop out of the woodwork, the moral of the story comes into play but it's still a crazy movie. It's worth a watch just to witness Zelig change into different people and to see how he cleverly put the movie together. It does seem like your watching the History channel because of the old footage, but when you see Allen's face pop up in some of the shots, you realise that it's his warped sense of humour that created such a off the wall movie.Budget: N/A Domestic Gross: $12millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about human chameleon, trying to to be cured of his condition. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zelig: Not Just About Jews Who Don't Fit In, No Matter How Hard They Try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ned Flanders, the Simpson's next door neighbour, said he liked Woody Allen films, but was not quite sure about the nervous little guy with the glasses who always appeared in them. Neither am I.There were only four I have ever really warmed to. "Play It Again, Sam".(The personal Bogart mentor is fun but the slapstick becomes tedious) "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex" (It is still funny and insightful) "Radio Days" (a rare delight - but the little guy with glasses is an offscreen narrator) "Broadway Danny Rose" (an examination of the idea of "grace", forgiveness, turning the other cheek as an alternative to revenge)"Crimes and Misdemeanours" - The suggestion that you tend to forget about guilt if you live with it long enough and make enough money to buy respectability is interesting. But is the film just a technicolor morality tale.In "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan", the little guy with glasses reveals himself as a self deluded, self obsessed brat.And then there was "Zelig". It runs out of steam about half way through and has to be resuscitated by a rescue mission resulting in a new world record for flying a plane upside down across the Atlantic.It seems to depict the age old plight of Jews, who were kicked out of Israel by the Romans and have endeavoured to become citizens of North Africa, then Spain, then mid Europe then Russia. The more ambitious and successful tried to assimilate with the people they lived amongst, (take on the identity of such people) only to be violently rejected in the end. However there is a universality to "Zelig". "Man is born free but all around us we see him in chains". If you try to make yourself identical to everyone else to 'fit in', you will never know who or what you really are. You will ultimately miss out on the wisdom gained through atonement - the means to 'Know Thyself". That may well apply to the timid Germans of the 1930's, the conformist faces in the crowds in those old newsreels. But it's not just about1930's Germans.You can see it acted out in Luis Bunuel's, "Exterminating Angel". The high society supper party guests slowly realise that they can not escape from the room in which they have gathered. Their increasingly desperate plight is finally brought to a head when one of them suggests they go back to doing what they were doing before it dawned upon them that they were trapped. The solution works. They find a way to exit the room. To celebrate their deliverance, they all attend a grand cathedral church service. And at the conclusion of the film, they realise they are trapped in the cathedral.So how do you escape the invisible chains that trap people in a society that is very imperfect? Ask the Greek philosophers.The beginning and end of all wisdom is to "Know Thyself" By beauty it is that we come at WisdomIn Keats' words,"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,?that is all &nbsp;Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."But what is the route that leads to that beauty that is wisdom, that is self knowledge?Woody Allen might well have gained some insight into that question had he spent more time becoming acquainted with the Hebrew scriptures than he did in "Crimes and Misdemeanours". Moses' Law and the Prophets have a great deal to say about the journey that leads to wisdom and beauty. Take the feasts prescribed in Moses' Law.Moses' Law ties the Exodus from Egyptian slavery story to a fortnight in early spring in which Passover, Unleavened Bread and First Fruits feasts are observed. They celebrate redemption. Of course only two of the people who were redeemed on that first passover made it to the promised land. The rest did not even make it into God's rest (Psalm 95), whatever that means.A fortnight at the end of summer contains the new year, atonement and tabernacles feasts. They commemorate the forty years of wilderness wandering (atonement) that allowed them to see and know God's ways(wisdom) . Passover is about redemption. The child at the loving mother's breast is protected from harm, nourished and kept warm. It would die without that redemptive care. Think of redemption as beauty, love, mercy, forgiveness, grace. Think of the closing scene of "Broadway Danny Rose"Atonement is about law, truth, consequences of actions. The child who has been weaned and goes out into the world soon discovers the truth that it is not at all like suckling at mommy's bosom. Wisdom is truth. The truth that is discovered about oneself by life experiences in the hard, cold world. They either make you, or break you. You get to decide by the way you react to the calamities of nature and actions of other people. Think of wisdom as truth. It is symbolised as a virtuous wife in the book of Proverbs. It is expressed as the knowledge of God that comes from riding out grief, pain and loss, in the book of Job. Apotheosis.The man who had his ex- lover murdered in "Crimes and Misdemeanours" failed to gain that wisdom.Beauty is truth, truth beauty Redemption is beauty. The Wisdom discovered by atonement is truth.If you want a new definition of the construct referred to as "God", recast that idea as what happens at some abstract point at which Redemption intersects with Atonement - at which grace and beauty intersect with truth. Using that definition, knowing God is to know redemption and atonement - beauty and truth - true wisdom.There's an idea for some new movies, Woody. Some really worthwhile movies, with or without the little guy who wears glasses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One joke comedy - but at least a good joke.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mock (old school) black and white documentary about a man (Zelig) that can adapt his appearance and manners according to his location.Another one of these "two in morning" movies, that only Allen actually gets made. This is the kind of stuff that works best on the small screen and preferably very late at night. Sadly it has nothing to do apart from repeat its one joke over and over again, until you are sick to death of it.(Not that some parts are not funny - the Nazi rally scene is a hoot.)Good support from Mia Farrow as the psychiatrist that Allen falls in love with, but this plays like an amusing Saturday Night Live sketch dragged out to cover a whole movie. It should also be noted that the technique also allows for shoddy production values that probably helped make the thing a tad cheaper too.Not a total stinker - but hardly worth paying money for.</fullReview>
