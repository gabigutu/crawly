		<shortDescription>"The Other Guys" Soars, &amp; Will Ferrell Is Finally Funny Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam McKay is not a household name yet, but movie buffs like me know that when he teams up with Will Ferrell, magic happens. The former "Saturday Night Live" writer directed Ferrell in "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" (2004), "Talladega Nights" (2006), and even the popular viral video "The Landlord" (2007). Movies with Ferrell that have not involved McKay have tried to duplicate the success of "Anchorman", but have failed ( i.e. "Semi-Pro" (2008), "Land of the Lost" (2009)).As director and co-writer of "The Other Guys", McKay brings the best out of Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, and the rest of the cast. It combines action and comedy better than any similar comedy I have seen in a long time."The Other Guys" refers to, of course, the detectives who rarely get a piece of the archetypal cops-and-robbers shenanigans that are frequently seen in action movies or on "Law &amp; Order". They remain mainly at their desks doing paperwork, something almost never seen in movies. Ferrell is Allen Gamble, who is somewhat content with managing case work on his computer, and Wahlberg is the far more forceful and ambitious Terry Hoitz.Their characters are in sharp contrast to the cops that Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson portray in this film (and definitely in other films). Although Jackson and Johnson were also funny here, I hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie. It would have been more exciting if the audience didn't expect them when they stepped into the theaters. Then again, that is the fault of whomever marketed this film, not the filmmakers themselves.When Allen and Terry start working on a case they have a lead in, one they get to before other senior detectives do, a really interesting detective story progresses that would not feel out of place in dramas like "The French Connection" (1971) or similar action/detective movies to that nature.''When you do a comedy, it does no good to reference comedies,'' writer and director Adam McKay told Entertainment Weekly, ''You want to treat it like a drama 80% of the way. Then, at the last 20%, you f**k it up".The last 20% made this movie work, naturally. More than that, though, Ferrell didn't get all the funny lines, which is the mistake that many buddy cop movies such as the recent "Cop Out" (2010) make. Wahlberg is as intense as he usually is in most movies, but he has laugh- out-loud hilarious lines that he plays effectively with a straight face. His line about being a peacock may make AFI's Most Memorable Movie Quote list in the next few years, and the hot water his character got into in an incident involving Derek Jeter (making a cameo as himself) made the audience at my screening cheer. Of course, I saw the movie in Boston, but I'm just saying.However, the 20% of the movie that was funny was further enhanced by the story. Again, many buddy cop movies of recent years that have tried to be "48 Hours" make the mistake of introducing the villain early on, similar to a superhero comic book. This movie has you try to solve the mystery along with Ferrell and Wahlberg, and there are some decent twists and turns that really make you wonder who the culprit is.I will say that the mystery was a bit confusing, especially since it involves a Rupert- Murdoch-meets-Donald-Trump tycoon (Steve Coogan) and some financial plot. As a critic, I could pretend to accurately interpret everything that I see on screen. However, I'm not a Wall Street expert, and numbers involved in trading, stocks &amp; bonds, and all the rest confuse me. Nonetheless, even if you watch this movie not knowing who's wrong or right and why, you will still love the ride.The closing credits featured cleverly-animated financial facts pertaining to the recent financial meltdown, which appeared to be meticulously researched but still out of place. Their presence reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's anti-Nazi plea for humanity at the end of "The Great Dictator" (1941). His speech didn't fit the slapstick comedy of the first 90% of the movie, but looking back, it was still necessary to hear. I feel as though this montage of facts may have the same effect.Overall, though, "The Other Guys" is not just another movie. Some gags seemed a bit out of place, and the tired plot point of the police chief pulling the main cops off the case still seeped its way into the story. However, it helped that that chief was Michael Keaton in what could be a comeback performance, and that he had some hysterical lines as well. The movie tells a great story, everyone in the movie is funny without appearing to try too hard (especially in Ferrell's case), and the ensemble cast works together perfectly. In a year of mediocre (non-animated) comedies, "The Other Guys" lives up to its hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wahlberg and Ferrell Deliver Hilariously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the advanced screening tonight in New York City and it was hilarious. The dry humor was tremendous and the chemistry between Marky Mark and Will Ferrell is unmatched. They were so funny together it was great. The story of the movie is pretty predictable but there legit is non stop laughter through the entire film. The only draw back was the length of the movie, they could have trimmed it a bit but overall it's a solid summer comedy. Dare I say this was Will Ferrell's best performance since Anchorman. It's certainly one of those movies you will be quoting with your friends for a long time. The entire theater was laughing throughout the entire thing..Great movie...go check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell is BACK! Mark Wahlberg is perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you think, "If you've seen one Will Ferrell movie, you've seen them all," think again. Ferrell is back and totally redeems himself from the flop that was Land of the Lost by giving one of his most genius performances to date. It does help that Ferrell is partnered with hottie Mark Wahlberg who delivers a superbly-angst-ridden-yet-hilariously-gut-ripping performance. The movie is filled with fresh, sarcastic, and humorous one-liners, non-stop laughter, plenty of action, car chases, and explosions, and a complex plot with a thought-provoking political message. Just make sure you stay through the credits.I cant't remember the last time I laughed out this loud and this often in a movie theater. One early particular scene in the movie in which Ferrell and Wahlberg argue over whether a lion or a tuna would win in a fight is so well acted and delivered that I was left gasping for air after laughing so hard. And don't be too sure you know who would win such fight, because their logic doesn't go the way any of us could have imagined.I watched this movie right after I saw the painfully boring Dinner for Schmucks. But that can't be the only reason I loved this movie because the whole theater was laughing and clapping along with me, so much so, that I missed half the jokes due to the sheer volume of both. I don't know what else to say about this movie other than "Go see it--it's by far the best comedy of the summer." Parisa Michelle, www.CelebMagnet.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you expect from Ferrell, except with much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you think you've seen one Will Ferrell movie, you've seen them all, think again. Try this on for size: Usual Ferrell comedy plus crazy action plus subtle political and economical commentary plus excellent soundtrack. The Other Guys is a surprisingly hilarious and surprisingly action-packed movie that will keep you entertained throughout without actually dumbing you down. Unlike most Will Ferrell movies, you don't have to shut off your brain in this one; you actually have to pay attention because aside from the comedy, there is a complex crime to solve. Adam McKay delivers his best writing and directing performance, while the excellent cast ranging from Ferrell to Wahlberg to Keaton provides plenty of laughs, plenty of one-liners, and plenty of entertaining moments that propel this movie past the slowest of scenes.The Other Guys is about two mismatched behind-the-scenes paper-pushers (Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg) quietly investigating a series of suspicious events stemming from a unique bank robbery. Along the way they try to defeat their personal demons and try to figure out how to get along with each other. Unlike most Ferrell movies, in which it's a simple concept and improv provides the filler material, this movie actually has a mildly complex and heavy script, but still gives the cast a chance for a little improvisation. Written by the director and also Chris Henchy, I'll even go as far as to say that this among the best comedic scripts since last year's The Hangover. To add to that, McKay and Henchy pull a neat trick by slowly feeding you some commentary about big business and its mannerisms. The last mainstream comedy to attempt this was the mildly underrated Fun with Dick and Jane remake with Jim Carrey.While this movie does not have the extensive magical gathering of comedians like Anchorman (then again, what movie does?), the cast still does an excellent job bringing the comedy from the script to the screen. Will Ferrell is a little more toned-down this time, but still has his usual moments (screaming like a girl, random quotes, random singing, quirky one-liners). Mark Wahlberg however, steals the show with his angry lines, his bitter delivery, and his outbursts. The only thing hindering Wahlberg is the PG-13 rating; who knows what more classic lines he could have pulled off if he was allowed to go uncut (Remember him in The Departed?). Smaller roles fill the bill in the laughs department, including Eva Mendez (beautiful as always), Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, and the cameos.Even though Farrell has been hit-and-miss with the public and the critics, his best work always has been with Adam McKay. Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers were their previous collaborations and those three clearly top anything else Farrell has pulled off. The Other Guys in terms of directing and pacing dethrones them all. McKay does more than just handle the camera and let the actors mouth off; he stages some great action sequences and does a fantastic job directing a slow-motion bar sequence that displays the coolest slo-mo effects since Zombieland. The first half was so overloaded with funny scenarios, the audience very often was laughing so hard they missed the next couple of jokes while trying to recover from the last two. One scene in particular had the audience nearly drown out the sound of the audio coming from the movie.The first half was absolutely spectacular and downright comical; the second half never had a chance to duplicate the magic of the first hour. This is where Adam Mckay's biggest issues have been: in the final third of the flicks. All of McKay's movies lose steam and slow down towards the end, preventing them from becoming eternal comedic classics. In the case of The Other Guys, he improved a bit by still providing some of the laughs, even though you will still feel the momentum slowly die down. The cop clichés, while not taken seriously, still mildly hindered the moments leading up to the climax. There were some unnecessary scenes; a little bit of editing could have really helped this movie. But, unlike the other movies, the third act stays afloat thanks to the Wahlberg/Ferrell mix, as well as the continuing mystery that was slowly unfolding. Then stay tuned for the credits, when the commentary rushes at you full-force.Bottom Line: Honestly, I never thought that Will Ferrell would be involved with Mark Wahlberg, a creative script, hidden commentary (that unveils itself when you least expect it), and a soundtrack consisting of Rage against the Machine. Nonetheless, the combination worked like a great mixed drink that has you asking for seconds and thirds. The one-liners are flying all over the place, and so are the bullets. The Other Guys is the funniest movie of the year so far, and clearly the best surprise we've had this summer. Adam McKay continues to claim the throne as the best comedic director in the business, and this movie is more evidence. All McKay needs to do is cut back on the overall running time. This is the first Will Ferrell movie that you must pay close attention to (in terms of visual humor and crime-solving), and is overall one of his best movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wahlberg - The angry cop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first off I will say that the story was just OK. But that usually happens in comedies. So you have to rely more on the film trying to make the viewer laugh. If you are a fan of Will Ferrell's comedy and Mark Wahlberg, then you will pretty much laugh throughout the film. Ferrell really gets to act like himself in this film. I mean he is playing a character, but he gets to use his typical humor. Wahlberg plays a really angry cop and some of the things that come out of his mouth will really get you laughing. I actually laughed more at Wahlberg than Ferrell. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are in the film a bit as the head cops; like a newer Starsky and Hutch. They were entertaining. Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's wife and she is actually entertaining. Then the chief of the police station is played by Michael Keaton. Throughout the movie he kept quoting from the group TLC. He was actually also pretty funny. You will find yourself laughing a lot throughout the film. But there are some parts where they do try to be serious and most of the time it can be a turn off in a good comedy. There are some great one liners and scenes that will stick in your mind. So a pretty good comedy and I will end by saying, I want to see Mark Mahlberg do more comedic roles, because he is pretty good in them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another underrated movie given only a 6.6 when a minimum should be an 8. This movie will have you laughing throughout the entire movie. I've watched this movie 3 times already and definitely bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. Will Farrel is a genius at finding some way to make everyone laugh as usual and Mark Walburge is just the touch needed to make the dysfunctional team even funnier. I love Sam and Dwayne's(the rock) part in the movie all though I thought they should have gotten a bigger role. Overall a great movie and no complaints by me at all. The casting was perfect also. I hope there's a second movie after this or something similar to this because I haven't laughed this much in a long time. Great comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film with my 60-year-old mom and my teenage son and we all cracked up throughout the film--sometimes at different things and to different degrees. That's touching a true cross-section!! Although the latter 1/3 of the movie isn't quite as funny as the first 2/3, it still brought the laughs. I can't imagine why anyone who enjoyed Will Ferrell in Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers would give this movie anything below 7 stars. Maybe the reviewer who said that everyone didn't get the comic references was on to something...although I can't imagine why people wouldn't. There are humorous references about modern technology, sports, pimpin', geriatrics, !! Who can't find something in one of those to laugh at?!? lol I say DEFINITELY check it out for yourself! I needed a good laugh and I got one...even some true tears of laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny start but fades fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is funny to start and rolls along nicely but quickly loses all steam and finishes quite weak. Having every single character be an off center borderline nutjob loses something without any straight men to set them up or play off of. Mark Wahlberg played the straight man part well for the first half of the movie but turns as loony as everyone else before it's over. A few laugh out loud moments save the entire experience but it really could've and should've been a better film in general and certainly funnier across the board.Not nearly as bad as Step Brothers but not half as good as Anchorman. Probably Semi-Pro and Jackie Moon levels here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action spoof that hits most of its targets (if not all). Ferrell and Wahlberg are hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell is back since the disappointing "Land of the Lost"! Who knew Mark Wahlberg could be genuinely hilarious? "The Other Guys" is the latest comedy to poke fun at the buddy cop genre, but this one is one of the best because the actors and director knew what they were doing.Ferrell and Wahlberg have terrific chemistry and both of them have perfect comedic timing. But let's not forget the other supporting actors (too many to list here), as all of them have some memorable and quotable lines.The jokes weave through slapstick and crude territory, while not being overly vulgar and overdone. The story is actually pretty engaging, as it is a genuine cop mystery at its core, but it is used as a vehicle for all the jokes to come in. And the jokes kept coming and had the entire audience laughing as well, this one the loudest compared to the previous Steve Carell entries "Date Night" and "Dinner For Schmucks". Sorry Steve, this year Will and Mark stole the audience.Having said that, the production design, cinematography, editing, stunts/special effects are good, and the direction by Adam McKay is lighthearted and brisk. McKay is seriously becoming a big name in comedy film directors, and here is another memorable feather in his cap.Overall, if you are in need of a laugh, see this movie A.S.A.P. This one is one of the funniest movies in years, and that's being honest.Overall rating: 73/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello again, another review from Thailand, sorry for the gram and spelling mistakes :) I always try to be very open minded about movies. And not to be to black and white about how a movie is. As always you can find things you dislike about a movie. Then you weight that out to the good things and then come to a nice average point to give to the movie.Humor is a very hard emotion to please everybody with. Some ppl love the hard cussing in movies (Samuel L Jackson trademark) And some love the high intellect humor of say a John Cleese or a Rowan Atkison that are able to give you a smile from ear to ear without even speech.The thing is when i started up the movie, you see Dwayne Johnson,who i really love as a actor! Really a great asset to the cinema. And Samuel L Jackson (the man is a old granddad and still going strong) i was like THIS WIL BE GREAT! Samuel the great Go beep yourself personality, and The rock as a duo perfect fit. Now i was not expecting a Danny glover and Mel Gibson chemistry (Lethal weapon 1 to infinity) But it felt good.Sadly but true, the die pretty early and there replaced by a Will Ferrell, and a Mark wahlberg my mood degraded with the minute it is really bad.Mark was not able to play the "angry" cop, he came over to me as a annoying person with no real convincing skills to make me laugh. Samuel l Jackson that made in his 15min (CAMEO i call it) with the rock 2 sentences that made me laugh like hell.1st beginning when he lands his car in the city bus "Uhh did someone call 91 holy sh*t!" 2nd When he tells Will Ferrell to shut up "Ai aij! you shut your mouth, if i want to hear you talk, i put my hand up your *ss and work you like a puppet" I can assure you, the rest of the movie is utterly boring. There is no chemistry between Ferrell and Mark at all. The don't fit as a team up the have a lousy sense of humor. Will is as usual LOUD very loud..I wanted to turn it off after the TUNA story (trust you even for fans its a idiotic scene that made no sense and its supposed to be funny). I still cannot believe that the killed of the Rock and Jackson like that. Or even that the rented themselves out for such a bad movie.1 point its really awe full..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, contrived and lacking imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I typically only take the trouble to go watch a movie if it has an IMDb rating of greater than 7 out of 10 and fits my genre preferences. So when I saw a 7.1, I was expecting a fairly decent comedy out of two seasoned actors. However, the movie fails on a number of counts:1. Parts of the script play out like a broken tape recorder i.e. mind- numbing repetition of the same lines and similar jokes. It's as if the script writer got permission to put only 10 funny lines in a comedy movie and tried to squeeze every last drop of humor out of them. Constant references to TLC, Wahlberg's "I'm a peacock" line, the constant portrayal of Will Ferrell as a paper-pushing dork etc. made me feel like my mind was turning to mush as the movie progressed. 2. They weren't kidding when they rated it PG-13 for "crude ...language". The movie is overwrought with misogynistic comments and jokes. It literally reminded me of being in school watching a bunch of prepubescent guys belt out one liners like:"I didn't know they sold tampons on wheels" (referring to the Red Prius that Will Ferrell drives), or, "I feel like i'm sitting inside a v****a" (referring to the Prius again).Orgy loving hobos, a grandma passing sexually explicit messages between her daughter and son-in-law etc etc etc. The list is long and I could go on all day. They really overdid it on that count. 3. The plot is weak and devoid of details. It looks like the filmmakers were hoping that no one would care about the story or central theme with the "in-your-face" "comedy". Ferrell and Wahlberg are paper pushing cops (for feeble reasons that are revealed in the movie, and really not worth my time to list) who accidentally stumble into a case far larger than either of them imagined. Contrary to what the plot summary says, nobody wants a part of this case, and the only reason they get into it is because Ershon forgets to file for scaffolding permits for a few buildings he owns. Their investigation ruffles a few feathers and everything goes downhill from there. All of this while these two mismatched cops try to "find themselves", resolve their differences, and fill the shoes of the two knuckle headed "red-bull high" macho cops who randomly jump off a building at the beginning of the movie. Throw in a few car chases, bullets flying willy-nilly, and a stupid wooden gun that Will Ferrell totes around (which is supposed to be soooooo funny for some reason), and that's the summary of this movie for you. Don't waste your time with this one, unless.... actually, don't waste your time on this movie, period.</fullReview>

Unfortunately there were no laughs in the movie.You'd think with Will Ferrell, Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan and Samuel Jackson the performances would be good but they're not. Wahlberg is as bland as ever. Even Ray Stevenson, an actor I normally like, is poor in this.Its supposed to be funny that Ferrell's character is surrounded by super sexy women who can't resist him. That's not funny and the "joke" is rendered even more lame because the women in the film are far from supersexy. Coogan is wasted and what is the deal with Wahlberg's hair?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst movie I've ever seen(Mainstream)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing I grow tired of it's people posting a "Worst Movie Ever!!!!" thread in pretty much every forum on IMDb. No matte whether it's Avatar, The Godfather or Transformers, it's apparently the worst thing put on celluloid. With statements like that you need to consider some things; Amongst others; What are your guidelines? For example, I absolutely consider the Twilight movies amongst the worst pieces of crap ever made, but they are masterpieces compared to the Asylum/Syfy movies that are constantly spewn out...Does that make them good movies? No, horrible movies but ones that needs to be measured a bit differently.With that said. I hate The Other Guys, and it's one, if not THE worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. It's misogynistic, crude, stupid, pointless, annoying, badly written and with acting that would embarrass a Porn Actor. When you have seven good actors in this movie(Keaton, Wahlberg, Jackson, Johnson, Mendes, Coogan and Stevenson) and you kill of the two who could have brought some fun into this movie within ten minutes(Jackson and Johnson) you better damn well make sure your replacements are up to it. Guess what? They aren't. Wahlberg can be excellent, but here he's whiny and with the emotional range of Seagal. "I'm a peacock! Let me fly!" Yeah, dude...If you're as homophobic as you pretend to be...Lay off that comparison. It's stupid. Ferrell...If there is another comedian as unfunny as him this side of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson then humanity is in deep sh*t. Nothing he says, does or tries to get across is funny. His acting is "ISpeakWithAMonotonousVoiceLikeThisHaHa" or "BLARGHABLBLAAAA!/#""!!!!" . Stevenson is surprisingly adept as the violent bad guy in the movie, I just wish he'd shot the Other Guys when spotting them. Mendes is...Urgh, a supermodel hottie who takes verbal abuse from her husband and smiles...And shows him her tits to motivate him at work. Keaton, oh poor Keaton...Why? Why are you in this?The "Comedy": The only thing I giggled at is the vulgar crudeness of the hobos having an orgy in the car, and the dedication they show to do it again. It's stupid and pre-teen stuff, but it is just too idiotic not to chuckle at. Pretty much every other joke doesn't fall flat...It smashes through the ground, yodeling while doing so.Action: ...It's a stupid, silly action comedy. Macguyver had better stuff than this.Story: Inept, silly, stupid. Words that sound familiar by now? They should. The plot isn't really there, it's mostly trying to find somewhere to sneak in in between a mix of stupid scenes.Overall: I hate the guys who made this movie, I hate the actors for being in it and I HATE the pretentious sods who gave this move such high a score. You make even Uwe Boll cry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't know what the thousands of people that gave this movie a 5 or above were watching. I like some of Will Ferrell's stuff and most of Mark Wahlberg's. I went into this film with the excitement of seeing a very funny movie. This has got to be one of the dumbest comedies that I have seen in quite awhile. I laughed MAYBE 4 times throughout this whole dog of a movie. The acting sucked and was forced. The chemistry was non-existent between Will and Mark. The whole movie was so unbelievable and juvenile that you would either have to be drunk, stoned or under 16 years old to think that this film was funny in any way shape or form. I bet that the Rock and Samuel Jackson were grateful that they only had small parts in this movie and were out of it after the first 15 minutes or so. I would have been happy if I were them too, when the script read for them to jump off of a building together and basically commit suicide. They got off lucky by being killed off as soon as they were. I'm just kind of surprised that they didn't survive the jump, seeing as how unbelievably stupid that the rest of this movie was. Do yourselves a favor and pass this dog up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading some of the reviews on this film - I'm beginning to wonder how anyone can say that this film was hilarious. All I can think of is that they said that just because, maybe, like me, that sat through this pile of rubbish and wanted to get their own back on people.I've watched 1000's of films, and believe me, I couldn't wait till this thing was over. Not funny at all, and worse still, the constant dialogue was just non-sensical verbal diarrhoea and extremely boring. Even my 12 year old grandson, who normally laughs at silly stuff, said the film was rubbish.ALso, with a star cast like this, they all must have been hard up for cash. Now I know why Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson made such an early exit out this film, like after 10 minutes or so they are gone. No Wonder !!!! I'm just hoping that I can give this zero star rating because 1 star is too much.BE WARNED - THIS IS BORING UNFUNNY CRAP !!!!</fullReview>

Unfortunately, I was disappointed once again by "The Other Guys", a motion picture so repugnant that I was unable to watch it to a conclusion.At the outset, the combination of Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and Samuel L. Jackson offered much promise. But the moment these two super-cops met their demise (about five minutes into the film) -- and especially the way their deaths occurred -- told me the writers' sense of humor was badly askew.The next 15 minutes confirmed that impression. I won't say the humor was flat or not funny; there WAS no humor. I was embarrassed for Farrell and the other actors and finally had to turn off the DVD at the 20 minute mark. What offered great promise ended up as another Ferrell Flop."The Other Guys" surpasses water boarding for truly excruciating torture. It has convinced me to never again rent any movie featuring Will Farrell, and for that I award it one star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was I watching the same movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw some reviews saying this movie was Hilarious. I like a comedy but the whole thing just seemed to be a very long advertisement for a Toyota Prius. It started OK, but then the same dry humour seemed to repeat itself. I suppose seeing about 20 people leave the cinema before the movie ended made me understand it was not just me that found it extremely boring. Maybe this is a cultural thing and people in the states like this type of comedy, in Ireland the whole thing just seemed pathetic. I can't understand how Mark Wahlberg made it to play in a comedy. Script bad... Just because you see Samuel L. Jackson on the list of actors does not mean he is in the movie (5 mins .. not much)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If ever a preview did not deliver with a good movie, this is it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went to see The Other Guys following a funeral. We were looking for something funny and uplifting, and had very low expectations of The Other Guys. The Other Guys failed to deliver on any positive level. Let's go through the reasons why. 1. When 2 of your 6 best actors are "killed off" in the first 5 minutes, you minimize the number of actors left to carry a movie. 2. When your only funny interaction between actors is between the male lead and the female lead, and it lasts for only 5 minutes of the movie, you minimize the number of laughs your comedy can have. And finally, 3. when you put every single laugh into the trailer, and leave absolutely zero remaining laughs for the other 102 of the 107 minutes of the movie, the audience will not laugh and will look for a way to leave the theater. I personally saw at least 2 separate groups of people leave and never return. My wife asked me numerous times, "Is this ever going to get funny". This movie failed on so many levels, with what should have been a great cast. Wahlberg was terrible, Mendes only was on screen for 5 minutes, Michael Keaton was given very little to work with and Ferrell was lost in a pool of "Huh?" This movie left me with questions though... why didn't they keep Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock alive, and have them compete against the other guys? Why didn't they have Mendes on screen more? Why didn't they remember to include any laughs in the movie? Questions, all left with no easily found answers. To say this movie is a waste of your money is one thing, but to know that it was a waste of almost two hours of your life, much worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst, if not the worst movie I had the forgettable experience of actually paying to go see. I don't know what everyone here is smoking, but has to be good, because this movie was as lame as a day at the doctors office. First, the plot. We've seen it so many times, it's gotten to the point of insanity. Two cops, one the straight edge, the other the wild man are teamed up and miraculously solve a crime that has confounded top investigative for years. Not only is the plot terrible (something about a ponzi scheme looting the NYPD pension fund, *yawn*) boring but this movie commits the cardinal sin of movie comedies: IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY! The jokes get old 5 minutes in. The running gag about how beautiful Will Ferrel's wife is and him not appreciating it wasn't funny the first time, and was even less so the fifth time! The two main characters have zero chemistry, and Mark Wahlberg is really annoying in this movie. The supporting cast tries, but they can't do much with this terrible script. I was hoping Michael Keaton would steal the show as the duo's boss, but it wasn't meant to be. The best part is, is that the scriptwriters of this dud and the executive who greenlit this project will be hailed as heroes in Hollywood. That says it all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor Will Ferrell film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two types of Will Ferrell comedies the excellent ones like Step Brothers and the rubbish ones like The Other Guys. This film sees this team of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as a team of Cops wanting to make a difference and uncover a big plot. Now both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are both stupid characters in this film and they both just play there usual roles and they don't bring anything to the table that really makes the laughs. Also their chemistry is just off as Ferrell acts stupid and Wahlberg just shouts a lot and none of it is funny. Eva Mendes is annoying and stupid as Ferrell's wife and it just totally distracts from the whole film. Michael Keaton is pretty good as the Police Commander and he is the funniest character in the film. The best moments in the film is the first 15 mins involving Samuel L Jackson and The Rock. They're characters are awesome and it's great but for some stupid reason are only in the opening moments of the film which is insulting. Now the story is sometimes ignored in comedies but I still think it needs to be slightly interesting and this story is non coherent and stupid like this whole film. The script is okay especially for Keaton, Jackson and The Rock but falls flat for the major characters and really takes away from the comedy. The style is okay for what they were going for a totally unrealistic film that I must emphasise takes away from the film. Overall this is just a poor comedy that barely made me laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other cop out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem I find with a lot of comedies today is that directors often have too much faith in their leading comedians to be naturally funny and almost no faith in the comedic value of the script. It's almost as if the screenwriter hasn't bothered to write any dialog figuring that the actors will just make up funny stuff anyway so there's no point. How often have you heard a director say "I just rolled the camera and witnessed improvisational comedic genius take after take" in a making of which is usually followed by " I just didn't want to cut any of it out" and unfortunately they usually don't.&nbsp;Comedy works best when its found within the circumstances of the plot not forced out of every moment. Comedy also usually works best when it's balanced with drama.&nbsp;The filmmakers have to realize that not every moment can be funny, you have to have a release before the next build up. Same goes for any form of audience mood manipulation, one cat jumping out of a closet will probably scare your audience, the fifth in a row almost definitely wont but these days when it comes to comedy everything is over played for laughs. It's almost as if the actors are ramping it up more and more in each scene, shouting out hey look at me I'm soooo funny right now.&nbsp;Ferrell is a funny guy, there's no doubt about it, but of late he's been let off his leash far too often and ends up rambling, falling back on his ever faithful man-child persona.&nbsp;Wahlberg on the other hand is not a naturally funny guy and he's left to compensate by exploding into an over the top performance in every second scene, so much so that Ferrell's character even points this out and verbalizes what the audience is thinking - "we're so sick of it already", yes Mark, it's not working.&nbsp;The other downer is that like Cop Out there's not that much chemistry between the two cops, though at least both actors appear to want to be there rather than just going through the motions as Bruce Willis did with Tracy Morgan.To top it off, for what is meant to be a comedy, we're presented with a rather convoluted and surprisingly involved plot about financial embezzlement and corporate greed committed by the most boring, unfunny bunch of non-villains I've seen in a long time.&nbsp;There's a few laughs here and there and the production value is great but ultimately there's very little to like about The Other Guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic, immature, boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched this movie yesterday and while it did make me laugh a couple of times, I still think it was an awful mess of a movie. Even for a mindless fun kind of movie. The plot was generic Hollywood buddy-buddy formula, but with some (not funny at all) twists to make it less been- there-done-that. Most of those twists are about Will Ferrell's character, even though there's one made with Wahlberg's character too. Those twists, contrary to the intention were the thing that made this movie really awful and a hot mess if there ever was one. It seemed like genre-wise it tried to be many things, a comedy, a moral story (the financial fraud part of it), and a good action movie. For me it failed on all three fronts. Comedy - tried too hard, the end result was more OMG what are they trying to do, this is not how you reinvent the genre! Also, the sexist "jokes" by mostly Wahlberg's character (also the weird treatment of Eva Mendes' character by Will Ferrell's character ) made it even worse for me. Moral story - seemed like an unnecessary part of the movie, but they went there. For the f... of it I guess? Action movie - The over the top Samuel L. Jackson &amp; The Rock scenes were pretty rad, but then the movie started going in many different directions genre-wise so it was hard to watch it as an action flick, it seemed more like a mish-mash of different genre sketches. The main characters were not that bad per se, they were amusing enough, but nothing new, especially Will Ferrell's. He could've been from any other of his movies. Mark Wahlberg's character was typical rage filled cop with additional helping of sexist jokes, Wahlberg himself seemed kinda wooden. Maybe he's just not meant for comedy roles. Anyway, I gave this movie a 3 because I feel like it did nothing for the genre, it was immature and I mean in "Poop jokes are the best! Let's make more poop jokes!" kind of way. I guess that was the demographic this movie tried to pander to: people who think poop jokes are awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It must have sounded like a good premise at some point. There are the hero cops, and there are the other guys, the cops who do all the dirty, nonglamorous work. And this is their story. Wait, that's not a terribly good premise at all. Who cares about the other guys? What kind of an action movie would focus on the other guys? This one, which pairs accountant-like Will Ferrell with hotheaded Mark Wahlberg, each with an implausible past necessary to keep their characters out of the limelight and on light or otherwise boring duty. Each is envious of their precinct's hotshots, played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson. But then the heroes are taken out of the equation, and it's up to the other guys to step up and solve some high-handed financial scheme.Ferrell and Wahlberg have no chemistry. They're just another set of mismatched cops with differing views on everything. Wahlberg pines for his ex, a ballerina; Ferrell is married to drop-dead-gorgeous Eva Mendes (whom he pretends is a Plain Jane, har har), and that's about the most plausible thing about the movie. One cop is straightlaced, the other is not. One cop drives a Prius, the other?wait, Wahlberg doesn't even own a car. So the only reason Ferrell drives a Prius is that it's easy to make fun of someone who drives one. Both cops are constantly berated and insulted by their coworkers for no discernible reason. They're not wacky, they're wacked.Is The Other Guys a comedy? Couldn't prove it by me. There's not a joke to be found, really; the paper-thin characterizations wear very, very quickly. It's as is the writers decided that Ferrell and Wahlberg would each be a particular type ? but then found nothing funny to write about them. And let's face it, having one guy scream all the time and the other guy nerding up the joint doesn't automatically make things humorous. There are no gags, although you will gag at the ineptitude with which this movie was written (partly by Ferrell stalwart Adam McKay). There are no hilarious set pieces, no random bits of absurdity. It's a faceless, directionless pile of pablum that can't even muster up the energy to lampoon cop movies.The supporting cast is wasted. Johnson and Jackson are out of it early, conveniently enough, but even their scenes are one dimensional; they exist merely to show what Ferrell and Wahlberg aspire to be. (It should also be noted that the stunts in this movie strain credulity past the breaking point, with the lone exception of an early Johnson/Jackson scene.) It's as if the film were a movie about the making of cop movies, with all of the cops played by bottom-of-the-barrel stuntmen.Mendes is terrific and beautiful, and she actually gets some of the best lines in the film, as does Michael Keaton as the guys' boss, Gene Mauch ? so named because Ferrell, in real life, is an Angels baseball fan, and Mauch was the name of their longtime manager. On the other hand, Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. (oh, no, not another one) are as hilarious as constipation; they serve no purpose other than to be annoying, cruel, vapid, and stupid.It's saying something that the only real punch a movie provides is during its end credits. In this case, a series of increasingly alarming stats rolls across the scene, focusing on bailout money and bonuses paid to already-rich people who helped caused financial destruction in the United States. What that has to do with this movie is a connection that can be made only tenuously.</fullReview>

It also looked promising because it had a great cast who should at least make me chuckle now &amp; again. But I will now sceptical about his recommendations after watching The Other Guys. I must admit the first 10-15 minutes of the film are quite funny with Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock hamming it up as action macho cops who take all the praise and adoration from the New York public. Then they die and it all goes downhill from there. No plot, no dialogue, no chemistry and not funny at all....Yawn!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Farrell teams up with Mark Wahlberg to make a steaming loaf. Scratch that...there was nothing steaming about this loaf.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 2 because I actually watched the whole thing, although I'm not sure why. First of all let me say that I love campy comedies, but I did not laugh at this movie once. I did smile during the scene where the helicopter lands on the driving range and everyone hits it with golf balls, because that is exactly what would happen on a driving range, but that was it: I smiled at the one scene that had any relevance to life, what-so-ever.The rest of this movie was a miserable, soulless, vapid attempt at comedy. Oh it was shiny, and there were cameos and TONS of "talented actors", but it really was just a polished turd. It reminded me of those "third in a series" movies...like "Austin Powers III" or "Oceans 13", where they fill the movie to the rim with people to help camouflage the fact that the script and the subject are just worn out. I think someone needs to educate the creators of this movie that the audience needs only the slightest bit of real character development to appreciate a film. When you create a movie filled entirely with the same, one-dimensional characters, it's like watching a 2 hour commercial...except that even commercials have better character development than this movie.Thank god for Eva Mendez - she was the only one that added a little grounding to this farce. Everything else will insult your intelligence with the notion that all Hollywood needs to do is get a bunch of known actors together to simultaneously phone-in a glib movie, and you've been given your money's worth. (according to IMDb, this movie cost $100 million to make? MY GOD what a waste)Want a funny, awesome cop-buddy movie? Rent "Hot Fuzz". It cost 8 million pounds to make and was Shakespearean by comparison. Want a tiring tour of Hollywood self-infatuation and "cutesiness"? Watch "The Other Guys".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you know the Lethal Weapon franchise was mostly ad-libbed, or improvised? And guess what? THEY GOT IT RIGHT. Okay, 3 out of 4 movies, but still. That's better than The Other Guys going 0 for 1.Pardon me, but this movie was just plain painful to watch. It was as if they had a bunch of one-liners and "ideas" for jokes, then started shooting the movie until about 75% of the film was completed and then thought: Oh, sh|t, we forgot to throw a plot in.Well, they looked like they were having a party ? they certainly invited fifty of their closest Hollywood friends for cameos ? too bad we weren't.I'll admit, some of the jokes worked and I smirked a few times, but for the most part, the jokes were forced and the so-called "gags" went on for far too long. (Yeah, I get it: Gamble (Ferrell) has a pretty wife and he treats her like she's a horse. And speaking of which, STOP BEATING THAT DEAD HORSE! Damn, after fifteen minutes of that, move on!You'll know you're watching just slapstick and you'll know to leave your brain at the door when the movie opens with the most expensive gag in the disguise of a police chase in downtown NYC. Supercops Highsmith (Jackson) and Danson (Johnson) destroy everything in their path with little regard to property, rights or humans. Again, this is slapstick, so they're considered heroes.UNTIL?they (not really a spoiler) perish and it's up to "the other guys" Gamble and Hoitz (Wahlberg), those wacky and goofy and excruciatingly unfunny odd-couple of cops, to take the lead. But, their chief (Keaton) doesn't have much faith in them. And they don't do much to prove their worth.Now?take that concept of them acting all wacky and goofy and excruciatingly unfunny for about another hour (feels like three) and then get to what the movie's about: Redemption, I guess. They lost me when they finally got to what their mission is. And let me spoil it, a bit: it's about corporate greed! The same thing that's going on for, well, quite a while now.And if you're not up to date, make sure you stick around for the credits for a liberal message on the wrong-doings of the CEOs, Government, etc.Blah, blah. This movie made me miss Riggs and Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon) and Lee and Carter (Rush Hour) SOOOO badly. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen in this terrible year of 2010, but it certainly proved One Liners and Will Ferrell both need to stick to Saturday Night Live. At least those skits are over and done within about five minutes and not making us suffer about a hundred more on the same one note.</fullReview>

I don't think that he should be cast in comedic roles however. Ferrell has his own way of comedy and sometimes it fits, other times it gets to repetitive and annoying.The first 15 minutes of this movie made me want to stop watching it. However, I was somehow drawn to it just to see how bad the movie actually was. The duo of Ferrell and Wahlberg doesn't click. The movie tried way to much to be funny and most scenes have bad comedic timing and are drawn out in ways that obviously were supposed to be funny. Not even the action was entertaining until near the end where there is a chase seen that I kind of found interesting. I my opinion, this movie wasn't even worth a rental.I must admit that I found Anchorman a bit better then this. Stepbrothers made me laugh at some points but I still wasn't a great movie. How this movie got about 5 stars in the rating is beyond my understanding. There must be a lot of people out there that are easily amused because I definitely was not.To be honest I only laughed once during this movie, and it was all thanks to Ferrell.The fact that Wahlberg is to star in the upcoming Uncharted movie makes me want to cry...</fullReview>

This sort of sidestepping, improvised humour of which Will Ferrell is the leading exponent is now old hat, a Noughties trend. As such it's tired in itself. What really bores me though is that the gags don't support the characters or story. They're like noisy sideshows; more than irrelevant, they're distracting. It's a shame because the basic idea for lampooning the cop thriller and buddy movie in one holds up. It starts quite well, with a nice double cameo from The Rock and Sam Jackson and individual turns from Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes. It's murdered by the central couple though, Ferrell continually overstretching the (already thin) gags and opposite a Mark Wahlberg who (and the casting agency are as guilty as he in this) confuses being a screen presence for acting. Pointless. 2/10</fullReview>

I genuinely thought that Wahlberg and Ferrell as the leading duo would have me rolling in laughter, but instead, I was rolled up in a ball in my seat snoozing away. Ferrell's character was a strange hybrid of slapstick and dry humor that left you sitting in utter boredom. As for Wahlberg, who I generally find unassumingly funny, his character's display of funny was over-rehearsed and fell totally flat. As for the plot, it went, well, nowhere. My recommendation - your $10 is better spent elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit that there were a couple of times in this movie I laughed. Unfortunately there were only a couple of times it happened. As you can see from the ratings on this movie you either loved it or hated it. And as you can see from my vote I wasn't one who loved it. Most of the bits were lame. Instead of moving on to a new joke they returned to the same joke time and time again until you were ready to commit violence. Ferrell and Wahlberg have no chemistry. In fact it seemed that Wahlberg was ready to commit some violence on Ferrell because of his annoying babbling. Too bad his character didn't just blow Ferrell's character's head off early in the movie and save us from his repetitive yammering. Will Ferrell is a one joke comedian. Once you've heard the joke it gets less funny every time you hear it. Seeing this garbage makes me wish he was really on fire in Talladega Nights. He deserves it.Spoiler Alert!!!! When I saw who was in the cast of this movie I was sure it was going to be a good film. It just goes to show how wrong you can be about things even when you carefully read the label. Michael Keaton should have run screaming in the other direction when he was presented this script. His performance was bad, bad, bad. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson were the high points of this film. Their over the top portrayal of the super-cops was a scream. The entertainment value of this movie ended with their arrival on the sidewalk.This disjointed, poorly written, poorly acted "adventure" cost me a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back. Thankfully it only cost me $1.50 from RedBox. I'd rate this movie three flushes (one being good, two merely okay, three being really, really bad.) because it would take at least that many to get a t**d like this to flush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie based on some of glowing the reviews on this website. I was expecting something funny, and had high hopes. Unfortunately the "unparallelled chemistry" between Marky Mark and Will Ferrell turned out to be bad chemistry - unparallelled, to be sure, and I knew ten minutes in that it would be a weak show, at best. I sat through the rest of it, and it was definitely weak. All of Wahlberg's lines seemed strained. Ferrell played himself, as usual, being the annoying partner that takes every joke so far so that it's no longer funny. Wahlberg played his easily set-off counterpart that freaks out at Farrell every time Ferrell speaks. Bad acting, boring plot, impossible to get into, and therefore a complete waste of time. The Rock and Samuel Jackson were pretty funny, so there's your two stars out of ten. I recommend to avoid this one folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot Of Silliness With Very Little Humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no argument with stupid movies in some cases. Sometimes they're actually quite funny. Take Will Ferrell's turn in "Anchorman" for example. That was a stupid and very funny movie that required no significant thought to enjoy. I was hoping "The Other Guys" would accomplish the same. It didn't. Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg played a couple of loser cops who are always in the background, being overshadowed by the other more glamorous and exciting cops. They're the quintessential "other guys" who are never in on the action and never get the glory. They stumble upon a big fraud case and set themselves to making a splash by solving it.OK. Maybe there was some potential there. But it was inconsistent, jumping around from ridiculous and unnecessary plot point to ridiculous and unnecessary plot point, introducing way too much, from Hoitz' (Wahlberg) dancing abilities (learned to make fun of queers and fairies) to Gamble's (Ferrell) past as a college pimp and his inexplicable attractiveness to beautiful women. It was just silly - and unfortunately it wasn't a funny silly; it was just plain silly. Dumb. Stupid. Come up with any other similar word and it will fit perfectly well. The highlights were some equally silly (but at least fun) car chase scenes at the beginning and end of the movie that at least drew you into the story (at least until it really got going) and left you with a bit of a smile. But any other highlights were few and far between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad...and I mean not Good Bad !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment! I had hoped for a few laughs since Ferrel was in the cast. However the entire experience was like watching a stand up comic bomb..at a very slow pace. It seemed the writers thought of a few good one liners, comebacks, and scenarios and threw it on the screen hoping that something would stick. It was awkward to say the least. Additionally it seemed as if Ferrel was acting in another movie..as though he was trying to "seriously" portray his character as a genuine individualistic oddball/geek relative to the other cops...not going for laughs at all..like a straight man. Except for a few teenagers , who probably laugh at anything, the theater was quiet much of the time(the audience that is). If it wasn't for the sound of the movie ..you could have heard a pin drop much of the time. Wahlberg ..well it was hard to believe he was a major league movie star in recent past....his acting ability seemed on par with a college age boy in a community theater production. Like I stated earlier it fell flat for me , my companions and most of the audience present. The only real actors who seemed to show "talent" and were believable in their roles were the England accented crook and the Australian accented bodyguard. Too bad Michael Keaton couldn't have had a better role/material..now he is a talented actor. I also can't believe the many very positive reviews on the site...they must work for for the film or distribution company or subsidiaries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was truly stunned at how bad it was , I watched the trailer at home and thought it looked OK , EVERYTHING that was remotely amusing was in that 3 minutes the rest was horrible , the acting the premise and editing the camera work , was outrageously poor, I think what truly offended me was the lack of effort to even try string it together, It was insulting .I guessing someone said something funny and they wrote a scene to incorporate it then stitched them together like gran'ma's quilt .. It seems like a long string of comics are perfecting the "wounded" look (I blame Hugh Grant ), however they are subtitling it without any humor!! just standing there looking dumb , bewildered and misunderstood when they do something stupid ..do your job write a script instead</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Ferrell is the least funny man in America. This movie was a waste of consciousness. My girlfriend, who likes Ferrell movies said it was horrible. Mark Wahlberg was more funny than the "comedian" in the movie. I don't know who Will Ferrell has naked pictures of to keep getting gigs, but he is not worthy of continuing to act in the industry. I will not be wasting another $ on anything with his name attached to it. I have only seen a handful of movies with the "comedian" in them, but he always seem like he doesn't have a script and just shoots from the hip with his dialog. Sir...please use a script if you get lucky enough to be in another movie. Absolute garbage!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is a retarded buddy cop movie, that is worse than "Cop Out". It's just that bad and mostly annoying to watch than actually entertaining. And while the cops from "Cop Out" is semi retarded or at least one of them. The cops in this movie is full retarded and annoying as hell and super not funny. I don't know how anyone can find this humor to be funny. I liked some of Adam McKay previous film's such as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, but hated this movie. The only good parts of this film is the first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie with Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock. The rest of the movie, I don't even remember or want to remember. The jokes aren't even funny in this and it drags on and on about that one unfunny joke for like 5 minutes or even more, felt like it was longer though. Like some reviewers said, this movie is a insult to audiences intelligence and I walked out with a head ache from the pure stupidity and not even it being funny at all. I give this movie a 2 and just because of the scenes with Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One travesty of a failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was truly an awful mistake. After some mild anticipation for the slim possibility that Will Ferrel would actually produce a character that was funny, I finally understood that Will Ferrel can no longer meet the needs of humor-hungry movie-goers. Once again he plays an immature, loud buffoon that feigns towards humor and then shies away as if the writers intentionally cut the punchline out of every joke. I admit there were a few times when I cracked a smile out of guilty obligation, but if one is looking for a funny movie, look elsewhere. Mark Wahlberg has demonstrated time and time again that he is a disappointment on screen, and its getting pretty obvious that if Nicolas Cage won't do a role, then there's always Markie Mark. This cast was extremely weak including the likes of Dwayne "The Rock and horrible Actor" Johnson, and the never popular Michael Keaton who butchers every scene as if he was put there by complete error. Maybe Steve Gutenberg was busy. Do not waste your time if you actually like to enjoy the experience of watching a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Waste Your Money!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I needed some laughs and were looking for a decent comedy. When in doubt she goes by the IMDb ratings. Over the weekend the Other Guys was rated 7.4 but there were only 1800 votes at the time. Of course I'd been trying to talk her into seeing Predators LOL.So since Tuesday is discount movie night we went to see The Other Guys. I was wondering whether we'd made a mistake about 5 minutes into it. It went downhill from there. I can think of only one funny moment: when the Rock and Jackson go for the bushes.Will Farrel has had some decent films, the Anchorman comes to mind. There may have been a number of flops I just never considered seeing. I like most of Wahlberg's films. The Big Hit proves he can do deadpan comedy.So where did this film fall sooooooo flat? I thought the screenplay was dreadful and good actors can't compensate for dreadful dialogue, unfunny characters or jokes. And it's not as if the plot was that coherent. Neither my girlfriend nor I thought this movie was in the least funny. I must have asked her about 5 times... shall we try to get our money back? When there was no redeeming finale, she finally agreed staying to the end was a mistake.Our recommendation is don't waste good money or 2 hours of your life seeing this film on the big screen. If you really want to see it... it will soon be a $1 rental at a Red Box near you.Then if 15 minutes into it, you stop watching out of disgust, you're only out $1.00.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst movie I have ever seen. Terrible editing. Plot that was a mess and actors that were totally ridiculous. No one in the theater even chuckled and everyone left in silence. I felt I was being punked the entire time--it had to have been a joke; it was that horrible. The jokes should have been funny, they all fell flat. It felt like I was watching a movie these guys made as a goof. I left the theater actually angry at the awfulness of this movie. Mark Wahlberg ACTUALLY sounded like the joke character from SNL (say hi to your motha for me). Ferrell is a great comedic actor, but in this mess, he came off like an overindulgent jerk. I don't know if these lines were ad-libbed or written--either way it was an embarrassment. I felt embarrassed for Mckay and co. , cause I know they are better than this garbage.</fullReview>

A few groups of people left in the middle, and I wish I had done the same. I cannot find one redeeming aspect of this movie and I was the one who really wanted to see it! A huge disappointment. Some others in the theater had a laugh every now and then, but mostly were quiet. The acting was poor and the actors were wasted on the script. The shootouts were asinine, the dialogue was idiotic, and the NYPD are all made out to be two-dimensional morons. Michael Keaton is wasted here, and you know the movie is in trouble when he is the only 'sane' one on the screen. My suggestion: "aim for the bushes". I, too, wanted to jump.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half-Baked Cop Buddy Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saturday Night Live" comedian Will Ferrell has made a mint out of playing morons. He delivers another hilarious performance as a moronic New York Police Department detective in "Talladega Nights" director Adam McKay's "The Other Guys," an ambitious but half-baked parody of slam-bang police thrillers. Oscar nominated actor Mark Wahlberg of "The Departed" co-stars as Ferrell's pugnacious NYPD partner. Unfortunately, Wahlberg displays none of Ferrell's comic genius. Nothing Wahlberg does registers as remotely amusing. He is either screaming at Ferrell out of spite or skewering his partner's masculinity. Wahlberg appears to be channeling Joe Pesci from the Martin Scorsese classics "Goodfellas" and "Casino." Alas, Wahlberg is no Pesci. The funniest thing next to Ferrell is the non-stop ridicule reserved for our hero's red Prius. One cop calls it a 'tampon on wheels.' Surprisingly, the car is far funnier than Wahlberg. McKay and "Land of the Lost" scenarist Chris Henchy struggle with little success to combine a formulaic police buddy picture comedy with a complex white-collar crime conspiracy involving a shady investment banker. Think of "The Other Guys" as a mediocre "Police Academy" wannabe with half of the laughs. Primarily, the humor grows out of the irony that a couple of pencil-pushing desk jockeys replace two loose-cannon celebrity crime busters as the top cops in the Big Apple. The stunt work is terrific. The opening gag where a heroic pair of testosterone-driven cops crash their sports car into a double-decker bus to arrest several shooters for a misdemeanor amount of narcotics is impressive. Alas, McKay and Henchy make some poor narrative choices. First, they kill off the two most charismatic characters, Highsmith and Danson, and then struggle to replace them with two boring morons.NYPD Detectives P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson of "Pulp Fiction") and Christopher Danson (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson of "The Tooth Fairy") are a macho pair of "Lethal Weapon" cops who refuse to let details complicate their roguish antics. Although they make spectacular arrests, they also create spectacular property damage. Nevertheless, everybody loves them so they can flout the rules. As "The Other Guys" opens, Highsmith and Danson are in hot pursuit of a gang armed with assault rifles. Danson has jumped atop their Escalade, but he doesn't stick around long after they perforate the roof. Danson dives back onto Highsmith's car, bounds off the hood onto the roof, and slings himself back into the front passenger seat. The villains blast Highsmith's car so the hood flies back against the windshield and blinds them. Highsmith shoots off the hood hinge. Too late! He plows into a double-decker bus as the villains appear to get away. Danson commandeers the double-decker bus with Highsmith's car still stuck in it. Danson careens after the hoods, whips the double-decker around and the maneuver launches Highsmith's car at the hoods with Highsmith blasting away with two pistols. After Highsmith and Danson receive their medals, Precinct Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton of "Batman") solicits somebody to complete their paper work. These two cops have never wasted their time with paperwork. Detective Allen Gamble snaps at the opportunity to polish off the Highsmith and Danson paperwork. Not long afterward, Highsmith and Danson leap to their deaths when trying to thwart a team of acrobats who wield a wrecking ball to smash their way into a jewelry store and heist $79-thousand in stones. Nobody knows why Highsmith and Danson jumped from 20 stories up and hit the cement hard.A milquetoast forensic accountant who prefers to file paperwork, Gamble (Will Ferrell of "Old School") likes to hum the S.W.A.T. theme and stay in the precinct office rather than nab bad guys on the streets. His idea of busting loose is to floor the gas pedal of his Prius and play the Little River Band. Allen's partner, Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg of "Date Night"), is just the opposite. Terry dreams of making the big bust. He suspects drug deals behind every crime. Sadly, Terry has been confined to a desk and stuck with Allen. The skeleton in Terry's closet is he accidentally shot New York Yankees baseball slugger Derek Jeter in the leg during the seventh game of the World Series. Yes, the Yankees lost! Everybody in the precinct now calls Terry 'the Yankee Clipper.' Naturally, Terry hates Allen, but he lives by the venerable "partner's code" which requires a partner to back up his partner no matter what the circumstance. Ironically, Allen's obsession with paper work prompts them to arrest British investment banker Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan of "Tropic Thunder") who is up to his chin in a grand scheme to steal $32-billion from the NYPD Pension Fund to cover the loses of another Wall Street titan.The best scene between Ferrell and Wahlberg is the lion-versus-the-tuna tale. Terry tells Allen that if he were a lion he would rip him to shreds as easily as a lion could a tuna. Terry destroys the lack of logic in Terry's threat with own flawed logic. He claims that the tuna would gang up on the lion. Later they would construct an oxygen apparatus to allow them to live out of water so they could stalk and attack lions on dry land. The running joke throughout "The Other Guys" is nerdy Allen is a babe magnet. Sexy chicks come on to him and ignore Terry. Terry is floored when he meets Allen's hot chick wife, Dr. Shelia Gamble (Eva Mendez of "Training Day"), who is crazy about her husband. "The Other Guys" swerves erratically between scenes of Allen and Terry bonding to the chaos they create after they arrest Ershon. The "Grand Theft Auto" chases, the blazing gunfights, and the audacious wrecking ball jewelry heist look cool but these scenes seem out of place in this lackluster buddy comedy. Ultimately, "The Other Guys" runs out of both momentum and laughs long before it runs out of plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hidden gem ! Thats what I think about this movie while this is definitely not a 6,6/10 movie ! I have seen it many times and I can say that it gets better and better every time . Will Ferrell &amp; Mark Wahlberg seemed to be a great duo with Michael Keaton as a surprise ! All of those 3 as main characters worked great in their roles giving as a result great laughs ! Michael Keaton was a blast in a role that reminded me a bit of " Mr. Mom " 30 years later . This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and plot twists, while the plot was as good as it can get for this kind of comedy . After watching it for the first time years ago I hoped for a part 2 as the end of it could easily give birth a second part. I hope even after all those years a part 2 will take place so we could see all these great actors once again all together ! Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of laughs and some action all rolled into one. If you're looking for a pick-me-up or to laugh hysterically, this is undoubtedly the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See 'Another Movie' instead..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notwithstanding the pleas for higher ratings from our beloved colleagues here at IMDb, I am recommending you pass. I really wanted Will Ferrell, and Mark Wahlberg to be funny, but, the truth is, after less than an hour, I turned it off, not really caring how the story ends, or how the main characters fare (just so readers don't accuse me of 'not giving it a chance').Hollywood has trouble turning out non-clichéd comedies these days - and this is an iteration of the 'cop-buddy' movie, with silly robberies, hijacks, and idiot violence (sometimes self-inflicted, as in the case of the 2 heroic cops envied by Wahlberg and Ferrell. Ferrell (who plays an accountant type) is a nerdy pencil-pusher married to a drop-dead gorgeous woman (Eve Mendes) -- a hot-tempered Wahlberg has been busted to a desk job after accidentally shooting a celebrity mistaken for a mugger (maybe the only original funny bit in the whole movie). These two yearn for the action of genuine police work in the street, but are ill-matched to work as a team, Wahlberg frequently criticizing everything about Ferrel (including his feminine farts). The two try to resolve their differences, but this regresses back to hostility several times in the film, when the writers realized there wasn't going to be anything else to laugh at.Lazy writing, a lack of genuinely-original material, and uneven development of character &amp; plot leave you with a sense that the whole thing was conceived over several drinks at a frat party (where proper masculine farting was, no doubt, exhibited en masse).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about a movie that had potential and fell short. So you're throwing in your ingredients and you open with the Duane Johnson and Sam Jackson doing a great macho opening and they end up jumping off a roof for, like, no reason, and then Ka-put, silence. Beat. Beat. The audience explodes with laughter. Great. Perfect. Check the Gate, let's go home. Because that's what most of the audience wished they had done 80 minutes or so later. And you have Michael Keaton. He's a God! Like having Bill Murray or some other comical genius on board. Will Farrell, well, you know what you're getting with Will Farrell, and you get it, he delivers. Eva Mendes?WOW?and that ALL works. So where's the problem? Oh yeah, the movie isn't funny. The jokes aren't funny. Mark "E" Mark isn't funny?he's acting with that stupid soft delivery thing he does, which did work in Fear because he's pretending to be a soft spoken guy and is hiding that he is a psycho. I thought he was great in that, but in this movie, he's actually playing it like that's who he really is, and at times it does work, sometimes really well, but overall it doesn't. And if you're not buying one of the two leads for part of the movie, then the movie doesn't work. A very large percentage of the jokes fell really short. I was pumped to see this movie and was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How fortunate Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a super-macho officer in this film, dies off early. That should have been the same for the writing and all of this film as well. Period.The film details 2 bumbling officers in the tradition of Officer Clouseau of the Pink Panther fame. They try to step up when Jackson and his partner die in a ridiculous scene.As the officers, Ferrell and Wahlberg uncover a tycoon's misdeeds but are constantly thwarted along the way by the tycoon's private force and others on the NYC police force.Some of the antics are crazy such as the shooting of Derek Jeter and Ferrell being persuaded by other cops to shoot off his gun in the office. Another scene includes police passing a gun around in a New York City classroom and allowing a young female student to go on a police chase with them. Stupid best describes all of this.In reality, the picture doesn't say very nice things about the police so I shall not say very good things about this film.</fullReview>

Oh, and little hint, no matter how loud you get or how foolish the subject, yelling is never funny.I understand the whole replace the really two good, crazy cops that were funny because they have acted in police dramas with two cops that should NEVER be given a badge, but you didn't have to kill them off, you could have just had them badly injured somehow and capable of cutting back to them in the hospital for when you needed some more over the top lines to be delivered.

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if I can say enough good things about this film. It was exactly what I expected and much more. It hit the comedy nail on the head repeatedly, from witty oneliners, extended quotable dialogue, over the top slapstick, and some quirky character humor. Johnson and Jackson are two hotshot action hero cops that cause more damage than the crooks they apprehend. But this film isn't about them. It's about desk-cops Wahlberg and Ferrell. These two make a surprising comic duo. Wahlberg is the angry/disgraced cop looking to get back in the field, and Ferrell is more of a number cruncher. After investigating a scaffolding violation, they are dragged into an action scenario. The film kept me in stitches by variating on its humor throughout. There are a number of memorable scenes from the whisper fight to the accidental bribes. It knows when to finish a joke and most impressive of all, Ferrell moves away from the lovable idiot character. He sometimes misjudges a situation, but his character's competence is refreshing. Wahlberg is a perfect comedy performer. Best of all, we get to see Keaton back in a fairly large, comedic role. Well cast, well played, and I have a feeling it will have a high rewatchability factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid comedy in the main but I found some of the absurd and silly dialogue to be very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If movies have taught us anything it is that the best cops are those that take the risks, do the outrageous and shoot their way through any problem while also coming up with a wise-crack kiss-off line. These guys are the heroes in the action movie cliché, along with the grizzled but tired boss, the paper-pushers and, of course, the other guys who make up the squad room. When misfortune meets one pair of tough cops, one such "other guy" sees the chance to step up into this role. He is Hoitz (trapped in a desk job due to shooting baseball player Derek Jeter and costing his team the title) and his partner is a dull accountant type who weirdly has amazing luck with women. Hoitz is disappointed that their first big case is over expired scaffolding permits, but it is not long before they discover more to the case.I heard so-so things about this film so I decided to give it a miss in the cinema, plus although I like Ferrell, he isn't the most consistent with his films and this looked like it won't be that good. In reality though it was actually pretty funny and it just seemed to hit my sense of humour right when I watched it. It is ridiculous stuff though and a lot of the dialogue and banter is absurd but to me this is part of the charm of it. One could argue that it doesn't really work as it was intended because, as a spoof of action movie excess from the point of view of "the other guys" it doesn't really work and isn't clever enough; sure it can laugh at the Hollywood excess at the start, but it isn't that smart beyond that point. Likewise one could also point to the final thirty or so minutes where the action aspect does rather take over and the comedy takes a backseat; or even one could question why the end credits decide that the film should suddenly become some sort of documentary against corruption in the financial sector - something it didn't do up till that point, despite being set in this world to a point. All of these would be true because the film is not a brilliant one and these flaws and weaknesses are all reasons why.The thing is though that when the film revels in the silly comedy dialogue it is really good fun. The writers have a good ear for it and the cast deliver them well; it isn't clever but it seems full of surprising and engaging nonsense dialogue that did make me laugh. The nonsense relationship between the lead two, the nonsense college background of Gamble, the nonsense conversations between the characters, the nonsense events that happen to the red Prius, I found them all really funny and it was always a shame when plot had to come and do some things to move the film along.Ferrell and Walhberg work really well together and the film seems to be aware of this because it does give them plenty of time together (perhaps contributing to the film running a tad longer than it should). They both have great comic delivery here - in particular deadpanning some great dialogues sequences and making them funnier through their delivery. Coogan is pretty good in a supporting role while Keaton, Mendes and others all let themselves be used as jokes and also deliver the comic material well.It isn't a great film by any means but it had a great sense of absurdity and nonsense to it that I really enjoyed a lot. The plot I can take or leave and the decision at the last minute to make it try and have substance just doesn't work but otherwise it is very funny and the central relationship and banter would be one I'd be happy to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what is the point of this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start by clarifying what is the intention of a comedy movie. The main trait must be to make people laugh. The rest might be a refreshing break for all day to day things that happen in the world.This failed comedy begins rashly with two good action-comedian actors: the rock Johnson and Samuel L Jackson. They both carried the first minutes of the flick straight, which makes people think that the movie is going to be good. But it's only a placebo that unveils itself once the "The other guys" are introduced.I'm not saying that Ferrel is not a good comedian. He is (although not great). But he's got the bad taste to select awful roles recently. As for Wahlberg, he is totally unfit in the role of a comedian. So, it's not necessary to say that he was miscast.Thus, people should blame the producers and writers for this mess since there is not point in this attempted comedy. So, the only thing that I can infer is that this movie is meant to get money from naive people's pockets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe they spent money on making this movie!OK, there were maybe 2 funny scenes that actually made me laugh - but mostly because they were too damn stupid, not really funny.A sample: 2 cops in a school class: "Statistically speaking, next year, 30 of you won't be alive anymore. If you want to live, try your hardest not to be black or Hispanic". -------------- The all-time worst scene in a movie: Eva Mendes announces to her husband: "I'm pregnant, my love" - "What? Whose baby is this?" --------------And the real horror is: once you watched it, you cannot unwatch it!If this movie gets any kind of price, it's only a demonstration of the incredible political bias in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another movie that panders to the IQ of the lowest common denominator. The humor is ridiculously dumb and it worries me that if the majority of people find this funny and enjoyable, then where is the human species heading? The movie industry has really let down humanity as of late, and this is yet more garbage to add to the pile. Why on earth is this rated currently 7.1 with over 6,000 votes? It seems as though the majority of people voting on this have very low standards.I was actually looking forward to a laugh with this movie, and sure there were the odd one or two lines that were funny, but ultimately I was bitterly disappointed.If you are an intelligent person, my bet is you will not like this movie either.Peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so stupid, it's funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to make a film that's action, drama, and comedy (all in one) is tricky, and "The Other Guys" can't avoid the difficulty. The parts that tried to be funny seemed flat, the parts that tried to be dramatic were tedious and many of the action scenes seemed intentionally overdone, to the point of being corny. The places where this film scored were the stupid parts, many of which were SO stupid they were hilarious.Dwayne Johnson and Samuel Jackson were excellent; Michael Keaton is solid, as usual, and I think my hardest laughs were at scenes with Eva Mendez, especially the ones featuring her character's mother.Judged against those sorts of all-in-one movies, I'd probably give this a 7 out of 10; judged against all kinds of movies, though, it's probably worth only about a 3 or a 4. In fairness, that could just be because in the last few days I watched Red and Red 2 for the first time, both of which did better at pulling off the action/drama/comedy trifecta, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny film about a couple of far from high-flying cops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this police comedy opens we see a pair of super-cops involved in a spectacular, and destructive, car chase to take down some criminals. When the chase is over they are f?ted like rock stars? these men don't do paperwork; that is left to the likes of Detectives Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz? the other guys. These two seldom leave the office as Gamble is a risk averse forensic accountant and Hoitz is less than popular following an incident where he shot a star basketball player. After the two star cops die the rest of the squad are keen to take on their mantle and Hoitz insists that they go out for once. While out Mantle arrests businessman Sir David Ershon? for breaking scaffolding regulations! They don't realise that he is involved with some shady characters who kidnap him on the way to the police station. It soon becomes apparent that Ershon has powerful friends and dangerous enemies; Mantle and Hoitz will have to up their game if they are to solve the case.When I sat down to watch this I hoped it might be mildly amusing but soon found it much better than that as laugh out loud moments came thick and fast. I like how the film introduced us to the two super-cops, played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, before the actual stars of the film. The way these two operated then died was delightfully over the top. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are impressive in these lead roles; their characters are funny as is their constant bickering. Steve Coogan provides more laughs as Ershon and Ray Stevenson is suitably threatening as bad guy Roger Wesley; a role he plays straight rather than for laughs. The story isn't particularly strong but that doesn't matter as it serves to put the characters in various situations that provide the laughs. There are plenty of funny moments as well as some running gags. The best of these running gags was Hoitz's constant bafflement that Gamble keeps attracting beautiful women, including his 'plain' wife. The action is over the top in a way that suits the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh and enjoys cop films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't normally write reviews but after reading some of the awful reviews some people wrote about this film I had to come to its defence.This film had me laughing from start to finish. If you like the silliness of Will Ferrell films or the humour in Ted then you will love this film. The comedy can be played very deadpan despite the surrealness (is that a word) of the situation. The comic timing is great and the chemistry between all the main characters is excellent. When I saw this film only had a 6.7 IMDb rating I was a little reluctant to watch it but I saw the trailer and that drew me in. I didn't regret it.If you want some great laughs, watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry all those who loved this but I didn't laugh or even smile once. A comedy is only a comedy if it is funny and Will Ferrel doing a poor impression of Chevy Chase just doesn't do it for me. The Mark Walberg character was weird and I never got what his angle actually was, in fact that was true of most of the characters, they were a mish-mash of characters from other comedy films and it just didn't work. But I guess the fault lies in the script and direction because as I said it just wasn't funny. Now I am sure many who did like it may have rolled about laughing but maybe that just shows we all have different tastes when it comes to humour. On a side note I was quite shocked at how short both Mark Wahlberg and Michael Keaton were. I kept thinking 'how on earth did that guy play Batman?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, but loses some of its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Other Guys" is a comedy, crime action movie, which follows the two cop buddies Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg who try to make a name for themselves in the NYPD. The story itself is not what makes this movie fun to watch, but instead to see the chemistry that goes on between Ferrell and Wahlberg. Their characters, who minds are complete opposite of each other works great for some good laughs throughout the movie. I love that the movie is set in a police environment, and that we get to see the odd police partnership play out between these two main characters. The flaw I have for this movie is the opportunities the movie misses to make it even funnier. The jokes in the movie mostly consist of what looks like improvised talk, and it's hard to find some real jokes in the movie without witnessing Wahlberg yelling all the time and Ferrell's mumbling. I feel the script could have been much better, but that isn't to say that the movie isn't funny at all, because it certainly has some scenes that will make you laugh. The crime- solving story isn't really that exiting to watch, which makes you more focused on how well Will and Wahlberg can deliver a funny performance. In the end, the movie has its funny moments but overall it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These two had me laughing my a** off the whole way through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I finished watching Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg's second collaboration together "Daddy's Home" a few days ago. I decided I would hop back to 2010 where these two first appeared in a movie together, and boy I'm glad I did. After seeing this movie I completely understand now why these two would just a few years later star alongside each other once again. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are absolutely hilarious together and this movie is proof of that.This movies opening minutes already has me laughing my ass off at the on-screen characters of Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. It's a shame though these two die about 15 minutes into the movie. Seeing the trailer for this years ago I was completely mislead into believing these two had way bigger roles in this movie then they really do. I eventually got over it though, but I really didn't care for their replacement's played by Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr. where their performances here were weaker than some of their others I've seen. The rest of the cast was either hit or miss. On one end you had a funny performance from Michael Keaton playing Captain Gene Mauch. Then you had one of the antagonists Roger Wesley played by Ray Stevenson who was very bland and one-dimensional, but it's the films two main stars that make this movie for me.As I said before Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg work together very well, and maybe it's Wahlberg that brings out Will Ferrell's better side. You know the calmer, yet funnier side of him that I prefer over his loud and over-dramatic performances. As again Will Ferrell not only succeeded at making me laugh, but at times in this movie actually made me seriously laugh my ass off. For example, when his character is tricked into shooting his gun in the office because he was told all the other guys have done it, and that he wouldn't truly be a man unless he did. That's just one of many laugh out loud moments for me in this movie, and I could list a few more but then what's the point of watching this am I right. Which brings me to my final words. If you haven't yet seen this comedy I suggest giving it a try. It turned out a lot better for me than I expected from this comedy, and if your not a Will Ferrell fan than your not alone, but I promise you when I say he's delightfully funny here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Combination of Silliness and Intelligence, from the Team to the Plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the buddy cop movie is a subgenre which, among many requirements, is not supposed to take itself seriously and offer a fair share of crazy action sequences, a spoof doesn't sound like the most original premise. How can you possibly make fun of something fun in the first place? Yet "The Other Guys" works, much to my surprise. While I was expecting a Laurel-and-Hardy-like pairing, you know with the straight man and the lovable buffoon, I was pleasantly surprised by the portrayals of the two cops, and the way their personality completed each other. Mark Wahlberg is Terry, a nervous trigger-happy cop whose career was compromised by the accidental shooting of baseball star Derek Jeter (looking like a suspicious guy with the bat under the shadow), and Will Ferrell is Allen, a passive and sweet office-bound accountant, who doesn't want to get in trouble. These guys form such a perfect pair of losers and loners they're inevitably labeled as the other guys.Now, who's the other's guys' "other guys", so to speak? Well, they make their entrance in one of the most over-the-top and brilliantly unbelievable chase scenes in recent history. It's noisy, nonsensical, each stunt asking more suspension of disbelief than a "Matrix" movie (actually, law of gravity is as disregarded as the penal law), and it features two bankable and believable legitimate movie tough guys through Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. They're the princes of the city, it's like Shaft and McClane under steroids with Starsky and Hutch's street smarts and brotherly love. What a loss when they met with the maker! But what an extraordinarily laugh-out-loud moment! I wish I didn't spoil anything but wasn't it obvious that they would have to leave room to the losers? And there's something so appealing in these guys, starting with their high self-esteem, they know they're only victim of unfortunate circumstances. Terry is actually a good cop and Allen displays a nice amount of wit and verbal come-backs, he also has an irresistible charm with hot women, which wouldn't make sense in a real world, but how about macho Terry who knows about music, dance and modern Art just because he wanted to make fun of some 'gay kid' of the neighborhood? In its own wicked way, the film manages to provide three-dimensional characters, that actually make us care for them. There's something so touching and vulnerable when Terry cries about being a "peacock who dreams of flying" and Allen's retelling of his past provides an interesting twist on his character."The Other Guys" have the characters, and the set-up ending with the previous cops' demise makes us expect a quality comedy movie. I think the good vibrations between Adam McKay and Will Ferrell not only worked, but Mark Wahlberg fits perfectly in this team as he never mocks his own character and plays him with the same respect and seriousness than his usual tough and no-nonsense characters. Ferrell is also remarkable as a guy whose comedic appeal doesn't rely on goofy attitudes or brash reactions, and when it happens a few times, the context makes it totally acceptable. Ferrell shows again his capability to play restrained and intelligent characters as he did in "Stranger Than Fiction" so the performance isn't much a revelation. Actually, the real revelation is in the story.Indeed "The Other Guys" has higher ambitions than the film it actually plays on, it doesn't just try to mock the usual cop archetypes, with the car chases, explosions, Mexican stand-offs, and evil masterminds, it actually has a statement to say about the way the economy works, and how liberal inequality is maintained by corrupt businessmen. A lot has been said about the film's ending credits, and without revealing everything, I must say it kind of killed all the fun, and made me realize that we were ruled by bad guys, basically. With all the Ponzi schemes (think of Madoff) the golden parachutes, and the wages difference between workers and CEO, you just applaud the guts of "The Other Guys" to tackle another kind of villain, than usual terrorists, kidnappers or serial killers.Still, for all the seriousness of the ending credits, McKay never tackles the story in a straight-forwardly serious way, you just have hints of what would become his Oscar-winning screenplay "The Big Short". The core of the movie still relies on the partnership between Allen and Terry, which creates some great interactions, involving metaphorical references (the Tuna vs. Lion speech is a quotable delight), an obligatory bad cop/good cop interrogation and many cute and sweet moments. They never express their mutual fondness but you can tell from their exchange that they respect and like each other, which is good, given the way they're belittled by their colleagues, except for their patient and magnanimous chief Captain Gene, played by Michael Keaton. And to complete the gallery, Eva Mendes is the too-sexy-to-be-true loving housewife and Steve Coogan as the corrupt businessman is a nice completion to the trio, during the third act."The Other Guys" varies from buddy-comedy to social commentary but the ensemble feels solid and well-structured, so that there's no moment whatsoever when we feel lost or that the story is going nowhere. Not all the gags are hilarious, but Adam McKay knows how to put his laugh-out-loud moments in the right places, and the performances of the two actors honor the plot. It's just a pity the film didn't get the success it deserves, but that's the risk with playing with archetypes that are already funny in the first place. I say a pity because this is a duo I would have loved to see again? Such well-written and acted and directed characters as Terry and Allen deserved a sequel.In fact, even Jackson and Johnson's characters deserved a prequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to laugh, so I tried the Other Guys. It's a typical Will Ferrel-type comedy. Two cops who are desk jockeys get thrust into a real case that puts them out on the street in a real case.Mark Wahlberg is OK as the partner, playing the straight man. Ferrell is a dork, married to a beautiful Eva Mendes who is a doctor. And all the beautiful women keep hitting on Ferrell. A typical ploy in these movies, reversing what you'd expect.Stupid story, lot of physical humor. If you like Ferrell, you will like this. Wahlberg is OK. The Rock and Samuel L Jackson also play some funny roles for a bit. But overall, you get what pretty much what you expect in this b-grade type comedy.The Other Guys - nothing great, but I have seen worse. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comedy in The Other Guys, comes from the relationship between partners, Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), two desk cops that idolize NYPD heroes Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and PK Highsmith (Samuel L Jackson). The only problem is that Terry can't stand Allen and his insistence to do menial work. However they learn to get along in order to investigate wealthy businessman David Ershon (Steve Coogan). The movie is a scenario with a bunch of jokes, like a lot of great comedies. Ferrell and Wahlberg are great together, and a lot of the comedy is derived from them. Eventually Ershon gets a lot of laughs when Allen and Terry kidnap him. The bottom line is the movie is really funny. I highly recommend, The Other Guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can one say about a movie whose best parts are the 2008 bailout comic during the credits and the joke told post-credits?It's obviously a big-budget movie. If you like those in themselves just because they are not bad, you'll probably like this one too.But, disregarding that, it just tries too hard to be funny. Sometimes it succeeds, but, most often, it doesn't. Though most of the attempts are somewhat interesting, they just don't work. Like Will Ferrell being a babe-magnet without even trying - well, actually actively trying to be babe anti-magnet with his wife, Eva Mendes. The Brooke Shields gag to that effect is interesting, but not very funny.The main problems seems to be that pretty much none of the characters are likable. The police captain, Michael Keaton is the only one that's somewhat likable (well, of course, Eva Mendes is likable, but she has very little screen time). Characters don't have to be smart or nice to be likable, but they still need to express something that one can like.It's not bad, but, not good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be completely honest I absolutely love about the first 15 to 20 minutes of The Other Guys. It sets the bar pretty high for a movie that unfortunately can't really keep up with those standards.Every scene Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson are in are absolutely hilarious. The problem is there aren't many scenes in which they are in. Ferrell and Wahlberg do a great job with the script they are given and I just have to say this movie did make me laugh out loud in quite a few scenes. But the laughs aren't consistent and I thought most of the humor was pretty low brow, the kind of things that may look great on paper, but when executed may not work as well as expected.The parts of the movie that I liked I really liked and I didn't really dislike the other parts of the movie, I just thought they were OK. The good parts of it are actually pretty quotable, so I have to say I enjoyed the Other Guys even though it is an inconsistent movie that could have been funnier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Other Guys (2010): Dir: Adam McKay / Cast: Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Eva Mendes: Hilarious comedy about those unappreciated of us all. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play frustrated desk cops who yearn for bigger cases. They embark upon a case involving police corruption and fraud that lands them in position to prove themselves. Director Adam McKay's fourth collaboration with Ferrell who plays the desk cop with the hot wife and completely oblivious to it all. They both collaborated on Anchorman and Talladega Nights, both of which are quite funny. Wahlberg plays a hot head cop who cannot communicate socially. Both are often the brunt of jokes at the station but even worse is their inability to communicate with each other. We know that they will eventually prove themselves but the big surprise is the dealing with hot shot cops played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. They are celebrated cops who are involve in a massive action scene that opens the film. A chase scene is followed by recognition then another action scene that will take viewers totally by surprise in what ends up being a big laugh at a bad joke. Eva Mendes is adorably funny as Ferrell's "plain" wife who is supportive and sexy, oblivious to him but not to Wahlberg. While the film is one of the funniest of the year, it also stands up for those of us who have often been overlooked in life in favour of those who take their success for granted. End credits point out insight into what the underlining message regards and how those other guys often make bigger differences. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy Cop Bliss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buddy cop movies were invented in the 1980s, and prior to the release of this film, it had been a long gulf of years from the days of 48 Hrs and all that as comedic action fans waited for something new and worthy.It was a great irony that this film--and I can defend this opinion against all comers so easily that I might as well be serving in Ping-Pong--may be remembered as the greatest buddy cop film ever made. And that is precisely because it succeeds by reversing the formula, by flipping the figurative script. Will Ferrell is "Gamble" and Mark Wahlberg is "Hoitz." They aren't the best detectives in their precinct. They have disastrous chemistry as partners. Gamble is a lumbering, brainy, soft, sensitive oaf. Hoitz is what we imagine a mixed martial artist who secretly dreams about show tunes would be like. Repressed, lashing, confused. Their Captain, played by Michael Keaton, is so over the whole cop's life thing that he moonlights after hours selling scented candles.A lot like most of us, when bad guys roll into town and start blowing things up, Gamble and Hoitz are nobody's first choice to get the collar. But they draw the assignment, and all they have to work with to get the job done is each other (quite literally in Gamble's case, when he is denied permission to use an essential and basic tool of policework, for the common good). Hilarity ensues, and Steve Coogan, Ray Stevenson, Derek Jeter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Dwayne Johnson are along for the film's gut-busting, powder-kegged ride. Eva Mendes plays a role of special merit and thus merits special mention as the object of Gamble's (lawful) affections and of Hoitz's (unholy but almost unstoppable) cravings. The genre has not produced a better movie than The Other Guys. All those languishing scripts with 'Comic A' penciled in as a lead had better go back to the drawing board.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam McKay, director of Anchorman (2004) and Step Brothers (2008), collaborates with Will Ferrell for the third time in this uproariously hilarious action comedy flick. Will Ferell and Mark Wahlberg play Allen and Terry, a pair of undervalued New York City cops who did almost nothing more than work at their office all day. After the highly cops Danson (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) are killed on the line of duty, Allen and Terry decide to take the opportunity to step in the game and crack their first case. Alongside this hilarious duo stars a like able cats of Steve Coogan, Rob Riggle, and Damon Wayans Jr.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg starring opposite of each other may sound like an odd collaboration to many comedy fans. Surprisingly however, these two manage to pull it off and steal the show with near endless laughs and hilarity. These two made me laugh me countless times. Even after his previous works in Anchorman and Step Brothers, Adam McKay still manages to outdo himself with this guy-busting action comedy that never fails to bring on the laughter. The humor is often a mix of lowbrow one-liners and jokes dealing with police satire, with occasionally non-vulgar sex jokes here and there; and it always works. The characters know how to be funny without being overly vulgar and crude, which is good especially for those who do not bode well with raunchy R-rated sex humor. The action scenes here are pretty decent as well. They are never over-the-top or cheesy in any way, just good. Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, who play fellow cops of the main characters, and Steve Coogan who plays the criminal are quite funny too.The Other Guys is very entertaining, very funny, and a blast to watch. This is probably one of the best action comedies I've seen in a long time, and one of the Will Ferrell's best movies. Please watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I own this movie, but not because of gator.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't call this a good movie because of the pimp storyline. The action, the actors, Michael Keaton, and the filming of this movie were great... until they decided that they would make Will Ferrell's Character into an ex-pimp named gator.The problem I have with Will Ferrell is that he is genuinely funny, but he doesn't seem to think that he can carry a movie as a normal guy. HE CAN. He's exceptionally talented. Problem is, because he doesn't seem to understand this, he ends up doing things where he acts gross, fat, loud, and obnoxious. It wears the average person out.Gator is exactly what's wrong with this movie. Every other part works well until we have the story destroyed by this stupid idea. Just look at all of the other movies where Will Ferrell could have played the character straight and the movie would have been good, but he decided to go the stupid route and make the audience tired of his antics. If he did that in "Blades of Glory," He could have made it more fun. If he did it in Anchor Man, it would have had a bigger audience.I like this movie, but I fast forward past the gator story because it doesn't work and it detracts from the comedy and talents of all the other actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious intro, the rest was OK.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 15 minutes of the movie were perfect, it was interesting, smart and hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing my ass out. It was comedy gold.Afterwards, It became less interesting. It seemed as if they were writing the rest of the screenplay as they were filming. It was still funny, but just average comedy flick funny, not hysterically funny like the intro.The middle of the movie was a bit boring. The story was drifting a little.Great actors though, a handful of my favorite actors were in this film and it was epic. Mark Wahlberg, Will Ferrell, Micheal Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, and Patrick Warburton just to name a few.This movie had the potential to be one of the best comedies ever if the whole movie was as funny as the intro. Even better than 21 &amp; 22 Jump Street, but unfortunately, it played out differently.It ended OK. It was a shame it wasn't as hysterically funny as the intro, but it was still a pretty good movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really made me laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg make a great comedic team with too many LOL moments to mention (although that explosion and its aftermath just killed me). I can honestly say I might have laughed as much here as I did with 'Anchorman'.Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson give awesome (kickass) cameos as the hero cops (until they jump off a building that is) giving desk jockey's Ferrell and Wahlberg their moment to shine. The back up cast is great here too; Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes as Ferrell's wife. The fact that Ferrell isn't aware that his wife is beautiful is cleverly done. The Other Guys loses steam a bit towards the end but I'd watch this again and laugh. 07.13</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Th best buddy cop movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood turns to the police force for one of its main sources of comedy. Boy have they failed miserable most of the time. Luckily, there's one man named Adam McKay who knows how to pick and choose the elements to make a hilarious action comedy. Step one is to hire Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell to pitch dialogue so perfect, to argue with each other in a manner in which the sense tingle, and to burst the laughter out of you like a hurricane. Wahlberg and Ferrell are NYPD desk cops, who idolize the bad-ass cops like Samuel.L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, but never shine. Of course they get their chance, and when they do, boy do they have fun. We know where this story is going once the film opens. The grace of McKay's directing allows hardly any jokes to fall flat. The tow leads are glassy spot on, providing a silly good time. McKay spoofs the action genre whenever he gets without overdoing it. There's plenty of dumb shootouts, brotherhood issues between Wahlberg and Ferrell, and of course funny dialogue to change the routine situation you think you know. Certain scenes in this film are completely dominated by the audacious and grotesque behavior of Will Ferrell. I could have sworn he ad-libbed this film to polarize audiences with his sparkle. The chemistry between the two leads are a surprisingly fun combination. This story is familiar territoriality, however, we feel as if we're seeing the first buddy cop movie of the decade. For once, we get an authentic satire with just the right amount of every comedic attribute necessary to make one heck of an entertaining ride. Bring Advil for the pain your stomach will have due to laughter!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of this movie made me laugh so hard. Will Ferrell and Marky Mark should do another movie together...great chemistry. Sure the plot was a bit off, but who cares? If you want to watch a stupid fun movie that gets "Step Brothers type" out of control and outright WEIRD...you will enjoy this one. The Christineth scene and desk pop scenes are just so obscure and fun. Oh...and I love when Marky Mark comes over for dinner. OMG...I laughed so hard and I really appreciate a good laugh right now. My life is not the best and just one laugh makes my night after a long and bad day of work...so thank you Will and Marky Mark!! It is not a serious movie...it is off the wall comedy. Oh and great to see Michael Keaton in this too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a cast like this,there will be something for everyone. If you're looking for a serious gripping plot with an end game, forget this. Indeed the producers did a great job with the trailer, as, it perhaps has the best bits of the film in it. That said, there are some genuinely laugh out lines here to keep you amused. Will Ferrell has a knack of creating these over the top characters, sometimes to the point of making you cringe. But I would let this film wash over you, there are some great ideas here, but do leave you thinking "I wish they could of expanded that idea."The Other Guys won't win any awards, but it wont offend either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-spirited and amusing buddy-cop romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Other Guys" starts off as just another cop-buddy movie but, about a third of the way in, it suddenly finds its mojo and turns into a clever, frequently hilarious send-up of not only police procedurals but the whole corporate and bank bailout outrages of the past several years.The mismatched big-city detectives are played by Will Ferrall and Mark Wahlberg, the former a forensic accountant named Allen Gamble who prefers crushing numbers at his desk to crushing criminals on the streets, and the latter, a stereotypically gung-ho, trigger-happy hothead named Terry Hoitz, who's been busted down to an office clerk for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter at the ballpark, and who's chomping at the bit to get back to doing what he does best. Together, Allen and Terry mount an investigation into a billionaire (Steve Coogan) who's become the target of a corporate client (Anne Heche) to whom he owes a great deal of money."The Other Guys" could easily have been just another big-budget throwaway filled with lame comic set-ups and even lamer jokes. Instead, screenwriters Chris Henchy and Adam McCay (who also directed the film) have come up with a manic mixture of goofiness and near-surrealism that they have refined into a tasty comic brew. Most of the dialogue is sharp and witty, and the situations stop just short of all-out theater-of-the-absurd.Much of the success of the film can be attributed to the wonderful performances by the two leads, whose decidedly different acting styles complement one another so completely. Wahlberg's deadpan, "straight-man" restraint provides a perfect foil for Ferrall's more over-the-top comic outrageousness, and part of the joy lies in watching these two old pros find their rhythm and go with it. There's also a goodly number of "name" players in the supporting cast, including Eva Mendes as Allen's ultra-supportive "plain" wife, Sheila; Michael Keaton as the police captain who moonlights as a manager at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond; Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. as a pair of hyperkinetic, shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later cops (their brief scene at an elementary school career day is itself worth the price of admission); and Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson in cameo roles as a pair of super-charged, risk-taking detectives who take the phrase "let's hit the pavement" to a whole new, fatally literal level. And all are excellent.There's not much point in trying to look too deeply into "The Other Guys." Just sit back and enjoy watching big-budget Hollywood filmmakers get one right for a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It was amazing, but that's not the point!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The closing title sequence shows us brash, vibrantly decorated charts and graphs of infuriating information about ballooned CEO bonuses, billion-dollar bank bailouts, Ponzi schemes and other installments in the index of recent economic villainy. This is, to all intents and purposes, a leg-puller for a movie much different from the one that we've just seen. For a film that means to show righteous indignation at present-day capitalism, it is made unmistakably clear in every scene how bloated and over-the-top the film's budget is. Sometimes these scenes are done very well, like when Coogan keeps distracting Ferrell and Wahlberg by giving them tickets to shows, we see them briefly at this huge star-studded events that must've cost a million or so to get in the movie, then back to them determinedly returning to Coogan's office frustrated that he keeps distracting them. The point of the movie is almost to include as many stars, mammoth stunt and special effects sequences and locations as possible in an hour and fifty minutes. This also causes the movie to languish through tons of scenes that do nothing to move anything along. You could shake this movie for a long time before every fatty minute has fallen out.Its plot does include a deceitful equity-fund manager, played by the dependable British comic actor Steve Coogan, and a Wall Street heartbreaker, but the plot is neither the movie's purpose nor its most remarkable element. Rather, McKay plays to his comic strong suits and those of his recurrent on-screen collaborator, Will Ferrell. Simply put, The Other Guys is most genuinely itself when it coddles in a spontaneous but still closely controlled absurdity that has the upshot of dispersing, instead of stimulating, whatever real-world resentment or aggravation you may have. Once again, and for the first time in a while, Ferrell uses his narrow body, his spry impulses and his markedly transposable voice to sponge incongruent and ludicrous qualities into an untouched but somehow immediately representative comic character.Allen Gamble, Ferrell's easygoing, desk-bound police detective, lacks the self-important onslaught of Ron Burgundy or the down-home belligerence of Ricky Bobby. Rather, he's assertively, brazenly, uncompromisingly submissive, an explosive namby-pamby. Gamble is shy, naive, inexplicably irresistible to Eva Mendes and yet unmindful of their attention. He makes no sense whatsoever, save for in the ridiculous framework of the movie's zaniest scenes. Gamble's antithesis is Terry Hoitz, an inauspicious detective played by Mark Wahlberg, who seems like an irate leghorn beside Ferrell's timid emu. Indeed, the two of them provide a more colorful, if less lucid, animal allegory in one of the film's funniest scenes, a semantic quarrel in which lions dispute tunas for animal kingdom domination.When it functions in this senseless sector of dialogue riffing and unsubtle clowning, the most virtuoso instance of which is a fight at a funeral carried out in polite whispers, The Other Guys offers some pretty big laughs. The Rock and Sam Jackson send up their stock personas and then skip out to let Ferrell and Wahlberg take care of business. Then Ferrell and Wahlberg are generous enough to surrender some opportunity to Michael Keaton, as the gristly precinct captain, and to Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr., as Gamble and Hoitz's loathsome precinct competitors.It all pulsates along satisfactorily for about 45 minutes, with Mendes coming around for a teasing, good-humored turn as Gamble's wife, Wahlberg incredulous and Ferrell dismissing her charms. But The Other Guys tackles a genre merger that's basically a detracting commercial barricade. The Other Guys, despite the unfulfilled promise of the closing titles, beefs up potential that it has no actual penchant to meet. It may be that no one can shame the unashamed VIPs of the financial sector, but it would be pleasant to give Ferrell and Wahlberg a turn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aim For The Bushes... Definitely SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene early in The Other Guys that sets the tone for the rest of the film for me. Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson, playing over-the-top crime-fighting figures in New York City (that's where the title comes from--there are the ones who fight the crime and then there's the "other guys" who type up the reports...yeah, well), have been chasing some bad guys, who eventually escape, leaving the two stranded on a rooftop, still watching the action but seemingly too far away to be of any help. That's when the already-strained sense of plausibility takes a fatal turn; the two share a fateful glance, and then there is something said to the extent of..."know what I'm thinking?" "Yeah, aim for the bushes!" And they jump off the roof, into what seems like and endless drop, and, of course, there ARE NO BUSHES, and they hit the sidewalk with a tremendous plop. There you have it--crazy action premise, long execution, eventual thud.The humor is at times juvenile, repetitious and tedious, but it comes at you so fast that you have only time to process one line and move on to the next raunchy expression or bizarre reference. Will Ferrell was much more hilarious in Land of the Lost, but that's probably because he was propped up by the comic timing and madcap presence of Danny McBride. Here, Ferrell is paired with Mark Wahlberg, who looks painfully out of place in a zany comedy. The other big name stars handle their roles with as much aplomb as they can muster given the nature of their characters: Michael Keaton as the pedantic boss who moonlights at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond; Eva Mendes who suffers her husband's constant put-downs with grace and reserve, and Steve Coogan's corrupt billionaire who can never seem to do anything more than pout or smirk.The inconsistencies are so numerous they became a source of humor in their own right, in particular the state of the Red Prious after the accident with the crime scene and its many migrating bullet holes and cocaine smears.However, what I found especially tedious was Ferrell's distracting attempts at ad libbing. His many efforts to enhance a scene with random exhortations detracted from the physical humor, and his many nonsensical meanderings in his character's delivery put me off. The final after-credit scene where he seeks to scuttle Wahlberg's attempt to tell a joke ends with the same "thud" as the flight of Johnson and Jackson earlier in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising start which quickly descends into baffling film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began watching The Other Guys with hope this would be a good Ferrell comedy. Unfortunately, after a very promising opening 10 or 15 minutes this film very quickly descended into a confusing piece of cinema.Being a lover of action films, the first few minutes looked great. Yeah it's pretty cheesy, but honestly, watching Samuel L. Jackson fly through the air in his car and firing duel pistols whilst simultaneously delivering a great line made me smile.So, why is The Other Guys so disappointing? Sam Jackson and The Rock are by far, the best characters and I honestly believe if they had made this film so they were the protagonists then we'd have a whole different kettle of fish. We'd have a great action/comedy about two rock star cops who, unfortunately, aren't that smart. We'd have a good comedy blockbuster. Instead, these characters aren't explored nearly enough, which is massively disappointing.We're then introduced to Wahlberg and Ferrell. Interesting at first but after a while they become massively boring. I like Wahlberg a lot, he's not funny in this. He comes out with half-arsed one liners that really fall flat. And then there's Ferrell, who we all know can be a comedic wizard but instead his character is bland and tasteless. And the scenes with his wife, Eva Mendes (about whom several flimsy jokes are made about her being hot), are baffling. Really BAFFLING. They have no place whatsoever within the canon of the story. It's weird.There are some awful and useless characters with some awful casting decisions. Steve Coogan is puzzling as a throwaway character. As mentioned before, Eva Mendes is Ferrell's hot wife. Her scenes are truly perplexing. All of them. Especially the scene where they sing. Odd film making there... Anne Heche and Micheal Keaton are truly confusing. I have no idea why they are in this film.Ray Stevenson, an actor whom I'm particularly fond of and anyone who has seen Rome will probably agree, could have been such a good bad guy. But his role has no meat on it and instead he's just scenery. I was so dissatisfied not to see Sam Jackson, The Rock and Stevenson duel it out.The use of music is off. Just wrong. Someone needs to have a look at a certain Quentin Tarantino's use of sound with image for some pointers. There's a crazy bit where they get drunk and the director employs a great panoramic series of tableaux's depicting their descent into inebriation. Now that would have worked if it wasn't accompanied by a Fergie song. It just didn't flow.One of the main problems I have with this film is it could have been great. If they were making an action/comedy then Jackson and Johnson should have got the leads. If they wanted to make a serious cop film, then Wahlberg would have been perfect, his role in The Departed shows he's capable. The film actually looks great, it's shot very well and gives the overall polished look of a Scorcese film. But it's just rubbish, it's really really strange. The comedy doesn't flow, it's as if the film doesn't know it's a comedy. The actors sure as hell don't seem to be aware of it. The special effects switch between being really quite good to being cheap looking and ropey. The film makers need to review this film again, because I had no idea what they were trying to achieve. They used lots of techniques, blended lots of genres together and it was all unsuccessful.Oh yeah, there's a bizarre use of narration that comes in and out at random points. Makes no sense, just like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding the Other Mark Wahlberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When two outlandishly virile street cops are downed by their own hubris, the race is on to see which desk jockeys can step up as the next department heroes.The supercops are Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, on minimum screen time and maximum testosterone; taking satirical aim at the exact macho roles they've played all their lives.THE OTHER GUYS are Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), two desk cops with very differing ambitions - taciturn Allen is content with computer bureaucracy while the confrontational Terry wants to beat the street with a passion, imploring his superiors, "I'm a peacock - you gotta let me fly!" then usually kicking a desk and running out like a sobbing girl.As a dramatic actor, limited though he is, Mark Wahlberg kills Will Ferrell. As a comedian, limited though he is, Mark Wahlberg kills Will Ferrell. This movie should have just been called THE OTHER GUY (singular), as we watch Wahlberg elegantly steal it from right under Ferrell's nose. After his dramatic turns in THE DEPARTED, INVINCIBLE, SHOOTER, I swore I would disrespect him no more with references to Marky Mark, but in THE OTHER GUYS, Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg is once again Marky Mark to me - this time, not through lack of cred, but sheer respect as a world class comedian.The corporate corruption plot is secondary to the interplay and unlikely chemistry between Terry (Wahlberg) and Allen (Ferrell). We imagine Wahlberg would be the Straight Guy to Ferrell's Pratfaller, but he utterly commits himself to a role that is dry, petulant and unknowingly comical, based on a real world version of a damaged cop, but tweaked to absurdity.Stuck behind a desk for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter in the leg (he attends counseling for a bunch of testosterone junkies called Officers Who Fire Their Guns in the Line of Duty), Terry wants that one big street collar to shoot him into the ranks of supercop, while his ad hoc partner Allen opts for the mundanity of issuing warrants for scaffolding violations. Terry despises Allen's passivity: "If I was a lion I would attack you and eat you even if you weren't in my food chain. If you were a tuna, I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and attack you!" Eventually, Terry forces Allen at gunpoint to take a street call with him. On the way to the call (in Allen's little red Prius), Terry ramps up to "do some damage" while Allen ramps up by sticking in a Little River Band CD, which incenses Terry, "I feel like I'm in Wal-Mart shopping for a training bra." Coincidentally, following the scaffolding violation leads them to a massive investment scheme fraud, led by conman David Ershon (Steve Coogan), who finds he can distract the two cops easily from arresting him by giving them tickets to stage musicals - at which they realize they've been duped usually halfway through the productions, which they admit are highly enjoyable nonetheless.Michael Keaton is the frazzled police chief, with the secondary job at Bed Bath and Beyond to pay for his son's transgender operation (watch the Special Features for an old-school Keaton ad-lib scene as the Bed Bath manager); Anne Heche looks very heterosexually female as a corporate bitch; Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr. are vying for the supercop roles.THE OTHER GUYS kicks into high gear when Terry meets Eva Mendes as Allen's wife, which Allen has been describing as a battleaxe. She appears with ta-tas on high beam, apologizing for interrupting them, and while Allen won't stop criticizing her for dressing like a hobo and barging in, Terry's jaw drops as he asks her, "Who are you?" "I'm Allen's old lady." Terry smirks to Allen, "No seriously, who is that?" Wahlberg never overplays the infatuated gazes and unmitigated dismay at Allen having such a shapely spouse. And then to discover all Allen's exes are as hot - Wahlberg's boyish astonishment is a riot, considering he has ripped through more panty than Ferrell and the rest of the cast combined.Terry's ballerina ex-girl is also hot; she's Jenna Haze lookalike Lindsay Sloane, so it's ironic Terry accuses her of being a stripper. This time, it's Allen's turn to be surprised as Terry displays some fine ballet prowess, which Terry disclaims, "We learned to dance that way to show the other guys how queer they looked." "You learned to dance sarcastically?" Wahlberg's casting in THE OTHER GUYS was the same reason Jeff Daniels was cast opposite Jim Carrey in DUMB AND DUMBER - with a "straight man," expectations would be low. DUMB AND DUMBER's counter-intuitive casting only elevated the main comedian - THE OTHER GUYS' casting destroyed the main comedian.The Other Guys become the heroes they aspire to be by dismantling a Ponzi scheme in a manner no Ponzi scheme has probably ever been dismantled before - with slow motion bullets while diving like supercops, and in outlandish car chases.So the outro credits are very interesting indeed: text screens and graphs outline all those outrageous American Bailout details that the media long ago decided they can't do anything about because no one cares enough, so no one talks about (except Matt Taibbi); salary ratios of CEOs to average workers; how much could have been paid to every man, woman and child in America on the 700 billion dollar bailout; ratios of the super-rich to super-poor, leaving no middle class existent... The most sobering outro credits you will ever read.Longtime Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay directs, but considering he also directed STEP BROTHERS and TALLEDEGA NIGHTS, I'm going to credit this movie's hilarity to that other guy - Marky Mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, an enjoyable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Other Guys" is a film that perhaps works better as a whole than as a comedy or action flick. It stars Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell as two cops with totally different styles who try to climb their way up the police rankings. When an opportunity to make themselves noticed arrives, the two will have to set their differences aside and collaborate in order to solve the new case.This film brings nothing new in terms of comedy, but there are surely moments that will make you laugh. The problem is that these moments alternate with some where the story simply stagnates, moments that are not particularly funny. I had the impression that the director envisioned the film in two totally different ways and not knowing which one was better, he decided to mix them together. "The Other Guys" is also an action movie and the action scenes are pretty well made for this kind of film. It is silly, but that's the way it was meant to be and from this perspective the film reaches its objective. Also, when you put the comedy and the action in the balance you will find that the result is actually satisfying. Wahlberg and Ferrell make an OK couple here, their chemistry is not great, but you can't blame them for not trying. As for the other actors, I liked Michael Keaton's role (he is such an underrated actor) and thought that Steve Coogan was good in his part as well.Despite not being that funny, "The Other Guys" compensates with its good action scenes and above average acting. While it feels that the result could have been better, this is a quite entertaining flick and it is still worth a look.My rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts off great with The Rock and Sam Jackson playing the bad $ss cops getting all the bad guys while creating explosions and lots of damage. Then they jump off a building and are out of the rest of the movie. I think this movie would have been better if those 2 had been in the entire film. So after they are gone, we have the other guys. Will Ferrell, is Allen, a police accountant happy with paper work and Mark Wahlburg, is Terry, known as the guy whom shot Jeter. The movie has got laughs but they sort of get more silly and less funny as the movie plods along. Like is it really that funny that Terry still can't believe Allen has such a hot wife.FINAL VERDICT: If you like silly comedies and Will Ferrell, check it out. I thought it was OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misfiring comedy that never manages to rise above average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning New York cops Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Hoitz (Mark Whalberg) have been pushed to the sidelines doing office bound duties, while other cops seemingly hog all the glory. While Gamble manages to keep a lid on his pent up frustration and settles into the mundanity of his life, Hoitz can barely wait to get out and get kicking some ass. But things look like they might be about to change for them, when an explosive new assignment comes up involving corporate espionage and multi national gangs.Just what we all needed, another light hearted satire of big budget Hollywood action flicks that thinks it can out shine the previous one before it. It's fitting that the lead character's name is Gamble, because that's exactly what the studios take when they churn out another one of these cookie cutter type flicks. And while The Other Guys isn't a completely dud bet, you can certainly think of better such films of recent times.With Ferrell in the lead role, it's safe to say he's the one mainly carrying the film and, always being a comedian who verges on the edge of annoying with me, here he comes dangerously close to the danger zone at times. Former rap star Whalberg has more presence in support as the tougher, more aggressive cop, but the main focus should be on laughs, and while there are one or two scenes that give the ribs a good tickle, it's generally a pretty bland, laugh free outing. It's not helped with the lack of a really coherent plot, which comes more noticeable more to the end of the film when there really seems to be a loss of any kind of narrative and it really seems to just drag on. There's some notable support from the likes of Michael Keaton and Steve Coogan, as well as cameos from people like Samuel L Jackson and Jamie Foxx, but, of course, it feels no less empty.For a film about men pushed to the sidelines, it's sadly fitting that in the long run that's probably the fate that will befit it just the same. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was home sick a few months ago and ended up renting this through the on demand on cable. I'm a Will Ferrell fan but haven't been impressed with a lot of his movies lately where he's the main character but love him in Old School, etc. I like Mark Walberg but not as a lead actor in most cases. He seems to be better behind the scenes now. I figured I'd take a chance and try it out to pass some time but ended up turning it off near the end, uninterested in seeing anymore crap acting, horrible story lines, non- humor, etc. Very disappointing movie and not ever worth a rental on a rainy Sunday afternoon unless you want to use it to ignore and fall asleep with sound on in the background. I still don't know what the hell they were thinking making a crap movie like this. Another example of how Hollywood can put some A list actors in a movie and not worry about the script. Hopefully this will help people save 2 hrs and a few bucks and spend the time and money elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Other Guys is a little unusual movie. Starts out with a bang when detectives Danson and Highsmith go in a action filled high speed pursuit of some small time crooks. Danson and Highsmith are the heroes of the town, and when they get killed in their next case, they leave a big hole in the department. Detectives Hoitz and Gamble intend to fill that hole. Problem is that they don't know how. Gamble is a desk jockey and Hoitz always makes some critical error, still the laughing stock of the force since he shot Derek Jeter at the stadium.But since the adrenalin filled start the movie doesn't seem to know where to go. It got a good start, a good idea, and a good story to tell. But it doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind as to how. For a few minutes it's a comedy, then it turns into an action, then back to comedy, and so forth. It is never able to combine the two, it never get to be an action comedy. It got some good action, a few very good jokes, but most of the time it just feels a little off. It is nearly there, but misses its mark.It got a great cast as well, but Ferell and Wahlberg doesn't really work out as a pair. Part of that is intentional, but it makes the story stutter, it never gets into an flow. Actually the movie was much better as long as Jackson and Johnson still was around as Highsmith and Danson.It had its points though, but only average for action and entertainment in all.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting combination of lame and seriousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't consider it a great movie. Storyline is weak, and full of lame jokes, which eventually make you give up laughing. It appears that lot of money was spent on actions (mainly, destroying things).There was something interesting happening throughout the movie, which prevented me from turning it off. Every time when I get annoyed by one of Allen's lame jokes, I can see Terry is also annoyed by it. So, I hold on my thoughts. That is a pretty interesting combination of lame and seriousness which holds the movie to its obvious ending.There is a bit of audience cheating going on as well. Jackson and Johnson opened the movie with heavy action, and just vanished in thin air, after 10 minutes, without even a proper excuse! (Similar to how Seagal vanished in Executive Decision 1996).You won't regret watching it, but not something you want to show to a friend to impress him/her on your movie selection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good start runs out of gas early - an opportunity missed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys showed enough promise early that I thought it could have been so much better than it turned out to be. I blame Ferrell, The Other Guys could have been a minor classic if only they went for An Other Guy.Sam Jax and The Rock are Supercops, the kind that shoot first and get someone else to ask questions later. The kind that revel in the thrill of the chase: even if it causes millions of dollars in property damage in order for them to issue a parking ticket. The kind of guys that get all the hot sex and are invited to celebrity parties...You know - Movie cops. In short they are better than you...And everyone you know...In every way.Allen (Will Ferrell) and Terry (Marky-Mark Wahlberg) are not Supercops. They aren't even very good regular cops. They are the guys who fill in the paperwork and file the reports for the Supercops so they can get to the premiere on time. They are the guys who... no that's it. That's basically all they do, fill in forms. Allen is actually happy to do what he does and has no aspirations greater than staying behind his desk, Terry basically detests Allen for his contentment and yearns for a return to the field and "real" police work. I say "return" as he was once a beat cop until an unfortunate incident with a celebrity (it's a movie, it has to be a celebrity so the audience can go "Oh my god it's really that guy" and so the celeb can get an IMDb credit) saw him busted to a desk job.Michael Keaton is the boss of the unit, his job is largely to coddle the egos of the Supercops and make sure everyone else doesn't get delusions of grandeur and sticks to the form filling and coffee making.The early scenes are quite funny, Sam Jax and The Rock obviously have a blast overplaying their roles and hamming it up bad 80s buddy-cop movie style, the action sequences are fast and frenetic and occasionally inspired. I especially liked the wrecking ball scene. Mark Wahlberg is funny as the almost-straight man and Will Ferrell is mostly tolerable. I've read that Wahlberg's "surprising comedic turn" is refreshing and welcome. Hasn't anyone seen: I Heart Huckabees? An underwhelming film but he was the best thing in it. Three Kings? A great film that was funnier than given credit, and Wahlberg was himself very funny at times. Date Night? Again a lousy film but he was good in his brief scenes. The Happening? That was a comedy right? Right? RIGHT? Surely!Wahlberg might play the so-called straight guy but in doing so and actually acting a little bit he provides most of the best laughs in the film.Ferrell is allegedly the "funny guy", but he only has two personas, calm Ferrell and zany Ferrell. Calm-Ferrell is underplayed and always says ridiculous things - only in a deadpan and totally serious manner. Zany-Ferrell is the one who always gets his pants off regardless of the situation and yells every line especially when it would seem inappropriate to do so. Zany-Ferrell is also well known for his bizarre descriptions and wacky sayings and phrases; "A whale's labia" and such.I loathe Zany-Ferrell. So the fact that in this film he is Calm-Ferrell is a bonus, but Calm-Ferrell is equally annoying after a while. For example the biggest running joke in the film is that Allen's wife - played by Eva Mendes in full on "Hot" mode - is continually referred to as his "ball and chain", and put down as being ugly and plain. On the first meeting this is funny, as Terry gets to express his astonishment that dull old Allen has scored such a smokin' hot and friendly wife.The "Old Ball &amp; Chain" - Seriously. That's what they call her in the film... often. The 37th time... not so much.Ferrell is allowed to indulge in his uber-serious and oblivious to all common sense sincerity way too many times, he has multiple patented speeches that ramble on into pointlessness and the less I think about his "Gator" pimp persona the less pills I have to take to stop the voices in my head from screaming.All that and I haven't spoken of the plot!The Supercops messed up. The Other Guys are unwittingly drawn into the investigation when they arrest a billionaire banker (Steve Coogan - Usually hilarious but wasted here) on a technicality.Despite all involved ordering them to stay out of the situation Allen and Terry follow up and uncover something much bigger and more sinister and must see there way to solving the case. Along the way of course they end up stepping into the Supercop's shoes and performing tasks and feats that would make 80s Arnie proud.Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's "ugly" wife... Wow now that I write that maybe it is hilarious? No, wait. It really isn't.The cold hard fact is that the first half of this film was very good, the second half proves a total let down. The jokes in the second half just seem lazy or recycled and revisited from the first 40 minutes. The frustrating thing is that overall there are some really good jokes and ideas in between the crap and Ferrell's self-indulgence.I think it's fair to place the blame for "what might have been" squarely at the feet of one Will Ferrell.Final Rating - 5.5 - 10. The fact that there have been precious few decent buddy cop comedies in recent years means that the promising elements here are all the more disappointing. An opportunity missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny but just during a few minutes of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie revolves around two cops, each with his own issues from the past, trying to step up from total losers to top notch cops. The movie was too slow for my taste, with not enough chemistry between the characters (but not the actors). The directing is decent, the acting also but it doesn't really work.I watched this with my wife, and she fell asleep half way through. I endured it to the end, hoping it would be worth it. I was disappointed. Although the movie boasts two good actors in comic roles, it somehow falls into all the classic old jokes that are just not that funny anymore. Also, something in the script is just off regarding the humor in it. I did laugh hard a few times, but that was too few (twice). If a friend would ask me, I'd tell him to invest his or her time on something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying that I am a fan of Will Ferrel's movies. I liked Elf, Stepbrothers, Anchorman, Talledega Nights and his SNL skits. But The Other Guys, in my opinion, was, simply put, a bad, unfunny film.I really tried to like this movie. I tried to find the laugh-out-loud humour that I saw in Stepbros and Anchorman, but it simply wasn't there. Maybe I should watch it again (IN CASE I DO, CONSIDER THIS MY FIRST OPINION). The movie got off to a promising start, with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson making me laugh in every scene that they were in. And Ferrel's naive character along with Wahlberg's insecure character gave me high hopes. But, as the film progressed, it was painfully clear that they were always mere inches away from a great punchline, but you soon realized that they had already said the punchline, and the "funny" joke was finished. However, the acting was good; there were no poor performances. It's just that their dialogue was unfunny.I'll sum it up like this: if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the funny parts. End of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely write a review because I do believe that everybody is intituled to their own opinion. There for people should see movies and then decide if they enjoyed them or not. Nobody should base their decision to see a movie on a review. That being said I must say to all the people who read this review: do not watch this movie! It's a complete waist of time and nerves. Yes, it might be fun, if you're 10 years old and you missed all the good Jackie Chan movies and the Lethal Weapon series or if you enjoy expired jokes made by some formerly known as great actors. The story is flat, the acting is as bad as it can get and the jokes, ohh the jokes, are simply...old. Nothing special, nothing funny. Anyway I rated this movie 3/10 because I didn't enjoyed it at all, but I've seen worse. I can't remember now, half an hour after the movie, anything special in it. Put your time to better use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>jusco's review: The Other Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't watch a lot of comedies. This isn't because I dislike the genre; no, it's quite the contrary, but the problem is that the number of bad comedies easily outnumber the number of good ones. A good comedy must be well-written, well-timed, well-acted and well-delivered (refer to: Little Miss Sunshine and Hot Fuzz). So I was extremely and pleasantly surprised at how funny The Other Guys was. I deliberately skipped it in cinemas but since it was the one film on the airplane I still hadn't seen, I gave it a try and found myself laughing from start to finish.The plot: two police officers, Detective Allen and Detective Terry, are the losers and laughing stock of their colleagues. Receiving no respect from the other officers, they are left dealing with paperwork. But when they stumble upon an opportunity to prove their worth, 'the other guys' step up to the challenge to show that they can actually accomplish something.Two things stood out.First, Will Ferrell's performance. I have to admit I hadn't seen very many of Will Ferrell's films, but I got a glimpse of his brilliant acting in Stranger Than Fiction, one of his few serious roles which he executed superbly. He does it again in this film. I now see why he's labeled as one of the leading comic actors around (though I'd have to watch his other films to be able to confidently state that fact). Mark Wahlberg's performance was refreshing as well, though he wasn't up to Will Ferrell's standard.But what was undeniably holding the film together was the script ? a round of applause for Chris Henchy and Adam McKay, the scriptwriters. The dialogue was pure comedy and solidly written. It's not rare to happen upon a comedy that runs entirely on one-liners and bursts of short comical scenes, but it's rare for it to work. Since when does an argument involving tunas devouring lions on land by constructing breathing apparatuses with kelp become so hilarious? If you get a chance, watch it. I guarantee you'll be laughing your head off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell team up for a pretty good cop comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We are going to have sex in your car! It will happen again!"Highsmith and Danson (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) are the super-cops. The ones that always get the bad guy, can do no wrong, and basically turn any situation into an action movie (I'd love to see an actual cop flick starring those two). But when they're out of the picture and &nbsp;(due to some pretty hilarious circumstances), it's time for the other guys to step up and investigate some massive financial crimes in the heart of NYC.&nbsp;Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg)&nbsp;is a disgraced and despised former hotshot cop (you shoot Derek Jeter and that tends to happen) who's paired with Gamble (Will Ferrell), a desk jockey who prefers pushing paperwork to busting perps. The chemistry between the two works pretty well, which is important, given that half the humor of this movie comes from those two yelling funny comments at each other. That leads to some funny dialogue, but it also makes this have a sort of haphazard feel, at time. Like some of the scenes have nothing to do with the overall story, they're just stuck in to show Ferrell and Wahlberg being wacky. That's not a huge complaint, but it did pop up fairly often.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;an action comedy, so it's important that both parts of that equation are at least decent. I have no complaints about the action half, as there are plenty of car chases and shoot-outs sprinkled liberally from beginning to end. And the comedy aspect is pretty good too, as long as you're a fan of the usual Ferrell/McKay brand of humor. Some of the jokes fall flat, but I thought the movie got funnier as it went along. There were some scenes that were flat-out hysterical, and some recurring jokes just kept getting better. Especially the flashbacks to Gamble's college alter-ego "Gator" and the way Eva Mendes' character is constantly referred to as plain and not very attractive.I wouldn't put The Other Guys ahead of Ferrell's best movies, like Anchorman and Talladega Nights, but I did enjoy it. The cast is really impressive, and it throws so many jokes at you, that at least some are bound to stick. You probably don't even need my review to decide if you'll like this. &nbsp;If you think Will Ferrell is funny, check it out. If you can't stand him, The Other Guys won't change your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Action Comedy... but the End Credits???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys opens with its narrator Ice T introducing the hook-you characters, super-cops Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as NYPD officers Highsmith and Danson. With their witty banter and a hot '70's Chevelle SS they manage to fly said vehicle into a tour bus in pursuit of criminals. With the Chevelle skewering the middle of the bus, Danson somehow takes over as bus driver and with a flip sideways launches the bus and the once-again airborne Chevy into the path of the criminals and their SUV. Of course Highsmith is still in the Chevelle and he is firing two guns through the disintegrated windshield at the gunmen as his vehicle crashes over the SUV and into a building. It's quite the elaborate stunt, but a waste of a nice vintage Chevy and ultimately costs the City of NY $12 million dollars in damages. Despite the negatives everyone at the press conference cheers because Danson mentions "New York City" and a hot-dog street vendor offers free hot dogs for life.Shortly thereafter, the super-cop duo finds themselves on the roof of a tall building looking down in pursuit of other criminals who had just robbed a jewelry store. Unfortunately the crooks had just severed the zip line they used to descend to street level for a quick getaway. Undaunted, our heroes run to the building's edge and leap off hoping to land on some shrubbery that is apparently not there.Following some shenanigans at the funeral, the deaths of Highsmith and Danson lead to an opening for the other guys, a new super-cop team, and misfit Detectives Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) and Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) eventually fill that role. At first, Gamble, a somewhat naive forensic accountant, is quite content to do the paperwork but very reluctantly gets roped into doing actual police work by his spirited and angry partner Hoitz who rants that he's a peacock who must be allowed to fly! Wahlberg's character Terry Hoitz was assigned to desk duty for having shot Derek Jeter in the leg during the 7th game of the World Series where he worked the security tunnel, hence his co-workers gave him copious grief and dubbed him "The Yankee Clipper." It is obvious from the get-go that Hoitz hates his partner Gamble and tells him so in no uncertain words. The pair also gets into a metaphorical lion vs. tuna debate, which Hoitz loses and then proceeds to dump hot coffee on Gamble's chest.The Police Captain, Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton) acts like a referee keeping order amongst his joke cracking staff. Mauch works a second job as a manager at Bed Bath and Beyond to put his bisexual son through college. His character lends a bit of sense and stability to this somewhat chaotic action comedy.The plot revolves around Lendl Global Consortium, whose head consorter and CEO is David Ershon played by the semi-likable Steve Coogan. Ershon and Lendl Global are having no trouble losing big money provided by all sorts of domestic and foreign investors. But Ershon has big plans about where to get the money to pay his investors back with interest. Of course all this is highly illegal and that's where our new super-cops come in.The Other Guys contains some very comedic car chases with Allen Gamble's red Prius serving up the laughs. Furthermore, Gamble's Prius is violated more than once by Dirty Mike and his pals who debauch the Prius using it as their own portable love shack.Eva Mendes plays Dr. Sheila Gamble, Allen's wife. There is a humorous scene when Allen brings his partner home for dinner and introduces the sexy Sheila as his "old ball &amp; chain." Hoitz's reaction is something like "No?who is it really!" Allen proceeds to belittle his wife with other degrading cliché comments to Hoitz's befuddlement as Sheila just grins and laughs it off.Overall I found The Other Guys quite funny and entertaining. It contains some slapstick but is not as sophomoric as some of Ferrell's previous films like Blades of Glory, or Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. The dialog and comedic set-ups are a notch up from Ferrell's previous efforts in my view. That said be warned that crude sexual references and language abound.The bottom line is The Other Guys is an entertaining film and worth watching. I give it 3.2 out of 5 stars but I do have one bone to pick. In the closing credits, facts about recent financial troubles in the USA are graphically illustrated in color. We are shown what a Ponzi scheme is and told that the Madoff/AIG bailouts cost taxpayers (you and me) 883 billion dollars. According to the graphs this amounts to $2,258 for every man, woman, and child in the US. Further, after AIG and the banks were bailed out, the 73 top executives received a total of 1.2 billion dollars in bonuses from the bailout funds. If that were not enough, the average yearly income for top financial executives rose to 11.8 million dollars over the past decade. And the ratio of the CEO's salary to that of average employees was shown as 319 to 1.I'm not sure what the film-maker's motives were for this blatant display of financial abuses as it was not directly related to the movie. But it did wipe the smile off my face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How not to write comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off Ferrel is a hit or miss actor, he can be excellent or just stupid, so I guess I mostly blame Adam McKay for this poor execution. And Wahlberg should just stay away from comedy.When writing comedy for film there are two things you do not do. You do not explain the joke and you do not telegraph the joke. Doing this will spoil the joke. If you are a professional writer you should know this. These basic concepts are constantly broken with each and every joke in this movie. It's over the top, but in a bad way. All I could hear was "This is a joke. We are being funny. Please laugh when the sign that says 'Laugh Now' lights up."When you are pointing out the fact that you are trying to be funny. You are insulting the intelligence of the audience. Let the watcher decide if your joke is funny or not."This was a smart idea..." Yes, we got the pun already. ha. ha. If I think the joke was bad or did not get it, let it pass. I might find the next joke funny. Don't hit me over the head with it. The movie also has the bad taste to beat dead horses. Jokes that where mildly amusing at best the first time around where repeated, often several times. The second time you know it's going to be a running joke and the third and so on,then it's just painful. Comedy is supposed to be spontaneous, take you off guard and if it's also witty, then it really hits home. This movie does neither.What really boggles me though is after sitting through this movie, getting increasingly bored by it at a steady pace. It ends with a political statement. After the movie goes out of it's way to make sure I can't take it seriously, even as a comedy. It then has the audacity to try and make a point. By then I couldn't care less about anything coming from this movie. It had already lost my attention.I have only two possible explanations for this movie. Either it was written by an amateur, or the entire movie is a scriptwriters inside joke. Realizing this is the writer/director behind stepbrothers, which was stupid, but at the same time undeniably hilarious. I know he can do better, so I have to conclude it's a stumbling attempt at the later.**Minor spoiler** It was clear already from the two super-cops that the movie tries to poke fun at the genre, but it really got to me with the explosion scene. It's so overplayed and the point is so painfully obvious that it simply does not work. Everyone knows (ok a few people might not, IE. children) that Hollywood physics are laughable. It's one thing to spoof that, but it's another to drag on about it. You are undoing the punchline of your own joke. And don't get me started on the final shootout scene, it's not even worth bothering with. **End spoiler**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Other GuysThere are two kinds of cops. Those that protect taxpayers from bad guys. And those that put on their siren just so they can go through a red light.Fortunately, the flatfoots in this action-comedy are the former. Unfortunately, they've never had the chance to prove it.Living in the shadow of the forces' top cops (Dwayne Johnson, Samuel L. Jackson), the paper pushing detective Gamble (Will Ferrell) and his halfcocked partner Det. Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) finally get their chance.But while Hoitz is hell-bent on cracking skulls, Gamble is more interested in cracking down on building infractions, which, auspiciously, leads to a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme involving the police retirement fund.With an equal balance of firearms and funny lines, this fourth collaboration between director Adam McKay and Will Ferrell ranks among their best.However, to truly be top cop, one must first survive a round of taser tag.

		<fullReview>I was sure that Inception was going to go for 4 weeks in a row on top but The other Guys topped them with 35 million.Holy crap this movie was awesome. I did not expect anything to come from this film because of the fact that Will Ferell had lost his touch in film for a while. With his streak of terrible movies I thought the streak would continue. This movie was more funny than Dinner for Schmucks, Step Brothers, but not as funny as the Hangover or Hot Tub Time Machine.I was particularly happy for two reasons one, my favorite wrestler of all time is Dwayne Johnson, and that they used the song "My Hero" by the Foo Fighters, those were just two little kicks for me.Not going to spoil the movie but basically Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) and Alan Gamble (Will Ferell) are detectives who hate each other, but through out the film they learn to co-exist. This is like any typical cop comedy, but this one packs in all the punches and jokes. Anyways 7 out of 10 stars on my part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promised more than it delivered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Adam McKay again teams up with Will Ferrell in this action comedy about two New York detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and his partner Terry Hoitz (played by Mark Wahlberg). The pair are the joke of the precinct given Gamble is a forensic accountant with an aversion for action, and Hoitz is the butt of jokes having been involved in an infamous shooting incident. They live in the shadow of the precinct's two hero hot-shot cops, hilariously over-played by Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, but Hoitz wants he and his annoying partner to step-up instead of just being the "other guys". Fans of Will Ferrell will probably like his performance. His awkward, irrational brand of humor is here. He has some great dialog where he goes off onto his trademark long-winded tangents in the middle of conversations. But I think Mark Wahlberg steals the show. He is a surprisingly good comic actor and his irrationally angry and resentful character actually provides some of the movies funnier moments. The supporting cast includes Eva Mendez as Gamble's under-appreciated wife, and Michael Keaton as the Captain. I have to say I was really looking forward to this movie but I was a little disappointed. The jokes in The Other Guys are a little hit and miss. Some of the humor is almost weird at times, so it will definitely not suit all tastes, and unfortunately most of the best bits are in the trailer. With the actions scenes and a great cast thrown in it provides enough entertainment to keep you interested, but you could probably wait until it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

A decent success at the box office and some positive reviews made up for it's makers.'The Other Guys' is about 2-under-rated cops, who take charge after their legendary seniors die. The film works because of the chemistry between it's lead cast. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg's on-screen chemistry is indeed brilliant. Ferrell rips it up as a comical, dumb but efficient cop, while Wahlberg shines as the no-non-sense cop.Among other performances, Michael Keaton delivers a superb performance as the Captain. Eva Mendes as Ferrell's sultry wife does very well. Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson are alright in cameos, while Steve Coogan seems to be in decent form.Adam McKay's direction relies on it's lead cast, who have truly helped him out, in this one-time watch.

		<fullReview>So you got THE Guys who without sense jump from a god damn roof aiming for the bushes and you got the OTHER Guys who are similar in actions to the dumbest cops in the world (but if the other guys are the dumbest cops in the world well what makes THE guys be?). Sounds fun? Maybe, maybe not... But here's the deal: one of them, career wise, is a complete failure wanna-be and the other guy is a sore loser which gets laid every night thanks to the most gorgeous woman on the planet I may add. Sounds hilarious enough? Oh wait! Not at all... the story of these two "dudes" characters it's the same as each story about two other wanna-be detectives who are trying to become the best cops: they do stupid things, they fail in almost each move they make but still, at the end, they get the girl and the fame... now ain't that sweet? Honestly, this movie is full of clichés but it had, I must admit, some real funny moments... At least it was to a certain point entertaining...The casting was so and so. You have Dwayne Johnson aka "The Rock" and Samuel L Jackson thrown in the movie just to sell some tickets but in fact you only get one of the "not-so-good" (let's not call it "the worst") actors of the moment, Mark Wahlberg and you got a classic comedian, Will Ferrel, which was the only good male choice. He acted so well as a nerdie loser type of cop I almost enjoyed pretty much each scene with him. The best female part goes easily to Eva Mendes, not only that she looked hot but she is a better actress than most of these "Hollywood Models".The film was shot pretty good, you got a stop-motion scene which was really cool till I realize you have Black Eyed Peas as soundtrack... Then again, the soundtrack was in the same tone with the movie... Hilarious... Overall, the movie is watchable, enjoyable, fun, ridiculous at points... It's entertaining if you look for a movie that does exactly that... I mean as a comedy it makes you deliver some laughs but otherwise it's just average...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is like a peacock, you gotta let it fly to like it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, don't take this movie too serious, as you'll find yourself, not enjoying it. It's one of the those good popcorn fun, films. The Other Guys is one of the funniest buddy cop movies, I ever saw. Directed by Adam McKay, this action comedy really did work, because it lampoons and satire the Buddy Cop clichés to pieces. The Other Guys focus on two New York City police detectives Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) whom been office pencil pushers for years. When the station's two tops cops P.K Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) &amp; Chris Danson (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson), catastrophic met their end. The two are forced to step up and go after a giant corporate embezzlement case. I have to say, this is one of Will Ferrell's best roles. He wasn't annoying, or over the top. I think, when he's playing the character, with the deadpan straight-laced delivery. It's the best. Yes, he was bit abusive to his wife, (Eva Mendes), but it was play off as laughs. It was too disturbing, not to chuckle. I love how cool and collected, he was for the most part. I love the running gag about him, holding a wooden gun, and his misadventures with 'Dirty Mike and the boys'. Mark Walberg's character is bit bitter &amp; whinny, but the character development, however, does help make him, likable by the end of the movie. Plus, most of his whinny complains were pretty funny. I love his lion eating tuna and peacock needing to fly, speech. Dwayne the Rock Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson's roles, while short was pretty damn entertaining. Steve Coogan is just as funny as the main cast as the supporting character, corrupt multi-billionaire David Ershon. He's so disarming and charming that he's hard not to like. I even like Bed, Baths and Beyond, Captain Mauch (Michael Keaton) who plays a mellow out Police Chief. I love Eva Mendes as Gamble's wife. She is stunning and beautiful. Wish, they had more of her in the film. I can do without Rob Riggie as Martin and Damon Wayans Jr as Fosse. They really don't bring anything to the table. The movie was less funny, when they were around. The movie has a lot of dumb jokes that was mostly a hit for me. Still, the movie was able to be smart enough to be taken serious. The whole Ponzi scheme plot was pretty interested. I like how the end credits are accompanied by with a series of visual displays of the magnitudes, methods, and principal actors of various licit and illicit financial doings of the financial crisis, such as the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, Goldman Sachs, AIG or the Troubled Asset Relief Program. A lot of good information, that people need to know. There is an outtake between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg at the restaurant plays after the end credits. Without spoiling it, the ending of the unrated version is just over the top though. The unrated version is just not as funny as the normal movie. Some of the movie was brilliant shot. I love the jump to the bushes scenes, and all the bullet time. Most of all, I love the drinking montage. What an unusual version. Instead, of than a time-compression montage, there's a fake continuous shot in which the camera weaves through the slow-mo antics going on over the course of the evening at the bar. It was pretty damn impressed. The action scenes were pretty cool to watch. I love all the shootouts and car chases. It was funny, when the store explore, and how the characters react to it. I didn't mind all the product placements in the film. After all, this movie did introduced me to the musical, 'Jersey Boys' which was awesome. Great use of establish songs, ranging from Foo Fighters 'My Hero" to Black Eyes Peas 'Imma Be'. I also love the TLC references as a running gag. My favorite is Rage against the Machine in the end credits. I like all the celebs cameos in the film, ranging from Derek Jeter to Brooke Shields. Overall: This peacock sure can fly. It really was a good time film.You've seen the good guys and the bad guys, now go see 'The Other Guys'</fullReview>

Disguising this as "comedy." Hypocrisy. And, people keep buying into it.And, like others have mentioned, the movie was disjointed by "fixing" all of the conflict quickly at the end (Keaton). Keaton is adamant about not helping throughout the entire movie, then, all of a sudden, he's all in?! The scene where Jackson and Johnson jumped to their death was ludicrous and never resolved (not that it mattered - the entire movie was like this).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Other Guys" refers to, of course</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Other Guys" refers to, of course, the detectives who rarely get a piece of the archetypal cops-and-robbers shenanigans that are frequently seen in action movies or on "Law &amp; Order". They remain mainly at their desks doing paperwork, something almost never seen in movies. Ferrell is Allen Gamble, who is somewhat content with managing case work on his computer, and Wahlberg is the far more forceful and ambitious Terry Hoitz.Their characters are in sharp contrast to the cops that Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson portray in this film (and definitely in other films). Although Jackson and Johnson were also funny here, I hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie. It would have been more exciting if the audience didn't expect them when they stepped into the theaters. Then again, that is the fault of whomever marketed this film, not the filmmakers themselves.When Allen and Terry start working on a case they have a lead in, one they get to before other senior detectives do, a really interesting detective story progresses that would not feel out of place in dramas like "The French Connection" (1971) or similar action/detective movies to that nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Highsmith and Danson--New York City's hottest and best detectives--fall to their deaths during a rooftop chase, two positions open up to be the top cop. From surviving car chases to escaping exploding buildings and shootings, Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz stick together as partners and attempt to become the city's new heroes. "The Other Guys" is a hilarious movie thanks to the acting skills of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, the cinematography of Oliver Wood, and the wonderful direction by Adam McKay. Will Ferrell is one of the best comic actors of all time. In this movie, Will Ferrell's character, Allen, is known as the desk jockey; he enjoys doing each case's paperwork. The 2011 AFI Movie of the Year winner, Mark Wahlberg, plays Terry, Allen's partner. He knows what it's like to be the hot shot and wishes to move up the ladder of detectives to that point again. Wahlberg does a fantastic job with expressing Terry's deliberate, yet hysterical efforts to become a great cop. After getting a dispatch that there's a robbery at a jewelry store, Terry wants to go to the scene, but his partner doesn't want to leave. Before stomping out of the room, Terry exclaims, "You've gotta be shitting me, you can't keep me cooped up in here. I am a peacock, you gotta let me fly!" Will Ferrell's experience with awkwardness makes Allen's situations on the field absolutely hilarious. While racing to a crime scene to get there before two other detectives, Terry yells, "Allen punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!" Allen does so and screams, "AMERICA!" Later, he explains that before he's never actually put his foot all the way down to the ground with the accelerator, but he feels slightly aroused. Not only that, but he runs over the crime scene. The contrast between one partner wanting to say in the office and the other wanting experience on the field creates the funniest bickers and arguments between two grown men. The cinematographer, Oliver Wood, does a phenomenal job at catching each scene at the right angle. A few of the films he has worked for are a few of the Bourne movies, Step Brothers, Freaky Friday, and the upcoming Anchorman 2. Within the first scene of the movie, you are pulled into the action of a car chase in downtown New York City. You get a view from on top of the cars, within, in the sky, and out on the sidewalks. The variety of focus in each scene keeps your eyes interested in what's happening on the screen.Adam McKay is the director of this film. He has had experience within the comedy genre, for he also directed Anchorman, Step Brothers, and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Typically in comedies, people want humor that is created by exaggerating real life experiences, as well as a happy ending. With "The Other Guys", that is exactly what McKay gives the audience. He takes the life of an average New York City cop and makes fun with it by adding exaggerated competition between detectives, cases that intertwine and connect to others, and separate histories of Allen and Terry's lives, which helps us understand why they act out of the ordinary."The Other Guys" is an action-comedy film that was created to excite and entertain. There is no doubt that this movie will get you to laugh and leave wanting to look up quotes With the combination of humor and conflict, this movie is the exciting story of Terry Hoitz and Allen Gamble taking on New York City's scams, drugs, sex crimes, and violence.</fullReview>

Neither characters are very complex but the story line plays out very well in twisted way. I also very much enjoy Will Ferrells Character who is not a genius but also is not nearly as dumbed down as his typical characters. Eva Mendes also added fun to the screen playing yet another type of character she has yet to previously been. The story line is predictable but I don't believe in this brand of comedy anyone expects too many surprises. All in all it was very enjoyable comedy with over the top action, romance and tons of laughs.</fullReview>

The closing credits with the distortions and flat out lies about what executives make (unless you believe in a loose definition of an "executive") are just too much. Just make a funny movie - keep your liberal views to yourself!I did enjoy the one part in the closing credits about a Ponzi Scheme. If you watch that in light of Rick Perry's comments about Social Security being a Ponzi Scheme the graphic / animation fits perfectly! Unintended consequence on the producer's part for sure, but gave me a good laugh when I watched it "again" tonight!Good movie though - funny stuff and one you can watch a few times and still find new things to laugh about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tragic Misuse of Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys is a depressing flirtation with comedy that abuses the fans base of the actors who star in the movie. The film is a faintly amusing disappointment that does not live up to the star power that it contains. The Other Guys an extremely disappointing attempt at comedy. The film delivers a few fleeting moments of humor that evaporate quickly. It is a brief tease with being humorous but not enough to entertain even the most devote fan of Will Ferrell. The movie is no where near as funny as it should have have been. The Other Guy has a number of really good comedic scenes but they are quickly drowned out by the next unfunny one. The film has a great collection of stars and it simply misuses the entire cast. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson were the best cop duo in the film. Their brief appearance of the film stole every scene that they were in. The film's value quickly dropped once their characters left the movie. The other buddy cop duos in the film didn't measure up to Jackson and Johnson in the story or with their performance. Wayans, Jr and Ripple as or the focus of the story Ferrell and Walhberg.The movie has a few brief moments of comedic genius. Some of the comedic scenes are extremely funny such as Alan's (Ferrell) irritating humming of SWAT's theme song while doing paperwork to irritate Terry (Walhberg), Terry's accidental shooting of Derek Jeter, the wooden gun that Alan is forced to carry, the scene where the explosion knocks both of them to the ground, Terry's openly disrespectful obsession with Alan's wife, Alan's college persona of the pimp, "Gator." The Other Guys does have its great moments but they are more overshadowed by the multitude of bad ones. I think my expectations for this movie were too high which led to my level of disappointment in this movie. I really love Will Ferrell's movies, I am one of his biggest supporters. However, The Other Guys is a disastrous catastrophe that has literally shaken my faith in Will Ferrell's comedic ability. The film is slightly amusing and contains a few good moments of comedy but none of them are nearly enough to drown my disappointment of this calamity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this. I even tried to laugh harder at some scenes, that I actually thought were working. I just couldn't entirely. One of the first mistakes (in my book), was to cast Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson in small parts, to go against Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrells main players (not literally). If you have guys with that charisma, with that "swagga", there is almost no chance for anyone else really being able to fill their shoes.So while I would love to watch the adventures of those two in a separate movie, the comedy felt weird and unstable in this one. Even a scene on a large building with Sam and Dwayne felt forced. They did something just to "end" the scene, that neither felt funny nor original or anything else. Apart from stupid that is. But I'm guessing that is something that some people might have had a laugh about. So you see comedy is defined by yourself.While it didn't work for me (and I don't think I'll be checking the extended cut, even if it contains more of the lovely Eva Mendes), that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it. I'm just saying ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the world needs; another lame buddy-cop film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the fact Hollywood produces a lot of formulaic crap is well known, there currently seems also to be a particular emphasis on the idiot savant sidekick.Witness Ferrell here and, in "Due Date" and "The Hangover," Galifianakis. All these characters are nearly indistinguishable. Cookie cut.That said, this loud, abrasive, and sporadically funny offering is a mild guilty pleasure. What it lacks is restraint and a pinch of smarts. The over-the-top approach becomes wearying and dilutes the proceedings. Some of it is damn funny though. As an attempt at satirizing buddy-cop movies, it's moderately successful.It's also another entry in the male driven, homophobic oeuvre prevalent in American cinema. Here it's subtext rather than main device. Thank God for small favors.Marky-Mark is lost in the constant screaming he's been directed toward. Ferrell is trademark Ferrell. Eve Mendes has a nice turn as Ferrell's wife. It was also a treat to see Michael Keaton back in the saddle spoofing characters who supervised his out-of-control cop behavior.A passable time filler. A few laughs. No other expectations will make for a satisfying view.Note: based on the Uncut DVD version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys (2010, PG 13)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Other Guys" provides a compelling argument that sometimes action-comedies aren't very good at climaxes or endings. As it gets more detailed and puts together a movie length story, it runs out of steam and sinks into boring action stunts. But it has the required three or four funny situations needed to make it an excellent comedy. Some of them stick in your head and provide laughs as you remember them. The best by far was in the trailer and can't be spoiled since it's funny every time you see it. Will Ferrell shouts "America!" for no apparent reason as he stomps on the accelerator, runs over a dead body at a crime scene, and (the less funny part) spreads cocaine all over his red Prius.This scene may remind you of joke routines from one of Ferrell's better comedies, "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby". It doesn't make as much sense while driving a Prius rather than a race car, but it's the sort of sarcastic and energetic humor that really works. We have no idea quite what he means, but maybe it's a play on the image of an ideal American male driving fast, working heroic jobs, and intimidating less manly colleagues. Additionally, Mark Wahlberg's frequent flying peacock metaphor reiterates this desire to assert traditional masculinity and heroism. The movie is partially a buddy cop parody of such an ideal, exploiting the stereotype with a sarcastic odd couple. It's a common theme in collaborations between Will Ferrell and the director, Adam McKay ("Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy", "Step Brothers"). Will Ferrell was credited as a writer for their previous three films together, but here the writing credits go to the director and Chris Henchy ("Land of the Lost").In this version of the routine, Will Ferrell stars as Detective Allen Gamble, a New York police officer with a proud resume of accounting and desk work. Everyone at work mocks his enthusiasm for paperwork, especially his new partner, Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), a would be heroic street cop, who was forced to a desk job after he shot Derek Jeter in the leg (ending the Yankees' chance to win the World Series, in the story). Some of the funniest lines come early and often as the two bicker with each other.Gamble (Will Ferrell) mocks Hoitz's oafish insults with witty responses and exaggerated enthusiasm. Again it's not quite clear what he says, but he quickly rattles off a story about tunas overcoming a lion off the coast of Africa. Ferrell's character is an odd mix of clever technophile, easily gullible, slightly effeminate, and mysteriously attractive. He's married to the gorgeous Dr. Sheila Gamble (Eva Mendes), and beautiful women respond to him instead of Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Gamble all but ignores and belittles their strange advances on him. Hoitz, in contrast, can't get his girl out of her ballet partner's arms. And he loses the war of music to Gamble's old man preference for LRB (Little River Band).These aren't the top or veteran cops on the police force. They're merely "the other guys"; the guys in the background who never stand out of the crowd. But they get the job done when our world spirals into economic disorder and people suddenly want average cop heroes. P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) are the celebrity cops at the beginning of the movie. They would be the cowboy action stars that walk away from explosions with minimal damage. But not in this film. They merely cater to the cameras and don't last long. It's difficult to say much about them without spoiling their great parody moment, but it isn't subtle at all.Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) contrast well: they feel the full force of explosions and roll around on the ground like babies. They also continually get bad press, and anger the wrong people, including their Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton). They begin as a hilarious odd couple, but then as the writers run out of ideas, the two switch roles and jokes repeat themselves without their former forcefulness. Most annoying is Will Ferrell's unconvincing and tedious back story. Mark Wahlberg is most effective in silent moments of surprise at Will Ferrell's silliness, and his role reversal is interesting as a latent ballet dancer. But his angry reactions don't have quite the natural comedic timing to achieve their full effect, perhaps due to his limited comedy background (or a mismatch pairing with Will Ferrell).As the movie descends into silliness, it has a few side gags reflective of the bad economy. The police captain works two jobs, once forgetting which job he's on. A corporation led by a swindler becomes "too big to fail". And homeless people won't stop having sex in Will Ferrell's little Prius.But the film has enough funny situations in the police office and Prius sequences to avoid repeating Will Ferrell's previous box office flop, "Land of the Lost", which is still in the red by a good $31 million, according to its worldwide gross revenue. He's back with a vengeance this year, also landing a key vocal role for the upcoming "Megamind" (release set for 5 November 2010).</fullReview>

It requires no crude toilet humour, just two cops doing the most outrageous things. The stunts are great, and the action is believably spectacular. It is actually better than many action films out there! The big budget shows in form of blowing up random buildings and smashing numerous cars in cool ways, which I really enjoyed.

		<fullReview>"The Other Guys" is one of those action comedies which have been so popular this year, except this one isn't very funny. I was looking forward to Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg in a comedy together. But Ferrell is better when there's intelligence to the writing and subtle comedy. Wahlberg is great as the straight man, as is Michael Keaton, but when both become ridiculous caricatures of themselves, the little bit of humour is lost completely.The action is over-the-top, the plot makes very little sense, and the jokes just aren't that funny. I would have almost nothing to recommend this movie, except there are some smart lines included. A handful of jokes that accurately depict society are smart and funny. But they are just too few and far between.Perhaps if you liked "Knight and Day" (2010) or like cop films, then you might like "The Other Guys". But mostly I was disappointed by it and found it not as funny as it should have been given its cast.</fullReview>

And then for the Lame cops, you see a stress and powerless Max Payne and Harold Crick failing every tasks. These guys did a descent job for you to laugh out loud on the sarcastic COOL cop, LAME cop routine!! As for the supporting casts, it is nice to see Michael Keaton(the Batman fame) being adorably bossy around with Eva Mendas's sexy essence seducing Mark Wahlberg and Steve Coogan committing lousy crimes. Not to mention Mr. Punisher(Ray Stevenson) messing with the cops with cocky Australian charisma as well!! The plot is.....hmmmmm...rather typical and cheesy when it comes to last 20 minutes of the movie. It is kinda Eye-sick to see those slow mo actions with Lame cops dodge off all bullets and get bad guys busted. I wouldn't expect the ending to be much differ from other movies of same genres anyway, so i got to avoid being fussy about the ending. Since the movie entertains us well enough to keep us on screen for 1 hr and 20 mins!!Lots of dark, sexual, awkward, stereotypical and action humors will tickles your guts mentally!!</fullReview>

If you've suffered head trauma and can somehow get past that then proceed.Will, plays an incompetent loser cop, who is somehow the sex beast of all these totally hot babes. Um, not sure of the story line really, just the loser cop teams up with the other cop and want to be the new BEST cops.The previous BEST cops, The Rock and Smual start out great, maybe a laugh or two, but then their parts are done with for the movie, i won't spoil it, loose term there, if at any time you feel spoiled in this movie you need your head read.I gave this film 1 star, there is no way i can support the making of such bad films, these just need to go right to free TV, late night, as repeats, i sure as hell hope no one has seen this in the cinema?, surely not.You have been advised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea for this movie is pretty good. A spoof of the cop/buddy movie that everyone is so familiar with. So after the most successful detective partnership in the NY police (Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) come to a sticky end disgraced detective Mark Wahlberg decides to get back in the good books with his bosses by taking up where they left off. Unfortunately his partner (played by Will Ferrell) is an accountant at heart rather than a cop. They get assigned to a fraud case that turns out to be bigger than they thought. There are obvious opportunities for chalk and cheese comedy situations and these are taken. However most of these don't quite come off. Ferrell and Wahlberg do pretty well but some scenes (many seem to be improvised) go on too long and aren't funny enough. Some of them even reminded me of the awful "Step Brothers", where Ferrell was also Executive Producer.Steve Coogan, Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes do well in supporting roles and there are a few good laughs. However IMO the film doesn't quite come together as well as it might.Get it out on DVD on a night the selection isn't that great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE OTHER GUYS is one of those comedy spoofs poking fun at the buddy cop genre but ultimately its about as funny as athlete's foot, the humor was either repetitive to the point where it became annoying as hell or it was the type of humor that was just childish or stupid, the only time this film was either fun or had a little bit of funny humor was every time Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson had screen time, after the point where they are no longer in it the film goes downhill fast.The acting is a different kind of screw up altogether, I don't know who told Will Ferrel he was funny perhaps it was his parents or his girlfriend or is boyfriend but this guy is about as far from a comedian as it gets, the only thing that's funny about him is that he has a face that screams "punch me!!" the other thing about Ferrel that would be a guaranteed riot would be if he announced that he was going to take up serious acting.Each and every character in this film is a total idiot and if you listen to the way they talk you'd swear you were watching your day care center days unfold before your very eyes and the sleazy sex talk between Will Ferrel and Eva Mendes, I never imagined that couples really talked like that to each other, for example Ferrel says to Mendes "I'm gonna do you grandpa style." What exactly does that mean? Is he gonna make his teeth fall out while their doing it? Good grief.Overall, if this is a stupid review don't worry, this film is equally stupid and Will Ferrel needs to go back to his day job, seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good improv, but it can't save this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are funny moments in The Other Guys, but they mostly seem to be due to offbeat line readings and on the spot improvisation. Will Ferrell, Michael Keaton, Eva Mendes and Steve Coogan are all responsible for some good bits, but overall this thing doesn't work.The script can't stop patting itself on the back for making scathing jokes about TARP and financial scandals. But don't get too excited, left-leaning viewers, because as much as you might like the satire of capitalist excesses, you'll be put off by the relentless sexism and homophobia.There are ways to make jokes about the macho culture of police officers without wallowing in a million woman-hating, gay-bashing one-liners. The cops are all portrayed as violent, sexist, homophobic fools. I thought the movie might show these childish characters growing up a little. That never happened.The best Will Ferrell movies, like Anchorman and Talledega Nights, follow his man-child characters as they mature just a tiny bit. In The Other Guys, Ferrell starts as a naive but level-headed character who doesn't need to grow up; he just needs to take off his blinders. None of the other characters change. Mark Wahlberg starts with grating, inexplicable anger cranked up to 11 and doesn't seem to know where to go from there. There's no buddy chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg. The action scenes are fine, but unexciting; who cares about slow-mo gunfights anymore? And since most action movies do such over-the-top stunts these days, there's not much The Other Guys can do to comically exaggerate the action.Skip this limp attempt and watch Hot Fuzz instead: it's a much more observant and clever parody of buddy cop movies, and there are so many jokes packed in, you can watch it again and again and find new things that will actually make you laugh all the way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Talledega Nights was OK and Step Brothers was hilarious. I thought Adam McKay knew what funny was. I'm not so sure anymore. A lot of respectable actors signed up for this dud. Why? Did it seem funnier on the page? In the spirit of 80's action flicks, "the Other Guys" asks the question "How many one-liners can we pack into a two hour movie?" When you loosely weave a story around that objective, as "the Other Guys" demonstrates, the answer is: A LOT. Particularly when they don't need to be witty, clever, or ironic one-liners... in fact, when they don't need to meet any criteria at all.I gave it three stars...one star for seldomly making me snort (by which I mean a partially-formed laugh that exited from my nose), one star for a chance to look at Eva Mendes, and one star as a thanks for expanding my list of people that indicate red flags for any comedy they happen to be associated with in the near future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some time ago (when Land of the Lost got out) I said to myself that I will never ever watch another Will Farrell movie...guess what? I decided to check out The Other Guys. Seemed all right: Mark Whallberg+Samuel L. Jackson+Dwayne Johnson . Seriously, do not waste your time on this attempt of a cop buddy comedy: the plot is weak, the characters are not funny at all...The movie kind of tries to make fun of some cop movie clichés but...you can't even give them credit for trying. Believe me, you will be so sorry if you waste your time on this movie, not to mention spend money on it. So what I'm trying to say here is don't get fooled by the trailer or by the cast. P.S. All of those who saw Land of the Lost...this movie is even worst...and yes, it is possible...unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually the first 20 minutes is great. But they must have used all of their best stuff at the beginning because the rest is like a bad Saturday Night Live, they keep tossing out the skits but only one of ten is funny. They actually totally leave the plot for half of the movie. They are trying to solve a crime but that notion leaves the set as they run around trying to work in every possible set-up that two buddy cops could have in their personal and professional lives. I've got a feeling that if you are the kind of person who loves to watch Die Hard movies over and over again, then you'll probably think the insanity in this movie is funny. But as for myself and my partner we should have left early like we almost did.</fullReview>

Forgive displeasure but here's a film with a good script, a great cast and its put together in such away that when ever Ferrell is on screen it stops moving as if waiting for him to do something funny. Ferrell, who I don't like normally, has a character here but he's continuously undercut by a director who stops everything with pregnant pauses that don't belong.What the hell was he thinking?

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not great either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are like me, you saw the trailers and you went/want to see this movie (or may be planning to go see it soon) and your expectations were/are set very high seeing as it has one of the top comedy stars, Will Ferrell, teamed up with Hollywood bad boy Mark Wahlberg, both who are accompanied by a pretty good supporting cast (Samuel L Jackson, The Rock, Michael Keaton, etc, etc). However, when you see it, at parts, wonder "is this movie ever going to be over". It's not that it's painfully boring throughout, but it has it's painfully boring and very not funny parts. With that said, it also has it's extremely funny parts. When Mark is driving around in Will's red Prius and say's it seems like they are driving around in a giant va*ina, I almost died laughing. But I will say, most of the super funny parts were shown in the commercials and trailers, which is why this movie proved to be somewhat disappointing to me. I went into the movies expecting to see another Will Ferrell gem, seeing as he was teamed up with Wahlberg who seemed, from the trailers, to be extremely funny in this movie considering he kept his well known "bad boy" facade on while still being funny. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a very un funny movie. But at the same time, it didn't come close to living up to expectations and what the trailers made it out to seem like. Definitely one you should consider catch On Demand or on TV when it comes out. But not really one you need to drop 10 dollars on seeing in the movies. And definitely to not waste the 30 on the Blu Ray when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thought this film would be 'hilarious' as it's presented to be. I didn't find one part of it funny. Will Ferrell always does rubbish films and this is another one to add to the list. Mark Wahlberg shouts for pretty much all of the film..this led me to turning the TV down but I could still hear him shouting which was stupid. Hated it. Plus none of the film even goes anywhere! One part was very rude at one point and I felt very uncomfortable watching it and no mother or father would want their small child hearing that sort of language for a film rated PG-13. Im 3 years older than that and even I didn't want to hear it.. Very unimpressed with it and glad it was only on a DVD rental and I didn't waste my money buying the rubishness and wasting money on it in the cinema. I would NEVER watch this film again and I do not recommend it on any account - even if it's the last film available in the shop...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that I was a big fan of Step Brothers, but that was a way better movie than this schlock fest. In SB, Ferrell had John C Riley to work with as well as a "family" of good actors to play straight people against those two overgrown boys. It was an inherently absurd comedic premise to begin that this one lacked.This one used the detective "buddy" movie plot, which was over worked about 20 years ago. Then add Marky Mark as Ferrel's partner, one of the most wooden and over-rated actors today, and it just plain sucked. It had the same sort of junior high wimp and fag bashing humor that was barely tolerable in Step but less so here. For instance, Marky Mark's character learned ballet when younger just so he could torment a ballet dancer fellow youth. Funny?, maybe! It also shared the same writers and some supporting actors as that one too. Even the opening scene, a total bs chase scene and shootout between the soon to be dead super cops and some stock rapper bad guys was just the same sort of over the top crappola that is the norm for about half the action movies these days.Also, the plot was well nigh non existent. Basically it was Ferrell playing this really nerdy cop, but with some sort of sex appeal with Eva Mendez as his wife and a past that included being a collegiate pimp. Marky plays some really angry low life kick ass sort of cop, who openly abuses and despises his unwanted nerdy partner. A bunch of jokes revolve around Ferrell's Prius and street people using it for orgies, really crude. Why this movie did better than Step Brothers is beyond me since Step Brothers had a simple 3 Stooges type of setup while this was just bad parody. The same super reviewers who panned that one seemed to praise this one, why?</fullReview>

One of them was The Other Guys.I have to say, it Sucked! And I really lie Will Ferell and Mark Wahlberg. I Loved Will Ferell's Elf movie for example. But this movie has only 4-5 jokes that are good, and they were all displayed multiple times in the trailers! The movies too long, it's not funny, it repeats the jokes, the plot is weak, the slow motion action climax scene with Mark Wahlberg was laughable and stupid. Eva Mendes is annoying as hell in this movie. The Wahlberg romance story has a no-sense ending.The best parts of this movie were the scenes with The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson, I love these guys. The movie should have been about them or some rivalry between them and Ferell &amp; Wahlberg.The biggest mystery for me while watching this movie was who is the narrator. I knew I recognize that voice, and it's ICE-T! Oh, and Michael Keaton .. wow he got so older.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If a motion picture "comedy" about a halfwit whose flatulence only matches his immense weight sounds appealing to you, then by all means you will adore "The Other Guys." Yes, "The Other Guys" is about an man whose buddy has constant flatulence. The all-star sounded promising to me and that's the only reason I saw this in the first place -- Jalil Jay Lynch and Dwayne Johnson even have small roles in the film! -- but unfortunately their talents are pushed aside for corny, crude fart jokes."The Other Guys" makes "Austin Powers'" fart jokes look sophisticated. This movie beats the dead horse over and over - there are only so many times we can (attempt to) laugh because, hey, that Ferrell leaves gas a lot! " Oh my, that's so funny! It's genius! Farts are hilarious!" I want to know who greenlit this project so I can carry a copy of "The Other Guys" to his or her house, strap them to a chair and force them to watch it 100 consecutive times, and see how much they enjoy the "humor" after that.An odd rarity in the children's film department, "The Other Guys" is clearly targeted towards the adults, but its content is quite childish in nature. People swear throughout the movie (our lead character uses profanity to describe portions of his anatomy) and the subject matter in general is lewd and crude and I had to wonder what sort of parent would even allow their child to view something like this in the first place.It's a demeaning film with no laughs and a sick, twisted sense of humor that is both inappropriate for children and way too stupid for adults. One of the worst films in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This abysmal Wahlberg/Ferrell vehicle is a poorly thought-out attempt at drama which will not sit well with most fans of Ferrell's usually high-octane mix of action and comedy. The plot concerns a mentally challenged "gentle giant"(Ferrell) and his able-minded/bodied brother(Wahlberg)who must sacrifice his freedom to care for his reliant sibling. What attempts to be a drama is marred by Ferrell's ridiculous portrayal of a mentally challenged adult as being nothing more than a gigantic baby, complete with overalls and a giant swirly lollipop. The movie attempts to generate sympathy for Ferrell's character while simultaneously deriving all of its humor from his various bathroom misadventures, a mix that left this viewer cold. The final version is edited so poorly that all attempts at drama seem to come from training at the Shatner school of acting. The movie limps along for over an hour before there is a significant plot developed involving gangsters, stolen jewels, and the eventual kidnapping of Ferrell. Then begins the movie Wahlberg fans have come to expect, with fantastic stunts, fights and chase sequences. In this movie it is a case of too MUCH, to late. The over the top hamming Ferrell is famous for seems here to be ridiculously out-of-place in contrast to the slow moving, "tear-jerker" attitude of the preceding two-thirds of the film. Add to this mish-mash an annoyingly repetitive musical score and not one, but TWO separate scenes of Ferrell's naked buttocks, and you have the makings of the "must NOT see" film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring and unfunny comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys is the fourth time in which actor Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay work together. They obviously have compatible styles and a similar sense of humor...but the screenplays they work with have always been unfunny so far, and the most recent example is this diffuse satire of the cop films which fails both as a comedy and as an action film due to its repetitive jokes and uncertain tone.I understand what co-screenwriters McKay and Chris Henchy tried to do in The Other Guys, and I appreciate their intention of trampling the clichés of "the odd couple" and "good cop, bad cop" (among other ones) which infest the action cinema since they were established many years ago in films like Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop. Unfortunately, The Other Guys ended up having more cons than pros mainly due to its ambiguous focus and poor narrative cohesion, which become it into a collection of confrontations and insults vaguely connected by a weak story. And the worst thing of all is that The Other Guys ends up having various of the fails from the movies it makes a parody of. Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg bring enthusiasm to their characters, but they are so poorly written that they cannot do too much with them.In conclusion, I cannot recommend The Other Guys, because I found it completely unfunny as a comedy, and tedious as an action film. I personally prefer the film Hot Fuzz and the TV series The Good Guys and Chuck, in which we can find more consistent humor and satire of the cop sub-genus.</fullReview>

The Other Guys, on the other hand, is just NOT FUNNY. AT ALL. Is it funny to complain about driving in a Prius?.. wait, and the complaint is that it makes Marky Mark feel like he's riding in a vagina? This is a joke people. A joke I don't get. Personally, as a straight male I find a woman's vagina a pleasant place to spend time, and I also enjoy getting excellent gas mileage. And then there's the running joke about how hot Will Ferrell's wife is. Mark Wahlberg's "macho" character can't understand how Will Ferrell's "sensitive" character could attract such a beautiful woman. Have the writers of this script actually ever had a relationship with a woman? I guess all those people who are afraid of fuel efficient cars and men in touch with their emotions need something to laugh at -even if it's not funny. I actually left the theatre feeling dumber than when I walked in. At least I didn't pay to see this. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Annoying Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its difficult to pinpoint exactly when Will Ferrell's career took a Steve Martin-esquire nosedive. It seems to be somewhere between the needless remake of The Producers and the gag free Blades of Glory. In the early naughties he broke free of the 'Saturday Night Live' crew, starred in some feature films and became a genre unto himself (You seen that new Will Ferrell film?). During that time he gave us some quotable, laugh-at-loud performances, such as Ron Burgundy in Anchorman and Frank in Old School. However overkill is easily achieved by funny-men and Ferrell obviously didn't follow Jim Carey's career too closely. Fast forward a couple of years and we are being given diluted versions of the same characters, but this time he has a film out every second month, how could that possibly get annoying? After a string of not appalling, but also not amusing films (Semi-Pro, Land of the Lost) it seemed he had lost it completely. Luckily he's slowed down in recent years and in The Other Guys he has downplayed the wackiness somewhat. But, one more false move and he's Adam Sandler.Highsmith and Danson (played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) are the two most bad-ass cops in their precinct. They get the criminals, they get the girls, they may not always follow the rules but goddammit they get the job done. Idolising them from a distance are Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz (played by Ferrel and Mark Wahlberg). Gamble is an accountant at heart and has no interest in police-work which poses any danger. Hoitz is hungry for action but has lost his bottle having shot an unarmed sports personality. When New York Citys finest duo get killed in the line of duty, Hoitz sees this as their opportunity to step up, do some real policing and fill Highsmith and Dansons place. Luckily the first case they take leads them to a multi-billion dollar fraud ring. It looks as though The Other Guys will finally be recognised.Mark Wahlberg seems slightly confused throughout the whole film as to whether he's the straight man or grabbing for laughs too. He also seems to be genuinely frustrated with Ferrell (you can tell because Marky Mark is not the greatest actor). Whilst they both give us some giggles and the supporting cast know how to deliver a joke, its hard to do a lot with poor scripting. Michael Keaton delivers some of the funniest material in the film but sadly has very little on-screen time. The entire film had roughly ten to twelve jokes rehashed again and again. As we all know, jokes get funnier the second time round, so by the tenth time round it felt as if I was being hit with an hilarity stick and it was almost too much to take.The Other guys is not a great comedy by any means, it delivers some giggles and for those in need of a Ferrell fix it will sate your appetite somewhat. For others, there's a scene about halfway through with Will Ferrell explaining why an FBI mug with 'Female Body Inspector' on it is funny. Wahlberg interrupts him and screams 'Shut up!'. I think it's an outtake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This takes me back to some of my first experiences seeing Will Ferrel on SNL and thinking "This is SNL, it's got to get funny sooner or later.". I know its bad when I'm watching an alleged comedy and find myself concentrating in the vain hope of that I'll catch something truly funny going on, I know something's wrong. That something is the perennially unfunny Will Ferrel. He just flat out tries too hard to be funny and quirky without any spark of genuine comedic ease. I know he didn't write this but it so smacks of his style. OK, I do hate this guy so this flick had one foot in the grave from the get go. But nothing seemed to redeem this film. An early action scene from a rooftop involving Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson is pretty funny parody of the standard invincible cop genre and there were a few other minor chuckles but this movie is a dud masquerading as a funny film. Don't waste your time or money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have people lost there minds or do Americans not expect much from movies anymore? This movie had a few funny bits but overall I would say that I waisted two hours of my life watching this drivel. First off how many movies are they going to pay Mark Walberg to make before they realize he cannot act. I get hes cool and in good shape, but he just doesn't have any acting ability. Besides not being able to act he also is not funny at all so most of the movie is left to Ferrell. I like Will Ferrell but every movie I see him in is like a SNL episode, half of it is funny the other half is horribly boring. There were quite a few funny bits that will be used on radio shows but the plot was non existent the character development was very weak and there were lots of bits stolen from other movies. There are several unbelievable car chases and property damage (into the millions) that no cop would get away with. I mean I understand that its a movie and movie goers must suspend belief, but give me a little bit of reality mixed in. Michael Keaton who plays the captain of their squad is woefully misused in this movie and frankly is starting to look like Mickey Rooney. Another problem I have with this and lot of other movies is advertising within the movie. Don't these aholes make enough off of the movie? Why do they have to constantly put store ads like Bed Bath and Beyond in their movies? Also they need to stop showing commercials at the beginning of the movies. I went to a Great Escapes theater and they showed eight minutes of commercials before the movie. I will never go there again. Demand more from your movies America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement on the Adam McKay/Will Ferrel's other stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and still it was crap. How many times do we have to see Will Ferrel play the same character I don't mean he plays characters with different aspects but some things in common I mean EXACTLY THE SAME. Does every song in this have to be a stupid Hip Hop song? really? anyone answer me that? None of the jokes are funny. Now that I think about it when did I see this before? that cop comedy made 3 years ago? Oh HOT FUZZ a much better movie and I actually laughed in it.Anyone sick of Will Ferrel? I am I am declaring to never watch his movies because all of his movies are a continuous long-running unfunny film franchise (except Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) that I could call a film franchise because it has the same character in it over and over.Now to the plot it's about this cop duo that fight crime and blow up anything between them and the criminals either that or ram through it and then they get medals for a drug bust then the cops praise them except Mark Whalberg who wants a little piece of that glory who also has to sit in front of Will Ferrel's character (I feel sorry for THAT guy).What even made Mark Whalberg and Will Ferrel a cop duo anyway? he could've done this movie with another person to team up with and a less unbearable movie. Back to the plot the cop duo have a few people that are messing things up (as usual) and they sort it out when they get onto a rooftop for god knows what reason they see them escape and WILLINGLY jump 20 stories off a building.When they die at the funeral people fight SILENTLY over who's going to be the next big shot cop... John McClane maybe? and then the duo that replace them are 2 guys who didn't and still didn't do a damn thing in the movie besides making fun of the characters and they get praised then there's some scaffolding thing with Steve Coogan and Ray Stevenson both of which I've seen in better movies... you know what I'm not going to do this anymore OK I'm done watching these movies and being dragged to see them I've had enough of these movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny and incoherent, but thats from a non-fan of Ferrell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should admit something immediately: I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan. Sure, he was really funny on SNL and for some reason I loved Talladega Nights, but Anchorman and Step Brothers were both very mediocre in my eyes. As such, fans can simply ignore everything I say from here on in, because while they will certainly enjoy it, The Other Guys was a huge disappointment in my eyes.The film would have worked great if it had ended twenty minutes in, for the first act was indeed hilarious. Featuring Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson (who really needs to do a real action movie soon) as hotshot cops with Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell stuck at their desks, laughs come quite fast at the start. Conversations about land tuna do well to contrast the ludicrous action sequences.However, once Wahlberg and Ferrell hit the streets, the movie loses all momentum. Various one-note jokes are stretched far too thin, such as Ferrell being irresistible to women or Wahlberg being blamed for shooting Derek Jeter, and most of the other laughs are in the trailer. A revelation about Ferrell's past is random enough to get some laughs, but is quickly overused.The actors do little to lift the material. Jackson and Johnson are great, but limited in screen time. Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr also manage to get the lions share of the second half's laughs despite their small roles. Ferrell's role is too inconsistent, playing up the Ferrell-esquire idiot role to be believable as the functioning member of society the rest of the film expects him to be. Wahlberg starts out as a great straight man, but as he joins the lunacy any barometer of sanity is lost. Michael Keaton never sinks low, but the TLC-oriented jokes around his character grow weak.I really can't say much more than that I didn't find The Other Guys that funny. It was a mostly laughless experience with a good opening, loose plot and ludicrous ending, but fans of Ferrell-McKay movies will likely enjoy it. I just can't claim to be part of that group.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wahlberg impresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supercops Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson start this movie off with an outrageous sequence typical of bombastic action thrillers. Events soon conspire to throw the improbable partnership of deskbound accountant cop Will Ferrell and disgraced would-be action cop Mark Wahlberg into the limelight, however, as they pursue an unlikely investigation in the fact of mishaps and pressure to drop it.This film generated a lot of laughter throughout its length. I'm not a big Ferrell fan, but his character was amiable and often funny. Bigger laughs came from Wahlberg, however, who showed considerable comic chops deadpanning to Ferrell's broader character. And Eva Mendes as Ferrell's wife was both funny and sexy. Jackson and Johnson clearly enjoyed sending themselves up. Michael Keaton did the best he could with a part which was not written helpfully, and poor old Steve Coogan was swimming against the tide a bit.But overall this was an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I freely admit I am not of the target audience that "The Other Guys" is aiming for. But I can only think of a handful of people I know (even Will Ferrell fans) who would be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is fair to all my readers to inform you, before you read on, that I am not of the target audience that "The Other Guys" starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg is going for. I like Mark Wahlberg as an actor and I like Will Ferrell as an actor and a comedian, but nevertheless, I am not the type of person who usually gets into slapstick cop-buddy comedies like this. There are exceptions, of course, but "The Other Guys" did not ring my bell.It didn't even begin to pull the cord.However, I must admit, that even though I know plenty of people who are Will Ferrell fans and who like movies such as this, I can only think of a handful who I sincerely believe would enjoy this picture. To my mind, it is a jumbled, unfunny, confused mess that fails to live up to the obligatory standards of its own category. As always, I entered the theater giving it the benefit of the doubt, but I left feeling thoroughly dissatisfied.I probably laughed only four or five times at this unfunny debacle, in which Wahlberg and Ferrell play mismatched but good-hearted New York cops who admire two legendary policemen (Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson) but fail to live up to them. Then, one day in a highly inexplicable scene, Johnson and Jackson fall to their death off a high building, and they need to be replaced. Guess who fills their shoes? Guess who goes after the Ponzi scheme-esquire case that follows up next? You guessed it.With a better script, this could have been an efficient comedy. But with an underwritten, seemingly incomplete screenplay as it has, it is nothing more than a promise for a gag and then a fail over and over and over again. There are so many opportunities throughout its running time for it to deliver on a hilarious joke, but I can only recall even smiling a handful of times. The first character who made me laugh was not Ferrell or Wahlberg, who bored me, but Michael Keaton as their skittish and unhappy captain. And again, maybe this is because I am not a target audience member, but all those stupid gags about homosexual orgies, phallic jokes, lions eating tuna and vice versa, well...that just does not amuse me. And that Prius joke. You know, it was pretty funny when ventriloquist Jeff Dunham riffed on himself during his stand-ups with Walter, Achmed, or by himself. But here, it is so banal and tasteless and underwritten that it has absolutely no point.However, I think even to fans of this type of movie will be bitterly disappointed like me. This is why. Because the only real way a movie with standards as low as this could be funny was to follow through on obligatory moments, twists, and such and make the best of it all. But it does not. I usually applaud a movie for avoiding conventions, but this is one of the few times that I booed it because the choices that it makes instead are even more tiresome than the clichés. There is absolutely *no* bond between Ferrell and Wahlberg. All that happens is Walhberg screams at him a lot at first and less at the end. Moments where they might have a friendship moment are cut short in favor of more dopey jokes such as Wahlberg deciding out of the blue that he wants to be a traffic cop. That moment comes up suddenly and is dismissed just as quickly. There is no time to register any effect whatsoever on the audience, except boredom. Then there is that incredibly bad subplot about Ferrell's college backgrounds and just when we think that might actually start to serve some purpose in the plot, it is dismissed and wiped clean from the slate.It seems as if the screenwriter just wrote an outline, realized a full script was due the next day, and just added some dialogue under his notes. It feels that rushed.And another thing, if you're going to make a slapstick about a Ponzi scheme, why not treat that on a humorous note instead of trying to lecture the audience about it? That kind of story and monologue belongs in a movie like "The International," not this.I laughed a couple of times, but not very often. Most of the time, I just sat in the theater with a sullen expression on my face. When I went and saw "The Other Guys," there was only one other person in the theater. About five minutes after the movie started, he stood up, and quietly left the theater. He did not return.I envy him.And if it weren't for my "critic code" in which I feel I must see an entire movie before I can pass judgment (and the fact that I've seen comedies before that started dumb but got better) I would have surely left as well. Once again, I must remind you that I am not a particular fan of this genre, so I cannot promise who and who it will not appeal to. All I can do is describe what my reaction was and let you be your own judge. But for me, "The Other Guys" was sheer tedium. The theater can keep my six bucks; I just want my invested time back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off very well, but then goes clunk just like that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love films of all genres, regardless of how old they are. The Other Guys looked like a decent enough film. But watching The Other Guys was like watching a movie like The Bounty Hunter, the funny bits were actually shown in the trailers and previews. Don't get me wrong, The Other Guys does start off very well. The first fifteen minutes are quite funny, with an entertaining turn from Samuel L.Jackson. After that, it goes clunk, just like that, which is a real shame because I really wanted to like it.For me, a major part of the problem was Will Ferrell. While I am not a fan of his acting/shtick, I don't hate him or see him as a spawn of Satan or something or other. That said, he can be good especially in Anchorman and Stranger than Fiction, and Megamind was much better than expected too. However, Ferrell just isn't funny in The Other Guys. His acting here consists of a shtick(acting like a total wimp) that I have seen many times before and better. To make things worse, this shtick wasn't funny in the slightest, well actually it was for about three or so times but after that it got repetitive and tiresome.His co-star Mark Wahlberg thankfully fares a little better. His style of acting is more understated, and he did get one or two laughs from me. That in mind, Wahlberg was so understated he also verged on rather dull too and then there are some instances where he is actually annoying. He and Ferrell have no chemistry whatsoever, which alone ruined the movie, as a good buddy movie is sunk without a decent enough chemistry between the leads. The supporting cast are talented, Jackson does come off best, but Eva Mendes looks beautiful but has little to do other than act sexy and vapid and Michael Keaton who does have a knack of stealing the show when he is good is wasted.Another major part of the problem is the film's focus. There are times when it wants to be a comedy, then there are times and in sudden changes of shifts too when it strives to be an action-thriller-like film. It is really sad though that neither of these elements are done very well at all. The comedy is pretty much wretched, not just in the predictable gags but also in the terrible script, while the action is tedious.The plot is yet another disservice. It is a badly paced(the middle especially is too slow and full of awkward pauses) and derivative plot with few exciting or original moments to savour. And did I mention it was predictable as well. The direction is poor too, focuses too much on Ferrell and not enough on making a good enough script and story. It isn't just the story, direction or script that wastes the cast, there is also the way the characters are written. To be honest I hated every single one of them. All of them were clichéd, shallow and under-developed.Then there is the style of filming. The location work is quite nice, quite beguiling scenery and lighting, but the cinematography feels rushed and the film could have done with better editing, in other words editing that flowed much better into succeeding scenes. I personally found the soundtrack rather generic and boring, and I also thought it didn't fit much with the movie or its tone. The ending also epitomises how much downhill The Other Guys went after the beginning.Overall, I am sorry to say this, but The Other Guys was a mess. Although I saw it just recently, it is one of my least favourites of the year, in fact in my opinion only Fred:The Movie in 2010 was worse. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

I kept waiting for it to get funny then about half way through I kept watching simply to see how bad it would get, and that was the only time it didn't disappoint. And I actually enjoy most of Ferrel's stuff, well the earlier stuff anyway, Anchorman and Old School are two of my favorites.I wonder how real some these other comments are, of course different people like different things but to have people give this "thing" a score of 10 is beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this movie I feel like the people writing these positive reviews didn't. I liked the previews and thought this was a great concept. I kept waiting for something funny. I was patient, even when several people walked out of the theater. I was tempted to join them, but I hung in there thinking, "this has to get better." Sadly it never did. There were no big laughs from the audience and only a few slight chuckles. It's a good cast, but there is no chemistry. It's not even silly, as many of Will Ferrell's best movies are. It's predictable and boring.If you have to see it wait until the DVD comes out. It is not worth the price of a ticket.Wahlberg is attempting to be funny. If you want to see him be funny go find "Date Night". If you want to see him at his best rent "Boogie Nights". Here he seems very uncomfortable and forced.</fullReview>

'The Other Guys' is finally here...Now here's the bitter truth: 'The Other Guys' is a poor show all the way. McKay's direction is prolific, but the screenplay is dull and wild. It has a dull, pointless and violent first hour which bores. The second hour is better... but later gets stabbed by the highly unconvincing end. One just doesn't feel nice and energetic once he's out of this world the Other Guys and their goons! As simple as that! A Major Letdown! Pluses: McKay is a genius. No two options on that! He makes a visual treat of a film! Cinematography is of International Standards. Music wise, Rahman is at his best. Each musical cue is memorable! McKay and the Camerapersons are stabbed by the screenplay. The first hour is boring, violent and to an ex-tend repulsive. The climax is very unconvincing, as said, you just don't feel nice and energetic once this screening has ended.The performances are mostly, weak: hams. The talented actor who was superb in cult-classics 'Land of the Lost' and 'Elf' is wasted over-here.Wahlberg is okay. Samuel L. Jackson gets nothing to do. David Gideon, in a brief role, is perfect. Joshua Church is wild, while Damon Wayans Jr. gets a raw deal. The actress who plays Rob Riggle's sister, looks charming, but does not deliver.'The Other Guys' is a major letdown!

		<shortDescription>Lame Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a Will Ferrel "fan" but I went to see this based solely on the very positive review given the film by the LA TIMES. I thought, maybe, that Ferrel was going in a slightly new direction and that there'd be action and chemistry with Mark Whalberg co-starring. What a disappointment! This is a lame attempt at a buddy comedy, almost as bad as COP OUT. The plot is nonsensical and the final confrontation with "the bad guys" is so anti-climatic that I didn't even realize that that it was the end. There are zero genuinely funny moments in this film. The humor is forced throughout. A few half-hearted chuckles here and there but that was it. The best part of this movie is the first 10 minutes, with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson taking the spotlight as two out of control super-cops. They were so over the top, but they had great chemistry and they were genuinely fun to watch. I can't believe the script wrote these two out to make way for Whalberg and Ferrel to take center stage. The Rock and Jackson should have been kept on to be a foil to the Whalbert-Ferrel pair. But I guess this film would be a Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock movie and not a Will Ferrel comedy. THis was not an offensively bad movie, just boring and lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I came to this movie expecting A LOT. I got more than I expected in the first half of the movie, honestly, Wahlberg and Ferrell did extremely well in that half. Ferrell especially made me laugh hysterically, while Wahlberg was averagely good. Just that half of the movie makes it very good. It explained everything well, made me laugh so much and had funny and interesting twists and turns.The second half (rather, the fourth quarter) is kind of boring. As soon as Ferrell loses his "loser" personality introduced in the first half, it becomes average funny but nothing interesting in it more than a Comedy flick - like "Burn After Reading", although the comedy was not bad, it wasn't enough.Here's my final word: Watch it. You will love it and the movie will stick in your head for a lot of time. I liked it, many people liked it. But beware, at the last quarter of the movie, it gets kinda boring. With all that said, the finale was hilarious as well as the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed to be more edgy and risqué</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many great actor-director combos, Scorsese and De Niro, Scorsese and Di Caprio, Greengrass and Damon, Wright and Penn, etc? Adam McKay and Will Ferrell careers have been interlinked since Saturday Night Live. Under McKay's direction Ferrell has lived out a number of childhood fantasy, such as journalist, NASCAR driver and now a police officer.Detectives Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and High smith (Samuel L. Jackson) are hero cops in New York who cause a massive amount of property damage along the way. Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are officers who are forced to do there paperwork. Gamble enjoys the paperwork, but Hoitz longs to be in the heart of the action and in disgrace after shooting Derek Jeter in the knee. But when the hero cops die, the NYPD needs a replacement partnership and Gamble may have found the case involving investment banker Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan).McKay and Ferrell both know that there films are not going to be awarding films but they know how to deliver a laugh. With The Other Guys they set out to parody (with love) buddy comedies, like Lethal Weapon, looking into the supporting cops of the officers who cause all the damage. There are some really funny moments and jokes, but this was when the film was more risqué and edgy involving sex (particularly involving homeless people), race and playing against police conventions, like when Ferrell talks a bloke into killing himself. But these moments are not frequent enough. McKay plays the humour too safely, what he should have done was been more edgy jokes, more willing to use language, violence, sex and race. The film should have gone for a 15/R rating, instead of playing it safe with the 12A/PG-13 rating.The action was decent, better then in some films, but of course McKay is a comedy director. The opening chase was deliciously over the top and a homage to the Lethal Weapon series. It was both funny and exciting. Other action sequence were well handled.If you are not a fan of Will Ferrell's over-the-top stupidity and physical performance then it is best that you avoid the film: but if you like it you will be happy. There are good moments of more understated humour like when he mentions how the Securities Exchange Commissions has failed with previous financial investigations. Walhberg's performance was strong as the straight, reacting to Ferrell's playing it by the book personality who avoids risks: he does humour with his anger and a moment I enjoy was when he threw Allen's gift out a car window. Being British is it enforced by death that you have to like Steve Coogan, and he was enjoyable, as well as supporting cast members like Eva Mendas. But Ferrell does play on what must be his personal fantasy, that hot women just fall in love with him.Also at times the film does divert into sub-plots and leads that go nowhere, none has enough of a comic payoff. The film was too long and should have been around 1 hour 40 minutes, a good length for a comedy.Jackson and Johnson were both very fun as the over-the-top, action packed cops and they deserve a spin-off.A decent effort, but try harder for next time. Hopefully the DVD will be more adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Effort by Adam McKay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, I feel like going out of my way to criticize Adam McKay for this movie, the same man responsible for some of my favorite new comedies such as Anchorman and Step Brothers. I would call him too ambitious for stepping out of his genre if it weren't for the apparent lack of effort in the writing and editing. The script was uneven, with a plot unsure of how to progress and seemingly secondary to the banter between Ferrell and Wahlberg, who failed to capture any real chemistry as partners. Wahlberg, in the movie, actually played a large caricature of himself and the character development for both leads was too far from believable to have anything but a negative impact on the film as a whole. I found myself wondering when this movie was going to get better only to see it take multiple turns for the worse, leaving me shaking my head in disappointment. I was disappointed scene after scene throughout. Even the surprise political message during the credits was out of place and I found myself wondering if this movie had actually been viewed all the way through before its release to catch any disjointed flow. The only redeeming factors are the funny one liners that McKay movies have always triumphed on, but even some of those were misplaced, too ridiculous, or just forced.</fullReview>

The story and script are so poorly written/edited that it even makes the stellar cast seem like bad actors. Through the entire movie, you just sit there waiting for it to get better, but it never does. There is never a connection between Ferrell and Wahlberg, neither comedically or as partners on the police force, nor is there a connection with the supporting cast. The entire movie seems disjointed and boring with a few funny parts thrown in to keep you from walking out on the movie. Talladega Nights and Anchorman are two of my all-time favorite movies; however, this movie doesn't even come close. Wait for it to become a discount rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good &amp; funny blockbuster comedy, which is all you can ask for in this case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So pleasant a relief, if not surprise (following this did the disappointing Step Brothers), it was that The Other Guys turned out to be funny. How funny it is, or how funny it will be for you, will depend on how much you can take of Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as on-screen cops. But for my money it succeeded where Kevin Smith's Cop Out slipped; it takes on the conventions and stereotypes of the buddy-cop action-comedy movie, and does it a service by having funny lines, funny sequences, and (somewhat surprising) good action. I hesitate to discuss the plot because it is the thing that is least effective, perhaps intentionally so. All I can really report, or would want to, is that Steve Coogan plays a sort of shady Wall Street dealer who makes a bad deal, and owes some bad dudes (Ray Stevenson for example), and there's a series of diamond heists that are linked to his office.So who to get on the case? Why scene-stealers Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson of course, the hot-shot cops who basically are the guys who one would usually see paired up in these movies. But they meet a rather unfortunate fate (I cannot describe it here, but it is one of the gut-busting moments of the year in terms of sudden, outrageous hilarity). So, who could take over? No one, really, except maybe Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg), a rather angry guy who got pulled off his usual detective work for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter (a fact he is painfully reminded of throughout the film), and, much less-so in terms of ambition, Allen Gamble (Ferrell), who works as an accountant for the cops. How they get put together, or how they go about the cases, is only somewhat relevant. The story takes some twists and turns but if you've seen one of these kinds of action-comedy cop movies you've seen them all.The Devil's in the Details, and it's in this that Ferrell and McKay get it right. True, some of the humor is pretty goddamn stupid, mostly with some of the physical gags like "Good Cop Bad Cop" that becomes "Bad Cop Bad Cop." Working much better here is Ferrell, who dials it down a little from his usual man-child roles and plays an adult (!) whose running gag is that he is married to and keeps getting hit on by insanely hot women. That is to Terry, Allen just sees his wife (Eva Mendes, very smoking hot) as "cute". There's also a side-track to Allen's time before being a cop, when he was a don't-call-me-a-pimp-but-I'm-a-pimp days in college, nicknamed "Gator" and with a mouth full of gold teeth.It's inspired feats and some really punchy dialog that keep things afloat, and that the film works this time- more-so than less-so- with the improvisational skills that Ferrell and surprisingly Wahlberg have on display. They make a good team, and other supporting players like Coogan and Michael Keaton do their parts as well (Keaton especially as a lieutenant-cum-Bed/Bath/Beyond manager has a riotous running gag of saying lines from TLC songs without realizing their origins).Lots of stupid fun to be had, and action that can be good on its own- i.e. scored to "Icky Thump" is a spectacular parody of a gun battle- or serving the comedy. I laughed, and I know that if I saw The Other Guys again I would laugh again, and maybe just as hard in the parts I look forward to. Sometimes, despite only a passable plot and a few cardboard characters, that's enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wahlberg and Ferrell are two desk jockeys about to make it big time- kind of. While they dream of becoming the sharp shooting, car chasing cops they idolize, they end up busting a financial scam. Both of the main characters are funny as hell, but in more of a straight-man way. Allen Gamble isn't Ron Burgundy- because Allen Gamble actually has some sense to him. They're smart characters. This isn't anything like Anchorman. Allen is actually a genius, with minimal street sense (see his "Lion vs Tuna monologue). Terry isn't the brightest bulb on the box, but he is like a Sour Patch Kid- sour then sweet. Both actors give memorable performances. The supporting cast is great as well- Steve Coogan, Michael Keaton, Eva Mendes, Dwayne Johnson, Sam Jackson, and in my opinion, Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans. Riggle and Wayans play two 'rival' cops who also idolize the rough n tough Danson (Johnson) and Highsmith (Jackson). Their "desk pop" prank is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. People say it's a spoof- but it's more of a "Christmas Vacation" than it is a "Scary Movie"- a lampoon, if you will, of action films. It is actually a very good piece of film. It's well written (what else do you expect from McKay though?) and it looks really, really good. The action is well done. The way the film plays out is great as well- props to the editors. Very well directed, and combined with one hell of a script, The Other Guys is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ridiculousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) are the best action hero rock star cops in the NYPD. They get into outlandish chases for nothing arrests. Everybody loves them. Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.) are the jokers. Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton) is in charge. Then there are the Other Guys. Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) is a naive paper pusher. His partner Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) is still trying to make up for shooting Derek Jeter. Gamble is eager to do paperwork for the heroes and Hoitz hates him for it. Highsmith and Danson finally kill themselves stupidly in a chase. Everybody wants to be the next hero cops. Hoitz forces Gamble to take on a high profile case. David Ershon (Steve Coogan) is an investment banker who lost $32 billion of Pamela Boardman (Anne Heche)'s fund. She demands that he replace the losses and he tries to go on the run. Gamble arrests Ershon on a scaffolding permit violation but a professional team takes him. On the personal side, Hoitz can't believe that Gamble is married to Sheila (Eva Mendes).I would have loved a buddy cop movie with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. This is just as good in a completely different way. Ferrell is hilarious and Wahlberg is the perfect angry foil. The fighting partners have great chemistry. The angrier Wahlberg gets, the funnier the movie gets. Adam McKay has a great sense of the ridiculous. The story is stupid. The setups are insane. The dialog is hilarious. There are some gut busting laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A messy buddy cop comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(48%) This isn't a comedy buddy cop movie, it's a buddy cop movie set in a parallel universe, or another solar system, because this sure as hell isn't set in modern day planet earth. Sam Jackson and The Rock play cartoon characters, fun cartoon characters, but nevertheless they still very much belong on the pages of the funny pages. While every other character could easily be replaced by a Muppet, or a Looney tune without any change to the script at all. The movie is at times at least funny, but the laughs do really start to dip as the 30 min mark comes around as too much stuff is repeated or just isn't very good, and there's quite a bit of crazy action, but then again much of it is really badly shot with almost extreme shaky-cam that ruins the fun and doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie. So as a comedy it's more than a bit lacking, and as an action movie it's sub-par, but it's still partly worth a look and isn't awful by any means. It just could have been so much better than it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly funny film which isn't really a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a 'comedy' film boasts a whole host of A-list comedic actors and ends up not being particularly funny at all. Now, 'The Other Guys' may have veteran comedian Will Ferrell as top billing, but Mark Wahlberg is an unlikely partner for an out-and-out comedy film.But then The Other Guys isn't really a comedy. The humour is strange and not that obvious, let alone appreciated by all. I've seen plenty of reviews where people claim not to have laughed once. I, on the other hand, couldn't seem to stop laughing all the way through. However, like I say, this isn't really a comedy. It's only slightly less serious than the Lethal Weapon films. It's really a buddy-cop movie with shoot-outs, car chases and double-crossing that just so happens to be quite amusing as an off-shoot.Ferrell and Wahlberg play off each other well and the supporting stars all have their moments, too. It's hard to say what the target audience is, as the film encompasses so many genres. I guess it's a bit of a shot in the dark as to whether you'll enjoy it or not. But, if you're generally into Will Ferrell movies, or you're in the mood for an action/thriller/cop movie/comedy then give it a go.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's quite an entertainment, but the magic only works up until near the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another action comedy based on a pair of cops. Also it's with the obvious combination, one hot headed foul mouthed tough guy, and one previously cooped up almost nerdy geeky pacifist. Unfortunately the story develops all too much like all those previous works. The action is not that good, even for an action comedy. This movie doesn't offer any new thing besides random shooting and car chases. The good part of this movie is actually all those nifty little jokes, especially the ones in the dialog. The action by Wahlberg and Ferrell is just about average, nothing special. For me Ferrell here is not quite the Ferrell we used to see, there is less of his signature hyperbolic manner of going into his character. On the other hand, Mark Wahlberg is, like almost always, not successful in being funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie more times than I can count and for good reason. I always come back to The Other Guys for a laugh if I need one. My friends and I are in love with the script and probably have memorized about 70% of the quotes in this movie. The dynamic duo of Terry and Alan make this movie great!! I love both Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrel and they work perfectly together in this movie. There are some odd moments in this movie that seem to not make sense, but I guess that's why I gave it 8 out of 10 stars. The bottom line is is that if you are looking for a funny movie to watch that is sure to make you laugh then look no further. You have found it! The Other Guys. It's worth the time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny comedy that has Ferrell on form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10The Other Guys is a comedy that boats not just funny stunts and dialogue, but also a very good action performance for a comedy role. Mixing slightly crude jokes well enough so it isn't too bad, and then adding into the mix smartly thought out jokes, this movie turns out very fun. Adam McKay yet again is back to his best making comedies, whether or not this is his very best work, well that is not my decision to make although I felt this was strongly a pretty good film.The story about cops in a comedy seems a bit Cliché but it honestly works out in the end to be funny, takes just a little time getting started and not "all" jokes work but still gives good laughs. The story is actually quite fun, go along with the plot and enjoy the jokes and you will hugely enjoy this, it doesn't contain all the action I expected from the posters but still has some, when it used it usually very funny, I will add though, the jokes are never quite crying but there a lot of chuckles nevertheless, good fun.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg put in a funny performance here, acted funny yes, Ferrell at his best, well maybe not but even so when it comes to where it matters he really knows how to do comedy. Wahlberg goes along well to say he isn't the comedy specialist and if you didn't know he usually does serious films, you would possibly think he is a comedy actor, good work. No one else makes a serious attempt to out do the main two guys but a bit more of Samuel L Jackson could have made this just a little better, maybe just a little little.It is written well with McKay doing directing and writing duties here, he seems to control Ferrell with a different way from say Anchorman, he lets Ferrell go a bit more control freak but stupid yet not turn into Ron Burgundy, good job from him. I appreciated the dialogue a bit but a lot of the comedy comes from it's physical aspect, so occasionally the talking gets a little shaky(immature to be fair), but it works out all well.Of any criticisms come to this, it is the missed jokes, not always funny and that is why it really isn't a great film, close to good but as I say not great. You could say the film also as previously said lacks the action that might seem a given with this film, it isn't completely without action but we should get to see just a little more. I felt Whalberg doesn't always deliver his comedic performance always well although of course he isn't used to it and this is new territory.Ferrell fans won't be disappointed at all, they should hugely enjoy this and it may just rank among your favourites, again if anyone particularly likes McKay films then you will also like this, his marks are all over this one. For those less inclined to these two guys above, it is fun anyway and you should get some laughs out of it, if you consider yourself very highbrow when it comes to comedy, you may not enjoy it so much but just take a little chill pill with this and you should enjoy.Overall I give this a 7/10, it is in my opinion Strongly Kind of Good, goes far away from just being OK as well, a good job and possibly unexpected. Watch it and enjoy, it has plenty of funny lines and parts, a story like I said, is good to go along on with and really tries hard to get fans, unlike so others that seem lazy and overused. One more thing to say is that if you watch this and you enjoy Ferrell's type of comedy, it will make you cry, different maybe to how he is in some of his other comedies although still has that funny serious look even when he is stupid.</fullReview>

The comedy is minimal and some of it is even not funny. The problem is just that we expect more when it comes to such a star cast and an amazing guest appearance by Samuel Jackson and Dwayne Johnson.If you're looking to find a simple flick to pass your time. This might be the right choice, however if you want some serious comedy.. skip it.Only watch this when you know you don't have anything better to watch, or you just might end up regretting..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Humorous Stereotypical Cop Parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys is a stereotype of its parody-cop-film genre, but before you write it off completely, it bites back with some genuine humour. As is to be expected, it is full of silly moments and unbelievable clichés, but there were also a surprising number of laugh out loud moments. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play two unconventional detectives who are paired up after both facing disgrace and ending up with a police desk job. They jump in on a case and end up with a lot more than they bargained for, predictably causing mayhem along the way.The characters portrayed by Ferrell and Wahlberg are not a far cry from their usual typecasts: Ferrell is the geeky oddball and Wahlberg is the "tough-guy-jerk", and there are similarly stereotypical roles played by supporting actors such as Eva Mendes and Steve Coogan. Initially this is off-putting, but once you get into the film this becomes less cringey, however I would definitely suggest giving this film a miss if you aren't a fan of both Ferrell and Wahlberg. In typical parody-cop- film style, the film is full of predictable situations topped off with outrageous stunts and cheesy one-liners, however the stunts are fairly impressive and some of these lines provide unexpected laughs. Several of Ferrell's lines felt like a nod to his character of Ron Burgundy in Anchorman (2004), although his nerdy cop role in this is a far cry from the hilarious news anchor. The relationship between Ferrell and Wahlberg may start off ridiculous, but ends up being quite an enjoyable pairing. It doesn't present anything new or ground-breaking to the genre, but I didn't really expect anything different.Strangely enjoyable despite being one huge stereotype, this film is unexpectedly entertaining if you're in the mood for some lowbrow humour and cliché. Expect cheap laughs and crazy car chases aplenty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyably silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was childish, stupid, clichéd, and utterly hilarious. Most of the jokes work so well because they parody buddy cop movies so accurately. Will Ferrell comedies can be something of a hit and miss affair (e.g., Cowbell sketch and Anchor Man = comedy gold, Talladega Nights and Blades of Glory = not so much.) But, if you found *any* of Ferrell's other work funny, you'll probably enjoy this too as it's amongst his best.Mark Wahlberg was also pretty funny as the straight guy. (Him meeting Will Ferrell's character's wife was particularly funny.) I can't warm to him as a human being owing to his violent, racist past (as a teenager he used to throw rocks at younger black schoolkids, and he was jailed for an unprovoked, racially-motivated attack on a Vietnamese man that left him blind in one eye.) I'm all for allowing people to change, move on and become better human beings. But in Wahlberg's case I still see a lot of the arrogance and thuggery in him whenever he's being interviewed. That's why I can't really respect him as a person or as an actor. But I digress.To summarise, this film works as a comedy. It's not quite up there with some of my absolute favourite comedies like Scrooged and There's Something About Mary, but it's still pretty funny.</fullReview>

Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's wife and she is actually entertaining. Then the chief of the police station is played by Michael Keaton. Throughout the movie he kept quoting from the group TLC. He was actually also pretty funny. You will find yourself laughing a lot throughout the film. But there are some parts where they do try to be serious and most of the time it can be a turn off in a good comedy. There are some great one liners and scenes that will stick in your mind. So a pretty good comedy and I will end by saying, I want to see Mark Mahlberg do more comedic roles, because he is pretty good in them.</fullReview>

I am not in a position to judge acting, any plot flaws, script faults of quality of cinematography. Actually, if there were any bad things, they didn't disturb my experience. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.There were a lot of weird scenes, which came at you from nowhere. For example, the bar scene where Gamble and Hoitz were talking and Gamble randomly sung a random song. A tons of scenes like these. And, i guess, that is what made this movie so great in my eyes. Without all the randomness and oddities, this would be just another cop-comedy. Not that they give the film any deeper meaning or help make the story more interesting, they just made the movie to stand out from the ordinary, maybe break some stereotypes.I like Wahlberg but can't say the same for Ferrell, but, in "The Other Guys" Ferrells' character really fits in.So, everyone should put this in their watch-list ASAP :D</fullReview>

Some where you literally laugh out loud even when you watch it at home on blu ray.Michael Keatons return to the big screen was also a delight. His role as Police Chief really fit him well.

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg make a Superb Duo,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an impressive cast. It's certainly a very fun movie, with plenty of laugh out loud moments throughout and it's a superb spoof on buddy cop movies, I think it will remind people of films such as Lethal Weapon or television series like Miami Vice, it is certainly inspired by these, but it has its own fun and original take on them. The only issue I really have is that I felt there wasn't enough action, normally crime comedies have a big action packed finale that's puts the characters in more danger than we've seen them in previously, this does happen here but it isn't as exciting as the build up for it was making it seem, and it certainly ended too quickly. The cast is outstanding, all well able to adapt to a comedy that was clearly high on improvisation, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play off each other very well and are certainly the highlight of the film, they clearly really enjoyed working together, and they also have a strong supporting cast from actors such as Steve Coogan, Eva Mendes and Michael Keaton. Very funny, memorable and well acted, I would recommend the Other Guys to anyone looking for a good comedy. A pair of incompetent cops try to win the respect of their co-workers by taking on a massive case. Best Performance: Will Ferrell Worst Performance: Derek Jeter</fullReview>

The plot is rather enjoyable to follow even though, of course, it is very classic and consensual. It unfolds a bit roughly, due to a rhythm issue, which is often the case in McKay's filmography.As for the humour, the gags are, like always, quite uneven: some are very good, some fall flat, but the absurdity characterizing McKay &amp; Ferrell is still noticeable. The latter is in a great shape, whereas Wahlberg struggled throughout the movie with this unusual comic role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay film to be completely fair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be completely honest with this film. A friend of mine told me to watch 'The Other Guys' and so I gave it a go. I was particularly excited to see the great Samuel L Jackson, to see Dwayne Johnson and also so excited to see Will Ferrel and star from Ted, Mark Walberg. The film started off extremely well, but soon things began to fall downhill. The start of the film, that is until Jackson and Johnson's characters were killed, was extremely funny with great action making the premise of the story exciting. After their deaths, things went all quiet and the film lost its tone. Don't get me wrong. I thought that pretty much all the actors did a good job in this film, in particularly Will Ferrel who had some of the funnier moments, but I just don't understand what many people love this film so much. I mean, sure it had some laughs, but the plot has been so overused in many films, its actually quite boring after a little whileIn my honest opinion, I myself wouldn't recommend this to those action/comedy fans as I myself am one. Being a huge fan of the Rush Hour series, Lethal Weapon and Die Hard, I found the action in this film extremely boring and the cinematography very ordinary. The script itself isn't very inspirational, the character development doesn't really occur and things don't go that well.</fullReview>

It did have its funny moments no surprise starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg who actually make a pretty good duo together. Ferrell obviously being the more experienced comedian really stole the show and made it good. The story line was kind of unoriginal and it had a huge budget I cant possibly see how they spent it.This movie is about two cops who are desperate to become the new hero cops after the last two hero cops jumped off a building thinking a little patch of bushes would save them. They take on a new case and try to figure it out and make a name for themselves.This movie was pretty good but it was nothing special.

		<fullReview>I was skeptical about this and the first 10 minutes of the movie didn't help either. It may not be the best buddy cop parody but the level of slapstick humor can be on par with the Simpsons or Family Guy. Though it has a lot of references, it is original in its own way.Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are the most under looked cops in their department and both have their histories for it. When a spot opens up after the death of the department's super cops, Terry wants to step in with his reluctant partner. What starts off as a minor scaffolding charge escalates to a multi-million dollar fraud and these two are in the middle of it.Wahlberg reprises his role similar to that of the one he played in The Departed, void his superiority and confidence. Ferrell steals the show occasionally as most of the slapstick humor is handled by him especially the pimp back story part. The late realization of them being bribed part was funny so is Ferrell's constant bickering on his hot girl friends. It is intentionally mindless and was willing to do anything to get a laugh out of you. I don't see any innovation on other departments like music or cinematography but editing is slick.It works great if you watch with least expectations and putting your brain on hibernate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had some hilarious moments. Farrell and Wahlberg have great chemistry and I would like to see a sequel to this film. Very original comedy - Johnson and Jackson as super cops was like a movie-within-a movie. The action sequences involving them were the best I've ever seen. I'd like to see them in a buddy movie with their '71 Chevelle. Some moments were too funny - like the offhanded comment when Jackson tells Farrell to shut up or he'll... (do something with his hand). The thing about Farrell's pimping past and his hot wife was hilarious. The part where Farrell's ex-girlfriend and her loony husband..Wahlberg's neurotic machismo....throwing Farrell's gift out the window...That said, the movie had some drawbacks - the villain, a Bernie Madoff type, was too vague and uninteresting - he seemed like a nice guy, which didn't work well; not well-developed.The entire movie petered out toward the end. As in a football analogy, the fist three quarters were terrific; the fourth quarter was filled with confusing action sequences and fell flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie hilarious. Along the same lines as Tropic Thunder which was a satire of war movies, this one was a send up of cop films. You've got the crusty old chief. You've got Mark Wahlberg playing his usual tough guy cop character except this time going way over the top. And then there's Will Ferrell playing the odd, (borderline creepy) nerdish stats cop who has an uncanny and inexplicable desirability among the ladies.The plot is barely there, and is just enough to send our heroes from one mishap to another. The real gems of this movie is the interplay between Wahlberg and Farrell. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys - 3.5 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only in a film by Adam McKay will you see scenes involving cubicle flute-playing, willful self-stabbing, and testicle drum-rubbing portrayed with such passion. And only a man named Will Ferrell will do all these acts just because he can. The Other Guys succeeds in further extending McKay's and Ferrell's track record for being the most haphazardly ambitious comedians in Hollywood.A quarter pound of illegal drugs needs to be recovered, and twelve million dollars worth of property damage later, they are recovered. No thanks are due to New York City's cockiest detectives Danson and Highsmith, who are uproariously played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson. But they are not what this movie is about. Living beneath, far beneath their shadows are Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz.Danson's and Highsmith's spotlight are later emptied for reasons I shall not discuss, and Terry notices that vacant spotlight and desires to fill it at the first opportunity that he can. But he can't do it alone, and must first convince Allen to go with him in the field and prove themselves worthy of more than mere paperwork at a desk. Oh, but Allen has different, less dangerous goals than Terry, which inspires some exchange of words, a few dozen fights, and a couple of felonies if I'm not mistaken.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/the-other-guys/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Will Ferrell and Adam McKay project</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam McKay and Will Ferrell have made a variety of films. The best one being Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. We have, following it, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, and then we have the Other Guys. Step Brothers had its moments, but a lot of it was just a bunch of crude language showing itself off for no comic function. Talladega Nights is another movie I thoroughly enjoyed. I thought it was consistently funny, and vulgar in the right ways. Now I'm faced with the Other Guys, starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. This movie is different from those other movies in story, characters, but it still has the normal Will Ferrell stupid humor. This movie was very funny, yes, but it had some issues, or at least, I thought so. The vulgarity wasn't that bad, for it was a PG-13 movie, and when it was vulgar, it made sense and served comic function. The typical stupid humor, most of the time, works. Though there are some things that are TOO stupid, that just aren't funny.The story is pretty standard, but, for a Will Ferrell movie, it's good enough. There are two cops who are considered the "heroes" of their city. When they die (in a very funny way, if I can say that) there are two rookie cops, or, "the other guys." Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) is just a cop who doesn't get into the action, just sits at his desk, which he loves, and does paperwork. Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) is another one of these, except he doesn't like his job, but he was put there due to a stupid mistake he made. He yearns to be the good cop again, and pull off cases. When these two cops die, Terry drags Allen into a case to try and become the next hot shots. This story is pretty funny, for Allen knows nothing about the action part, and just the information part of it. When faced with actual action, he knows nothing about it. Terry knows nothing about the information, and is a real jerk to Allen. They try to pass this off as funny, but sometimes instead of laughing you feel bad for Allen.The movie has some funny jokes, plus a nice supporting cast, such as Michael Keaton, Eva Mendes, Steve Coogan, Rob Riggle (who may have himself a career with all the appearances he's making), etc. My only problem with this movie is Mark Wahlberg. Hold on, hold on! I love Mark Wahlberg, don't get me wrong, but he just seemed very awkward in this movie. Sure, there were some funny things that he did and said, but he just seemed awkward. Mark Wahlberg is not your typical comedy guy, and he shouldn't do it again. Comedy does not come naturally to him, he's more of a badass than a funny guy. Will Ferrell has comedy built into his genes, and he can automatically make something funny. Mark Wahlberg is more built for action movies or dramas and not comedy. It doesn't suit him, but he does have some good moments.Overall, this movie is pretty funny, but it isn't laugh out loud hilarious. Most of the laughs are just little giggles and chuckles, but nothing super hilarious. Though, it is an enjoyable movie. Would I watch it again? In the future when I've forgotten it, yes, but it wouldn't be a movie I would watch over and over.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite well made with some nice stunt work in the car chase scenes and some decent cinematography in the outdoor scenes. There are many things that let this movie down, not least is the dialogue, it's terrible! I can't remember when I've watched a film where a joke is performed and then explained afterwards! It has a 12 certificate here in the UK and (I guess) if I was twelve I might have found it funny(ish), but I'm not and it most certainly wasn't. If you want a decent cop based comedy/drama then I can recommend any of the 'Lethal Weapon' films, they are SO much better than this, which most definitely does not get my vote!... NOT Recommended.My score: 4.3/10IMDb Score: 6.6/10 (based on 76,191 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 64/100: (Based on 35 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 79/100 (based on 191 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 57/100 (based on 137,002 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I wanted to like this film. I thought Mark Wahlberg delivered an entirely believable performance in "The Departed" and was quite good in "Boogie Nights," especially for a newbie. And Michael Keaton in a supporting part is usually convincing, whether in comedy or drama. But everybody involved in this production is defeated by a script that reeks of adolescent jokes and contrived incongruity.Wahlberg and Will Ferrell are two mismatched cops who stumble without orders into an important embezzlement case involving a horde of people high up on the food chain. How's that for novelty? You want jokes? Some are reasonably pointed but this one is more typical. The NYPD are mostly testosterone-ridden goons who are into muscle cars and are fond of calling people "fruits". Wahlberg and Ferrell are riding in Ferrell's sensible little Prius hybrid coupe. Wahlberg remarks, "I feel like I'm riding in a vagina." There's a good deal of action. It goes without saying. What would a post-modern movie be like without a couple of fire balls and speeding car chases to distract the young girls and keep the young boys turgid? Only two people, I think, get killed but it's a comic moment. The two crooked cops wisecrack as they fall ten stories or so onto the pavement.But there is a cornucopia of wisecracks, most of them as flat as the two cops on the sidewalk. The whole affair reminded me somewhat of "The Squeeze," another failed comedy in which Michael Keaton appeared, as did I. The frenzied action scenes always leave a bit of room for some fitful and discordant observation that's supposed to be hilarious. After they barely scrape through a monster car pile up, a passenger remarks, "Boy, did you see that van tumble? I mean, it just went over and over." But that's not funny. It's just silly.A few situations clear the bar. One involves Ferrell's being unable to approach his house to talk to his succulent wife. The place is being watched. So Ferrell and his wife trade messages by sending Ferrell's ancient mother-in-law hobbling back and forth across the street with her geriatric walker. The hoary old lady has to convey messages along the lines of, "She wants you to ride her like a bucking bronco and do something with that electric razor on the end of the golf club." The jokes might or might not be funny but the elderly actress, Viola Harris, convinces us that her protests -- "That's too PERSONAL. I can't SAY it!" -- are sincere. She's hilarious. That's more than can be said for Ferrell, who isn't funny at all as a police accountant drawn into field work. The part was made for the Alan Arkin of thirty years ago.Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two mismatched New York City detectives seize an opportunity to step up like the city's top cops whom they idolize -- only things don't quite go as planned.Comedies come in all shapes and sizes. Some are laugh-out-loud hilarious while others while make you sit expressionless. I didn't have the highest hopes of this film, and I didn't receive the best of it either... The first thing that intrigued me was the actors. Okay, seems like a typical role for Will Ferrell, but Mark Wahlberg? Things are about to get interesting.. They both played the role well, but this leads me to the next thing; the humor. Typical comedies have this thing about jokes about penis. I consider this a type of humor, as it doesn't think of clever responses, but inserting the word 'penis' and it ends up hilarious. The Other Guys.. not so much. The humor was very dry and sarcastic and you've got to pay attention to the story to get the humor. Me, I'm not a fan of this type of humor as it seems too stupid. This is coming from a person who likes Step Brothers, 21 Jump Street, and the Hangover, but the director seemed to lose his toll. The jokes were fast and clean, and I have to admit, some parts made me laugh, but overall the humor just wasn't my thing. Everything else was okay in my opinion, but the movie's humor just fell short, as it wasn't my thing...SHOULD YOU WATCH IT? If you understand and like this type of humor, then you'll apparently love this film. It's a parody of buddy-cop films, that interestingly wasn't funny to me, but that's just me. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is worth watching for its unconventional, weird, almost new kind of comedy that can sometimes leave you confused, or cringing, but also laughing at the audacious impossibility of what you're watching. This is hardly realistic, generously exaggerated, and certainly not for everyone to be able to laugh at. But if my descriptions are making sense to you on an emotional or gut-feeling level, if you feel how a movie like that would be like, and you think you can laugh at it, then definitely watch it. A niche kind of comedy that should make the compatible audience laugh with abandon, and probably keep remembering certain lines and scenes for a long time to come.</fullReview>

The punchlines are delivered perfectly and if you don't laugh out loud then I seriously don't think you'll laugh at anything. A lot of times every good funny line they have is stuffed into the commercial, in this movie that's just the tip of the iceberg.Also Michael Keaton is hilarious as their captain.Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson play the roles of the two bad ass cops that everyone looks up to, but due to unforeseen actions they bite the bullet. So Wahlberg and Ferrell's cop characters who aren't as well received decide to pick up the slack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh...same ol' Ferrell and Wahlberg routines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this and lost all interest halfway through. Will Ferrell is sticking to his typical "serious screaming of absurd ideas" brand of comedy, which holds hands with his idea of "play old memorable tunes out of typical-movie context" to produce humor. Mark Wahlberg is such a great actor that I've seen this character in every one of his movies, except this one is slightly looser than the others. There's also a number of other actors you've seen before and explosions and TLC references that are slightly humorous still today.Call me jaded, but this was an excuse to get Will Ferrell in a somewhat-action oriented movie. I did like the over-the-top beginning and the overall teamup of Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock, but that was short-lived. And Steve Coogan annoys me, ever since seeing 24 Hour Party People. Maybe the movie just wasn't for me, but it was definitely better than Bewitched. D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this was unexpected. Compared to most cop films, this is a fresh, hilarious, and highly original movie. It took what was essentially an ordinary-guy-rising-up story and brought it to a whole new level. There are heroes and then there are the Other Guys.When the city is in need of protection, somebody has to step in as it's next generation of heroes. However, those heroes are a rather odd and mismatched duo: the docile and nerdy Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and the tough and aggressive Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). If they can get their act together, try to get over their opposing personalities, and understand what it means to be a cop, then these two detectives can solve a bewildering case surrounding a billionaire in distress (Steve Coogan).What a great flick. With excellent comedy, cool action, and an all-star cast, this movie will bring joy and laughs to you from beginning to end. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are tremendously funny, constantly arguing and throwing insults at each other as well as others around them while people are dying and things are blowing up everywhere. All the jokes are truly original and everyone, such as Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes, does a good job.I didn't expect much from this movie but now that I've seen it, it exceeded my expectations. Go see this awesome detective comedy and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Atlast! One movie of Will Ferrell's that I finally enjoyed. Although he is a very humorous guy, some of his earlier movies like Old School or Land of the Lost were so silly &amp; disappointing to me. But here, in The Other Guys, he gets a good platform(story, action, cool star cast) to be funny again(as a stupid yet nice cop Allen) with an aggressive, action partner to boot, Mark Wahlberg(as Terry).The comedy is too good, mostly due to Will Ferrell. And Mark Wahlberg provides a hilarious support.And what casting! We also have Michael Keaton(as their captain Gene), Anna Heche(as CEO Pamela), Samuel Jackson &amp; Dwayne Johnson in short appearances(as cocky detectives), Eva Mendes(as Will's wife) and another funny guy Steeve Coogan(as billionaire David). All of them do a cool job.Except for some unconvincing action sequences(including Mark coming out unscathed from a hail of bullets on every side), this is a thumbs up laugh riot.Verdict: Thank goodness, it was not just about Will Ferrell and his jokes. The Other Guys is a solid package in all aspects. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the average Hollywood comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are 'the other guys,' the faceless nobodies toiling behind the scenes while their more outgoing colleagues grab all the glory. When the city's star cops, deceived by their apparent invincibility, dive to their deaths from a 20 storey building, Wahlberg sees their demise as an opportunity for himself and his mismatched partner to grab the glory for themselves.Mismatched buddies are a staple of the comedy genre, almost as old as cinema itself, so it's a small miracle that anything fresh is ever mined after more than a century. While The Other Guys dutifully follows the Mismatched Buddies Comedy Template with a stolid lack of imagination, it does at least manage to wring a decent number of laughs ? while leaving you hoping that they don't make a sequel because its success just seems to be a sort of happy coincidence.I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell ? I've seen him in too many unfunny comedies. In fact, given that he has topped the league of least bankable movie stars (i.e. his films provide the studios with the lowest box office return for every dollar he earns) it's something of another small miracle that he's still managing to win leading roles at all. Having said that, he's pretty good in this; it would have been easy to have turned his character into a familiar buttoned down nerd, but Ferrell at least has the sense to realise that he has to let his character's true colour peek out from his dull veneer throughout the film (and not just when the script calls for him to do so). There's a reason Mark Wahlberg isn't particularly noted for his comic talents and that's because he doesn't really have any. He's not a disaster here by any means ? and at times he's pretty good ? but I was always conscious of the fact that I was watching a predominantly straight actor in a comic role. Fortunately, Michael Keaton (who, as well as acting funny, is now starting to look funny as well) is on hand to lift things when the pace starts to flag.The Other Guys probably isn't going to top anyone's favourite comedy list, but it's a solid enough comedy which arguably delivers more laughs than the average Hollywood comedy these days. It also manages to sustain a couple of running jokes that remain consistently amusing from start to finish ? no mean feat for any funny movie these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Other Guys" is part of a recent wave of big-studio comedies which revolve around neutered white/blue collar heroes, evil bosses, greedy bankers, recession woes, and directly reference the late 2000s global financial crisis. Directed by Adam McKay ("Anchorman", "Talladega Nights"), the film stars Will Ferrell and Mark Whalberg as a pair of police detectives. Desk-bound, buried in paper work and given wooden guns, they begin the film castrated and impotent (Whalberg is ashamed that his partner's car "resembles a vagina"), and so spend their days fantasizing about being powerful superheroes who "ooze machismo" and "make a difference". Gradually, however, our duo realise that anyone can be a superhero, so long as they "step up the plate", "do their jobs well" and "take down the bad guys". The bad guys being a group of corporations who run a giant Ponzi scheme, betray investors and suck money directly out of the public purse, as well as the equally unethical Obama administration, which bails out banks and businesses, green-lights "Troubled Asset Relief Programmes" and re-routes public sector money into failing companies which it deems "too big to fail". References to Bernie Madoff, Enron, Lehman Brothers etc are sprinkled throughout the film. The film then ends with a series of blunt title-cards which share statistics torn from the financial crisis. Here, amongst other things, we read what the TARP bailout really cost the American public, that after the bailout over 1.2 billion in tax payer dollars went into the bonuses of just 73 AIG executives, that Goldman Sachs got a huge tax break that saw its tax rate drop from 34 percent to just 1 percent, that the typical American retirement account has lost nearly half its value over the last five years (while CEO salaries went up 300-500 percent) etc etc. It's an odd, unexpected bit of pop agit-prop, an extended power point presentation over which Rage Against the Machine sings a cover of Bob Dylan's anti-corporate anthem, "Maggie's Farm". This credit sequence may be clunky, but it nevertheless does well to provoke us into re-reading the film which we think we just watched. In hindsight, "Guys" shows what constitutes grand theft these days, and highlights how traditional uber-masculine action hero logic is totally incapable of addressing 21st century concerns.Interestingly, Wahlberg's character spends the entire film confused and dumbfounded, blaming the film's central crime on "drug cartels" and "latino gangs". He's been indoctrinated into an antiquated brand of crime drama. But the real criminals, the film shows, are on Wall Street. They are the real "other guys", blissfully ignored by all. Meanwhile, a poster of Sylvester Stallone's "Cobra", in which Sly played a renegade police Lieutenant who violently got the job done, stands proudly in Wahlberg's apartment. The poster not only addresses the irrelevancy of the aggressively masculine ideal in a world in which muscle is incapable of bringing corporate misconduct to justice, but illuminates what constitutes true, new (fiscal) muscle. It's no "The Wire", but McKay is nevertheless right to be deliberately uncinematic and audience-unfriendly (the film's central crime is as murky to us as it is to our heroes). Of course all "corporate" and "bureaucratic" crimes are largely visually uninteresting. But it's not only that the complications of such crime don't fit typical Hollywood formulae, but that "The Other Guys'" confusion echoes the general population's confusion over the recent financial crisis. Indeed, the crisis depends on such confusion, wrapping itself up in faux mystique and deliberately convoluted "inside-speak" which the media itself propagates rather than untangles. End result: the film's heroes are as scrambled as today's populace. Many directly responsible for the crisis remain confused themselves, unable to fathom how the system they had faith in could collapse around them; but of course the system itself is dependent on a kind of irrationality, and mass, almost psychotic faith.Some of the film's jokes are fairly good, like one in which Wahlberg misunderstands the role of the Federal Reserve (and so no wonder crime happens under his nose), one in which Ferrell meets with the Securities and Exchange Commission and casually rattles off a list of all the big, recent Wall Street ripoffs the SEC failed to avert (Enron, WorldCom, Madoff, AIG etc) and one in which two cops tell a classroom of children that the best way to avoid getting arrested is to "try your hardest to not be as African-American or Latino as possible". The film pokes fun at the fall in journalism standards and the irrelevancy of debt rating agencies who give AAA ratings to companies with no integrity, but unfortunately is more content to be silly than a well thought out thematic critique of social reality. Ultimately, "Guys" is a movie about excess: financial excess, testosterone excess, American excess etc. But it also works well as a tongue-in-cheek homage to noirs (jazzy score, sprawling cityscapes, a loner hero up against faceless, impenetrable evil) and also exhibits what is now a growing trend in action movies: the self-critical action hero, ashamed of his need to be conjured up. No longer are action heroes lug-headed tough guys, or even wink-at-the-audience, ironic heroes in on the joke (Indy, Bond, McClane etc). No, now action heroes ("Green Hornet", "Suckerpunch" etc) possess a kind of critical self-reflexivity. They know, shamefully, they exist due to a certain audience or social lack.Among the cast, Wahlberg stands out. Funnier than Ferrell, he reprises his role from "I Heart Huckabees", and oozes an endearing mix of boyish vulnerability, funny earnestness and stupidly sincere wistfulness. The film's anti-corporate message is monetised and exploited by its financier, Sony Corporation, a conglomerate with its own unending list of unethical and illegal skeletons in the closet. Better art deals with this paradox. 8.5/10 ? See director's cut. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off-the-wall cops and financial frauders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, this looks to be another same-ol', same-ol' buddy cop movie after just getting over the sour taste of "Cop Out." Though this was one of the better comedies of 2010, as generic, stupid or pointless it may initially seem--it ain't. This also works as an action movie spoof that is less exaggerated than "Loaded Weapon" and "Hot Shots" and more closer to "Hot Fuzz," if still unlike. It's off in its own odd-ball world where everyday life is noteworthy and completely over-the-top silly in a way similar to the director's other works like "Anchorman" and "Talladega Nights." The simplistic story has some relating points, though the scenarios and setups in between is what makes this an amusing ride that has capability of repeating and reliving.Two NYPD detectives are begrudgingly assigned together and have to maintain the partner's code which entails getting each other's backs, except they have nothing in common to the point of being the absolute antithesis of one another. Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) is a man's man who's more street wise than book smart and also doesn't express himself through anything but anger and disapproval: a yell, a smirk, a cold stare at the slightest slip in his chauvinist view. Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) is a learned but gullible man who's the everybody-make-fun-of guy due to everything he does going strictly by the book, not to mention looking like a straight-edge accountant that he is who plays it safe behind his desk, outdated specs and the wheels of a Prius.The super cops--more like "superstars"--of the department get first dibs on calls and are practically treated like royalty. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson) wear their shades, flashy clothing and drive their muscle cars, except until they unexpectedly check out early and someone else takes their place in front of the cameras and press stands. Hoitz wants him and his tight-end partner to step up after being stuck behind a desk--or as he puts it "I am a peacock, you gotta let me fly!"--by doing everyone else's paper work. Except first they have some competition with the wise crackin' partners Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.) who can't help to mess with Gamble, such as making him do a "desk pop" and fire his gun in the office as if it's just some supposed initiation. Gamble stumbles onto some evidence after making what seems to be a pointless arrest for a financial investor named David Ershon (Steve Coogan). After the Captain (Michael Keaton) tells them to repeatedly back off, they still urge ahead as they have a gut hunch and suspect something fishy's going with other people's money. That is only after they get bribed to sports games and concerts but are too stupid to realize, not to mention are being chased by a ruthless security team headed by an Australian named Wesley (Ray Stevenson) who keeps rolling a bolder in their path.As dorky as Gamble is you realize there's another side to him, such as for some reason attracting all the fine ladies without even having to try. Hoitz is a straight shooter that you find out has something in him but is afraid to let it out, such as secretly knowing ballet, but only because he wanted to imitate how "queer" it was when younger. They have to prove themselves and reverse the decisions that landed them to desk jockey duty instead of being out there with the big boys. But first they have to dodge a couple of reprimands from the Captain who needs to keep his guys in line so he can put his bi-sexual son who wants to be a DJ through college. Now it's all about two cops going out on a limb by sifting through the politics and doing what's right. Yep, it's about as cliché as that but the story--still with some relating points about bailouts and Ponzi schemes--isn't the entire emphasis but also the inventive puns, jokes and comedic observations to go along with it about things in general, pop culture and cop movie fare.Similar to "Cop Out," this has everything a bad movie usually has, except the difference is "The Other Guys" used its purposeful set-backs to its advantage with consistent timing and the chemistry of a team to pull that off with. Otherwise, it's such an overused convention that rides a fine line that can fall on its face when not pulling off the trick without a hitch. Where would this be without some shoot outs and car chases like a good ol' cop and bad guys story even if they are even more exaggerated than what they're emulating. This is often direct, unashamed, raunchy and mean-spirited, but at the same time hilarious in that it takes it all the way to the hilt without feeling guilty about it. They say some of the most ridiculous lines but while maintaining a completely stern-faced serious look. This has an abundance of I-can't-believe-they-just-went-there snappy jokes with a well-timed comedic side on all fronts that makes this such a thoroughly and highly entertaining and fun experience that should be fresh for some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys (2010) - I'm a Peacock! Let Me Fly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam McKay and Will Ferrell are back with an even bigger comedy since "Anchorman" and "Step Brothers". Now, this Mckay-Ferrell group has brought us, "The Other Guys". The movie is a satire buddy cop feature that talks about being the hotshots, and being the next to take the dream of a lifetime. And the comedy duo of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, they both create a unique and hilarious chemistry together, and they are a perfect duo. The rest of the cast including Eva Mendes, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, and Dwayne Johnson was also hilarious, and took on newer and challenging roles. And also, it's another well-written comedy that only Adam McKay and Will Ferrell can bring. Also, the laughs are deserving, and I laughed really hard until my heart stopped beating, and it's been like that every single moment of the film. And let's not forget that the action was sweet and electrifying, and when you're watching action in a comedy like this, you're not going to regret watching this movie. The script is hilarious, the action is top-notch, the cast is crazy funny, and every single moment made you feel like you are in the experience as a real cop. "The Other Guys", is an awesome comedy, which contains an entire laugh that keeps going and going to the same tune as your heart beating. "The Other Guys", in my review, "smart writing and hilarious material, a perfect buddy satire".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Other guys is a freak'n hilarious movie. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg have great comic chemistry, and both their characters were funny. For a comedy, The Other Guys has surprisingly good plot, and the action scenes and set direction were both fantastic. Every joke was original and extremely funny I was laughing really hard during the whole movie. The first time I saw this movie was in the theaters, but I recently bough the DVD and enjoyed it even more the second time around! So over all, it's a well done and side splittingly funny comedy definitely see The Other Guys. Also for people who own the DVD there's a funny scenes after the credits so stick around for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two cops, corporate fraud and the best Toyota Prius ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys is Will Ferrell's best film since Anchorman and by far one of the best comedies in recent years. Many had thought Ferrell was going back to the same well too many times with recent efforts like Blades of Glory and Semi-Pro, which were lazy rip-offs of better Ferrell sports comedies like Talladega Nights. However, this is great material for him to work in and his long-time partner, writer/director Adam McKay, brilliantly exploits all the laughs as much as possible. Added to the mix is Mark Wahlberg, an actor better known for his serious, dramatic turns but is in fact one of the best comedic actors working today. His performance as the gun-toting, crazily ambitious Detective Terry Hoitz is genius in the way it combines fearless recklessness and sympathetic empathy. Wahlberg shows he has true talent in many genres; hopefully he will continue to make comedies in addition to dramas.As for the film itself, it works on every level imaginable. First, and most importantly, it is flat-out hilarious. For 107 minutes, there are dozens of laughs, mostly one-liners zinged by Ferrell, Wahlberg and the very underrated Michael Keaton as the TlC-influenced captain. However, there are also some wonderful sight gags, a few breathless car chases and a coherent subplot involving corporate fraud and conspiracy cover- up. Of course, the real plot is about these two opposite partners coming together. Ferrell and Wahlberg have such remarkable chemistry it's a wonder they haven't worked together before. Yet, now we know. Hopefully, this isn't the last we've seen of this duo nor this type of cop-spoof film. Laughs at every turn and a wise script that covers all its bases combined with a first-rate cast that includes Eva Mendes, The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson as supporting characters, there is very little to not like about The Other Guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tend to have mixed feelings about Will Ferrell films. Ferrell is a likable guy and plays likable characters, but often his films feel a little too much like extended Saturday Night Live sketches; even if they're funny, they just don't have that much to them.But I love The Other Guys. The premise is unexceptional, a mismatched buddy movie about two undistinguished cops who stumble into a big case, but the movie is wildly funny.One of the things I love about this movie is how everyone plays it straight. Ferrell is almost as low key here as a cop-accountant as he was in Stranger Than Fiction, and while the movie is often extremely silly, no one in it ever gives a hint that they know it (although Ferrell has a few over-the-top moments that have that SNL cartoonish feel to them that I could have done without). Wahlberg doesn't act like he's making a cop movie parody, he acts like he's making a cop movie. There is a certain odd realism in moments where the heroes pull off something clever or dazzling and take a moment to be impressed with themselves.Mainly though, this movie is just really, really funny. I could not stop laughing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it without knowing any plot or storyline and I thought it was hilarious! The dialogue was random and will Ferrell killed it. The whole cast provided a well rounded movie. Yes the storyline was sort of on the weak side but the humor was enough to support it. Mark wahlberg performed well for someone I'm used to having somewhat serious movies. The two complimented each other in some weird way. Maybe because they weren't in the same type of movies before. The other characters had their own humor to add: Michael Keaton as the captain quoting tlc songs? Martin and fosse blurbs? The British billionaire guy (forgot his name)? They were all hilarious on their own rite and added more to wahlberg and ferrell's dynamic</fullReview>

To me his films have always been a little stupid, somewhere between too over the top or not enough over the top at the same time. Some how they have managed to gel it into the right mix with this one where you don't feel like an idiot watching it and it's good. It really feels like wil (and some other SNL latelys) has always wanted to do what John and Dan did with movies but none of them ever got it right mostly using outrageousness to make up for talent. this movie has the feel and the quality/talent of the good SNL movies. Like baby bear's porridge it's not much and not too little, it's just right. I would assume that the director had a lot to do with it. So in conclusion I have to say this should be the beginning of a new career for wil where his movies are funny to all not just to those that "get" him</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frenetic Buddy Cop Comedy Starts Strong But Peters Out in a Convoluted Storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parts of this rambunctious 2010 buddy-cop action comedy are hilariously funny, but director Adam McKay ("Anchorman") can't seem to keep up the momentum he sets up in the movie's first fifteen frenetic minutes. Perhaps due to Will Ferrell's presence, it starts to feel like a feature-length manifestation of one of his Funny or Die videos or at its worst, a padded skit from "Saturday Night Live". On the upside, pairing Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg as mismatched and thoroughly inept NYPD desk jockeys is inspired casting and provides several giddy moments, but the screenplay co-written by McKay and Chris Henchy fails to sustain its satirical edge throughout the course of the story.Ferrell plays mild-mannered Allen Gamble, who is perfectly content as a precinct pencil-pusher. He's partnered with Wahlberg's Terry Hoitz, a hot-headed screw-up desperate to get his old beat back. Terry lost his self-confidence as well as his gun when he inadvertently shot Derek Jeter before a Yankees game, a tactical error that has made him the subject of constant ridicule at the station. Both Allen and Terry idolize the superstar macho detectives (played with comic relish by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) who have caused millions of dollars of damage in their relentless pursuit of the city's biggest crime rings. When their fate gets sealed in a most surreal stunt jump, Terry and Allen begin to piece together a convoluted white-collar conspiracy involving a billionaire's plan to cover the losses he has incurred for a multinational conglomerate.In the meantime, the reluctant partners get to know each other personally and discover some intriguing surprises, including Allen's hot, attentive physician wife Sheila. Whether spouting Zen-like psycho-babble or driving his tomato-red Toyota Prius, Ferrell is in typical deadpan form here except when reenacting his outrageous college years as a pimp. Wahlberg works best when he acts incredulous at his circumstances such as seeing a surprisingly funny Eva Mendes as Sheila helplessly smitten with Allen. It's also good to see Michael Keaton back in fine comic form as the precinct captain who moonlights at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and cannot help but share his wisdom by quoting TLC lyrics.Steve Coogan manages a few funny moments as the targeted billionaire, as do Ron RIggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. as a competitive pair of bumbling partners. The 2011 DVD offers only three extras - a ten-minute making-of featurette ("Crash and Burn!: On the Set of The Other Guys") which focuses mostly on the opening sequence; a four-minute short focused on unused scenes of Keaton at his retail job; and five deleted scenes. The Blu-Ray disc adds several more featurettes; a gag reel; an audio "mom-mentary" recorded by the mothers of Ferrell, McKay, and Henchy; the music video for the closing credits version of "Pimps Don't Cry"; a Judd Apatow-like "Line-o-rama"; and even more deleted and extended scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell, Hollywood's staple man in comedy for some years now, re-teams with director Adam McKay for The Other Guys, a buddy-cop comedy that definitely has its moments, but is ultimately nothing you haven't already seen before. Ferrell typically delivers his best work alongside McKay (their co-op resume includes such laugh riots as Anchorman, Talladega Nights and Step Brothers) and this time they bring along hardman Mark Wahlberg, relishing the opportunity to somewhat break the mould and showcase his comedic talents.The mismatched pair plays Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg). The former is content to sit at his desk filing paperwork all day for the local police station, while the latter would rather be out on the streets, making a real difference in the city. Due to a, let's say, lack of staff, they are put on the case of shifty tycoon David Ershon, who's felonies turn out to be more serious than just his failure to apply for a scaffolding permit.From the outset, it's clear Ferrell and Wahlberg enjoyed their time on the set. While the plot, set pieces and screenplay display little to no innovation, it is the chemistry between the two leads that regularly delivers laughs out of situations that could have fallen very flat with the wrong combination. With such a stale, oft-worked film genre, it is difficult for those involved to keep the audience's attention solely on the comedy. They don't exactly reinvent the wheel, but Will and Mark work wonders with what they have.Running jokes grow tiresome after a while, though. Subliminal TLC references from Michael Keaton's (remember, he used to be Batman?) police captain and Allen's subconscious ability to attract beautiful women are, frankly, used too often at times where other, more refreshing ideas could have been exploited. But going back to the subject of actor combinations, an honourable mention must go to Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne John- who am I kidding, he's still The Rock, who play the heroic cop stereotypes to great effect. Their final scene is arguably the funniest in the entire film, combining music, slow-motion and a throwaway line so appropriate it's already earnt itself a spot in the Urban Dictionary. And well done to McKay for adhering to Article 39 of the Movie Code: Any film post-1994 starring Jackson must contain at least one Pulp Fiction reference.On the whole, I had feelings of indifference towards The Other Guys. Because this is one of those disheartening final products in which the funniest parts were packed into a two-and- a-half-minute trailer, I left inarguably underwhelmed. I wouldn't discourage anyone who hasn't seen it to go and watch, but certainly feel under no compulsion to watch it again myself, or anticipate its home release. A lack of depth in most technical filmmaking categories, but points for Ferrell, Wahlberg and most of the cast for efforts that produce satisfactory results, just about the definition of 'average.'*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great social commentary with equal hilarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>thefilmsmith.com It seems as quickly as Will Ferrell hit it big, he was already on his way down. From Land of the Lost to Blades of Glory, Ferrell has worn out his welcome with many people due mainly to meeting a saturation point. Which is why it would be a shame if people missed The Other Guys, one of the best comedies of 2010.The first act of the film features an over the top car chase with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson in pursuit of some petty criminals. The scene is a thing to behold, but the comedic punch arrives when reporters ask the two supercops if the 15 million dollars in damages was worth the misdemeanor offenses by the criminals. This lets you know immediately that this is going to be a cop satire equal to Hot Fuzz.The film could stand to lose 30 minutes worth of fluff, but it subverts the traditional cop film (drugs, prostitutes, blue collar crime) to focus on white collar crime as the U.S. reels from the economic collapse wrought by such characters. It's a scathing critique of cop films, highlighting the lack of independent power in the SEC (which is supposed to prevent the types of crimes that plunged the U.S. into its worst recession since The Great Depression), and the way our judicial system allows white collar crime to fade into unimportance. Hilarious (directed by Anchorman director Adam McKay) and scathing in its critique. You have to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A winning buddy movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys deceptively opens with a police chase that features P.K. Highsmith ( Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) as the two most kick ass cops in New York. The scene establishes the tone of the movie as completely ridiculous as well as entertaining, The Other Guys does a wonderful job of not taking itself seriously and the humor just gushes forth.Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Whalberg) are a hopelessly mismatched pair of NYC Detectives that are stuck behind desks doing the paperwork for the big shot hero cops, Highsmith and Danson. Gamble is a complete nerd and is very happy to sit behind a desk, but his partner is more action oriented and when Highsmith and Danson are killed in the line of duty (it's a silly death) Hoitz drags Gamble away from the desk at gunpoint to the scene of the latest high-profile crime. Thus the buddy movie formula begins as the unlikely duo seek to track down the criminal mastermind of a $32 billion financial fraud that nobody believes is happening.Whalberg has a gift for comedy and his delivery really helps ground the insanity of the film and make it just that much funnier. Will Farrell is very much at the top of his game. His humor is more mature and less in-your-face for most of the film, which makes it even funnier in those moments where he really lets loose and steals the spotlight. The movie makes great use of recurring comedic themes and callbacks without overdoing it and the supporting cast, especially Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton), is very good. The Other Guys is a wonderful, quotable buddy movie that I will be very happy to add to my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Other Guys" is an action-comedy starring Will Ferrell &amp; Mark Wahlberg as a pair of mismatched New York City detectives. The strait-laced Ferrell &amp; the disgraced Wahlberg initially don't get along but they manage to put aside their differences when they finally get the chance to tackle a high-profile investigation.The two leads, Ferrell &amp; Wahlberg, turned out to be a much better team than I expected. Here, Ferrell is mostly subdued while creating humour through quirkiness rather than manic energy. Wahlberg mostly plays the straight man to Ferrell's antics but he occasionally shows a flair for comedy all his own. In support, Michael Keaton makes a welcome appearance and Eva Mendes ably holds her own with Ferrell &amp; Wahlberg. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson &amp; Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson are featured early on as a pair of stereotypical hero cops.In the director's chair, Adam McKay competently steers the film from comedy to action set-pieces. The script, co-written by McKay &amp; Chris Henchy, sends up buddy cop movies with more verve than most films of this type. The plot, meanwhile, is decent enough but not especially compelling. The soundtrack deserves praise, though. Rage Against the Machine, the White Stripes and Foo Fighters rub elbows with unlikely suspects like Donovan, Phil Collins and the Mamas &amp; the Papas.All in all, "The Other Guys" delivers comedically from beginning to end. I can see people not necessarily sharing the film's sense of humour but I was pleasantly surprised to find a comedy that didn't resort to recycling all of the same jokes all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrell and Wahlberg Deliver the Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other Guys, The (2010) *** (out of 4) Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play opposite types of detectives who find themselves paired up with sometimes disastrous results. After several failed police issues, the two men find themselves on a mysterious case involving a financial backer who might have more than one group after him. I will admit right off that I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell and there have been many times where I'm left blind as to why people find him funny. I'll admit that I rarely go by trailers when it comes down to watching movies but the teaming of Ferrell with Wahlberg just seemed too promising to pass up and the film actually works for the majority of the running time. I say the majority because the final thirty-minutes start to run out of gas as the jokes stop flying as fast and we're left with a lot of silly action scenes with way too much CGI explosions. The first hour is one major laugh as another as the screenplay is going several miles a minute in terms of jokes being thrown around. You get the typical humor involving Ferrell being kicked on for being a nerd but you also get a nice running gag of every hot woman wanting his body. Ferrell fits the role perfectly because he can come across as that dork that gets picked on but when it comes down for him to snap he also handles it perfectly well. I really loved the stuff where he has a flashback to his college days when he worked as a pimp and how the pimp dialogue finds its way of coming out of him. Wahlberg isn't the greatest comedic actor in the world but I think he manages to role very nicely. He has no problem bringing the toughness of the character but I thought his comic timing was extremely good especially in the scenes where he struggles to understand why Ferrell is getting all these beautiful women. The supporting cast is pretty good as we get Eva Mendes showing off her body and Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson supply a pretty funny cameo. It was also great seeing Michael Keaton back in a nice role. The humor is all over the place as we get gay jokes, dirty sex jokes and a hilarious bit that mixes the two as homeless gay men have an orgy in the back of Ferrell's car. Everything that follows the "investigation" into his stolen car will have tears running down your face. As I said, THE OTHER GUYS eventually runs out of gas but it's still worth viewing for the first hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Case That Will Make Them Heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys in this film are Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, a pair of NYC detectives who have gotten really far off the fast track in terms of career mobility. Wahlberg while on security duty at Yankee Stadium shot Derek Jeter mistaking him for a an unauthorized prowler, nobody's letting him live that down though I'm sure in Wahlberg's native Boston people were going to name children after him. As for Ferrell he worked before in the highly unglamorous forensic accounting division and one with computer knowledge can gain a detective's shield there. Being a true bureaucrat at heart he delights in doing the paperwork for the other detectives in the squad.But these two mismatched partners or at least Ferrell given his background get the scent of a massive defrauding scheme when they spot a Bernie Madoff type tycoon being kidnapped. Later on it's denied and the tycoon played by Steve Coogan shows up all hale and hearty and in a forgiving, but put out mood. The more they pursue this, the more warnings they get to back off, some of them real direct like a bomb going off at a mall account's office in New Jersey.Still our heroes persist and in the end the case will make them the hero of every cop in New York City. More I cannot say, but it will make up for shooting the Yankee captain.Ferrell is funny as always and Wahlberg has done comedy before and done it well. Eva Mendes is Mrs. Ferrell and it bugs Wahlberg no end how such a nerdy guy like Ferrell can land Eva Mendes as a life partner. Let's say that he's got a lot in his background as well, not typical for an accountant, but in a former line of work Ferrell was in you have to keep good accounts as well.Nice location cinematography in New York make The Other Guys something to enjoy and realize that heroes can come from the oddest places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Other Guys is actually a pretty funny movie exactly what I expected it to be. Will Ferrell was somewhat annoying at times but then again he always is. I cracked up at the jokes many times especially the ones made by Johnson and Jackson. This movie is no Lethal Weapon but it's a good buddy cop movie nonetheless.This is about two cops who are in the office all day doing nothing but paperwork. Wahlberg's character decides that he wants action but his partner doesn't. Once the cops played by Jackson and Johnson dies, they may get their chances.The acting is awesome. Ferrell is funny in some parts. Wahlberg plays the tough boy he always is. Jackson still is the wisecracking dude even though he's up there in age. Michael Keaton is hilarious as the Captain.Some of the jokes were bland but the rest were funny. My favorite joke, even though I'm a big Yankees fan, was when Wahlberg shot Derek Jeter. I thought that was hilarious.Overall, this is a good action/comedy to see after you are finished watching Lethal Weapon. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good - would watch it again sometime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a recent movie that does not feature Samuel L. Jackson?Probably, but this movie stars the unlikely combination of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as two poorly matched big city police detectives who do the paperwork and leave the heroism to others (Jackson and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson). Wahlberg may be an action star but this movie is dominated by Ferrell's usual comedy/spoof genre. Just as there is only a little action for Wahlberg, there is only some of Ferrell's usual style of humor.Ferrell and Wahlberg play two cops who have little in common. Nevertheless, the Ferrell/Wahlberg partnership works well to produce a better than average action/comedy/police film. As if to emphasize the nature of this flick, Michael Keaton stars as the police captain who moonlights at Bed Bath and Beyond.If you want to see Wahlberg in an action movie, check out Shooter or Max Payne. If you want to see Ferrell doing his stuff then watch Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Those movies are examples of each of these two stars at their best. This movie shows them both running in 2nd gear, still pretty good I think.This movie is good enough to watch now and again sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shift in tone for McKay, bring on The Boys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam McKay could make terrible films for the rest of his career if he so chose, because the man is responsible for 'Anchorman'- the defining comedy of a generation and one of the funniest films ever made (FACT). He made Will Ferrell an international superstar, and hasn't made a movie without him since.Ferrell has a lot of stick, actually, and some of it's quite unfair. He gets a lot of criticism for "playing the same role" time and again. Well, that's simply not true. Ron Burgandy is almost a separate entity, and here he plays a dull, introverted detective who differs from all three previous McKay collaborations as much as they do from one another. It's an understated comic performance for the most part, allowing (oscar winning) Mark Whalberg an opportunity for some laughs- and the two surprisingly gel quite well on screen.The action-comedy genre is populated with cop/buddy movies: Rush Hour, 48 Hours, The Man (urgh) and the recent Cop Out- but what's striking about McKay's effort is that it's tonally more similar to 48 Hours; both films having a streak of darkness running through them. The comedy is sometimes black (Ferrell attempting to stop a potential 'jumper' from plummeting to his death with words of encouragement- and failing), sometimes heroically juvenile (the departure of Jackson and Johnson's super-cops is so funny to look at I laugh simply when I remember it in my head) but pretty much always funny.It has its pitfalls though- Ray Stevenson (so likable in 'Rome', so repugnant here) is criminally underused in this movie as one of a pantheon of potential threats, and Michael Keaton too (although a police captain who also works at Bed Bath and Beyond is a twist on his usual dual-personality roles) is always welcome to more screen time. Perhaps the romantic entanglements could have been sacrificed in exchange for more time with these characters and the wonderful Steve Coogan (Whalberg's love interest serves no purpose but to facilitate a mildly amusing recurring joke wherein Whalberg has learned ballet and the harp during his childhood in order to mock the 'fairies', and Eva Mendez is trying a bit too hard to be funny).McKay has played down the "whacky" aspect of his comedy in order to produce a functional and entertaining action/comedy; a (slightly) more mature tone and some impressive skill with action and effects sequences. Some may have previously suggested his landing of "The Boys" adaptation was a mistake- after watching 'The Other Guys', you can see how it is a bridge between his previous films and what is to come. I think he'll handle it magnificently, and given that subject matter it will hopefully inspire him to a whole new world of possibilities within his own original material.I was quietly impressed by this film; a well engineered action-comedy flick which surpasses most others in the genre (namely Cop Out). Except for 'Pineapple Express', but that's a personal choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This looks like such a terrible concept and with the wrong casting it would be but it's cast so well that it just about works.Marky Mark is so sincere that the Cop Movie genre aspect of this film works &amp; I just love watching Will Ferrell riff away like a proper mad'un &amp; here he does that in Talladega Nights style. If you're a fan of his, you have to see it as he's in good form. His "pimping past" is bloody funny.I cant really recall the film's plot as such. Much has been said about its anti-capitalist stance... MmmmHmmm... Whatever, as a simple buddy movie, I enjoyed it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys - A Wavy Davy Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys is a straightforward comedy with little freshness or flair, and only looks good in comparison with this years other buddy-cop movie, Cop Out.Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson play New York's top cops but the movie focuses on 'The Other Guys' - two desk-cops with differing ambitions - played by Will Ferrell (Anchorman) and Mark Wahlberg (Max Payne). The movie follows this mis-matched pair as they try to claim the glorious title of top-spot within the New York police department. The main problem with 'The Other Guys' is that the laughs do not come consistently enough. There are some very funny moments - for instance when Will Ferrell apologises for his lovely, stunning wife (Eva Mendes). It is only Ferrell who generates laughs, though, and Mark Wahlberg comes across as an annoying and angry man. Steve Coogan (Tropic Thunder) and Michael Keaton make appearances, but especially Coogan has some terribly unfunny lines which is a shame because he has a lot of comedic talent. The story is also too complicated for a cop-comedy film. It follows Steve Coogan's character who is somehow involved in a series of financial crimes, as well as a jewel heist. It is also worth mentioning that some of the scenes make you wonder, how did he know he would be there? Wahlberg just seems to turn up in similar places in New York to Ferrell for little or no reason, other than the fact that they both hang out in these places (unbeknownst to each other).Overall, there are a few scenes which are genuinely funny, but ultimately there are not enough to sustain the audience's interest. If you are looking for a very stupid comedy then you will get a few laughs, but more serious film-goers will not particularly enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Hoitz's past mistakes in the line of duty and Allen Gamble's reluctance to take risks have landed them the roles of the "Other Guys", disgraced New York City police detectives relegated to filling out paperwork for cocky hero cops Danson and Highsmith. The mismatched duo must look past their differences when they take on a high-profile investigation of shady capitalist David Ershon and attempt to fill the shoes of the notoriously reckless officers they idolise.Being a big fan of Ferrall and Wahlberg, I was expecting a hell of a lot from this film, and i got what I asked for In the first two acts, which were laugh out loud funny. But not from your typical Ferrall screaming and shouting shtick he seems to do in every other one of his films. it was the tension between the two characters in the first half that had me laughing.The lion and the tuna piece has to be some of the most silliest and pointless dialogue written in a film in a while, but it worked, and a simple line such as 'we would find out where you live' is turned into priceless comedy.Saying that that, the story is about as good as Lethal weapon 3, namely is about some money being owed to someone else, and if it isn't paid, there's trouble. its that simple. simple enough to call it a sub-plot.The real thing here is the role reversal between the two leads through out the film. One seems insecure, the other doesn't and then you realise that these are not the people you expected them to be.The writing and narration are fluid and hilarious, but with most buddy cop comedies, it runs out of steam long before the end. Jackson and Johnson are great in self deprecating roles, and Keaton should do a lot more comedy.It's the sort of film that has spurts of genuine hilarity, and then it just tails off onto annoying characters who offer nothing for the film and slow it down too much.but it's a lot better than Talladega nights, so it can't be that bad.one of the better comedies of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stopped the film after about 30mins, it's just too stupid for me... I was very hopeful because of the actors playing in this movie but I was very deceived. I think the acting was maybe bad or the jokes too dry I don't know. Or it has to be brought in a different way. I hope anyone else likes this movie better. I was even surprised to see that it has a 6.6/10 quotation??? Strange, I'm certain a lot of people have seen plenty of movies that are much much better than this one!If you like stupid jokes, this is for you. If you love a good comedy, thy to find something else to watch...See for yourself and vote!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has one good thing going for it and that is Mark Wahlberg. The question is- why the hell did Mark do this movie? It sucks. It is hardly funny. It's the kind of humor that a 10 year old might appreciate. Some raunchy jokes and windowlicker slapstick.Idiot Farrell (Hollywood's biggest jerk) gets paired with tough guy bully Wahlberg in cop world. The two are the precinct's 'odd couple' (how many times can Hollywood regurgitate THAT theme...?) and they try to crack a big case.I don't know what else to say, I guess I should turn back the clock to 1994 and start smokin weed again, maybe I'd appreciate this drivel.2 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The usual rubbish unrealistic action, that what the movie is about, at least, if you can judge it by it's first few minutes. And, ..., that is what I've done. If you start a movie with a ridiculous car chase with guns blazing but nobody get's hurt I think you've set the tone for the movie. What is wrong with Hollywood these days (years)? Why can't they keep it realistic? You empty the magazine of a machine gun (the magazines never empty) onto a car and everything get's hit except the windscreen and the occupants? Car jumps that simply can't be real, a real car would slam and crash, over, out. I personally did not watch more as the first 5 minutes of this movie, I was prepared to like it, I was bitterly disappointed. Why can't they make car chases like in the best car chase movie, Ronin? Why does it all need to be unrealistic? What is wrong with some good old proper chases, proper shooting, proper science, not all this nonsense? The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of 1 was that there was a bit of humor. But, just don't bother, it's a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I paid to see it in the theater. Actually, a guy took me along. Regret that. Not the date, but the movie, and so did he...the movie that is. There was a lot of dead time after most of the 'joke' moments, and the jokes missed?sometimes by a lot. Too bad Michael Keaton wasn't 10 years younger and he could have played both of the 'other guys' by himself. What the heck, he did it in multiplicity. Now that was funny! Keaton is brilliant with this sort of comedy. Any sort of comedy, for that matter. I wanted more Keaton! (my dad's a big Keaton fan, so I've seen all of them). I will give it to Ferrell, he did his job very well. But the jokes or the timing wasn't there for some reason with his partner, and we all like Walhberg (meow!), but they didn't team up right or something. Then again, maybe it was the writing or editing. But it wouldn't be the editing because comedy should be on all the players. It's timing, reaction, playing off each other, good material, give and take (like the Marx brothers, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, Wilder and Feldman, Eugene Levy and John Candy or Keaton?I'm a chip off the old block, dad loved the classics). It's about chemistry. I don't think the studios are going to rush out anytime soon to make another Ferrell/Walhberg comedy. But the Rock and Sam Jackson, now there's a thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know. Maybe I just don't get it. I don't get spoofs I guess. Airplane was funny too, but, seriously, can you rate a movie higher than a 5/10 just for being more than funny? This one I can't. Maybe it's just Will Ferrell. Honestly, Mark Wahlberg in a comedy? Maybe I don't get that either. Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock looked like they were just having fun, who wouldn't doing that kind of a bit? There's some kinds of comedy that deserve more than a 5/10 rating, but I guess they just aren't spoofs in my book. Cop shows are what I live for. I've been addicted to L&amp;O SVU for the past 10 years I think, and I used to like the regular L&amp;O stuff sometimes. CSI shows are OK too. Heck, I've watched cop spoofs before, and I've seen spy spoofs, going back all the way to Get Smart (does that date me?), some of it's good, some is OK. I didn't find much redeeming about this movie, just funny is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam McKay brings you a rolling laugh riot that 'turns on' a witty guy. If you have seen Mark Wahlberg's splendid performance as a tough guy in flicks like "Shooter" and top cop in "Max Payne" you should now be ready to get surprised, he is so versatile that he could 'act a fool' with the same cop costumes. With Will Ferrel giving the lead, Mark Wahlberg takes you to a roll-out laugh riot by failing every time they become desperate to shine. With no spoof and lot of pun, The Other Guys is a true entertainer for the grown ups who understand sarcasm, parody, pun and occasionally read a business newsprint with special interest in corporate scams! Adam Mckay does a Christopher Nolan (Inception) by packing many twists that trigger your interest and tickles your funny bone. My advice, try holding your pop-corn tight, you might spill them all by laughing out loud.</fullReview>

Will seemed to only be on 25% thrusters here, and even seemed to play the straight man to Wahlberg most of the film which was odd. Even Steve Coogan (Alan Partridge) is completely wasted. There are 3-4 funny moments (classic Ferrell outbursts) but it is a truly lame duck. By the end I was so bored and couldn't wait for it to finish. It is wrapped in some sort of semi- serious plot about financial crime which is overly-complex and pointless - who cares?! I never understand comedies that try to put in serious plot lines as if the audience will care.AVOID!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet the other guys.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy film puts Will Ferrell back in the right direction. He still has some ways to go before becoming actually funny again, but with the help of his long time collaborator and new comer Marky Mark Wahlberg, we have a slightly funnier comedy than one would expect. The Other Guys is in the vein of Hot Fuzz, only with less jazz and more stupid Ferrell humour. It takes the buddy cop action film genre and parodies it. Sam 'The Man' Jackson &amp; Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson are two egocentric big time cops who will do more than millions of dollars in damages to the city just to bust some people running dope. Tango &amp; Cash on steroids. Their untimely exit (you knew it happened, come on) gives the others guys a chance to shine. The other guys are of course Ferrell and Wahlberg. Two polar opposites that when together make for some laughs. Wahlberg plays up on his bad boy rep as he berates Ferrell every chance he gets. This is a fish out of water style of film for Wahlberg who finally just seems to have found his footing in comedy. Specifically this style of comedy. Ferrell tones it down a notch, but does his typical long winded comedic bits at others. His backstory involving hoes and pimps was a huge misfire in my opinion. Eva Mendes is the sexy wife who gets nothing to do but be the good looking woman of the film. Her role is minute and her talents are kind of wasted, she does the best she can with the material. I really dug Michael Keaton as the Captain. With this film and Toy Story 3, I hope he has the comeback his so deserves. The comedy is really hit and miss. I expected it to be a lot worse. As far as McKay and Ferrell comedies go, it's pretty light. It's more grounded than their previous efforts and actually has a bit of plot to give the viewer. The Other Guys is a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cocaine covered Prius? And here I thought I had seen it all...Well, first of all, with an impressive cast like in this movie, you cannot go wrong. Sure enough, "The Other Guys" truly does deliver. This is a really, really nice action-comedy.Lets start off with the action. There is a lot of action in the movie, but funny action and action-action! And it works well when put together. It is not hilarious as most Jackie Chan movies, but it still comes off as a good result.And as for the comedy? Well, it is not the type that will have you sprawled on the floor, hunched over with tears streaking down your cheeks. The humor here is more like gentle slaps in the face, and there is a constant underlying humor throughout the entire movie.The actors in the movie were superbly cast. Just seeing Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson in those two roles, that was off the chart. They were right for those whacked roles. And also hats off to Michael Keaton for his performance. But not forgetting the two main actors, the chemistry between Will Ferrel and Mark Wahlberg was so good. They worked so well opposite one another."The Other Guys" is good entertainment from start till end. There is a constant flow to the movie, and it never grows stale or boring. There is always something just waiting around the corner, and that really makes it worth watching it for.This is one of the better action-comedies I have seen in quite awhile. Compared to movies like "Cop Out" or "Date Night", then "The Other Guys" is off the charts. It beats other movies by a long shot. Thumbs up for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light hearted action-comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whalberg and Ferrell are a terrific team. Whalberg hasn't really ever done comedy before, with the exception of his wonderfully amusing turn in The Departed (which earned him a nod from Oscar). But like his performance in Scorsese's Best Picture winning crime saga, he rarely plays it for laughs as the highly-strung Hoitz ? a couple of "peacock" moments aside ? instead choosing to generate his humour as the straight, albeit tempestuous, character. After a string of less than impressive movies in the previous few years ? The Happening, Max Payne, We Own the Night, The Lovely Bones ? hopefully this return to form marks a comeback.In the other corner, Ferrell provides his usual big child routine, yet again producing hilarious results. His random verbal rants ? the tuna fish monologue is outstanding ? are delivered with an almost monosyllabic tone and very few facial expressions, making the matter-of-fact diatribes even more entertaining. The talented supporting players don't contribute as much as they should have. Keaton didn't resonate as the TLC-quoting Captain, Coogan is plain unfunny as the weaselling capitalist and the intentionally over-the-top portrayals by Jackson and Johnson as vainglorious cop partners didn't hit the funny bone as much as I was expecting.Director McKay keeps it simple. He allows his odd-couple stars to do the bulk of the work and minimises the rest. Of the very few directional flairs on show, a scene midway through presenting a big night out with a roaming camera and motionless images is amazingly effective and eye-boggling flashy. Elsewhere you have a satirical soundtrack that accentuates that parody-esquire tone of the film and a handful of cunningly written scenes that takes the Mickey out of Hollywood with a blithe glee.But this is the Whalberg-Ferrell show and their chemistry guarantees a light-hearted 107 minutes of action-comedy.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wasn't really looking forward to seeing this one just by watching the trailers. Altogether "The Other Guys" was somewhat entertaining but really didn't deliver much. Usually after a Will Ferrell movie, you have a few scenes or lines that are stuck in your head for the week. It almost seemed as if this film needed a few more writers on board. Don't get me wrong I laughed out loud at times, but it wasn't a memorable experience.I think I would have liked this movie a lot more when I was 12, but for any adult, it was kinda boring. It was funny to see old Marky Mark yell at Will Ferrel, but the gimmick wore off quickly. Again not to many memorable jokes, but worth watching on Netflix a year from now.Rating = D- VideoGameHollywood.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially a great movie, but a flop in current state.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went and saw the other guys I was surrounded by males, ranging from fourteen to about twenty-five, and then other ranging ages filling in, but not as populated as the ones mentioned. Going to see this movie, there was hope for entertainment, humor so one could laugh, and yes there was that. The movie had great physical humor when it was acted out right and a pretty well laid out attention grabbing plot.But, this movies plot was all out of "whack". The flow, the acting, it was just in pieces. Though people find "Mark Wahlberg" to be an awesome actor, which I have enjoyed his pieces before this, he fell short. His mission to accomplish the personality of an uptight driven cop became this spastic waste of screen time. I am a fan of him but this was a waste of his talent. One could tell in the action scenes that is what he is meant to do, that is where he excels. But when he would try and be funny, it made me get aggravated because I felt it to be to forced. When I complained this to my company I was with, they believe that is was made the movie so funny, but the humor has no substance if it is idiotic and choppy. The flow was totally interrupted every time Wahlberg little bits would come in and it would make all the scenes diminish from what they could have been. Now I am not blaming Wahlberg's acting on this, I am blaming the directors and all those who saw this going down, and actually thought it was a good thing. Most people want to try new things and step out of their safety zones but this was too far out and it just did not fit.One movie that this one could have taken notes from is "Superbad". I feel like their characters made the movie because they were awkward, and played into their roles as awkward people. McLovin was on of the most awkward characters especially when at party and around girls, but he pulls it off. His nerdy-ness was used for the better in that movie. That makes me believe that Wahlberg's hard ass personality should have been worked in better. Though it was present it was tainted by making him look a little psychotic. Will Ferrell has never had a problem making people laugh and its because he embraces how he is funny, with awkward situational, sometimes physical humor. That is something that Wahlberg did not have or did not do, or was not intended to do. Maybe that was the point for Wahlberg's acting, maybe that was what he was told to do, but it made the movie a flop for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby), this looked like a buddy cop comedy that may be reasonably funny, so I gave it a chance. Basically NYPD detectives P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) are the bad boys of the law and the best cops of New York City, until they make a hasty decision that turns out to be the wrong one, and they both die. Seemingly taking their place on the streets to clean it up, or rather trying to, are the guys on the desks further away, Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) who stay in the office and don't see any action at all. They are a mismatched duo, and not going for the big guns, i.e. the hardest crimes of the city, they focus on investigating high-profile capitalist David Ershon (Steve Coogan) who is doing something financially shady. There is some big conspiracy concerning the New York Police department retirement funding, the criminals (not Ershon) are trying to scam $32 billion, and the result is some bad guys shooting guns and chasing the pair all over the city. Also starring Eva Mendes as Dr. Sheila Gamble, Michael Keaton as Captain Gene Mauch, Ray Stevenson as Roger Wesley, Lindsay Sloane as Francine, Natalie Zea as Christinith, Damon Wayans Jr. as Fosse, Anne Heche as Pamela Boardman, Brooke Shields, Tracy Morgan and Ice-T as Narrator. It may have an impressive cast list, there may be one or two humorous moments, but I'm afraid to confess I wasn't laughing much because of the silly choice of storyline for the opposite cops, I was hoping for another Lethal Weapon or something, it's only an alright action comedy. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a good comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Police Detectives P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) are the heroes of the NYPD, and are loved by the entire city. Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are the "Other Guys" of the the Police Department. However, when these two men happen to come across a case that no one else wants, their lives may be changed forever, and they may become the new heroes of New York City.Let us take a quick look at some of the comedies that have tortured us this past summer. Grown Ups, Shrek Forever After, Knight and Day (brought a few laughs, but nothing special), and Date Night, which was actually a pretty good film, but not enough to save a summer as bad as this past one. There are a lot more comedies that really just were not very good, but I don't think there is any reason to go into detail about what everyone already knows. Needless to say, The Other Guys saved the summer as far as comedies go! It may not have been the best comedy ever, but what it did that other comedies this summer failed to do, is consistently make me laugh throughout the entire film, which for the most part is all anyone could ask for.The key to the comedy in this film was both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Their acting was nearly perfect, and along with a fantastic screenplay they really made The Other Guys a movie that is worth seeing, and actually buying as well as that. I don't usually picture Mark Wahlberg as a person for comedy, so if you are thinking that, do not let it stop you from seeing this movie, he was excellent. Also, I think Michael Keaton deserves a little bit of recognition for his role. He was absolutely hilarious at certain times of the film. There really is not too much to say about Ferrell. He is a good actor and he is funny, I think we all know that by now. I liked the appearance by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as well. All in all, the acting was very well done by all actors.Here I will have to disagree with Rotten Tomatoes, this was in my opinion the best collaboration between Will Ferrell and Adam Mckay. This was Adam Mckay's best film for me. He did a good job with the direction, and his screenplay was brilliant. So you take an actor like Will Ferrell and a screenplay like this and you come out with an excellent comedy, especially for a summer such as this past one.Overall, The Other Guys was a very good film, and was funny all through the movie, which nowadays just doesn't seem to happen too often. Adam Mckay did a good job with the screenplay and direction, I really enjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a convectional Will Ferrell movie but still a good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The other guys" is a very funny movie but it is not like most Will Ferrell movies. In this film Ferrell plays Allen Gamble, a cop who avoids police missions because he wants a secure job after being a pimp in college. He shares a desk with Mark Wahlberg who plays Terry,a cop who was once the future of the NYPD until he shot Derek Jeter (great cameo by Jeter) by mistake when on duty outside Yankee Stadium. When two famous cops (Samuel Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) die on a mission 2 jobs as hands on officers are open. Terry convinces Allen to go on a mission and while they are on the scene of a crime Allen recognizes David Ershon (Steve Coogan),a man who Allen knows has committed a violation. Allen arrests Ershon but Ershon pays his fine and leaves the police station. While at first Terry rejects Allens desire to hunt down Ershon again for some violations that Ershon committed, after being after being convinced by Allen to come with him Terry realizes how deep Ershon is into crime. What Terry first thought was a stupid mission turns out to be much more then it seems. Ferrel is hilarious giving a great quirky performance. He is funny without being annoying. Watching this movie will make you want to watch more movies in Ferrel's riotously funny catalog of movies. Wahlberg is kind of annoying because he is so bitter throughout the film but you still find yourself rooting for him. Coogan does a decent job but also verges on irritating at times. While nothing about Coogan's performance stands out as bad nothing stands out as good either. This film also features Andy Buckley, Michael Keaton, Eva Mendes, Damion Wayans, and Rob Riggle.</fullReview>

But with so many other great talents, I risked it. The movie was good. Wahlberg was hilarious. Sam and Dave were fantastic. Even though it was just a short script for them. They were perfect! Keaton was his usual funny self. Everybody was great. Then there is that hack Farel....I think the only funny thing he has done is playing the cow-bell. Everything else he teeters between being a hemorrhoid and being totally crap. He was just a constant distraction from the rest of the movie that was trying to be good. So Farel spoils another potentially good flick. Next time, I will not even risk watching... I give the movie a 4 only because everybody else tried so hard and actually did a good job! Oh, I have no respect for a crap actor, so I have no intention of spelling it's name correctly either...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gugs and gals, this film deserves an A for its courage and imagination, even when half of the jokes fall flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allen (Will Ferrell) is an uptight accountant/police officer. He is not out on a beat but tracks criminals in the "white collar" arena. But, he does have a partner, Terry (Mark Wahlberg), a dimmer bulb who got a desk job when he "accidentally" shot Derek Jeter in the leg. Terry is not happy with his job or his personal life, for he can't get over his romance with a beautiful ballet dancer. The "go-to" guys on the force are two brawny daredevils (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) who take big risks and usually get their perps. One fatal day, however, these two jump to their deaths and the Chief (Michael Keaton) decides to send out Allen and Terry. A mistake? We'll see. In the meantime, two corporate giants (Anne Heche and Steve Coogan) are trying to pull off a major swindle, raiding someone else's funds. Naturally, this is Allen's forte so he races to figure out how to stop it. But, Terry's problems and the two corporations' henchmen might throw the new dynamic duo off course. Will these two bumblers snag the big lawbreakers without losing their lives? This is a film with plenty of laughs, imagination and courage. Sometimes the results are hysterical, as when Allen plays the Little River Band on his car stereo, to Terry's chagrin, and the time a fellow officer relates the events at a local bar mitzvah. Now, that's entertainment. Other times, jokes fall flat, especially with situations involving Allen's wife, a totally wasted Eva Mendes. However, the cast of Ferrell, Wahlberg, Keaton, Coogan, Johnson, Jackson and all of the rest, comedy's best, definitely enhance the success of the script's elements. The setting in Manhattan is nice, although nothing spectacular, and the costumes, camera work, and direction have many fine qualities. Also quite wonderful are the stunts, with some truly topnotch car chases and explosions, if you are a fan of that sort of thing. All in all, its true that the movie is not an indisputable winner. But, it certainly will get most folks to laughing and its risk-taking attempts at comedy are absolutely admirable. So, guys and gals, go arrange a viewing in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest movie of the year! What a surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I thought Will Ferrell's ship had sailed years ago. None of his movies since Anchorman have been much better than average, and his personality has since gotten quite old. I was blown away by this film on that level. Will Ferrell actually was funny. Though his usual style of humor was there, he never goes overboard with it, always staying true to his hysterical character. Even funnier is Mark Wahlberg, who actually manages to upstage Will Ferrell in the comedy department. His chemistry with Ferrell, his constant angry outbursts and thoroughly agitated personality result in some of the biggest laughs of the summer. Wahlberg might just have a career in comedy as a result of this.The plot is rather weak in many ways. Ferrell and Wahlberg play a couple of police desk drones who live in the shadow of two badass hero cops who the city worships (two of the funniest cameos ever... I won't spoil them). When an unfortunate accident occurs, frustrated tough guy Wahlberg convinces Ferrell to join him in trying to take their place. What follows is an endless stream of gags and one-liners, as well as a convoluted and somewhat unnecessary financial thriller subplot that tends to drag the film down when it's emphasized too much. But it's hard to find fault when a film makes me laugh like this one did.The Other Guys knows that its success relies on the quality of its jokes, and fully delivers. A running joke involves Ferrell, an effeminate dweeb, getting all the attractive women much to Wahlberg's dismay and confusion. Their take on how Hollywood portrays explosions is great, and we get a true sense of the god complex that seems to affect most movie cops (see the movie and you'll know what I mean). The jokes range fro brilliant, to not-so-brilliant but well-timed and executed, sometimes silly, sometimes downright bizarre, and sometimes lost among the laughter. It would take a second viewing to catch everything, because this is truly one film where you WILL miss lines from laughing. The storyline is flimsy and the action sequences are poor, but that's just the film snob in me talking. I see comedies to laugh, and when it works, it works. The Other Guys is the funniest film to come out this year. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Buddy-Cop Spoof; I Hope Kevin Smith Was Taking Notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know you're in for a good time from the very start, when director Adam McKay introduces us to the "hero" cops (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson) in the middle of an explosive car chase ending in $12 million in property damage. From the moment Jackson's car is launched from a bus into the lobby of Trump Tower and causes a massive explosion, we see McKay will be spoofing everything we've come to know about the buddy-cop crime movie. He will be doing so, not with Jackson and Johnson, but with "the other guys": Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). The two are desk jockeys and objects of ridicule around the office, Gamble for his nerdy sensibilities and Hoitz for mistakenly shooting Derek Jeter and costing the city the World Series. These two will finally be given their chance to be "real cops" when they stumble upon a ponzi scheme where billionaire investor David Ershon (Steve Coogan) plans to embezzle funds from his investors to repay a significant debt to a major corporation.I have never been a big fan of Will Ferrell's movies. I enjoyed his run on "Saturday Night Live" but his movies have been hit-or-miss. With a few exceptions, I find most of Ferrell's movies miss. He does his best when teamed with writer/director Adam McKay (see ANCHORMAN or TALLADEGA NIGHTS) so I wanted to give this movie a chance, and I'm glad I did. Ferrell isn't his usual out-of-control annoyance, instead keeping himself subdued and only going wild when his dark college personality "Gator" starts to emerge. Most of the crazy behavior is left up to Walhberg as the short-tempered Hoitz, desperate to prove himself as an awesome cop. His outbursts towards Gamble are some of the funniest bits in the movie (especially the tuna/lion rant) and I was surprised to see that Wahlberg could do comedy as well as he does here. The two have an awesome chemistry and I hope Wahlberg continues to pop in to the occasional comedy with McKay now that we see he has the chops to do it.The supporting cast were just as fun. In addition to the aforementioned Jackson and Johnson cameos (seriously one of the best action spoofs I've seen), we've got Michael Keaton as the captain of the police force. Keaton is one of my favorite actors and he's a scene-stealer here. Steve Coogan's never failed to make me laugh, and the cops rivaling Hoitz and Gamble for the new tops positions, Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.), are funny enough that I wouldn't be surprised if they're given a spin-off (whether it be theatrical or DVD).While the majority of the film will keep the average person laughing, it's pacing feels way off. Despite it's reasonable run-time, it feels like it goes on a bit long and could've ended earlier. The gags begin to feel a bit stale as Hoitz and Gamble will apprehend Ershon and losing him. It gives plenty of opportunity for some great car chase sequences, but I think less would've been more in this instance. The subplots of Gamble and Hoitz's love interests probably could've been cut a bit shorter in interest of time, though they make for some hilarious moments. McKay's film continues his winning streak, and aside from a case of "too much of a good thing" making the end of the film run a little stale, this is one of the better comedies to arrive in 2010. I hope Kevin Smith was paying attention because this film is everything I'd hoped COP OUT was meant to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't find any humor at all in this movie. Much like most of the recent Will Ferrell movies. The first part of the movie was OK...but less than halfway through...I started to lose interest. Maybe my expectation for the movie was too high. My favorite movies are comedies...and I really like some of the old Will Ferrel movies. Personally, I would have enjoyed watching "Old School" again instead of watching "The Other Guys". I could watch "Old School" every day-ha ha. This one is not funny and I highly recommend that you skip it.Mark Wahlberg did a great job in the movie. I'm a fan of many of his movies also. He can play many different roles. This movie has a rating of 6.7...not sure how it got such a high rating but I think that a 3 is a little bit more of an accurate rating!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is supposed to be an improvement from Ferrell? Good grief, what were his other films like? We left about half-way through. Maybe it got better, but it seemed to be heading in the opposite direction (from a high point of dire). What gets me is that it's got a higher review rating than (say) Made in Dagenham. Does that mean that the average IMDb reviewer is completely lacking in any critical facility, and is happy to watch any pap as long as there are a few explosions and car crashes? That would explain why we get this kind of American drivel week after week, when good indie / world cinema films can't get a release. OK, you can stop reading now, it doesn't take long to slag off a film, but apparently I have to submit a review of at least ten lines...What a waste of money and (alleged) talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Other Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are probably three key reasons why I predict this action comedy will be a hit and live up to its potential ? the pairing of what's probably deserving of a movie of its own with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as the toughest, meanest, no nonsense cops in New York City whose careers are nothing but laden with action, the main focus on the quirky pairing of Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell as complete opposites to their peer's partnership and crime-busting success rate, and Eva Mendes herself for her firm and perky you-know- whats, spouting lines seen in the trailer that so far has never failed to elicit laughter.While the film may be hidden under the guise of the classic cops and robbers tale, it is Adam McKay and Chris Henchy's story that made it stand out, because of its relevance and commentary of today's real world woes. Like how the action sequences involving the old school cops become ultra exaggerated and complete with what I'd like to think as deliberate B-grade film special effects, if not to keep costs down in filming along the busy streets of a major metropolitan city, it accentuates how the old ways of doing things will not work, where heroes and villains are no longer clearly and cleanly defined. Aiming squarely at the financial crisis where problems or opportunity for problems stem from financial accounts and affects a lot more people across the board, the skill sets required to solve a crime go beyond just normal policing work.So with the development of more savvy crooks comes the need for an appropriate response. Out goes the traditional techniques now seen as dinosaurs, and in comes a new breed of problem solvers where the everyday common man, each steeped in their own skillsets, competencies and diligence for menial work sometimes, play that very important role. This is the story of the unsung heroes, and the other guys who are left with filling the void of new opportunity. And the film's pairing of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as detective partners couldn't add more fun into this definition of embracing change and the differences in others, never to judge anyone, as the adage goes, by the book.Ferrell plays Allen Gamble, a mild-mannered cop whose background in forensics accounting means he's one suited for a desk role in the force, never ever volunteering for the more glamorous aspects of police work, preferring instead to work behind the scenes hammering out reports. This of course to the irritation of whiny partner Terry Hoitz (played by Wahlberg who hammed up his usual macho alpha-maleness here), who yearns to see action and doing his contribution to clean up the streets, if not for that hilarious career limiting move that had stalled his prospect for promotion. Reporting to Michael Keaton's Captain Gene Mauch who has this penchant for unknowingly quoting TLC, this duo will go through a rather satisfying cliché of getting to know each other, warts and all, before finally accepting their differences en route to cracking a big case.No sooner than the get go are we treated to the very first action sequence of the film that's so much fun and laughter even that your appetite is whet and leaving you clamouring for more. I for one will put up my hand should there be a feature film based on Sam L. Jackson's and Dwayne Johnson's characters since they're totally over the top, and I suppose as a comedy they nailed their roles and were right on the money with personifying self-importance and arrogance, having little patience for their support team, never hesitating to shoot or belittle them, and it's quite the pity we don't get to see more, as they had to make way for the titular guys to take over, so with that goes some of the fun that came right from the start.The writers McKay and Henchy have developed extremely likable caricatures, which every cast member especially Ferrell and Wahlberg delivering with a complete repertoire of slapstick and with with aplomb. Between the two leads there are occasional moments where you'll find that they irritate, especially when Wahlberg turns all angry and whiny at the same time, with Ferrell too having to seem that he's been reigned in to play such a restrained character, with moments where the glint in the eye to explode just shows, then dissipates. Still, probably the best scene here were the three way dynamics which included Eva Mendes, some of which you'll already have seen in the trailers.Adam McKay had directed a fair bit of Will Ferrell comedies such as Step Brothers and Talladega Nights amongst others with varying degrees of success where the comedy's more hit than miss, but The Other Guys really went for that rip-roaring laugh a minute offering which lived up to its potential. A definite contender in my shortlist for favourite films of this year as it's been some time since I laughed so hard during a comedy, one that had its message not lost in laughter. Don't leave the cinema just yet when the end credits roll as you'll be taken through a fantastically done animated piece on the financial crisis we face today as well as the absurdity of pay structures, and between the haves and the have nots / other guys, before one final joke cum outtake between Ferrell and Wahlberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farrell's funniest since Anchorman?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell and Mark Whalberg are The Other guys. The Other guys is Will Ferrell's funniest and most fun film since Anchorman,which was his masterpiece. THere is a lot to admire here. The film is similar to Cop out, only funny.In the police force, there are cops who get into car chases and shoot down bad guys. The real deal. Then,there are The other guys(Ferrell and Whalberg). Allen(Ferrell) is a goofy cop who doesn't really care about his job.But Terry(Whalberg) is quite the opposite. He really cares about his job. This is part of the reason why they don't get along.So, after the real deal cops die, they decide to try and take their place. The cast also includes Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock as the better cops, Eva Mendes as Allen's wife,who he seems to not care about, Michael Keaton as the chief, Steve Coogan as the guy they're after, and more.I had a blast with The Other guys. It's the first Will Ferrell comedy in years that could become a classic. Anchorman was an instant classic. This is his best comedy since Anchorman. That's my opinion.The film goes in the tradition of films like Rush hour and Lethal weapon. But it goes a little further than the level of Rush hour. Cause here both actors are very likable. Unlike Rush hour,which I only payed attention to do to Chris Tucker.I appreciated Mark Whalberg's role in this film. After seeing him in a film like The Departed where he plays such a serious cop, here he plays such a serious cop but in comedy form. I enjoyed The Other guys. It's hilarious,fun and exciting.Originality?I don't know. But you forget about that. Enjoy yourself.3.5/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie started out pretty well. In particular an early scene between Wahlberg and Ferrel had me rolling. But after that the movie went flat. There were still some good moments throughout the movie, but for me a lot of the jokes were flat. Actually, from the response of most of the audience that opening bit was the comedic high point.Also, the movie did get preachy about the current economic crisis, corporate bailouts, etc. This was especially the case at the end of the movie and current the closing credits. It was all to make a single joke that no one in the audience laughed at.Action Comedies are tricky and require the proper cast to pull it off. Will Ferrel did a pretty good job, but wasn't perfect. Mark Walhberg however didn't uphold his part as the straight man. Rather than play it straight, he was just flat, he played Mark Walhberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrell/McKay duo and buddy cop genre finds some chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The buddy cop comedy sub-genre has been limping about Hollywood as if shot in the leg from an awry 9mm bullet. Now it's been found by the duo of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, the pair behind "Anchorman," "Talladega Nights" and "Step Brothers," whose brand of contemporary idiot humor has been steadily met with compounding criticism the last few years. But the combination of these two seemingly stale styles works somehow in "The Other Guys," even if it's not a total revitalization for either party.Ferrell's humor has led to the comedic veteran being liked or loathed in most peoples' opinions. Detective Allen Gamble borrows a bit more from the Ron Burgundy character profile that made Ferrell a household name in 2004 only much more modest. Both rely on the childlike innocence or unawareness that Ferrell handles best. Consider his most recent exploits, "The Other Guys" is refreshing. Pairing him with someone unpredictable in Mark Wahlberg was also a wise move. Wahlberg is the Type A of the twosome: angry, impulsive and bordering on wackjob. He operates on one level while Ferrell bounces up and down, occasionally going to his level and sometimes understating it nicely. It's a much more effective co-star than John C. Reilly, who offers too much of the same style as Ferrell, which in "Talladega Nights" and "Step Brothers" caused Ferrell to be the Type A guy.The two play detectives Gamble and Terry Hoitz, two NYPD desk jockeys who are, of course, totally mismatched. Gamble was promoted from accounting and Hoitz demoted from security. When Hoitz smells a big case surrounding a Bernie Madoff-like investor (Steve Coogan) that might put him back in the action where he feels he belongs, he forces the oblivious Gamble to step in with him.Fitted with even so much as jazz saxophone transition music, "The Other Guys" is a spoof at heart. Instead of the cheesy explosion that the pair survives in the nick of time, these guys get knocked off their feet and writhe on the ground in pain, with Ferrell shouting about blisters on his hands and the misleading nature of movie explosions. This additional "objective" of needing the film to serve as a spoof forces a bit more creativity out of McKay and Ferrell's writing. The usual improvised shenanigans wouldn't cut it here.The supporting cast in "Other Guys" is much more cameo-like than in past McKay/Ferrell movies. Rather than get wrapped up in giving other characters adequate screen time, the focus stays on Allen and Terry and their chemistry. Although it undercuts characters such as Eva Mendes as Allen's hot wife and Michael Keaton in a surprising but welcome comedic role as the police captain, it focuses the humor better and doesn't let it get to eye-rolling levels too often, at least as far as dumb characters are concerned."The Other Guys" definitely starts out stronger than it finishes. The biggest laughs are at the beginning and fade at the end as happens all too often in comedies that worry too much about resolving an uninteresting plot at the end of the film while also burning out recurring jokes (such as the Toyota Prius that Allen drives having a prominent place in the film).It's far from a Ferrell/McKay renaissance and it certainly won't leave you clamoring for more twists on the buddy cop comedy, but the two sides find a chemistry together that however brief, refreshes in a year light on good laughs.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I'm being kind calling this overblown, half-conceived offering the biggest piece of celluloid turd I've seen in a while. It probably started off as a half-decent idea, but instead of hiring a writer, the director decided he'd credit himself as writer and "create" the movie on the fly. And that's exactly what he got. A collage of half-worked scenes - admittedly with one or two laughs along the way, but that's about it - and two hours of laborious "comedy". There's one (long) riff between Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg - an ultra-lame bit about lions and tunas (yeah, I know. And it's about that funny, too) that goes on so long it's actually painful to watch. I like Will Ferrell. He's good at sketch comedy... short pieces that don't have to have a clear beginning, middle and end. But linking a thousand sketches together to make a film just doesn't cut it.I will offer kudos to Mark Walhberg. Despite the temptation to play it for laughs,(a temptation irresistible to most of the other actors), Walhberg plays his role straight and honest and provides the only few genuine comedic moments in the film. The cameos by the half dozen or so name actors can't rescue the tired storyline... rather, you get the feeling they're all saying, hey, look at us! We're being really funny, right? ...Sorry. No.</fullReview>

Only Adam Mckay was able to get his twisted sense of humor and this film is a perfect example of their collaborative comic sense. If you expect this film to be 48 Hours or any other "tough guy gets stuck with funny dude" movie you are about to be disappointed. It has more character, less drama and non-stop absurdity. The writing and the character development was incredible and surprising. I never was a fan of Mark Wahlberg but this was the first time I saw some sort of genuine humanity in him since "Three Kings".The leads were not shadowed by supporting roles but Eva Mendes, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Michael Keaton and my favorite Steve Coogan were hilarious and completely understood the absurd context created by Ferrell &amp; McKay.For the viewers who are familiar with Ferrell's previous movies; see the movie if you liked Anchorman or Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. If you consider their sense of humor as stupid and juvenile (which is something I hear often) then stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the film, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play Adam Gamble and Terry Hoitz, two desk jockey police officers who seek to get higher notoriety within their division. After the abrupt death of the two most respected cops within the station, they see this as their chance to finally get out of their slump, but they find their plan to bust a huge embezzlement case with a corporate CEO (Played by Steve Coogan) at its center, foiled at every turn by dastardly criminals, and their own faulty antics.The film is written and directed by Adam McKay, whose body of work includes offbeat but exceptionally funny movies such as Anchorman and Talladega Nights. The Other Guys is not always perfect, but it benefits from the perfectly mismatched chemistry of Ferrell and Wahlberg, and gets in some great laughs, which range from witty one-liners to side achingly tickling WTF sight and sound gags. They're joined by a cast that includes Eva Mendes, Michael Keaton and Rob Riggle, who all get in their own unique laughs. Even Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson in their small roles are hilarious.While The Other Guys has some serious good points, such as the film's action, which includes some of the year's very best stunt driving and fight choreography, it still has a tendency to feel flawed. Most are simply minuscule and can be forgiven, but the most evident of them all is the film's quest to find consistent rhythm. The first act is a tad too rushed, and the second act is too slow, but the third act finally manages a solid tone.I give The Other Guys **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie. My son watched it first. I thought it would be another over-the-top Will Ferrell movie, like "Talladega Nights," with blatant sight gags. That was not the case. There was plenty of action to enjoy, but this movie focused on the unusual and unexpected dialog between the characters. It definitely caught me off guard. In addition, the humor was applied with a small yet fully soaked "paint" brush of intelligent blandness. I chuckled throughout the entire movie because of the numerous smart subtleties. The writers are the real stars of this movie, and should be commended for a job well done. Very impressive work. I enjoyed this movie and was never bored. A caution however; be prepared after the movie for some political "messages."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one turned out to be a surprisingly good watch. Quite hilarious in parts, and loaded with black humour. Worth the watch ? definitely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !It's been a while since I have seen a good comedy flick. "The Other Guys" turned out to be a good surprise and quite a hilarious watch, after a string of crappy comedy flicks that I have seen this year. The chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg was also good and unique at the same time. There have been a quite a few "cop-duo" comedy films in recent years like 'Rush Hour' and 'Starsky &amp; Hutch', and this movie is another good one to add to the lot, if you enjoyed the previous two mentioned flicks.Go see it, and have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most genius cop buddy pairings ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE OTHER GUYS': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another teaming of writer / director Adam McKay with funny-man superstar Will Ferrell (Others being 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE', 'ANCHORMAN', 'TALLADEGA NIGHTS' and 'STEP BROTHERS'). In one of the most genius cop buddy pairings ever Ferrell is also teamed with Mark Wahlberg. After watching the movie I can't think of a more hilarious odd couple pairing in recent memory. To top it off you have Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in one of the most brilliant cop action movie spoofs ever, all though brief. Not to mention Michael Keaton as a very humorous police Captain. There's also the stunning Eva Mendes and at least a dozen other great supporting characters. The movie has all the ingredients of a comedy classic.Ferrell and Wahlberg play Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz, two New York City police officers who spend all of their time doing paperwork in the office due to Gamble's fear of action and Hoitz's past blunder shooting a star baseball player, Derek Jeter (playing himself). They idolize the two star detectives P.K. Highsmith (Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Johnson) but when they're killed Hoitz can't wait for the opportunity to get back in the action and be a hero again. So when they stumble upon a breakout case Hoitz drags Gamble with him on an obsessed mission to save the day. The movie is just one wild action scene and outrageous joke after another from here on out.The movie is about as funny as they get, from start to finish, but as this is it's greatest strength it's also it's biggest weakness. There's no real drama or true emotion (other than briefly, due to the performances). A truly great comedy requires real developed characters with honest problems. There needs to be some break from the laughter to establish real situations which makes the comedy that much stronger. When it's just one hilarious joke after another the laughter somewhat loses it's power and gets exhausting, especially at an hour and forty seven minutes (which is way too long for a slapstick comedy). The only time the movie has any real drama and heartfelt emotion is when it comes to it's conclusion and the credits roll. It's here that the movie delivers it's moral message by rolling statistics on how much big wig executives make compared to true heroes like cops, nurses, teachers and others. It's the 'other guys' that the spotlight is not on that make our world worth living but society puts the value on self centered assholes. That's the message the movie is trying to drive home and it only truly resonates with the viewer at the end when most people have left the theater.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesson Learnt: McKay and Ferrell are still in a league of their own; as is Eva Mendes (in a very different way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've loved, laughed, fawned over McKay's witty script or Will Ferrell's immunity of being unlikeable then you will love this. If you like comedy you will love this. But if you compare it to their other works (hello Anchorman!) then you will at least bare minimum like this.Ferrell teams up with Mark Wahlberg to form The Other Guys. It's all very Ying and Yang, Ferrell makes the effort, likes the office work and (to his partners dismay) is surprisingly adept with women whereas Wahlberg hates the work, has relationship problems and wants the success 'The Non-Other Guys' have. He's almost as annoying as he was in The Departed.Still, they work, they clash, you laugh, laugh to tears sometimes ? particularly (unless you're a descendant of Iron Man) the conversation about the Tuna and the Lion. A scene of comedy perfection, which would make Ron Burgundy proud.The rest of the film has these high notes which you'll have no trouble unearthing yourself, but occasionally takes the vast amount of police action a little to far when some of the humour dries up. But saying it wasn't one their funniest would be a downright lie. Not the bee's knees but definitely, the Ron's moustache.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic lead characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever teamed up Ferrell and Wahlberg deserves a large pat on the back first off, a great leading two who play off each other really well. To be honest all of the characters were pretty damn good, I found Keaton hilarious as the captain/bed &amp; bath store manager. The only actor I felt didn't deliver any laughs whatsoever was Coogan, if it isn't Partridge, don't bother as you're just annoying Steve! As with any Ferrell film, the dialogue is brilliant, although weirdly there was a running theme of animals in this film..from a hypothetical Tuna vs Lion fight through to flying 'like a peacock'?! The back and forth between Ferrell and Wahlberg is priceless and worth the admission fee alone in my book.Mendes plays a fantastically quirky role as Ferrell's wife and Samuel J and The Rock play an all-action cameo which have one of the weirdest deaths you're likely to see in a film.It almost felt as though Ferrell was nearly back to his best in this film, not playing an over-the-top character for once, which makes a refreshing change. Have to admit I was laughing out loud for 90% of the film but the ending did disappoint somewhat, a tad too cheezy for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell's best collaboration yet with Adam McKay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No modern comedy worth its salt misses the chance to keep you chortling as the end credits roll. Bloopers, bleeps and assorted outtakes off the cutting-room floor generally provide the fare. Here we follow a different tack. Whizzy graphics illustrate the extent to which corporate greed has raped the American economy. It's powerful stuff. The only wonder is what it's doing tacked on a film without a serious bone in its body. Take the gag about speeding to a crime scene in a Toyota Prius. If you find it offensive, you should maybe avoid the movie and indeed the rest of this review."I literally," says Mark Wahlberg to his partner Will Ferrell as they tear politely through New York City's pulsating streets in a small red environmentally friendly dwarf of a car, "feel as if I'm driving in a vagina." Yes, this is another cop movie pairing ill-matching detectives who learn to buddy up and bust bad guys together. Of course the odd-couple dynamic throws up laughs galore. But the real treat of The Other Guys is in its subtle variations, in its pursuit of the unexpected.The titular guys are Detectives Gamble and Hoitz, black sheep of the precinct who somehow never get to go out on a case. Not like Detectives Danson and Highsmith (Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson), whom we meet in medias res on a high-speed multi-vehicular chase sequence which pleasingly sends up all the daftest tropes of the cinematic action cop. These guys are heroes, but they are also very dumb heroes. It's still a shock when they test their indestructibility once too often by throwing themselves off the top of a building in pursuit of thieves who have taken the smarter route down via a zipwire.Into the freshly made vacancy Gamble (Ferrell) is perfectly happy not to step: a desk-bound scourge of white-collar felons, he'll take the paper chase over the car chase every time. "Go get 'em, guys!" he hollers from his swivel chair as cops with bigger balls head out into the mean streets. "Lot of energy, lot of focus!" Hoitz has been paired with Gamble as a punishment for mistakenly using his firearm on a sporting hero. Result: he's packing a lot of pent-up aggression inside the compact form of Mark Wahlberg. It doesn't help that he's romantically luckless, while Hoitz in his prissy white shirt and prim specs, not to mention his penchant for flaccid MoR, unwittingly exerts a wild pheromonal pull on beautiful women, above all his preposterously gorgeous and servile wife (Eve Mendes, being a very good sport in a lowcut top).The only way Hoitz can drag his partner, who has had his weapon confiscated, out on a job is to pull a gun on him. The job turns out to float Gamble's boat when they accidentally bump into a British financier (Steve Coogan) wanted for a series of unpermitted scaffolding violations. Forcibly required to hand him over to a private security detail, and told to drop the whole thing by their superior office (Michael Keaton), they smell a rat.And we can pretty much leave the plot there. It's much the least interesting thing about The Other Guys, the pleasures of which lurk in unlooked-for corners... for more check out theartsdesk.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys reminds us a lot of the other, younger Will Ferrell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨ You have the right to remain silent... but I want to hear you scream! ¨ It was about time 2010 gave us a comedy that was actually funny. The Other Guys isn't a perfect comedy, but it does have several laugh out loud moments. This is one of Will Ferrell's best movies since Talladega Nights. It was good to see him team up with Mark Wahlberg in this buddy comedy and their chemistry was great. Most of the movie focused on them, leaving the supporting cast kind of flat, but it did pay off at the end. Eva Mendes, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Michael Keaton, and Steve Coogan had good supporting roles, but the main attractions are actually Ferrell and Wahlberg and the movie keeps us focused on them. Director Adam McKay knows Will Ferrell really well since they have worked together before in Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers. This is probably not as good as their two first movies together, but it is definitely an improvement over Step Brothers. McKay wrote the screenplay along with Chris Henchy who had also written a screenplay for Ferrell's other movie Land of the Lost. Ferrell is back to his old self mixing his calm behavior and nature from Ron Burgundy in Anchorman with some outbursts here and there. Wahlberg's comedic timing isn't the best, but he is funny nonetheless when he is screaming and insulting everyone. The movie could have been a lot better since the first half of the film is actually much funnier than the second, but it is still worth a watch considering there haven't been great comedies released this year so far.Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) works as an accountant for the New York police department. He is very happy with his safe job and is always in the mood to do all the paperwork for the true heroes of the city: street officers P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson, better known as The Rock). Danson and Highsmith have just tore up half of New York City chasing a pair of criminals in a car pursuit. They catch the criminals who only happen to possess a quarter pound of cocaine, but are still received as heroes by city citizens because they are willing to do what it takes and even defy the laws of physics in order to catch criminals. Allen's office partner is Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), who is really unhappy with staying indoors all day and wants to be in the streets fighting real crime. The problem is that Terry has had a funny incident in the past (which I won't give away) and therefore he isn't allowed to work in the streets anymore. The police captain is Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton) who needs more men in the streets after he loses Danson and Highsmith. Hoitz forces his partner Gamble to accept a case in order to stop from being simply the other guys. Gamble isn't too happy about leaving his job because he doesn't like taking risks and he enjoys his happy life with his beautiful wife Dr. Sheila (Eva Mendes). Forced to take a call Gamble and Hoitz head to the streets where they accidentally run into David Ershon (Steve Coogan). Gamble has been building a case on Ershon because he believes him to be a shady capitalist, and now he and Hoitz have an opportunity of a lifetime to become heroes if they can uncover his fraud.The Other Guys may not end up being a very memorable comedy, but in a year with lack of good comedies, this was a fun and entertaining experience. Will Ferrell may have other funnier comedies as well, but it had been awhile since he had had one, and teaming up with Mark Wahlberg was a great idea. The chemistry between them worked really well and they made for a good couple in this buddy comedy. The beginning of the movie was pretty funny, Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock were hilarious during the opening scene and they also have a very memorable one when they are at the rooftop of a building chasing some criminals. I laughed really hard during these opening scenes. Will Ferrell was his usual self, without overacting this time and playing the nice guy. He does have a secret past which really works in this movie and makes up for the funniest scenes. He also happens to be a chic magnet which also brings several laughs throughout the film. Mark Wahlberg may not have the perfect comedic timing that Paul Rudd has for example, but he is still funny and makes for a good comedic partner. Eva Mendes also had some funny lines and we have seen her do comedy really well in the past as well (Stuck on You and Hitch). The action scenes in this movie are actually pretty well done and a lot of fun. The scene where Wahlberg fights off a bunch of guys on motorcycles is really well choreographed. I ended up enjoying this movie quite a bit, but I am still waiting for this year's The Hangover.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect rebound for Ferrell; optimum comedic performance by Wahlberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep, I enjoyed almost every minute of this movie. To sum it up short, it's like the best of Ferrell, cut short on where the jokes go too long and awkward. Combined with jokes written just right for Wahlberg (he did worse in "Big hit"). Combined with action a cut above the rest (for the genre), the chemistry between the duo, and the unbelievable home-run ratio of the "awkward jokes" (TLC quotes by Keaton for example). Topped with some VERY funny cameos. Direction is all good, along with the editing. The movie showed signs of running out of steam in the middle, but towards the end it picked up the momentum again and ended on a high-enough-note. To sum it up VERY short, it's this year's "Rush hour". So if that's anything up your alley, go see it. From recent offerings, I hope this one gets a sequel along with "Expendables" and "Prince of Persia".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad cop, mild cop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys is a decent summer entry that falls somewhere between teen juvenile slapstick and wry sophisticated parody. Mind you it's neither but it does have an abundant amount of chuckles and director McKay keeps a lid on Will Ferrell's over the top antics most of the way with Donny Wahlberg offering a solid straight man.Gamble and Hoitz are a misfit team of cops with comically dark pasts. Far from the superstars of the precinct like the Rastas (played with full tilt bravado by The Rock and Sam Jackson) Gamble is a numbers cruncher and Wahlberg the perpetrator of a NYC sacrilege. When they stumble over a conspiracy to defraud millions from their own union they set out to redeem themselves.The Other Guys is a rapid fire presentation of humor and action that hits the target better than half the time. Director McKay is constantly going for laughs from the outset and he sacrifices subtlety at it's altar over the course of the film and the parody begins to dilute from this hard sell. He does keep Ferrell in check most of the way though and gets some excellent deadpan from Wahlberg and Michael Keaton as the chief to provide for what passes as decent comedy these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious in ways you wouldn't expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very entertaining to me. It is not the kind of movie where you'll be laughing the whole way through (which is not a bad thing), but it tends to catch you off guard.There are only a couple classic Will Ferrell parts in this movie, which is refreshing. He is a comic genius to have lasted this long as a comedic actor where people tend tire of them very quickly. This is probably one of Will Ferrell's best roles because his natural talent for the hilarious really fits well with the character whom is paradoxically funny (there's a new term to think about... when you see the movie anyways). He was great, and that's all fine and well but he was no match for the, "Batman," in this movie.By, "Batman," I mean Michael Keaton. I was laughing hard enough watching the movie, and continued to laugh about his character long after I had gotten home from the theatre. I had actually heard him say to David Letterman that he got his start in show business as a stand-up comedian, and that really shows in this movie. Fantastic work, Mr. Keaton! Mark Wahlberg played his character perfectly. That man has so much acting talent. He showed that he is able and willing to do comedic roles as well as dramatic ones. This movie was ideal for him to get his feet wet, as his character was very similar to a lot of his previous characters; only incidentally funny and purposefully exaggerated.Kudos to Adam Mckay and Chris Henchy. Their writing really made the movie, for me. The characters were so funny on their own, that it's hard to imagine any of these actors not be funny while playing them. I suspect the characters were actually tailored to the stars as Adam Mckay is apparently a very close friend of Will Ferrell's, and possibly the other actors in the movie as well. The cop-fight scene was incredible (being vague to avoid spoilers). I'm still laughing about it two days after seeing it.I recommend you see this movie with friends, as with any comedy. There are a lot of good movies in theatres right now and this one is definitely in the top 3, in my opinion. I'm glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm rebounding off of the mediocre "Dinner for Schmucks," or maybe I'm rebounding off of an entire season of lackluster comedy; either way, "The Other Guys" is like a breath of fresh air. It feels like eons since anyone's batted a consistent laugh average?But Adam McKay and Will Ferrell do reliably that. It might seem like a passive aggressive compliment, but in this chortle-starved summer beggars can't be choosers.At its most embryonic state, the movie works because it's built on the solid, if elementary, foundation of pairing Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg has a deft, underexploited comedic potential that he, his agent, or whoever, has critically ignored. Roles like his in "Boogie Nights" and "I Heart Huckabees" make a case for an actor that should lay off the heavy drama every so often and recoil with something silly. I honestly believe Wahlberg is the best part of the epically awful "Happening," and that there isn't an ounce of his performance that isn't calculated?How anyone could read Shyamalan's script and not burst out laughing is beyond me.His pairing with Ferrell is a match made in comedy heaven, and the two play off each other well. Of course, this is a more restrained Ferrell than many may have expected, but it's a role that suits him following his over-the-top performance in "Step Brothers." Besides, when released from the shackles of his character?Paper-pushing "fake cop" Allen Gamble? Ferrell's performance is hit and miss. Exploding into a shrieking rage during a 'Good Cop, Bad Cop' routine gone awry is one of the film's funniest moments. Revealing his ex-life as a flamboyant pimp? Not so much.But even with its pecking detractors, "The Other Guys" is never unfunny for long. Once we've established our two protagonists?Via a bizarre and amusing lion and tuna metaphor?It is generally fun just to watch them blunder their way through the rest of the movie. Wahlberg's character is Terry Hoitz, Allen's partner, and the short-fused catalyst for his first big trip out of the office. Their dynamic warmly satirizes the eighties buddy cop cliché, but more often is a simply a vehicle for short-form character sketches.If there is a problem with the movie, it's that the plot is astronomically overcomplicated, neither clever nor compelling. Laughter is usually the only bridge connecting one idea to the next, and the constituent scenes sometimes fail to function as a unit. Worse yet, terrific performers like Steve Coogan are stuffed into straight-man roles, and ought to be espousing humor, not plot.Regardless, this movie has it where it counts. Its lack of focus may detract slightly from the overall experience, but it only serves to highlight what "The Other Guys" ultimately is? Mindless summer entertainment. My approach to comedy has always been that character is paramount, but when you're knocking off something like this, the only thing that really matters is its ability to make me laugh. And for the first time in months, I feel like I got my funny bone's worth.Ferrell and McKay never pretend to be auteurs of deep or provocative comedy?Jay Roach of "Dinner for Schmucks" didn't either?But I laughed more. Much more. There's a reason comedy is called the most subjective genre; a movie like this is dangerous because when you put all your chips on the gags, you're going all or nothing?Either you'll find "The Other Guys" funny or you won't. For me, the film is a return to form for a duo that has disappointed me with their previous two efforts; its no "Anchorman," but it's far and away superior to "Talladega Nights" and more consistent than "Step Brothers."More importantly, it's far and away superior to "Dinner for Schmucks" and whatever other marginally amusing film is concurrently playing. In a summer of lackluster comedy, every chortle should be cherished, and "The Other Guys" has them to spare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is the movie i like, one that promises plenty of laughs in the trailer and delivers and then some. I am very surprised with Mark Wahlberg even though he is in my top 5 fave actors of all time list, i was still leery on him doing comedy. He was brilliant in his own tough guy sarcastic way and it worked. His "want to keep low key " partner Allen Gamble, played very excellently by Will Farrell is assigned to Detective Terry Holtz (Wahlberg) Allan just likes his cushy desk job where he gets in no trouble and goes home safely every night to his "bad-a-lax" as he puts it wife. I need to mention the so called bad-a-lax is played by the beautiful Eva Mendez. Terry is a cop who in an accidental shooting of Yankees superstar Derek Jeter gets stuck with Allan. Terry is very angry and Allan is very timid together they are one of the most miss matched cop pairing since Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon series. Enter the super cop pairing of Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and P.K Highsmith (Samuel Jackson) These cops are the creme of the nypd and the envy of the whole police dept. When something happens to them Allan and Terry try their best amidst loads of hilarious back and forth banter to take their places. Nice to see Michael Keaton back on the big screen as their captain. A great flick that delivers all the ;aughs it promised, which in Hollywood as of late is a huge surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little disappointed but it was still funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing that I love, it's action movies, even buddy cop films. So when I saw the trailer for The Other Guys, I knew I wanted to see it. Even though I'm not a Will Ferrell fan, I love Mark Wahlberg and the whole idea about this film seemed just great. The Other Guys delivers in with the laughs and action, but there's unfortunately something missing from it that could have made it into a great film. When I saw the trailer, I thought I had the film figured out, Sam Jackson and The Rock are these two awesome action cops who are just unstoppable but then we compare to the average Joe's who aren't Arnold Schwartzenegger and Bruce Willis. Unfortunately, Sam Jackson and The Rock are taken away in the first 10 minutes of the film and we're stuck with Mark and Will for the rest of the time. The first half of the film was really funny, there were a lot of good jokes and I just had a great time laughing. I wish that they kept Sam and The Rcok around because the guys that Will and Mark were competing with were dorks and didn't work. The ending of the film fell flat and didn't know when to quit.Detectives Danson and Highsmith are pursuing a group of robbers in a van. After a brief firefight that results in the hood of Highsmith's car getting blown into the windshield, the two inadvertently crash into the side of a double decker bus. Danson drives it after the robbers and meticulously slingshots the trapped car out the other side of the bus and crashing into a building, inexplicably surviving. But they are not our hero's of the film as they are quickly killed off. Detective Allen Gamble, a forensic accountant who's more interested in paperwork than hitting the streets, and Detective Terry Hoitz, who has been stuck with Allen as his partner ever since shooting Derek Jeter. Allen and Terry idolize Danson and Highsmith and receive absolutely no respect from the other officers. When an opportunity arises for Terry and Allen to step up, things don't quite go as planned. As things get worse, Allen and Terry are forced to split up. However, Allen still tries to solve the crime on his own even though Terry thinks it is a dead end. He finally gets credible evidence and earns his gun back. Allen finally convinces Terry to rejoin him and as things begin to go well, the other guys of course realize they are not Danson and Highsmith.Now The Other Guys is good enough for a rental, there are some really great laughs. I did love the joke between Mark, Will and Eva Mendes. Will's character is this straight laced accountant, but is married to a bombshell like Eva and Mark just can't figure out why she married him. Also Will's ex's are these beautiful women, Mark is just dumbfounded but it was a great joke. Even though I hated that The Rock and Sam were taken so quickly, their exit scene was beyond hilarious. Like I said, it's not a bad movie by any means, it just didn't know how to end and had several pointless scenes/stories. Mark has an ex love who wasn't much purpose for the film, the villain had too much plot for a simple story and some of the jokes dragged on a little too long. I really wanted to love this film, even though Will Ferrell was in it, I even accepted him and went along with the story. I was just a little disappointed because the movie had so much more potential. It just needed a little more work, because frankly The Rock and Sam Jackson could have carried the film alone with their story and would have been a great comedy. In fact, I think I have an idea? don't you get any ideas! I'm off to Hollywood.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I'm a peacock. You gotta let me fly!" Terry (Mark Wahlberg)The Other Guys is a buddy-bromance comedy about two hapless desk cops, Allen (Will Ferrell) and Terry (Wahlberg), who wind up on the street solving high tech, collision-prone larceny in some humorous setups.This mismatched duo, who awkwardly replace super cops Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, at times seems like part of the gang that couldn't shoot straight and at others the only uncorrupt and loving cops in NYC. Will Ferrell manages to revive his career with a variation of his usual nerdy, shy, but lethal boy-man, and Wahlberg shows solid comic timing, mostly reacting to Ferrell.Not brilliant comedy but chuckle worthy with some domestic scenes for both cops that are genuinely funny?Terry's reacting with disbelief at Allen's babe-wife, played by Eva Mendes, is a lesson in underplaying and comic timing. Secondary player Michael Keaton as the Captain is a delight of comic authority as he constantly throws out lines from TLC while he tries to discipline his two "rogues." The Bernie-Madoff type corruption has currency, starring Brit funny man Steve Coogan as tycoon David Ershon. Just as in the case of Bernie, it's hard not to like this sweet swindler.Judd Apatow need not worry about the competition; Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have no rivals here for action, yet the underplaying of outrageous setups is enjoyable with witty lines and underplayed guffaws. No, its action can't match that of Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours, but its humor is enough for me to recommend a serviceable summer comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is something I just could not figure out. Why did Danson and Highsmith do that? It was obvious that there was nothing to land on but the sidewalk. They were on top of the roof. There were no trees or nothing in sight. This did not really make sense to me. Did they want to commit suicide? Or did they just think they were so great that they would be invincible if they hit the pavement? There was no explanation for this, like a lot of other things in this movie. Like why did Will Ferrel have this magnetic charm with hot females? Not explained. It was okay. A few decent laughs. The rest just silly bad.

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg provide plenty of good laughs in The Other Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one didn't see the trailers on TV and in theatres or look at the beginning credits, one would think-judging from the beginning sequence-that the stars of this comedy-action movie were Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. They're emphasized a lot early on but when they disappear halfway through, that's when the plot involving mismatched partners Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg get into gear. I must say right here that Ferrell and Wahlberg get quite a few good laughs out of their contrasting personalities especially when the latter wonders constantly how the former gets so many hot women. Also, seeing Ferrell explaining the impossibility of certain things whenever Wahlberg threatens him is also pretty hilarious. Also good are Eva Mendes as Will's wife, Steve Coogan as financial wizard David Ershon, and Michael Keaton as the superior officer who also works at Bath and Beyond. Not everything works but director/co-writer Adam McKay keeps things moving nearly smoothly throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Much of Will Ferrell's box office success has occurred thanks to his collaborations with Adam McKay. This includes Step Brothers, Talladega Nights, and Anchorman. McKay's long history at Saturday Night Live is often on display in his movies, but never more than during The Other Guys. While there is some semblance of story, the film often has the feel of individual skits.The first skit involves two supercops played by Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Of course, the kicker is that they really aren't great cops, but masters of Public Relations. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are partners and the titular 'other guys'. We get minimal background on each but quickly understand that Ferrell's cop comes from accounting and is obsessed with regulations and safety. Wahlberg was a former rising star until an unfortunate accident involving Derek Jeter snuffed out his promotions.Obviously, there needs to be a super case that these two solve and it involves a corporate financing scheme with Steve Coogan. The story itself is really unimportant (luckily) and the humor is derived from individual moments between Ferrell and Wahlberg, that same duo and Eva Mendes, or scenes with Michael Keaton.There are a couple of running gags that work (hot girls are always hitting on Ferrell, Wahlberg's dancing, Keaton and TLC), and the best visual gag is an extended freeze frame montage set in a pub. It is pure comic genius. On the downside, I was really baffled as to the over-the-top approach taken by Mark Wahlberg. His anger and bitterness were so big that it has to be considered a spoof. However, if you try to view the film as a spoof, it just doesn't work (outside of Samuel L Jackson).Overall, this one has the laughs you would expect but is certainly not at the class of Anchorman. Comedy remains one of the most difficult film genres, and McKay remains one of our best hopes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll begin by saying that I went to see this movie as a huge Will Ferrell fan, so my opinions of this movie may be slightly biased. However, if, like me, you loved Anchorman, Taladega Nights, Step Brothers and so on, then you'll love this movie.I've seen a few reviews slating the plot-line for its un-originality. Maybe these people have a point. It's a classic good-cop, bad-cop scenario. The duo's boss pulls them off the case but they strive to uncover the truth. Nothing special. But if you're like me, then you'll take the storyline for what it is: it merely exists in the movie to give Adam McKay somewhere and something upon which to scatter some truly hilarious moments; ridiculously laughable scenarios and a few one-liners that you'll be quoting with your friends for some time.Mark Wahlberg, who stars as Ferrell's partner is funny at times but there were a few cringe worthy lines from him. The scene that sticks out for me is when he meets Allen Gamble's (Will Ferrell) wife. However, I can forgive Mark for this as he isn't classically a comedic actor, and he does play his part well.All in all, I loved this movie, and have been back to see it. Watch it: you'll laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was 100% laugh out loud funny, so far the funniest movie in 2010. I saw it expecting, well a comedy. Not a movie that would keep me laughing, throughout. Will Farrel, honestly wasn't bad. His only other recent enjoyable film was Taladega Nights. Mark, did a great job of being the "serious" cop, and was a perfect partner for Farrel in this comedy. Honestly really couldn't have been funnier. For those of you who say "well it was stupid". No duh it's stupid, it's a comedy, nothing about it was supposed to be taken seriously.

		<fullReview>To be honest, this movie did get a grip of movie from the get-go and didn't let go for MAYBE the first twenty minutes to half an hour. I mean, how the super-cops are eliminated was one of those unexpected-but-gradually-realized-what-was-happening moments, therefore just drawing it out to make it THAT much more funny. However, if you've seen any movie where Will Ferrell is the star, there are some awkward jokes, and rather than just let them die so that the one guy in the back can laugh his ass off, they decided to drag each one out much longer than it had to be. Most notable are the ones where Ferrell plays his usual nerdy-yet-extremely-obnoxious character, who yells profanities (or randomness, which is much more the case this time) to get no where near a realistic feel, which I certainly need for a comedy to work.To make a long story short, this movie was the only one I've ever walked out on. After a while, I didn't much even care for the plot, let alone the next drag on the same genre of jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell has redeemed himself with a hilarious movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys marks the fourth collaboration between actor Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay. Will Ferrell has redeemed himself as a comedy actor after the ever awful Land of the Lost. Ferrell stars with Mark Wahlberg as two detectives who only work in the office and rarely go out to take on cases. Ferrell's character, Allen Gamble is always in the office by choice, while Wahlberg's character, Terry Hoitz, is not.For a while it is because of two of New York's best cops, played by Smauel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. However, they die by jumping off a building. Now Gamble and Hoitz are wanting to step in and be the best cops.Ferrell and Wahlberg are hilarious as Allen is a bit uptight while Terry is acting tough all the time. Michael Keaton does some fine work as the police chief, who also works at Bed Bath and Beyond. Eva Mendes does some good, funny work as Allen's wife.McKay knows how to get the performances he wants out of his actors, especially Ferrell and Mendes. Anyone who likes Ferrell comedies such as Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, Step Brothers, and Old School should check out the other guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although not Ferrell's best work, The Other Guys delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys starts out with Highsmith and Danson (Samuel L Jackson &amp; Dwayne Johnson), two tough cops who are rock stars in their own rights. We then flash to Allen &amp; Terry (Will Ferrell &amp; Mark Wahlberg), accountants for the police department who rarely see any action and are treated like jerks even when they're trying to do the right thing. It is then Allen &amp; Terry must jump into action when they have to take down a rich businessman (Steve Coogan) who is illegally paying a number of people back money. Ferrell &amp; Wahlberg play well off each other, and although Ferrell has done better works in films like Anchorman &amp; Talladega Nights, he certainly hasn't had the chemistry with anyone such as in this film. A constant joke is that Ferrell is a nerdy, vastly unappreciative guy who seems to still get a lot of hot women, and that joke was funny every time. There are a lot of constant jokes that are actually funny every time. Although is does drag a bit toward the end and it becomes a typical action film for the last 15 minutes, it delivers because up until the hour and a half point, it had me rolling in the aisles with laughter, and for that I am highly recommending The Other Guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Guys succeeds, where Cop Out failed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike Cop Out, The Other Guys never loses it's tone on what it's trying to be, an action buddy cop film parody, it avoids from being an annoying spoof like Disaster Movie(2008).Now I won't lie, after the insultingly bad Land of the Lost(2009), I had very low expectations for this film, or any film with Will Ferrell. I thought the film was gonna be just a one joke, and the characters where gonna be annoying, not annoyingly funny, just annoying.Thankfully I was wrong, this was the funniest film next to Dinner for Schmucks. I never thought an unlikely pairing of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg could be so entertaining. Will Ferell is funny when he is not going over the top. Mark Wahlberg is for the most part spoofing his character from The Departed, and for the other part He and Ferrell just play off each other perfectly. Action scenes are pretty good. And Michael Keaton is funny as there Captain, and Eva Mendes bring some laughs as Ferrells wife.If your in the mood for a good comedy, and if you already seen Dinner for Schmucks, then give The Other Guys a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has certainly been one of the best comedies of the summer, seeing as other movies like Dinner for Schmucks did not really live up to its potential.You've got Mark Wahlberg, your typical tough guy; Will Ferrell, your awkward funny dude; Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson playing--what else--a couple of badasses who I was surprised to see got very little screen time. And I still have a huge "What the heck just happened?!" stamped on my forehead after what happened to them.No one really "stole" this movie; meaning, there wasn't really a standout performance from anyone. Everyone was just... funny. There was a couple of interesting humor like the silent fight during the funeral and one of the cops "tweeting" and Michael Keaton quoting TLC songs, as well as some other memorable scenes.This movie has enough action to satisfy the plot and very few (if any) twists. It was simple and to the point, which I haven't decided yet if that's a good thing or a bad thing. But now, every time I see a red Prius, I'm gonna wanna look inside to see if there's a group of homosexual hobos having an orgy.</fullReview>

Put him in The Sound of Music and it becomes an instant comedy classic with nuns. Put him in Star Wars dressed as a wookie and you know the Falcon will need a complementary. Silence of the Lambs, as Hannibal's frightened cell neighbour? Magic! Put Will Ferrell in anything and the movie will go in unexpected directions and over length. Probably a producer's nightmare to work with, but box office gold. I loved this movie for Ferrell's low key handle on his character, who becomes more unhinged as the movie progresses.

Farrel is simply light years ahead of him and it must be because he writes his own material. An exceptionally talented bloke indeed.I noticed that some reviewers even though they rate the film say its to long...Eh? Please give me another hour. Do these people have such short attention spans? Wahlberg really surprised me in this as his comedic timing was spot on. His looks of incredulous amazement at Farrels antics were often priceless. I simply didn't see the guys as a comedy actor but he absolutely shone in this paired up with Farrel.Wahlberg and Farrel must have got on very well as the chemistry between the two is obvious and adds greatly to the enjoyment of the movie for the viewer.I rarely ask for a sequel, but please do make another one with the same cast and while your at it add on another hour.Pure comedy magic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Will Ferrel. I like Mark Wahlberg.I liked that it had a pretty good plot. Most comedies I've seen don't seem to have a believable plot. The action was pretty insane at times, like absolutely impossible. Definitely messed up the reality aspect of the film for me. I didn't like that.But of course, the action wasn't the sole aim of the director. It is meant for the comedy genre, and I think it succeeded. It was funny. I especially liked Will Ferrel's character. He was really cute. I kinda related him to Steve Carell's Barry of Dinner for Schmucks. Both nerdy, socially awkward little fellows that are adorable. He worked pretty well with Mark Wahlberg's tough guy character.It didn't amaze me. It's not the best comedy I've seen ever, or of recent times, but I'll be honest, when it comes to comedies, I like really stupid stuff. Like Anchorman and Talladega Nights kind of humor. I think this movie was a step up from that, maybe a bit less stupid and ridiculous.So yeah, I laughed out loud. I had a good time. I would buy this, if there were no other movies I loved more around, hah. But still, I think it was enjoyable. I would like having it in my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Other Guys was an absolutely hilarious movie, and I think many would agree it can be compared to The Hangover. The only problem was, I really wasn't following the story. If you're someone who just wants to good laughs, this movie will give them to you, but if you want a full, great movie experience, this isn't it. The jokes alone earn this movie 7 out of 10 in my opinion. This movie is said to have completed what Cop Out missed, and I agree with that statement, solely for the fact that this movie was FUNNY. No story, not very good lines, but a funny movie, and it is a comedy so a job well done! Go ahead and enjoy this movie for you will not see jokes like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big name cast takes a script which is OK &amp; makes an OK movie. There are points in the film where there are laughs. There are points where the throw away lines are faster than the audience. Will Farrell has done better material than this &amp; there are worse films like Bewitched which would get my vote as worst Will Farrell film ever. Still while this one gets off too a fast start, the pitch is there too hit out of the park, but the ball stays in the park due to the strength not being there to complete the hit.There is plenty of bat here as the cast has loads of talent. There is an umpire, catcher, pitcher, &amp; a bat &amp; ball. What is missing is the juice. The laughter comes like someone taking steroids, &amp; then trying to keep up with the rest of the world without crashing.Still, this one is OK. There are lots of decent things going on &amp; Farrell is pretty good here. The plot is a police precinct where there are hero cops &amp; then there are the office paperwork hounds. Then, for an insane moment, the hero cops make a mistake &amp; jump out of a building too their deaths. After the funeral, the paperwork hounds have to step into the hero role. That makes them the Other Guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun moments than five comedies combined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys" is a fireball of hilarity detonated by two writers who seem to be having as much fun as its weird heroes. It begs the question: why can't the funniest movie of the year be its best as well? Just about the only big gripe about it is the slacking off of the laughs in the second half, but by then the audience have had more fun moments than five comedies combined. Besides, the story fulfills a higher purpose: to send a poison letter to Wall Street and its regulators. Both halves are good honest entertainment. If there's one movie that could have shed light on recent U.S. financial scandals, it's "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps." But Oliver Stone barely scratches their surface, while "The Other Guys" exposes them with startling clarity, from the collusions to cover up the losses of investment banks and a buddy system that binds the regulators and the regulated. This movie pits powerful cliques of buddies against the underdog buddies, two losers in the police force.The bond between Detectives Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz (Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg) is a tongue-in-cheek teaming up of meatheads. Gamble, the more finely done character, "audited" his parents when he was 11. He became a pimp in school, sporting rapper chic, and later switched to the job of a detective accountant, taunted by colleagues as their "paper bitch." As a buddy, he's fiercely loyal and thoughtful. As a husband, he can be verbally abusive. But as a sex object, he is a runaway hit, driving hot women into a state and into fantasies of three-day sex marathons.Hoitz has had less success in his love life despite being the movie-star/model type. As a young man, he learned to dance the ballet and play the harp as an act of "sarcasm" toward sissies whom he wanted to beat up. Currently, he's banned from street beats because he had brought shame to the police when he shot the top star of the World Series. As a buddy, he can be dense, hurting Gamble's delicate feelings and using him cynically in the name of police duty. Teaming up Ferrell and Wahlberg was an inspired move. They're both born comic actors, capable of wild physical gags as well as a more subtle type of mimicry. Ferrell has the more demanding role, where he swings from being a reluctant partner to a gung-ho crime-buster and as a gruff husband to Dr. Sheila Gamble (Eva Mendez). But Wahlberg is as expressive ("I'm a peacock, you've gotta let me fly!") and as multi-layered, such as his look of disbelief and lust when he first meets Sheila. Like the comic greats, the duo gives Gamble and Hoitz a kind face, a gentle disposition and an honest heart. Directed by Adam McKay like an indulgent father giving free rein to his gifted children, and scripted by himself and Chris Henchy, "The Other Guys" has supplied this year's most quoted lines. Early on, the duo has a battle of conceits to express how they dislike each other. "If I were a lion and you were a tuna," says Hoitz, "I'd swim to the middle of the ocean and eat you and I'd bang your tuna girlfriend," whereupon Gamble frees a cascade of metaphors.More word plays keep the fun going ("the sound of your pee hitting the urinal sounds feminine"), as well as non sequiturs ("I'm Catholic, he's Episcopalian, so somehow it works") and mock hyperbole ("I think we all witnessed today a ballet of emotions and feelings," says Gamble of Hoitz's Baryshnikov-like pirouettes). This movie puts the audience in such a lighthearted state that when it's time to wrap up the story, some feeling of letdown sets in. But sit tight, as there's intrigue and more wham-bang action yet to come. When Gamble and Hoitz set off to investigate scaffolding violations in the buildings owned by billionaire David Ershon (Steve Coogan), little did they know that they will be sitting on top of a rotten scheme where Ershon and his creditors conspire to make huge dirty profits from huge dirty losses. Some may find the Wall Street jargon off-putting, but really, it all boils down to state lottery earnings and police officers' pensions at risk of melting down. American public apathy had played a role in the Bernie Madoff, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers scandals, and still does and this movie indicts everyone.Two scenes keep "The Other Guys" crackling with comic madness. The comedy gems are the dinner scene at the Gambles with Mendez and a sketch toward the end -- where Gamble's mother-in-law (Viola Harris), disguised as a bag lady with a walker, shuttles back and forth to deliver increasingly salacious messages between him and his angry wife.In a Manhattan pub, Jewish humor meets Irish humor as Gamble (or Irish-blooded Ferrell) joins an a cappella group in a lovely rendition of a parody of a tragic Irish rebel song that ends with the English scoundrels burning Harry Potter books. Huh? Coogan plays Ershon as a quick-witted manipulator with the charm of a fading rock-star. Mendez as Gamble's trophy wife reveals a comedic side to her celebrated silhouette and is very much in on the joke. But Madame Harris steals the show at the last moment as her pleading eyes and quivering voice, tinged with gleeful malice, turn the audience's giggles into bursts of laughter.In one defining moment, Gamble and Hoitz duck under the bed to make sure that their chat is not being recorded. "Did you miss me?" Gamble flusters. Hoitz continues his prattle about the latest findings of their criminal investigation. "Hey did you miss me?" Gamble insists. "Well ahhh, umm yes," Hoitz replies, then carries on. It's a splendid irony that after all the huffing and the arguing and the screaming, the best lines of "The Other Guys" come in whispers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most people have given a pretty accurate summary of the movie, so I won't get into that. I will just say that I loved the chemistry with Will and Mark-they work together very well. It was a blast seeing Michael Keaton on the big screen again, and he's another one Will has great chemistry with. But then, I think Will has it with almost everyone, so I'm biased. The movie was hilarious. There were several moments my friend almost choked on her popcorn during some of the funnier scenes. I highly recommend it as a fun summer movie, and hey-I absolutely would not mind a sequel, if they have a great story. As far as other people's comments that it is not as good as Anchorman, I disagree. I just didn't like Anchorman, though. I've watched it several times, and I just don't like it. The Other Guys, however? Totally delivers. Go see it, and bring a friend or two. If you like comedies-if you like action movies-what are you waiting for?

		<shortDescription>Funniest film of the summer, possibly of 2010 as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say that as of a few months ago, my reviews weren't 10 stars for any movie I loved and 4 (or lower for movies I hated) anymore. But to my eyes, this movie truly deserves it's 10 star rating. In The Other Guys, there wasn't a minute in which I felt bored, or started looking at my watch. There wasn't a minute in which I wasn't either laughing my a** off or being captivated by the action sequences. The chemistry between Wahlberg and Ferrell works very well, but the real highlight of the film comes from the first 10 or 15 minutes with Highsmith and Davidson (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ''The Rock'' Johnson), who come out as two crazy cops who deliver both a load of action and laughs. too bad we didn't see them more.I don't want to say much about this film's plot but I can assure you that you will definitely laugh, and thus, more than once. Of course it's a Will Ferrell movie, and his style seems to be a love it/hate it type of humour, and it is shown a bit in this film so if you are bothered with his style maybe you shouldn't see it, but if you enjoy his style then there is no reason you shouldn't see this film. Ferrell had me laughing a lot and so did Mark Wahlberg, shown here in a style of movie we aren't used to see him. Surprisingly, his funny lines come out better than expected (I'll never look at that actor the same way since his performance in the Departed, one of the greatest performances ever), and even more laughs came from other small roles, such as Eva Mendes and Brooke Shields. In all it's the funniest movie of the year so far, and it definitely has a chance at scoring high during the Golden Globes next Februray. Go see it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the previews, I was genuinely prepared for an action/comedy. With the star power available, I did not see any way I would be disappointed with the outcome, boy was I wrong.I can tell you now, the funniest parts of the movie are seen in the trailers for the film and even one of those did not make the final cut. How could the acting skill in Samuel L Jackson, Mark Wahlberg, Will Ferrell, Michael Keaton and even "The Rock" butcher such a movie? To their credit, each one of the actors did what they could to save the movie, but the plot was so bad, the scenes looked like they were filmed without a storyline and pieced together to try and make a plot, which never materialized. The "bad guys" didn't seem bad, which gave no reason to even care about the characters.In the end, each one of the actors will look back at this film and undoubtedly feel this was the worst movie that they took part in. If you have to watch it, wait for the DVD, it should be out within weeks. The critical reviews are going to be bad</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get to go out to the movies often (last movie I saw in the theater was the 2009 Star Trek), so I don't want to have my time wasted on a bad movie.I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised! Though I like most of the Will Ferrell movies, I was a little afraid this movie would be too corny and I would lose interest. NOT SO! I have to say that I laughed during the ENTIRE movie.I found the movie to be pure enjoyment and am so glad I went. All of the main characters were great fun to watch and it was actually exciting to see some of the ones whom I've not seen in a movie in a long time.I don't really have comments on the plot and other details. I'm just reporting it was pure enjoyment and suggesting it for a wonderful, uplifting, funny time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie which you can adore or hate. There is no in between. no average. For me, I had some difficulties...the next day. My stomach was soar of all the laughing at this movie!! I enjoy watching movies with will Ferrel. He is like one of the best comedians on the screen. But you need to like the dry humor to love the movie...Actually, you need to see the film twice if you want to get all the jokes. For example: Every woman like Will Ferrel. And all of his girlfriends are hot. But you only find this out when you see his wife. By that time other jokes with hot woman are made already. It's so dry that jokes you will see in Talladega nights and the wedding crasher repeat themselves in a new kind of way. And if you love that kind of humor: definitely watch this one!! It's maybe the best in it's kind. If you don't like this humor. please don't watch it, and please don't tell this movie IS not good, but you don't like the humor... I find it fantastic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Other Guys is a great and funny action comedy starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. In the film, the punch lines come fast and thick in the film's first half, detouring into some inspired out-of-left-field bits ? a monologue about lions fighting tunas, hobo sex in a Prius ? but as the film's convoluted white-collar crime plot takes over, the mirth wanes and what remains are mostly retreads of the movie's earlier jokes and lots of frantic action. Perpetually angry New York police officer Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) has been demoted to desk duty, partnered with Allen (Ferrell), a milquetoast forensic accountant. Their entire police division lives in the shadow of two supercops (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson), who are known for their over-the-top, property-destroying arrests. When the ultra-macho cops die in a hilariously surreal act of buddy-cop bravado, Terry and Allen get their chance to shine as detectives. Some funny comical notes and lightens are ones that include Allen's past life as a pimp named Gator, and Eva Mendes upending her typical throwaway hot girlfriend role into Ferrell's hilarious wife. Listening to her briefly croon "Pimps Don't Cry" makes clear that this is comedy by a thousand nicks. That was pretty funny the first time, after it went down. Another nice scene was the frozen still frame scene, showing a showing of Allen and Terry drinking in a club.Though the movie started off great with many funny jokes, the 2nd part of the film kinda went down from there. They added in too many subplots (Allen's conflict with his wife, Terry reuniting with his girlfriend, , the crime bankrupt plot, etc.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Other Guy. Honestly, I thought the trailer was pretty weak. But, I am a person that strongly believes "never trust a trailer". And, that is very much the case here. First, and foremost, I love Will Ferrell. Stepbrothers is one of the top funniest movies of all time in my book. Secondly, if you asked me if I liked Mark Wahlberg... I would say ,I wouldn't ever bring up that I liked him as an actor, but I don't really dislike him. In this movie, I feel like he was over-acting. Comedy just isn't Wahlberg's thing. OK, now to the movie. Will Ferrel really shines and delivers his brand of humor in this movie. What can I say? It is a really funny movie. There is a ton of hilarious dialogue, and some really good one-liners. The action is actually that of a high end action movie. You get a lot of laughs and some action. There are a few spots where it lags a little, but I would not pass up seeing this movie. Definitely worth the watch, and funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some early reviews on this movie and they absolutely raved about, saying it was hilarious. So I went in with some pretty high expectations, based on A) Great Reviews and B) Funny Trailer. So when I got out of the theatre I was slightly disappointed. It was funny don't get me wrong it was really funny, but the way people were talking about it, it was a classic. There were some quotable lines in their, some pretty funny scenes, making it better the Talladega Nights, but not as good as Anchorman or Step Brothers.Adam Mckay made an appearance as Dirty Mike, in my two favourite scenes, and Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg played off of each other perfectly, but this is nothing but your slightly above average comedy, definitely worth a rent, but nothing to rave over.usualfilmfan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give the writers of this film credit, they really came up with some original dialogue. This is the first cop movie that I have ever seen where I have heard one of the cops tell his Captain that he is like a peacock and you have to let me fly! How creative! Numerous reviewers have said that Will Ferrell gave a fine performance and redeemed himself for last summers stinker Land Of The Lost. However, lets not forget that this is a "buddy" film and Mark Wahlberg does a great job as well. I figured he had a ball doing this film because he is sort of spoofing the character that he played in The Departed. SPOILER ALERT It was great seeing Samuel L. Jackson in this film along with The Rock as the two supercops that Wahlberg and Ferrell wish to emulate. However, the manner of their deaths wasn't so heroic. They dove off a twenty story building hoping to land in the trees but landed on pavement instead. Tsk tsk, not very smart!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This opened in London in a ho-hum week and whilst the Press were mostly negative virtually all the reviews stressed that the first half hour was hilarious but one a plot of sorts kicked in it tended to go downhill. On the strength of that I decided to check it out. I didn't find anything all that excruciatingly funny in the first half hour or indeed at any point but it was a fairly painless way to kill a couple of hours. One think the Press did get right: Steve Coogan was pathetic and as unfunny as he continually strives to be. Much - possibly too much - is made of Ferrell's nerd proving to be a babe magnet and apart from that the plot is pretty much formulaic.</fullReview>

The Samuel Jackson and Dwayne Johnson cameos were hysterical as well, though only in the film for a mere total of maybe five minutes of screen time, every minute had me laughing out loud at their incredible wrecklessness as police officers. Grade A comedy, absolutely hilarious highly recommended go see it. Will Ferrell and Adam Mckay make dynamite and this movie is absolutely no exception to that rule.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg star as two loser cops in New York City who stumble upon a big case involving Steve Coogan as a corrupt investment banker. It's very silly and very typical of a Will Ferrell comedy, so you have to be a fan to have a reason to watch this. I am, and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't put it up there with his best films (Anchorman, Blades of Glory and Step Brothers, in my opinion), but it's definitely worth checking out. Wahlberg makes a nice partner. He's very funny when he gets intense. Ferrell plays a more laid-back, nerdy character in this one. There are a lot of really funny gags. I loved, for instance, the whole running gag about Ferrell being able to attract women who should be far out of his league. Eva Mendes plays his wife, and near the beginning of the film Wahlberg meets her for the first time, attending a dinner at Ferrell's place, and he can't even believe it. The film misses a lot of opportunities, too, partly because they needed to put out a PG-13 rated movie (I hope we get an unrated director's cut; it might be a better film). But even stuff like the partners' rival cops (Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr.(!?!?)), who feel like they should have been a bigger part of the film, doesn't get much in the way of laughs. Michael Keaton has a decent role as the Captain who also has a second job as manager of a Bed, Bath and Beyond so his son can "explore his bisexuality at NYU" (a hilarious joke that really needed to be explored just a tad more). The film ends with a downright odd and out-of-place Power Point presentation of how investment bankers are defrauding America, set to a Rage Against the Machine song. Who knew we were secretly watching a Michael Moore film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrell and Wahlberg are flying peacocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Other Guys doesn't bring anything new to the screen, but as a buddy movie, it is pretty solid. Writer/director Adam McKay milks the formula for as much comedic value as possible, and it is enough to sustain the viewer for a hundred minutes. It starts to fly off the handle (a bit) around the end, by going into action mode, but even here, the presence of comedy is evident. It kind of makes you wonder how Michael Bay would fare if he tried comedy. Scene one has a little too much Michael Bay in it. It's a sequence designed to make sure the audience is listening, It is a bit overdone, and is certainly the wrong type of sequence to put opening credits over. We are not sure which to watch, the film or the names of the people who made it. From there on, The Others Guys, runs nicely. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are a great mixed matched couple. Not only are their personalities different (mostly), but they could not be more physically dissimilar. It never occurred to me just how big Will Ferrell is (then again the last time I saw him was a few years ago, in Stranger than fiction)I got a kick out of this one. The Other Guys is pretty good for its type, and offers enough laughs to be worth your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Others from another mother worked out except for the corporate undertones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many humanoids that think that Will Ferrell is the best funny thing since those other past funny guys that have caused many carcajadas (go to your Spanish dictionary) attacks to others guys &amp; gals. And then there are the Anti-Ferrells, a "stop the Will to power" discriminatory group who crave for Mr. Ferrell to go to hell. There is hardly an existing middle ground with Ferrell, most people either love or despise him. And that is a matter of comedic digestive taste, but there is no denying that the man is multi-talented. He proves it yet once again on the funny, but a bit overrated, "The Other Guys". Ferrell joins up again with that other guy that he has collaborated in other side-splitting gems in the past such as "Step Brothers" and "Talladega Nights"; that would be Writer-Director Adam McKay. "The Other Guys" teams Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg as two cops in a New York district police station who work in the shadow of a pair of heavy-testosterone super cops who pull in all the punches &amp; bullets to catch the bad guys. Ferrell plays the bumbling former-accountant now police pencil-pusher Allen Gamble and Wahlberg makes his mark as the frustrated &amp; enraged Terry Hoitz who is restricted from street crime police work due to the fact that he mistakenly shot NY Sports God Derek Jeter before a World Series game. So therefore that gives Gamble &amp; Hoitz Associates their "other guy" police brand. When super cops P.K. Highsmith and Christopher Danson (played by Samuel L. Jackson &amp; Dwayne Johnson) hit the red asphalt of cop super stardom in a high flying accident, Gamble &amp; Hoitz and the rest of the other cops in the station want to hit the Po-Po Big Time by being the next Super Duo Cop Team. And that is where most of the fun lies in "The Other Guys". However, the plot line of Gamble &amp; Hoitz taking on an investigation of a shady corporate David Ershon was too much of a not-so-funny scheme for my taste. And that is an aspect that I wish that McKay and fellow scriber Chris Henchy could have restrained from exploiting in a comedic movie; we are there as viewers in a comedy to unwind &amp; disconnect from the disconcerting realities such as sleazy scumbags causing much of the country's economic woes. But to their credit, Henchy &amp; McKay's screenplay did not need any scribe policing when it focused on the eccentricities &amp; oddness of its main guys Hoitz and especially Gamble. And not to mention the whole subplots of Hoitz' coming-to-terms with Gamble having a voluptuous wife and Gamble's past alter ego in college were quite hysterical. As far as the Thespian Unit of "The Other Guys": Ferrell was yet again a comedic Will to honor with his work, and Michael Keaton went beyond his acting duties with his pitch-perfect supporting performance as the TLC-quoting Police Captain who also moonlights as a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond manager. Wahlberg was adequate as Hoitz, but the over-the-top antics do not suit him well in a comedic performance. Eva Mendez was more of a physical figure as Gamble's hottie wife Sheila but she la la was more pleasing to the eye than the other gals in "The Other Guys". Damon Wayans Jr. and Rob Riggle did bring some laughs as bullying cops, but their performances were just about what was asked of them to do, and they did not bring enough to the charismatic table. You take away the corporate "way to complex than it had to be" storyline of the movie, you are talking about "The Other Guys" being another classic comedy. I much prefer the other comedic duo in "Step Brothers" which Ferrell was a part of, but there is nothing wrong in investigating if "The Other Guys" warrants a Mirarla Right. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly a fun blast of action &amp; comedy, in a weird way, it was like pineapple express except way funnier &amp; awkward. But not 2 crude 4 parents. Will Ferrell &amp; Mark play off each other perfect. The dialogues they share are better every time they talk. Every time you think they can't dig deeper into each other &amp; their weirdness, they do. I haven't laughed this hard since Hot tub time machine seriously. Will Ferrell acts kind of like he did in Stranger than Fiction. Thou he does figure out how 2 crack away @ his weirdly calm shell better &amp; wiggles around his bad guy side with ease. The back stories of both cops were great and not to long. The whole cast did great &amp; Eva mendes was a bit underused maybe but she was great fun and crazier @ the end so that made up 4 it. Overall, music was fun, don't know if TLC will sue the lead captain for his completely random use of their song lyrics. That was a perfect topping on the seriousness of yet another clueless acting cop in this movie. They all seem 2 be blindsided except the weasel Will Ferrell. Go geeks! Lastly, Samuel Jackson just gets crazier every movie he gets in it seems. Did not expect what happened at all. Movie did know how 2 get serious when it needed 2, so on that point, i give it credit for not overdoing the laughs, or reaching for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The summer comedy is back and with explosions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films this summer have made me want to rush to the theaters. Is it a sign of a struggling cinematic climate, a recession plagued studio system or just a weak summer? Without taking the time to figure out the specific reason let's just agree that there isn't much to get excited about this summer, especially in the comedy genre. Luckily, we live in a world where Will Ferrell and Adam McKay get to make films. The Other Guys stands as a sign that when it comes to ridiculous comedy, this duo continues to set the standard.Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson) are the definition of action hero cops. Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are not. Gamble is a forensic accountant with no aspirations to leave his desk. His partner, Hoitz, having been shackled to his desk after an incident that involved a discharged weapon and a New York Yankee cannot wait to get back in the field. So, when there is an opening for the new hotshot cops, Hoitz jumps at the opportunity. As the two attempt to prove that they are more than just desk jockeys, they stumble upon quite the case that goes deeper than they could have imagined.First, let's get the film's missteps out of the way. The acting isn't always the best, and I'm looking at you Mark Wahlberg. Some people may say that I'm expecting too much and that this is just Marky Mark and we should be happy that he is able to survive without the Funky Bunch, but I say nay. I have witnessed Mr. Wahlberg put his best foot forward in the acting realm. I only have to go back to The Departed where he knocked it out of the park and got a well-deserved Academy Award nomination to see just how good he can be. While his acting is much better than it was in The Happening (although I don't think anything could be worse than that) it often seemed like he wasn't trying. The story is a bit unoriginal and formulaic. The credits, which some may not consider part of the film, takes an odd political turn. While the animation is all right and the information is interesting, the material seems out of place and left me confused when I would have rather left smiling. The only other caveat I would have for this film is that it is very much a Ferrell/McKay film. This is the team that brought us Anchorman and Step Brothers and this film is in that same vein. If you don't like their style of comedy, you probably won't be a huge fan of The Other Guys.Moving on to the good stuff. The cast is strong. Ferrell hits it out of the park. He manages to balance moments of insanity with the ability to also act as a straight man. I don't know that there is another actor that can create a character that is able to bounce across this line as well as Ferrell. Dwayne Johnson (it's tough not to say "The Rock") and Samuel L. Jackson play characters that we've seen before, but don't fail to delight. Then there is Eva Mendes. Obviously, she is all types of beautiful, but the girl has got some comedy chops. I loved the pairing of her and Ferrell and I never doubted that her character had all sorts of love for Ferrell's creating a relationship that is simultaneously sweet and crazy. While the cast is able to elicit huge laughs, without a great script they would have nothing. The script seems to be written to make sure that nearly every line will get some kind of laugh, be it a chuckle or a chortle. The film demands at least a second viewing since I was laughing so hard that I'm sure I missed some jokes.As I've said before, The Other Guys is first and foremost a comedy, but it holds its own when it comes to action. At first I was surprised how well put together all of the action set pieces were. After all, this is Adam McKay not Michael Bay. It was only after I sat and thought about it that I realized that McKay has been building to an all out action film. There was the multiple news station brawl in Anchorman, then the NASCAR crash in Talladega Nights, and most recently the end credit schoolyard smack down in Step Brothers. After this mini retrospective, I realized that I shouldn't be surprised that the guy handles explosions impressively since he's been eyeing it for so long. In this comedy, the well-choreographed and entertaining action is a sweet bonus treat.The summer comedy is back. With The Other Guys Ferrell and McKay show how to make a funny film. The story is far from original and occasionally formulaic, but this doesn't stop the film from being all kinds of entertaining. The script is so well written that any cast would be able to get some laughs from it and it is the audience's good fortune that such funny lines get to be delivered by this cast. Although Wahlberg's acting is a bit wooden, he works well with Ferrell. Eva Mendes, as Ferrell's wife, is surprising in just how well she works in this comedy. Even the narration is great, delivered with the steely coolness that is Ice-T. On top of being a laugh riot, McKay is able to put together some great action scenes, allowing the film to stay true to its buddy cop roots. Despite a confusing and oddly political end sequence, the film will make you laugh. It may be too early to call it, but I'm going to anyway, The Other Guys is the funniest film of this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie delivered just as promised... an amazing performance by Will Ferrell. The whole plot of have pants dropping Mark Wahlberg and Will Farrell as a police investigator team screams funny. There is not only great chemistry between the two, but you could tell they were just having a blast doing this movie. In addition, the starting police stars played by Samuel Jackson and Dwayne Johnson really started out the movie in an amazing chase scene which was not only dramatic but amazingly funny. The whole thing with them jumping to their deaths "in the line of duty" rather than let the bad guys get away was just one example of the dark comedy which this movie delivers a number of times throughout. I also would mention that Michael Keaton delivered a great performance of a quirky police chief...very quirky... using TLC music quotes as inspiration to the officers was just amazingly funny. Even the ending credits delivering a "political/non-political" message about financial bailouts was a bit different from what your normally see out of Hollywood... not really a blame of any political party but really just a demonstration of corporate greed. All in all this movie was I think Ferrell's best to date and am happy to see a comedy that actually kept not only myself... but the entire audience laughing throughout. Hollywood take notes from this movie.... make more like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off strong, but loses its steam in the latter half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Anchorman to Talladega Nights, the duo of Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay has become one of my favorites ? comically ? in the industry as of late. And based on the trailer for The Other Guys, the quirky spirit of those two films in particular seemed to be relatively intact, but does it hold up over the course of the entire film? Unfortunately, no.To start off with aspects of this film that I enjoyed, virtually every cast member involved does a solid job in their respective roles. Both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play off of each other much better than you might expect as the titular characters, and Michael Keaton ? once again, this summer ? steals just about every scene that he's in as the Guys' more-calm-than-he-probably-should-be captain. Also, for what little screen time that they have, both Sam Jackson and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson shine as the two celebrity-status-garnered cops, being responsible for what could be the funniest movie moment of this year so far. Even Eva Mendes (who I'm typically not the biggest fan of) shares a couple of enjoyable moments with Ferrell as his purposely-out-of-his-league wife.It's unfortunate, then, that the plot of The Other Guys is an absolute mess. After about the first forty-five minutes, the movie begins to shovel in unnecessary parts of the story, and by the time that the climax hit, there was simply too much going on for me to even care (despite some surprisingly well-shot action sequences). Also, don't confuse this with last month's Inception, whose complicated narrative was used to challenge the viewer.Still, though, I'm a firm believer in that, no matter how much I may not like the plot of a comedy, if it makes me laugh, it's done its job. A similar rule goes for horror films in my book, where the primary goal should just be to frighten me. Even in this area, The Other Guys only succeeds during its initial half. Similarly to Knight and Day from earlier this summer, once the second half rolls around, most of the appeal is lost, and the movie becomes more of a financial thriller than a buddy-cop comedy.The Other Guys, while still enjoyable to a degree, with the laughs being nearly consistent throughout the first forty-five minutes, is yet another film from this summer in which a significant chunk of its steam is lost within the latter half. Overall, my suggestion would be to pay half of the ticket price to see half of the film. Doesn't sound too unreasonable, does it?</fullReview>

The film starts out with Ferrell and Wahlberg being an odd ball duo, with Ferrell happy behind a desk and Wahlberg aching for some action. Wahlberg is able to finally convince Ferrell to jump on a case with him, which leads them to an investigation that is ill advised all along the way. Mendes lights up the film as Ferrells mismatched wife, with Wahlberg immediately noting this and stating it constantly throughout the film. The movie is full of action, as well as great chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg, which leads to hilarious interactions between them. I recommend this film for everyone!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you don't think its funny, it means you don't get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be honest with you. I usually don't write reviews. 1. It's because I'm bad at them. 2. It's because so many people do and I feel mine are never seen. 3. I hardly have the time.The reason I chose to write a review about this movie is because it deserves one. I haven't laughed so much since "She's out of my League" came out a few months ago. And let me tell you, this movie is hilarious. Let me warn you, there are some parts that are questionable if they should of been part of the movie or not, but in general, it's very funny. Will Ferrell is at his best in this movie and Mark Wahlberg is at a never seen before point of view in this motion picture. Based on looking at other reviews, some people are hating on this movie. After watching it, I have concluded that it's because the people don't get all of the references. If you have only seen a few movies and TV shows in your life, you obviously are not going to get the references they make in the movie. That doesn't give you the right to say it's not funny. To be honest, I didn't get some of them either, however people in the audience did, and had tears of laughter. If you watch this movie, I assure you that you will laugh, and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Will Ferrell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When New York City's most destructive, er I mean honored, cops Danson and Highsmith (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Samuel L Jackson respectively) are out of action, the city must turn to the other guys (hence the film's title). Meet officers Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Gamble is a buy the book career desk cop while Hoitz is his annoyed partner, essentially banished to this fate for shooting a local hero. The two try to step their game up to impress Captain Gene played by Michael Keaton and become the city's new heroes.I'm reminded of 2004's Starky &amp; Hutch and how the plot forcing the two cops together is a lame excuse to forge gags. I can't make a logical sentence to explain what the bad guy was up to, and the audience isn't expected to give two cents. They paid for classic Will Ferrell high jinks and that's what they are going to get. Allan Gamble is a lot like Frank the Tank from Old School, minus the beer. Once he gets wound up, he's like Frank after a keg stand.Directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy), The Other Guys has a familiar composition, though to some degree less outlandish than its forbearer. Some characters are more realistic than others, but their situations and the rest of the world have distinct realism. People die. People also put up with verbal abuse from a spouse in the name of comedy. The most effective way these mildly surreal comedies can cope is to produce laughs, and in the case of The Other Guys there isn't a steady supply but there are enough to make the journey worthwhile. Eva Mendes has a rare comedic turn as Ferrell's plain Jane wife. On the other side of things, Mark Walhberg has little to do other than yell. An effort is made to give Hoitz a conflicted personality; he took up dancing as a kid so that he could better make fun of "girlie men". The point of his character should be that he's the normal one.Austin Powers certainly paved the way for what can be included in a PG-13 comedy and The Other Guys doesn't disappoint in serving up off-camera references that would make Horatio Caine flinch. It's an acquired taste, but not every joke goes this low. My personal choice is a long-winded comeback from Gamble about animal eating habits. There's also a competing cop team, Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.) &amp; Martin (Rob Riggle), who make for unique grade school visitors.The unfortunate truth is that, and as I had suspected, the duo we want the movie to be about is Danson and Highsmith. These guys were splitting my sides. Maybe they couldn't maintain the laughs for a whole movie, but their absence makes it obvious how much funnier the first half of the film is compared to the rest. Regardless, comedy isn't easy and The Other Guys do an admirable job stepping up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you expect it to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw an advanced screening of this movie last night, so maybe some of the things seen in the movie will not make it into the final cut, but anyway.As to not reveal any spoilers, you all have seen the trailer and know the story. I'll tell you how it actually panned out as a film."The Other Guys" was surprisingly well in the beginning. Will Ferrell is not typecast as some obnoxious leading man but plays well as a do-nothing cop. Mark Wahlberg is over the top with his performance, which is what more than likely was expected of him in this type of film anyway. Eva Mendes does really well in this movie and brings in more of the laughs than the movie's leading men.The film starts relatively funny, with banter by Ferrell and Wahlberg that make the movie seem not as predictable as first thought. As the story progresses, the comedy becomes stale. It's as if they had a good concept for a parody of cop action films, but they didn't know how to finish it properly, and it becomes the thing it is parodying. The plot near the ending can confuse many if not paying attention, and for this movie you would think you wouldn't need that much of an attention span to understand it.Bottom line, it promises something new, but ends up being the same ol' buddy cop comedy that we saw 5 months ago when "Cop Out" came out. The idea was there, but they couldn't continue with something fresh and humorous.Wait till this movie is out on DVD, or dollar theater. Don't spend 10 dollars unless you have a date that you REALLY want to spend the night with.It's an okay movie.(On a side note, if anyone cares to know, Jon Brion scored this movie, which you can barely tell because it sounds like the soundtrack to any other action film. See if maybe you can point out some Brion-isms in the music.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam McKay (Anchorman, Talledega Nights) and Will Ferrell (Anchorman, Talledega Nights) team up once again for another goofy screwball comedy. And this time Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, Three Kings) is thrown into the mix, along with notable stars such as Micheal Keaton (Batman, Jack Frost), Steve Coogan (Tropic Thunder, Hamlet 2) and even cameos from Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Unbreakable), and Dwayne Johnson (Scorpion King, Doom). What could go wrong? The answer. Everything.The Other Guys is about detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg) who are reluctant partners who can't seem to do anything write, leaving a wake of destruction behind them wherever they go. They are given the chance for redemption, however, when Allen stumbles upon a case that might be bigger than it seems. This is about as far as I can explain the story because from here it simply makes no sense. The Other Guys exemplifies my main issue with comedies these days. The jokes carry the story instead of the story carrying the jokes. There are so many moments in this movie that, albeit humorous, are utterly pointless and do nothing for the plot. Imagine this movie as a sheet of paper. Covering this sheet of paper are the jokes. And then there are little holes placed sporadically around this paper that represent the actual plot. The plot is suffocated by the so called humor of this movie that it makes it impossible to follow and just annoying to watch.Now normally I can respect a movie for at least delivering in its main selling point, the jokes. Even if the story lacks, if it makes my laugh out loud I still consider it a film worth watching. However, The Other Guys is just another stupid comedy that relies on silliness and sight gags. Most of the time I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at how stupid this movie was than actually laughing. No doubt it had its funny moments, but thinking back now I can really only remember the painfully idiotic parts of this worthless "comedy." Ferrell and Marky Mark do a decent job in their roles, but they simply have nothing good to work with. They deliver nothing new, and definitely nothing worth remembering.I am a fan of Adam McKay's. His directorial debut, Anchorman, is one of Will Ferrell's funniest roles, if not his funniest. Talledega Nights had some extremely memorable moments that I still quote to this day. And I just recently watched Step Brothers and had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard. But now I've learned that McKay needs to stick with what he does best, straight comedies. The Other Guys is a buddy cop movie, so obviously it has its fair share of action sequences. Each one of these is so poorly directed that I sometimes found myself cringing. Adam McKay cannot do action, but I'll stick with him as long as he goes back to what he's good at.The Other Guys has reminded me what it truly feels like to be disappointed by a comedy. At least most comedies of the same nature as this one can be enjoyed and are good for a few laughs. This one was American comedy at its low. Skip this movie. There's nothing worth remember here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's "spit soda out of your nose" funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, in full disclosure, I really can't stand Will Ferrel. Sorry, but I find him insufferable and annoying. So I wasn't expecting much from this film. Boy was I wrong. I could not stop laughing the entire show! Ferrel and Marky-Mark balance each other perfectly. Wahlberg is the perfect straight-man, but also offers his own humor, in a tough-guy kind of way. ("They took my shoes again! What is it with taking peoples' shoes?") Michael Keaton as the police chief is a perfect choice. He is funny enough that this isn't really a 'Will Ferrel' comedy, it really is a total group effort. Big names like Sam Jackson and Dwayne Johnson add big-name punch and set up the farcical nature of the entire film. My advice- sip your soda quickly, or else it'll be coming out your nose.</fullReview>
