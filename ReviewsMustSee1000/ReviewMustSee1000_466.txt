		<shortDescription>Chilling!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have seen all year, and one of the top horror stories ever told. It's creepy, simplistic, and eerie.I was impressed by the enchanting simplicity of the plot, the lack of need for "Hollywood" special effects, and the haunting atmosphere that loomed over everything from beginning to end. The first half, or even three quarters, seemed to move along a bit slowly, but it felt necessary to build the suspense to the point where I was biting my nails in anticipation of the inevitable.Nicole Kidman's character, Grace... I was torn between empathy and disgust for her at times, but she definitely succeeded at captivating me with their lives and story. Predictable in parts, but it still leaves you guessing. This was a quality ghost story, with an old fashioned ambiance; downright spooky. I was in awe of the ending, a fairly intelligent premise. It's the kind of movie that lets you escape reality for a while by entertaining you, but at the same time, returns you to the "real world" with your spine tingling, wondering if there isn't some possibility of truth... Chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle, genuinely creepy and ... SUBTLE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is a very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint. In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucket-loads of blood and gross-out effects, Amenábar actually re-teaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years, completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish, over-concerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world (daylight in particular). She lives in a remote mansion and waits, along with her 2 children, for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants, strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay - by Amenábar himself - is not totally unique (filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist) but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with, if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amenábar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great, the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genre-films of the last few decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect.... a master at work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar is a very young and talented director, born in Chile and raised in Spain. He revolutionized Spanish cinema when he arrived on the scene with Thesis, at only 24 years of age. The came Abre los ojos, a very powerful second film that immediately put him aside some of the leading directors there, like Pedro Almodóvar, Carlos Saura, or Fernando Trueba. The others is only his third film and you can now see a hint of who may become one of the best around in a couple of years (he's only 29). The best comparison I can make of this film is to a piece of clockwork. Precise, exact, nothing is gratuitous or excessive.... What a subtle charm this film works on you as a spectator. The screenplay is one of the best of this genre I have seen in the last few years, very carefully revised and misleading, yet at the end everything makes perfect sense, not the mention on the second time you watch it. It is true that many of the film's features and details may be traced to classic films of the genre, but there is nothing wrong with that. The director himself said it was an homage to directors like Alfred Hitchcock (to whom he has been compared somewhat prematurely.... he may reach such height but he still has a long road to walk). That is one of the great things about the film; it takes the best of the genre, the best that has been made by the best directors... it's a film lover's delight. I had never thought Nicole Kidman could have been at the height of the project, as I really have never considered her a great actress. All I can say is I am still dumbfounded by her extraordinary performance... really, a large percentage of the film's success can be related to her. Sober and discreet when needed, yet grand all the same... It does remind some of the most elegant names of classic Hollywood cinema like the Bette Davis of All about Eve or the Katharine Hepburn of The African queen. But it would be really selfish to give her all the credit when she was supported by an extraordinary cast. Fionnula Flanagan (the sweet old lady from Waking Ned Devine) is trully magnificent as the governess, Mrs. Mills, and very surprising performances of a mute and an old gardener are given by Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes. The children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) are also fantastic. Finally, I cannot but mention the crew of the film. It is even a more fantastic job when you consider that the film (many people don't realize this) is chiefly a Spanish production. The production design by Benjamín Fernández and specially the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe are extraordinary. Just as in the best painting of figures like Goya or Rembrandt, light and shadow reveal the objects and the people. I do not hesitate to say that this is really one of the best films of the year 2001. I am still waiting to watch Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, La stanza del figlio, The shipping news, The hours and Italiensk for begyndere, but I know it will remain amongst those at the top. A 10/10 is really fair for a film that has it all, a perfect machinery that arrives at a time when we seriously need intelligent films and not blockbuster deceptions. I can only say I hope its director won't jump to Hollywood in search of big-time projects that waste his potential. It is a film to feast on.. to savour, to enjoy, to remember....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"THE OTHERS is a creepy film... that reminded me of an old 40s or 50s ghost story."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is yet another in a long list of great horror movies of the new millennium. I have always loved ghost stories, and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever. It's like one of the great old black and white ghost stories but better. It takes you on a slow, and uncomfortable ride.The story is simple. Grace lives in a mansion with her two children, both allergic to sunlight. That little twist on the story was just great. It makes the film completely opposite than other ghost stories, with Grace not afraid of the dark, and making sure to keep the light out, to save her children. This provides us with a very creepy, and dark atmosphere. Plus the mansion is also a creepy place. Not to mention, that in the film everyone who enters the house, must close the previous door, before opening the next.Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast in The Others. This may be one of her best performances ever (She was also great in this years Moulin Rouge). She was really very believable in the part. The two kids in this film were also fantastic. Alakina Mann as Anne was terrific. She played the bullying sister great. She and James Bently, who played Nicolas, really seemed like siblings. Awesome job by both. Fionnula Flanagan was also fantastic as Mrs. Mills. She really creeped me out, and I didn't know where she stood. Was she good or bad? I didn't know, but her acting was right on the ball.Alejandro Anemabar directed The Others with such atmosphere. The dark lighting is creepy, and the cinematography is beautiful. This guy's has got a bright future. To accompany all the atmosphere we get a fabulous score by the director, Alejandro Amenabar. The music is creepy, and really adds to the feel of a 50's ghost story. It also sets the mood of the film, and makes the scary scenes, even scarier. The score is fabulous. Not only did Alejandro Amenabar direct, and score, but he wrote the great, and well-developed screenplay.The Others is not without a great twist ending, that should shock everyone. I did not see it coming, and it's such an original concept to use in a ghost story. It worked well, and I was speechless after the film. Outstanding finale.This film is yet another horror film that proves that big budget special effects suck! This film is scary, and it only had a $17m budget. The Others did great at the box office, and deserved every buck it earned. It's a creepy film, that has its very scary moments. This is a film that will not be forgotten. It'll be stuck in my mind for a long time. This really reminded me of an old 40's or 50's film. I highly recommend this film to every fan of ghost stories.The Others: 10/10, A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole Kidman rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to sum up this movie in a word, it would be "chilling." The Others is a delightfully atmospheric suspense film. It's tense, scary, and very memorable -- I don't think I'll ever forget the image of a terrified Nicole Kidman clutching her rosary beads around her shotgun as she tears down the halls of her dreadful Victorian mansion.Writer/director/composer Alejandro Amenabar creates a dark, dark atmosphere, in which you feel like you can't trust anyone. Nicole Kidman, in her brilliant performance as Grace, is supposedly the "heroine" of the film, but as I watched the movie I found myself more frightened of her than rooting for her; steely and overbearing, with a hint of psychotic hysteria in her icy eyes. And then the children, (held their own and even stole a few scenes from the more experienced players) were just hellishly creepy. The little girl was one of the most ominous characters I have ever seen in a film. And the servants (who were also finely played) will keep you guessing the whole way through. Every time you think you have it figured out, some of the household help will pop up and throw the whole framework off-kilter.The real attraction in this film is Nicole Kidman, following up her bravura performance as Satine in "Moulin Rouge" with a woman teetering between insanity and iron control. Grace has so many layers, and Kidman reveals almost all of them through her face. The film is anchored by her presence, and she plays off the other actors extremely well -- note the tense relationship she has with Anne, her daughter. When the two lock eyes, it's like watching two trains crash head-first into one another.The only disappointment in this movie is the ending, which is slightly anti-climactic. When you get to it, you'll be satisfied, and it ties up everything that's happened in the movie up to that point quite well. But it seemed almost anti-climactic, and I was left feeling a little bit let down.Overall, I gave The Others a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Drama Entangled in Intense Thrills and Chills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny that I see this movie the way I do, perhaps I'm more perceptive to little dramatic, human touches, but I saw this movie and was satisfied with it. In fact, I fell in love with it. This movie is chilling, very spooky, with a few moments that will make you jump, but it's a movie that works itself up, and by the end of the movie you feel scared, and like someone has zapped you a few times, chilly from inside out, but fulfilled.People have been comparing this to "Sixth Sense". Though the movie may share similarities, this stands on it's own. It's content is not trying to send a message, except for a universal theme that you want to grasp onto. There is historical and religious content, purely in context for the twists and turns and nuances to make this film so complete in every aspect. Everything works so well. This movie takes pride in each scene, and each is set up so that you get the most of it. Everything relates to everything, you are given clues the entire movie, but it's set up so masterfully the ending is the suprise you've been waiting for.The performance by Kidman and the two children are one of a kind. It's a realistic interaction between siblings and a controlling, dysfunctional, but loving mother. The acting and writing (the script) is so well done, it adds for scattered scenes that will, hopefully, stick around with you for a long time. There's this one beautiful scene in the movie, it's where Grace (Nicole Kidman) is hugging her son, and her daughter (who is slightly estranged from her mom) runs up and hugs her, and there this look of absolute release on the face of Grace. Another great scene is when Grace carries her rifle around the house (shoot the ghost!), and she's desperately trying to protect her house and children. There are more like that, so keep your eyes open.The cinematography is innovative and brilliant, camera angles and the lighting set everything up so well. The lighting is very important as well, in fact, the subject of "light" is so well mixed into the story, the dark feels safer and more secure than the light does. There are times when you long for the darkness, just as the characters long for the darkness (due to a part of the plot including a health condition of the children, which serves a basis for the mental thrill fest to come). To finish off this concoction, try to listen to the score, because it's very fitting.This is more of a drama than a thriller, though it deserves to be a thriller (it's scary), but the power of it's dramatic side comes bursting through. This is a beautiful movie, it has overtones of a more serious side, and it's a movie that hardly belongs in the horror section because of it's beauty, but it's too darned eerie, weird, and chilling to fit anywhere else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, stylish horror film ***/****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The others ***/**** "The Others" is a suspenseful horror film unlike many these days. Most are concerned with blood and gore, teenage girls getting naked, body count, and not scary. "The Others" is atmospheric, spooky, bloodless, and carried by strong acting and fleshed out characters. Yet, it takes too long to make an impact and the final payoff is not as shocking as it should be. The plot is simple and not especially innovative (your average ghost story), but it seems fresh thanks to strong acting and a well-crafted, eerie atmosphere that rivals that of a Tim Burton film. Nicole Kidman is Grace, a beautiful young married mother who must raise her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) alone in their gigantic (actually, ridiculously large) mansion on a British isle, around the end of WWII. They are alone, for the husband and father has been at war and has not returned, and their housekeepers mysteriously vanished. Suddenly, a trio of friendly caretakers arrive one day. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) is the amiable old lady, Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) is a mute young girl, and Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) is the not-so-social gardener. However, there is a strange, arcane facet to the trio; they have little background and had no way of knowing that Grace was offering positions at her manor. Aside from this, Grace must deal with her children, who have a deadly allergy to light, which means that the house must be dark all the time, allowing for a spooky dark, shadowy ambience. Anna and Nicholas, most importantly, have been visited - by a family of ghosts. Noises - crying, piano music, and running - have been heard. And curtains that stop light from entering the house are opening and closing by themselves. The film is based around Grace's efforts to solve the enigma.I love the atmosphere of "The Others," set in a nostalgic and ominous 1940's estate. Snowy mist blankets the grass and crisp fall leaves. Murky waters of a lake border the chateau. Elegant furniture, polished marble and wood floors, neatly-woven blankets, tautly fabricated furnishings of wood and olive green cloth, coal black German sedans, lightly wrinkled sweaters and jackets are all seemingly authentic from the era. One spectacular and tense scene has Grace haplessly stumbling through an impenetrably thick ocean of milky fog that weaves through overhanging trees and a ground of crunchy bronze and russet leaves.The action takes a while to get started up, which is a major negative. This is due to the director, Amenabar, spending time to develop an involving plot, 3-D characters, and the aforementioned décor. While Amenabar succeeds in those respects, we find ourselves wishing something would happen. Many people will easily become bored, feel tempted to sleep or leave, etc., but I, while not exactly enthralled by that point in the film, was still enjoying it.When we finally are treated to doses of suspense and chills (not so much horror and terror), it is satisfying. You most likely will find yourself on the edge of your seat or huddled in a ball anxiously awaiting the potentially fatal results of Grace's investigation. This is not so much because you care about her character, but really because you expect a sudden scream and heart-stopping outburst of maniacal ghosts. Most scenes are chilling, including the door shutting in the piano room, the old lady in the white dress, and the final chaotic conclusion. However, I can not say that I was truly horrified and paranoid from this film, unlike "The Sixth Sense," where I was freaked out for months. I was still very entertained.I must commend all the actors in the film, especially Nicole Kidman. The acting was down to earth and realistic, despite Nicole Kidman forced into saying some foolish lines ("Something.. Diabolical!). The two child actors, Mann and Bentley, were excellent in a fairly difficult role for children. Another important downside to the film was the "shocking" conclusion. While I must admit that I found it brilliant, it lacked the powerful punch I wish it had. I don't know why this is, it just isn't. I am disappointed at how much potential the ending could have packed and how little it did. Overall, I found "The Others" a highly entertaining thriller with magnetic milieus and plenty of startles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A throwback to the great spooky Gothic films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.With 'The Others', Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. Kidman is great as the incredibly brittle and mentally frayed Grace. While she puts on a cool, haughty façade, the circumstances she finds herself in are clearly eating away at her sanity. The actors who play her children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent. 'The Others' is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. 'The Others' takes its time to get to its reveal, and it is worth every minute. 7/10Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly decent and original concept.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because "scary" movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled, cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B- horror/thriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, I'd like to say that I have yet to see The Sixth Sense, so I cannot comment on any similarities between the two films that I have heard exist.Grace (Kidman) and her two young photosensitive (X.P.) children live in a sprawling old house together in England in the 1940's and await the return of their father and husband who went off to fight the Germans in WWII. As a result of the children's very rare and dangerous skin condition, all of the house's curtains must be shut during the day and all of the doors must be closed and locked to prevent any accidental solar exposure to the children. Despite the warnings from her children and new found servants, strange things begin to happen in the house which Grace chooses not to accept or investigate...partly because of her zealous religious beliefs which leave her closed minded and ignorant to things outside her psychological realm of thinking. Sooner or later, she will have to come to terms with what's going on...Kidman's acting is admirable in this movie, and although I usually have a hard time enjoying her films, I felt she did a very decent job here. I think she was born to play a stubborn, hard nosed, uptight tart, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I especially enjoyed the acting performances from both of the children. Both are talented child actors and were definitely helped by the script which captured what it's like to be a child. I was constantly reminded of my own childhood amongst the belittling and teasing between the two, and of course the naive and adorable fears. The film is shot beautifully and has a lot of atmosphere, partly due to the fact that since the children are photosensitive, the house must always be dark, and the director definitely likes to play with that. There's something else that helps the film's atmosphere as well, the fog, which obviously adds to the general spookiness. But I'll leave that one alone as it plays an important role herein. The score helps as well, and is well placed and executed.Overall, I found this to be a very respectable and enjoyable film in almost all respects, and I no longer consider Kidman a pretty face begging for nude scenes. I felt it was very well thought out, and if it weren't for a minor plothole involving Grace's husband, I would have ranked it higher.Easily a solid 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a twist!!! Scary to the last moments, specially at the last moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, i have to say that this year (2001) is the one that established Nicole Kidman as a superstar, she was an "A" actress, but here she became "A+", first and mainly with Moulin Rouge and then with this superb movie, i have to say that i saw a few people who gave this great movie a 10, i rate it with a 10 only because there is nothing higher, but i'm sure it deserves a lot of credit.And i have also seen many people complaining of the "borrowed storyline" (Comparing "the others" with "Sixth sense"), bah they touch the same topic of life (and death actually), but this one has a more religious view, and makes you think a lot about that.Nicole did a great job in this movie, nobody can't deny it, her role as a lovely but at moments almost gone crazy mother of 2 was a dualistic and strange thing that fitted perfectly well in the story. All the supporting actors did a great performance as well.The plot, the plot, i think it couldn't have been better, i don't want to tell you anything about it, so you can have the surprise i had when i first saw it, but the best of all is that you are almost as surprised the first time you see it than the second, and the third, and the fourth...... You just want to see it again, because you experience a feeling that only a few, but a few few movies give you; a strong chill crosses your whole body, it is fear, but you like it anyway, it is a fear that awakes curiosity, curiosity for what is happening next...And what a spectacular, but necessary addition is the environment of the movie: an old mansion at the times of War world II, permanent darkness and haze, dead-like servants, photosensitive children so that the house had to be kept in an absolute darkness, no electric light........could it be more scary?? I don't think so.And by the way, this is a proof that a movie doesn't need amazing special effects, even more, i think this movie doesn't even have special effects, it is all in the way the story is told, nothing more....and nothing less, something that seems to be hard these days.........But i'll stop talking, if you are reading my comment, just stop and go to your nearer video shop and buy it, or rent it at least..........you won't be disappointed..............believe me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Are Here, Invisible, but Here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stewart household is a strange one. An isolated house in the Isle of Jersey, it's constantly enveloped in thick, blue fog, all doors must remain closed, and drapes block the sunlight because the children suffer from an illness in which they are extremely sensitive to it. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman, finally coming to her own in a story worthy of her talents), wakes up one morning screaming from what may have been a nightmare. Three strangers arrive to the house and they tell Grace they are replying for her request for domestic help -- and almost immediately, though subtly, strange events begin happening and it slowly becomes clear that there are other unseen, unwanted people occupying their quarters. This only becomes more evident when Grace discovers, to her horror, that these servants are more than what they seem to and that her own reality is not what she believes it to be.Alejandro Amenabar had already caught the attention of Tom Cruise who produced and starred in his own remake of OPEN YOUR EYES, which gave Cameron Diaz a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and here he establishes himself for the American movie going public with his follow-up. Again going for clever storytelling -- even if it takes a while to take off -- and relying on atmosphere rather than on expensively produced special effects, it's a showcase for Nicole Kidman who carries the entire film on her shoulders and who conveys furious determination to protect her household and absolute terror at the unknown forces against her with intense verve. Fionulla Flannagan and Christopher Eccleston provide some interesting foils to her dominant presence, but the real star is the film itself, who never goes for a quick cheat to fabricate its denouement (diametrically opposed to what M. Night Shyamalan's style where the twist is everything). Already a contemporary classic, it will go down in cinema history as an updated take on THE HAUNTING, with more finely tuned performances, even darker atmosphere, and a rising sense of dread.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the death? What is the fear who make this sleep a huge problem? This movie do not presents a way to understand the future life or the secret of another world. This film talk about the knowledge and the innocence. About an inside solitude and the words of this empty space. Grace Steward is the perfect mother and a perfect wife. But his perfection is his fundamental sin. The fear and the waiting, the love and the sacrifice spirit. Like the Old Lady she believes in the reality and must protect his personal world of the dangerous contacts. The house is a grave, but his silence is the honest price for live. The rooms are cells but this is only way to save the essential. The sick of children is a wall for a good protection. Bertha Mills and his companions are not only the enemy, guides or strangers. They are the end of waiting. The killers of the Grace's reality. The death is yours master piece. And the verdict- a word of children's lesson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of The Best and the Most Original Ghost Stories of Haunted House Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1945, in Jersey, Channel Islands, the widow Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a lonely old house with her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann) and her son Nicholas (James Bentley). Grace lost her beloved husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) in the World War II and their children are photosensitive and Grace keeps the curtains and the doors closed to protect Anne and Nicholas against the sunlight. Grace raises her children with strict discipline and following religious principles. Grace hires the strange housekeeper Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), the mute maid Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) and the gardener Mr. Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) that have asked for a job. Out of the blue, mysterious things happen in the mansion and Anne claims that there is a boy named Viktor that visits them. Grace unsuccessfully seeks out the intruders until the day she has a revelation about the house and its intruders. "The Others" is one of the best and the most original ghost stories of haunted house ever made (the best is actually "Haunted"). Nobody can guess the final plot point that has one of the best twists of the cinema history. I saw "The Others" for the first time on 28 June 2002 and today, almost ten years later, I have enjoyed almost the same way I did in 2002.This is the third film made by the excellent Alejandro Amenábar, who is the director, writer and composer. The plot is very well disclosed and the entire cast has magnificent performances. Nicole Kidman is very beautiful before her plastic surgery of the nose and has a top-notch performance. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Os Outros" ("The Others")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched THE OTHERS simply because Christopher Eccleston in it , a future DOCTOR WHO in a scary movie , now this I've got to see , but to be honest Eccleston's role is little more than cameo while the always consistent Nicole Kidman isn't the real star of the movie - It's writer/director Alejandro Amenabar From the opening shots where the servants arrive at Grace Stewart's house I had the story pegged as to where it was going . Grace is an absolute nutter isn't she ? But then the story twists and turns a little and then I thought she might be a victim , I mean these servants ... But the story keeps twisting along nicely so that the script is one step ahead of the audience . There is a slight problem though if you're familiar to Amenabar's work , especially ABRE LOS OJOS and that is that he's a master of the shock twist ending and I thought with the appearance of Eccleston's Charles Stewart half way through the movie I had the story sussed . I actually did work out how he fitted into the story and was correct in guessing his fate but I never believed in what the twist ending was so well done Senor Amenabar There is a problem with this type of story and THE OTHERS is no different in that respect - You can only enjoy the movie once since you know the shock twist at the end when you see it a second , third , fourth time and there's another very successful film ( No clues but you'll know the one I'm talking about after you see this ) that has the same idea which means comparison's are inevitable , but it's difficult to compare to one another . Certainly THE OTHERS has a more creepy atmosphere and probably a better pace and cast with special mention going to Alakina Mann as Anna who plays her role as a totally convincing horrid brat , nice to know Amenabar has resisted the temptation to portray the children as sugery sweet little cherubs which is often the case in Hollywood movies , you might not believe this but THE OTHERS in fact is a Spanish film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman is a lucky girl. She's got two great movies out there. All in the space of a year and both showcasing her ample talent. The Others in particular, while devoid of OTT performances, costumes and sing along songs, will appeal to a lot of people. People who enjoyed 'Sixth Sense' in particular will enjoy it, and those who're into ?X-Files' will surely enjoy this too. However, it isn't a slasher thriller, with some ditzy teenagers running around a school chased by a homicidal fisherman. No, it's much more intelligent and, to me, seemed a far slicker movie than even 'Sixth Sense'It's focus is on a family, after the war, living in an old mansion (prime ghost story location! Why can't they have a nice semi detached?!). The children are photosensitive and the house must be kept in darkness and this creates an imposing atmosphere from the off. The characters, including the mother played by Kidman, seem to have more to them than we are led to believe at the start. There are noises in the house, the children say they've seen people walking around, the mother seems to on the edge and about to break, and all the while, the creepy atmosphere grows and grows.It's strength lies in the fact that it doesn't simply throw the characters into scary situations, (e.g. some man chasing them around the house) to get a reaction from the audience. It instead creates a sense of dread. The director uses the camera and sound to merely suggest what's there. The viewer's mind is allowed to make up the rest (and is much more effective than several million dollars of special effects). The sound of whispering in an empty room, or the haunting sound of a piano playing from a locked room. And having creepy maids and gardeners puts the audience at unease, trying to second guess if they're good, bad or evil.The story takes a lot of dramatic twists and turns. And in the end, everything is, to paraphrase one of the characters, "...Changed. It'll never be the same again." The conclusion is one to rival 'Sixth Sense'. You're feelings are towards the characters are completely different, and "The Others" of the title are not who you'd have thought they were.The mother is, of course, the main focus of the story. Treading, it would seem, a fine line between exploding, and being ready to give up. At first, it seems sure fire who's good, and who's bad. But then you feel a growing antipathy towards some characters, and to a certain extent, the mother. In the end, though, you only feel extremely sorry and sad for the characters, yet angry at some of them too.This movie, along with ?Moulin Rouge' was a pleasure to see (well, it was a pleasure in hindsight. It was definitely in the `too engrossed to move' range when I was in the middle of watching it) and I would recommend it to anyone (except those with baby's or heart conditions)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of my friends told me, that this is a masterpiece. Excellent acting, brilliant cinematography, extraordinary music, great atmosphere, etc., etc.,....... So I wanted to buy the DVD without seeing the movie, because my friends are nearly always right in case we do have the same predilections. Luckily another friend of mine borrowed me his DVD.As I had been very excited at the beginning, I was bored beyond believe while watching this one. It is so in lack of story, that even the brilliant twist at the end could not change my misery. Sure, technically it is great, the twist is awesome, but that does not make a masterpiece. Especially not, if the first 90 minutes are boring and stupid as hell. The music is not bad, but when it rises up, the actress turns around and nothing happens, so I just asked myself: So what? By the way: Nicole Kidmans performence is breathtaking. I hope, that someday this gifted woman receives the Oscar she deserves so badly. Becaus in my opinion she was passed over for: To die for, Eyes wide shut(supporting) and of course: Moulin Rouge! But back to this movie.Some cinematography and directing are just selfish. The plot with the husband (a totally give away of Christopher Ecclestone) could have been cut out. It is just repeating the "pillow-story" the third time and adds nothing new to the picture. But most responsible for killing "The Others" is the weak writing. But I don't want to make you think that everything is bad in this movie. So here are the good things: Sometimes great atmosphere is built up. Sometimes destroyed by the selfishness of the cinematographer and the director. Same thing with the direction itself. The music is really good composed and arranged, but sometimes unnecessary (as read above). The performances are all very good and believeable. But all in all, and in this case I keep it with Martin Landau in "Mistress": I think, the story is an important element!So, if you like nice pictures, good acting and a brilliant twist: Go and rent it! So many people liked it.But for me: I give it 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching THE OTHERS because I love good ghost films. However, by the end of it I was disappointed. The screenplay didn't quite develop some of the best ideas in the story. **** SPOILERS ****For instance, the "what happened that night" part should have been introduced more forcibly earlier on in the film. The problem for me was that as soon as I saw Christopher Eccleston (Kidman's husband in the movie) appear out of nowhere in the fog, the twist became pretty clear to me. Also, the servants' clothes gave them away as ghosts (too old-fashioned). Having seen The Sixth Sense, I just knew that if the husband and the servants were ghosts, then Kidman and the kids must be ghosts too. I quite enjoyed the ending but it wasn't half as scary as the ending of The Sixth Sense. I know it's not fair to compare films in this way, but I can't help but do it in this case, simply because they are based on the same premise and quite frankly, The Others jumped on the bandwagon in that sense.As far as Kidman's much-performance is concerned, I thought she was good but not impressive. I would have preferred someone with a face that said more than their whispers. I found her a bit hysterical.Overall, I would give this film 6/10 for trying hard and for generating a good atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is directed and written by Alejandro Amenábar. It stars Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Elaine Cassidy, Eric Sykes, Alakina Mann &amp; James Bentley. Amenábar also scores the music and the cinematography is by Javier Aguirresarobe. Plot sees Kidman as Grace Stewart, the mother of two children who have an allergy to sunlight. With her husband still missing in action during WWII, Grace and the children reside in a remote mansion on the isle of Jersey. When one day a trio of house servants turn up looking to fill the vacancies at the mansion, it coincides with strange supernatural occurrences around the home. Are the children being mischievous? Is Grace losing her mind? Or is there indeed something not of this world at work?The haunted house creeper has had a number of film version tellings over the years. A different kind of horror film, it's a sub-genre that relies on suggestion and atmospheric shocks instead of rampant blood letting. The Others is one of the finest of its type, a wonderfully crafted chiller that thrives on old fashioned values to deliver its scares. The set up is standard formula stuff, a big gloomy mansion that's nice and remote with rolling gardens and finds itself often cloaked by impenetrable fog. A couple of cherubic kids, classically inviting creepy activity, and servants that have foreboding written all over their respective foreheads. Throw into the pot the lonely female trying to hold her self together as things threaten to unhinge the family bond, and it's so far so formulaic. But Amenábar, for his English language debut, has a great sense of mood and pacing, slowly unwinding the coil to reveal a sense of impending doom, playing it out amongst eerie sounds and deft camera movements about the house. That the kiddies have a light sensitive problem gives Amenábar the perfect excuse to keep the whole thing dimly lit: to great eerie effect.With unease in place and the small band of characters firmly established, the other key element of the film starts to kick in, namely the mystery element. Just what exactly is going on here? The children, excellently played by débutantes Mann &amp; Bentley, garner much sympathy, but at the same time we suspect they might be at fault for the ghostly activity. The servants are led by the officious looking, but gently spoken, Bertha Mills (Flanagan superb), you sense something isn't quite right but all cards are played close to the chest so as to not reveal anything. So much so that when the reveal does come, it's a doozy, firmly rounding out The Others as a classic of its type. The trump card here, tho, is Kidman. Pale faced and cold to the eye, she nails the plummy English accent whilst turning in a classic performance of a repressed woman battling against-it seems-everything and everyone. Following in the footsteps of Deborah Kerr and Julie Harris, Kidman's ability to make Grace's mental disintegration believable marks it out as one of the best horror sub-genre performances ever.Suspense, scares and some tricks up its sleeve, The Others is every inch a quality bit of psychological horror. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check Out "The Other" Classics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie today,I read the reviews &amp; they were very positive &amp; given high ratings,so I decided to see it. I was very disappointed in it. I was expecting alot more &amp; kept waiting for something good &amp; scary to happen for the first while.I found alot of it to be confusing. For example: What's the deal with the husband showing up from nowhere in the fog,and what was the purpose of him in the plot? Am I missing something? Also, how come "Ann" was the only one to see the intruders? I left the theater trying to figure it all out. On the other hand alot of it was copied from other movies &amp; predictable. I did not feel scared during this film overall. It had only a few creepy moments worth mentioning. One of them can be seen on the 30 second tv spot.(Ann as the old woman with the white vail) The other is the photo album that Grace(Kidman) finds. That was creepy!Everyone seems to be comparing this film to "The Sixth Sense" I liked that better than this but,I was disappointed in it as well. If you want to see a true classic ghost story then rent or buy the DVD of "The Changeling"(1980) starring: George C. Scott. That blows this movie away! Lots of scares &amp; a much better story. Also "Dark Places"(1973) starring: Joan Collins &amp; Christopher Lee, is another well done scary ghost story with plenty of twists &amp; suspense. There was also an episode of "Unsolved Mysteries" they did about "Ghosts" &amp; one of the segments was about the "Queen Mary" being haunted. That scared me more than this movie! It was very well done &amp; gave you chills up your spine &amp; left you with a really creepy feeling.And I didn't have to pay $9:50 to see it! I wouldn't say "The Others" stunk, but I wouldn't say it was great &amp; worth seeing either. I give it a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of "The Others" we get introduced to housewife Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) living with her photosensitive children on the island of Jersey during World War II. They can't leave the island as the Nazi submarines have it surrounded. Then, ghostly things begin to happen in the house, and the children say that some other people are living in the house. As time passes, Grace gets more and more desperate and angrily starts carrying a rifle around. And then...it turns out that we've been assuming the wrong thing the whole time.This movie probably makes a more interesting use of light and dark than any other movie (at least that I can think of). Every scene's contrast makes you think that something terrible is about to happen. Some people have compared this movie to "The Sixth Sense", and I would call that a legitimate analogy. Not only is there the horror factor, but also how the main character is forced to reassess everything that s/he has known...and then we find out the truth. Kidman, whose roles often seem a little too glamorous, here makes your blood freeze and displays a menacing face without even trying.Overall, I do recommend this one. Just see whether or not you totally trust yourself after watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect example of how to create a ghost story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is one of my favourite horror films of all time. It has a good plot, it is subtle, it gives nothing away until the end and everything it does is relevant to the story. I would recommend viewing the movie twice to really appreciate everything that it does, you will miss many things upon first viewing and watching it twice will really enhance the experience.It is set in the early 1900's and the house, costumes and style are very well presented; they do a good job of transporting the viewer to that time. The story is all based within a mansion where a woman and her two young children live with their three housekeepers. Her two children suffer from a photosensitive disorder and are not allowed to be in direct contact with sunlight, this means that the house is constantly in darkness, offering a much more eerie experience. The daughter claims that she can see ghosts around the house, this is ignored by the mother at the start but before long she is questioning the matter herself. Is the house haunted?My main gripe with many horror films is that things are revealed too early on, in ghost stories you will see the ghost before any real suspense has been able to build. In my opinion the scariest things in horror films are the things that you don't see, the things that only your imagination sees. This is where The Others excels.The Others consists of around 6-7 characters with the majority of it being dedicated to Nicole Kidman, who does a fantastic job with a really convincing performance. She is a very mysterious character who seems extremely paranoid about her children's health and wellbeing; she appears as a woman who is on the edge of sanity. The whole supporting cast are fantastic and not one of them lets the casting down.The Others is a film in which you cannot say much about without the fear of giving anything away, but I will say one thing, the ending is spectacular. So many horror movies struggle to get the ending right, The Others shows its fellow horror flicks how it should be done. Its certificate is only an age 12 but in my opinion it is much creepier than many age 18 films I have watched. If horror movies are your scene then I would recommend this very highly.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the terrible horror movies I've seen before I was really hoping this was going to be a good one and it definitely was, with a fantastic cast and brilliant acting from all the actors and an amazing storyline it was definitely worth watching. Nicole Kidman in particular was fantastic in portraying her character with so much emotion which really helped to convey the deep issues of the movie. Without giving anything away it is a great story from start to finish with plenty of jumps and some tense moments and an ending that completely shocked me I would say it's actually worth watching just for that aspect alone.

		<fullReview>It's 1945 Jersey, the Channel Islands. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) is staying at a mansion with her two kids waiting for her husband. Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) come for work after the previous servants vanished. The children are photosensitive and can't be in direct sunlight. Grace is religious and over-protective with numerous strange rules. Then Grace hears strange noises and voices which her girl Anne says it's a boy named Victor and his family.This is a terrific moody ghost story. The twist is very nicely done. If there is any problem, it's that this movie is released two years after the best ghost movie with a twist. Nevertheless, Kidman is great and the creepy mood is worthy of the best of the old fashion ghost stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good horror film with a spectacular conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of The Others, I honestly was that not interested in watching it, it's premise seemed like a generic horror flick and the plot about a mother living with her photosensitive children alone in a large house or mansion sounded as generic as it gets. How many horror movies we have seen with families living in an abandoned Haunted mansion? The Others didn't seem that different even if the children were suffering from a rare illness or disease, it became hard for me to distinguish the Others from your average generic horror flick. All that was until I actually watched this great film was absolutely mesmerized with it.The film starts out slow, as you are introduced to the characters and the new servants are hired to work in the house and you are introduced to the children and find out about the rare disease they suffer from. As the plot unfolds and the film moves on, events start to unfold, some weird incidents and noises start to occur in the house making the mother, the children and the servants realize that they are not alone in the house, making them believe it is haunted. The plot keeps on unfolding when the unforeseen twist occurs in the end, which I honestly did not see coming at all. It was shocking and was so well handled and executed that it is in my opinion one of the best scenes in horror films even though the scene in retrospect is not that scary but it is the shock factor that makes that scene so great to watch.Performance wise, Nicole plays Grace, the mother of the two children perfectly, she is strict towards her children and tries to discipline them, but is also well protective of them and loves them deeply, she is also depressed about being cut off from the rest of the world due to her children's condition. Bertha Mills who plays the nanny does a fantastic job in her role as a kind old lady but there is something that always remains mysterious about her especially in the later part of the film where she behaves oddly and it seems like that she is up to something with the other servants.The boy who plays Nicolas was actually good in his role, a kid who is scared, and is a sort of a momma's boy who is deeply attached to his mother, and he is scared about the recent haunting in the house. That brings me to Alakina Mann the girl who play's Ann. She received nominations for her performance in this film and it is very well deserved. It is a one of best performances a child artist has done in a horror film, she can be funny, she can be mysterious and creepy, and can also play a serious role. All of which she does in this film. Ann's character was extremely deep and the actress who played her did her job as perfectly as she can. The rest of the cast also performs well and serve well in their roles.Overall, before the watched the Others, I was thinking about watching just another horror film but I was so wrong, this is a fantastic film, with several scary parts and creepy scenes, a slow but well developed plot and a spectacular twist which will leave you in awe and leave you talking about it for days, and make you watch the entire film entirely from a different perspective.Overall Rating: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nearing the end of the Second World War, Grace Stewart lives with her photosensitive children in a large and silent house. After her previous servants went missing, Grace accepts the offers of work from three new servants. Since these three have entered the home, strange events occur, and Grace begins to wonder if it's her sanity getting the better of her, or if there is something more sinister in the house with them.....Yes, we all know its so much more than just another haunted house movie, it's about segregation, coming to terms with losing someone so young, and coping with massive, life changing events, but at the end of the day, it's still blooming scary.Kidman is wonderful as Grace, and really holds the film, keeping the drama upfront, and the haunted house element as more of a subplot. Her relationship with her children is beautiful, yet also a little sinister.The children's illness adds a wonderful depth to the narrative, thus making the viewer at more unease than they should be.Halfway through the film, there is a bizarre appearance from Ecclestone, as some sort of lost soul, but it doesn't really make sense until you've seen the ending.And the ending is pretty cool, and like The Sixth Sense, it will change the way you see this film in the future, and make you feel smug when you are watching it with someone who hasn't seen it before.Good stuff, and Eric Sykes has never been scarier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an overrated movie that actually is just alright. It is well crafted, but not very original. The main strength of the simple plot is supposed to be the twist at the end. The average enthusiastic audience won't notice a few inconsistencies, amazed as they are by the "subtlety" of the movie and the "cleverness" of the final revelation, but I am annoyed by plots that have not been thought through thoroughly and disappointed there is so little discussion about these shortcomings (though it would be difficult to do so without spoilers).The actors are good (notably the little girl and the two adult servants; Nicole Kidman is sort of woody, OTOH I must admit I never liked her), the photography is fine, the scenery is expensive, there is some suspense here and there, but the pace is slow, and I cannot understand how one can call a masterpiece a movie that just uses classic devices of horror movies. I appreciate too there is no blood nor severed limbs and everything is left to imagination, but the fact that, while there are so many bad splatter movies around, this one goes back to the classics is not enough to make it outstanding as say a Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine: Someone makes a scary thriller...and it actually has a BRAIN! Well, maybe I'm exaggerating, because some other thrillers do. Take "The Sixth Sense" or "Vanilla Sky" for instance. They had plots, and made you think. But take, say, "House on Haunted Hill" (the remake)? Blood. Sex. Gore. Bad special effects. Scares? A real plot? Any reason for making the movie whatsoever besides cheap thrills and money? I think not. "The Others" isn't gross at all. The character development is good, and the musical score and sound is outstanding. And Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances to date.Kidman is Grace, a prim, religious 1940's mother with two photosensitive children, Anne and Nicholas. Every day, instead of school, the children study the Bible by candlelight. (By the way, the setting for the story is great, too. Almost the entire film is shot inside the beautiful but very dark house.) At the beginning, three mysterious servants come to work at the house--even though the advertisement Grace meant to send out never got mailed. This is because, they say, the servants worked in the house before.Soon, Anne begins mentioning Victor, a boy that assumingly keeps talking to her. While at first it looks like a good plan to scare Nicholas, eventually Grace hears noises in the abandoned room upstairs. The old forbidden piano starts playing after the children and servants are asleep, and even though a door isn't supposed to be opened without the previous one being closed first, Grace keeps seeing the door behind her in the corner of her eye open.This might not sound interesting or scary, but you have to see it. The setup for each sudden, frightening moment is about three-quarters of what really scares you, and that's true for most other movies, too. I probably shouldn't go on with the plot, because this is one of the only movies where just one little spoiler ruins the entire movie."The Others" is also probably the only movie that scares you out of your wits every time, not just the first time, and at the same time doesn't give you nightmares for weeks. Probably because none of the scary images are really enough to stick in your head.The children, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, are excellent young actors, especially James Bentley. He deserves the Young Artist Award he received for this picture, no question about it, and Alakina Mann deserves her nomination.I hate to break it to you fans of gory thrillers, but blood and guts just aren't scary. Sure, they're gross, but they're more hokey than frightening, and it looks as if the filmmakers haven't got anything better to lengthen the movie with, like actual content. Movies like "The Others" really deserve praise for using things important to the plot, or at least explaining them at the end. I recommend this to anyone who's in the mood for a good scare without the gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a time when horror films constitute silly teenagers blindly wandering into danger and unnecessary gore, 'The Others' is like a breath of fresh air. It goes back to the roots of the horror genre, employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.'The Others' is set in the Forties and revolves around staunchly Catholic Grace Stewart, who lives in an old mansion located on the island of Jersey with her highly photo-sensitive children ten-year-old Anne and six-year-old Nicholas. The house is almost permanently entrenched in darkness, in deference to the children's condition, and Grace's husband is lost in war, only enhancing the sense of gloom to the story. One morning, three servants mysteriously turn up at the door of the Stewart mansion, despite Grace having not yet advertised the posts, to replace the previous servants who had suddenly left their posts a week earlier. Anne then begins to maintain the house is haunted, her deduction supported by the fact locked doors left ajar, closed curtains suddenly being found opened and furniture moving when there's no-one in the room. Grace, deeply ingrained in her religious belief that ghosts don't exist, initially refuses to believe her daughter but soon she questions her faith as she can't deny there is something ominous about the house...Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance as the almost cold and aloof Grace, who does love her children dearly even if she doesn't always show it openly. Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy, as the three servants, are suitably mysterious by showing they seem to know more than they let on, leaving viewers questioning their motives from the start. But it is the young child actors, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who steal the show as Anne and Nicholas. Despite their age and inexperience, both children given first-class depictions of their characters, showing their isolation thanks to their medical conditions and their reliance on one another despite typical sibling discord at times. Mann, in particular, excels in portraying the stubborn nature of Anne and her precarious relationship with her mother. It is a shame this child never continued her acting career because she is a credit to young British acting.'The Others' is a subtle horror films for those sick of cheap Hollywood horror flicks and are seeking interesting characters and an intelligent plot. While there are no special effects or buckets of blood in this film, in the tradition of 'The Exorcist' and 'The Devil's Backbone', it instead relies upon more old-fashion methods of frightening the audience, which are far more effective. The story is well-paced, leaving the audience guessing what is happening and what the characters' motives are right to the end.This film has to be one of the best horror films I've ever seen and puts many films in the horror genre to shame. I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the value of suspense and a good fright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The first thing to decide when creating an intelligent film is who the camera is. We start out here with one identity and discover that we actually have another. This is a well known if rarely pulled trick in the mystery genre. Films like this are essentially mysteries, following all of the important rules. That makes them more engaging because the viewer engages in a game with the writer (and her surrogate the actor) to outwit each other.The filmmaker here is very intelligent in leveraging this by exploiting Kidman's rather hypnotizing, slowly incubating terror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Contrarian View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly, Others saw something in The Others which I missed.This was billed as a horror/suspense movie, but it lacked horror or suspense. It just wasn't scary. Or interesting. Within 15 minutes of the start of the movie, I was wondering how soon it would end. I had no reason to care about what would happen to the characters, and nothing interesting did happen.I should declare my bias. Other than Dead calm, and Eye Wide Shut, I have never found much to like about Nicole Kidman's acting. She leaves me cold. In this movie, she seems to sleepwalk through the part, with an expressionless frostiness that left me uninvolved. I found myself viewing the movie as a critical exercise rather than being drawn into its alternate reality. Like all "haunted house' stories, this movie depends on suspension of disbelief. Neither the script nor the acting delivered that for me.</fullReview>

But the twisted ending in the plot is a complete rip off of the sixth sense and could be expected after youve seen the movie for half an hour. Nicolle acted very poorly and didn't put down a realistic character. There's only one location in the movie which is in the mist all the time. There was exactly one scary moment in the movement.

		<shortDescription>Not your typical ghost movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not your typical ghost movie, where Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, who retires with her two children to a mansion towards the end of the Second World War. Her children are photo and sunlight sensitive and she hires three servants to care for them and the house; however, strange things start to happen shortly afterward and Grace believes her house is haunted.Filmed in the Channel Islands, Spain, England and New York, this movie captures the brilliance and beauty of each place and the subtle aftermath of post-WWII. Alejandro Amenábar wrote and directed the movie, providing us with an eerie story full of mystery that will have you guessing where the plot turns and have you surprised at its unpredictability. Just the Mrs. Bertha Mills character, played by Fionnula Flanagan (who always look strange and mysterious to begin with), provides enough uncertainty and chills to the story, enhancing the overall suspense. However, there are some parts where the plot lines do not quite intertwine, which may confuse the audience, and is notorious in American ghost/horror movies.Kidman did a fabulous job in her role, nonetheless, providing enough drama to captivate the audience. It's a film full of surprises, which deviates it from many other ghost/horror movies with predictable plots.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy movie builds taut by showing virtually eerie images , unsettling score and evocative cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thrilling and surprising story full of chills , plot twists , intrigue and excitement . The movie opens with Nicole Kidman, in voice-over, reading a story. She begins with the words, "Now children, are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin." As a woman named Grace Stewart who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive (it is very strange with roughly a thousand people in the world that have it) children (the disease they have is an actual disease known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum). Grace , whose husband (Christopher Eccleston) has never returned from the war , becomes convinced that her family home (the house - supposedly on the island of Jersey - is actually located in the north of Spanish , in Las Fraguas , Cantabria , Palace of Hornillos) haunted while overprotecting her two young children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley were cast after an intensive search that encompassed 5,000 children). They will live alone there with oppressive, rare and almost religious rules , until she needs to hire a group of servants (Eric Sykes as Mr. Edmund Tuttle , Elaine Cassidy as Lydia and Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Bertha Mills) for them .The motion picture displays genuine chills , suspense, mystery and dark atmosphere with a twisted finale . Packs excellent creation of tension , thriller , emotions and terror . It's an exciting , bizarre film ; skillfully written and proceeded by Alejandro Amenabar and turns out to one of the most unusual Spaniard suspense movie ever made and certainly one of the most unsettling .The basis for this movie is an episode of the British series 'Armchair Theatre' called 'The Others' made in 1970 and remade as a movie called 'Voices' in 1972 , this version is more elaborate but the story is the same. ¨Los Otros¨ comes from a peculiar cross-section of production cultures ; it stars an Australian woman playing an Englishwoman ; it was written and directed by a Spaniard, backed by Americans, set in Jersey but filmed in Spain. Plenty of twists and turns , the strange images deliver the excitement united a thrilling musical score by the same Alejandro Amenabar . He along with screenwriter Mateo Gil appear in one of the photographs of dead people . Furthermore , Alejandro also wrote the interesting plot , embarking into the phantasmagorical, psychological or even quasi-surrealist story . Intelligent edition, special use of luxurious sets by Benjamin Fernandez and slick utilization of shock images make this one, a magnificent film . Colorful and glowing cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe which heightens the suspense . This was the first film ever to receive the Best Film Award at the Goyas (Spain's national film awards) with not a single word of Spanish spoken in it and his film went on after its release , to become Spain's biggest grossing domestic film of all time. The film opened in the US at number 4 in the box office charts and stayed around that figure for its initial run. Seven weeks into release it actually climbed up to the number 2 spot. The picture was very well directed by Amenabar in his third movie, after he achieved various hits . Since his perhaps best-known early short-film "Himenóptero" in 1992, in which he directed , produced, acted and wrote the script and the music, Amenábar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with "Thesis", Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . And ¨Abre Los Ojos¨ that was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise who in ¨The others¨ was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros¨ (2001) was released a few months prior to Vanilla Sky (2001), the American remake of 'Alejandro Amenabár''s Abre Los Ojos (1997). Ironically, it starred Nicole Kidman's then estranged husband Tom Cruise . "Los Otros" confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films Alejandro also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films , most notably "Butterflies tongue" (1999). He subsequently directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz . Rating : Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, subtle scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is a ghost story but in this haunted house the scares are quite subtle. This is a movie which, to its great benefit, is more about the story than shocking, scary moments. To be sure there are some good frights sprinkled throughout. But nothing over-the-top. This movie is more interested in making you think than in frightening you. What exactly is going on in this house? It's a mystery the audience will be trying to solve right along with the characters. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, mother of two young children. The three of them live alone in an isolated house on the island of Jersey in the days immediately following the end of World War II. Grace's husband is presumed dead in the war. The family's servants just up and left in the middle of the night. Three new servants arrive at the house. And here things begin to get very interesting.From the moment we meet them there is something slightly off about these new servants. An aging nanny, an elderly gardener and a mute young woman...they're quite the odd trio. But they know the house, having worked there before and Grace welcomes them in. But first Grace must explain the rules for the house, rules designed to keep all sunlight out as the children are so sensitive to the light it would kill them. This makes for a dark atmosphere which adds so much to the film, especially once things start to go bump in the night. Grace's daughter Anne sees the ghosts but Grace herself refuses to believe it. The servants, especially the nanny Mrs. Mills, seem to know more than they are letting on. It's pretty clear these servants hold the movie's secrets. What are those secrets? The fun for us is in finding out. Grace needs to find the answers too but it seems unlikely she'll find much fun in it.Kidman is excellent in playing the loving, protective mother who is thoroughly harried by the unseen intruders in her home. Fionnula Flanagan is also terrific playing the mysterious Mrs. Mills who is somehow creepy even when she's not trying to be. Or maybe she is trying. Also notable are the performances of the young actors playing the children. James Bentley is quite good in playing the boy, Nicholas, but it is Alakina Mann, playing Anne, who is the true revelation. Mann turns in one of the best child acting performances you'll ever see, mature far beyond her years in playing a girl who sees ghosts and is not even freaked out by them, taking it all in her stride. Kudos to director Alejandro Amenábar for coaxing such fine performances from his cast and for creating such a creepy atmosphere. The movie's story is a smart one, building slowly but surely toward its big climax. There are enough hints sprinkled throughout that may let you figure things out before the characters do. So maybe when the ending comes it doesn't pack quite as much of a wallop as it would if you were totally stunned by it. But it is still all in all a very satisfying movie-watching experience. A good story with enough subtle little scares thrown in to keep happy those who are looking for chills and thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good ghost story with the style of an old movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time where most horror movies consist only on cheap scares and are not patient enough to build an appropriate atmosphere, "The Others" is a breath of fresh air and a welcome return to old-school horror.The film takes place in a post-war era in an isolated house in the countryside. The Gothic aspect of the house helps to create a ghost novella feeling, with small rooms and doors closed that give a sense of claustrophobia. Added to that there is no electricity at the house, so all homework must be made old-school. In the house lives Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, who have an uncommon disease so they can't be exposed to the sunlight. One day three servants arrive at the house, disposed to help in the housework while Grace takes care of the children. Her husband never returned from the war and the old servants left the house weeks ago. Even so the arrival of these new persons make Grace suspicious, because in the moment they enter the house strange happenings begin to occur.One of the surprises of "The Others" is at its style, similar to an old horror movie: the scenario, ambient, characters, even the storytelling. The film also seems to take elements from the classic novel "The Turn of the Screw", a book that inspired "The Innocents", an old horror movie reminiscent of this. I find it admirable the fact that Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar tries to take the audience into the old times, allowing the events to build slowly, even if this could be a problem for viewers accustomed to fast-paced modern horror movies. "The Others" is a solid haunted house story with a good script and interesting twists, but the highest point here is Nicole Kidman. She plays her character naturally, showing herself as a normal person facing difficulties, and not as the typical hysterical woman found in recent horror flicks.Concluding "The Others" may be a good choice if you like old horror movies, suspense or want to see a good story. The film contains a revealing twist over the ending. I can assure you will be surprised, but I can't assure you will like it.My Score: 7.4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Turning of the Kidman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems pretty apt that Kidman would replace Kerr in this subtly lifted inspiration from Henry James to the mind and talents of Alejandro Amenabar. Never mind that Cruise and Kidman were going through a divorce at the time, Tom still helped with the funding, probably feeling like he owed Amenabar one for letting him recreate Abra Los Ojas into the lackluster Vanilla Sky. The stirrings are creepy without being over-the-top, and the twist ending is plausible which makes re-watch palatable... though there's not quite enough character in the characters to see anything more than plot polishings when it's all said and done, Kidman does a fine job of providing an aura to the mother that's all but mostly absent from the script. We're never sure what makes her as she is and the history behind the family is as foggy as the island they can't seem to get away from. Oh man, another ten minutes of scenes just to flesh these characters out and we'd have a something of a Gothic masterpiece on our hands. So close!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an old film but I was just reading a few of the reviews. Personally I think Sixth Sense was a very good film with excellent performances but the so called twist was a little obvious. Surely it was obvious that Bruce Willis was already dead, he got shot at the beginning? He then had no interaction with anyone in the entire film apart from the boy, who could see ghosts, not to mentioned that he said halfway through the film that he sees dead people, but they don't know they're dead...Personally I enjoyed The Others more but Sixth Sense is really good film. Ghost stories are often associated with haunted &amp; old houses The Others had atmosphere &amp; great performances, particularly from Nicole Kidman. &amp; the ending... I think Its rare that an entire film is taken from ghosts perspective so that was interesting &amp; a different take on a familiar story. Some people may have seen the twist coming but it wasn't obvious that an entire family lived in the house &amp; clairvoyant was trying to make contact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film, have watched it so many times and never tire of it. A couple of things do annoy me slightly like some of the plot is just spelt out too obviously but apart from that I really cannot find fault.The acting is very good, even the children - especially Anne are exceptional. The constant low lighting and over panning really help the over all eerie feel and sense of the severity and urgency regarding the children's "condition. It also gives a very claustrophobic feel to the point where you can see how much the lifestyle would drain anyone to the point of distraction. And I genuinely felt for the characters in this one, many emotions portrayed very well. "The twist is fantastic and you really do not see it coming till the end unlike many films that have tried to re create this since. SO, to sum up-I would recommend this highly to anyone and I don't recommend horrors lightly as I'm very picky and don't frighten easily!</fullReview>

First thing the acting in it is good from everyone except the little girl. The plot is quite good with an interesting original twist however the movie is quite slow and dull for me.I thought it was going to be somewhat scary and it was not at all.This movie is about a young family in England circa 1940s. The father has gone off to war and the mother is forced to stay at home and take care of her children who have a rare disease which makes them ultra alergic to the sunlight. Strange things start to happen though as the kids start to see ghosts.This movie was OK it was just a little boring for me. Slow and dull just like most English things. Still more exciting then Paranormal Activity of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not usually a horror film fan; they tend to be schlocky, clichéd and full of characters that absolutely deserve whatever they get. But I am a fan of the more psychological horror films; The Others ticks all the right boxes for me. It has no special effects or gore for that matter, so it relies on moody lighting, a tense score, great acting and storytelling - at some points in the film, a combination of these things actually make broad daylight seem creepy. My only snagging point is the disease that the children have - they're photosensitive - so any exposure to sunlight will kill them. This is the basic set-up that the whole movie is based on, at first it may seem like a poor excuse to keep the house in perpetual darkness, but gradually it becomes a revelatory plot point. Now, if you're sharp, this light-sensitive ploy will be a dead giveaway right from the start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They're here" ... and so are they ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a nutshell, Alejandro Amenabar's "The Others" is a gripping and emotionally powerful horror film, respecting our intelligence enough not to overuse graphic elements and to make the perfect dosage between thrills and mystery. And the mystery surrounding the characters is so absorbing that it immediately plunges us into such an unnerving and harrowing atmosphere that at the end of the film, whether we found relief or our hearts were still pounding, we know we'd just have lived an extraordinary experience."The Others" is set in a large mansion inhabited by a young mother, Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart and her two children, Anne and Nicholas. The film opens when she receives three applicants for house jobs, an elderly tacit grounds-keeper named Mr Turkle, a deaf and dumb adolescent, and the lady who seems to lead the group, Bertha Mills, played, in a remarkable performance, by Fionula Fllanigan. Mrs Mills is the kind of character that immediately strikes the viewer as very competent in her job while the eventuality of her vileness is better conveyed by the peculiarity of her workmates. what's more, Mrs Mills' personality, very calm and professional, efficiently contrasts with Grace's more natural behavior as a loving and caring mother, trying to hide her excitability behind a mask of aristocratic-like composure.It's hard to figure the period of the film until Grace mentions that her husband is fighting in Europe: it's WWII, the film is set in a mysterious foggy island in Britain, and we ought to believe her. Now, why would the mother of two kids endure such a spooky location? the answer is immediately given, setting at the same time, the tone of the film. Her two kids suffer an extremely rare syndrome, they are photosensitive, which means they can't be exposed to sunlight without being victims of irremediable symptoms. Therefore the mansion's activity is driven by a special but indispensable routine implying to close all the doors with a key, whenever someone gets in or out. This information is vital, and plays as an interesting display of smart writing in the way it distracts us from many precocious interrogations, such as why are all the three servants dressed in a very old-fashion way.I mentioned in the early paragraph the atmosphere of the film and, no pun intended, it's indeed the key element that drives the film. The atmosphere is so intense that we don't need to be scared, because we constantly keep our guard up, it's the kind of situations so calm we know something will happen. Yet everything remains desperately quiet, and as the movie progresses, all we have are little doses of thrills, through apparitions, voices, screams, encounters with mysterious presences, and the macabre discovery of photographs showing dead people, but no death, no gore, no fights. The secret of "The Others" is to works as an efficient set-up whose sensational impact would ineivtably rely on the climax, so all we have to do is to be patient, and collect all the hints in order to know what to expect and this is what communicates the thrilling effect of the filmThe atmosphere is carried by a shadowy external photography and a powerful cinematography whose use of lights transforms the vastness of a mansion into a sum of little closed places, conveying the disturbing feeling of a suffocating paranoia. The house is so big yet feels so small while the mysterious and haunting presence of 'strangers' make the whole setting totally unsettling. And the force of the film is within the story as it features characters who are apparently forced to live in this mansion for vital reasons, and the satisfying resolution would either be a way to chase the others, or to be chased, but we all know the confrontation is inevitable. "The Others"' suspense works on a Hitchcockian level, even more effective because we really don't know what to expect, and take it from someone who saw it each time with different persons, no one ever guesses the ending, and neither did I.But it would be unfair and untrue to imply that "The Others" only works thanks to the ending, the narrative evolves around an emotional core within the story of a mother who tries to protect her two children. And the conflict in "The Others" is not just between two different kinds of presences in a same house, but the psychological consequence through the torment invading the heart of a woman, torn between her maternal instinct and a terrible secret belonging to the past and profoundly affecting the present. Nicole Kidman magnificently embodies the vulnerability of a woman left alone and totally alienated by too much responsibility. And Mrs Mills represents the perfect counterpart to Grace's hellish condition and while she gets closer to Anne, and Grace's behavior becomes more suspicious, the notion of vileness goes back and forth and we wait until the moment it will finally determine who the real antagonist is ? if there ever is one.All in all, it's hard to know who is the straight person of this series of incidents when emotions are so powerfully engaged. "The Others" is a remarkable chronicle of a dramatic family story involving a woman and two kids, one strong-minded and free-spirited little girl and her poignantly coward little brother. The two kids, beautifully portrayed, mirror the same contrasts between Mrs Mills and Grace Stewart and what's more, their condition plays like the metaphor of Grace's symbolic sensitivity to an even blinding and painful light. Needless to say that the ending doesn't disappoint and elevates the films to one of the greatest horror mystery thrillers of the last 20 years, working in every single level.So beware of the light, whether it's of a blinding sunshine or a terrible secret?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talking about "the others" we're talking beyond any doubt about the best thriller movie ever! And not only! We're talking about a movie which twists to such an unbelievable extend the idea of what this kind of stories in art and literature represent, that makes you wonder if it could ever be possible in the future to have another example in this field that would add anything to what seems to have reached its absolute perfection. In "the others" we don't just have a story with threatening ghosts. We have an amazingly inspired twist, which through a breathless series of doubts and huge wonders, questions, and events which do not at all deviate from the scheduled flow of a very solid script, lead you finally to such a bitter, dark and ? consequently yet surprisingly- extremely unexpected ending, that leaves you ? and every other spectator- speechless on your sit. Yes, unexpected, because, though in a very artistic way indeed, the movie makes believe that it doesn't want to hide the truth, it gradually leads to it's perfect doubt, till it finally comes to its shocking, twisting revelation. There's no question that we're talking about one of the very best movies of all times! It's certainly the best for the ones who have a strong preference for thrillers. The double "version" of the scenes near the "revelation" and the ending, are really shocking and are exactly the ones which literally make any ghost story you have seen (or read) in the past, look and sound banal and trivial?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There aren't many negatives to "The Others" especially in terms of plot development, imagery, and acting/casting. The only thing I can say is that if you are a huge blood/gore horror movie fan, bypass this one. If you like eerie atmospheres and spooky ambiance, you'll be pleased with "The Others". Nicole Kidman plays overbearing and religious mother, Grace Stewart to perfection. She's obviously overprotective, due to her two children's medical condition: xeroderma pigmentosum, or a sensitivity to sunlight. The two children, Anne and Nicholas are delightfully frightening in their own right. Grace's husband has left to fight in WWII, leaving the family alone in a large, and apparently haunted, house. Grace is alone with three, also frightening, housekeepers. She is overbearing, and her rules are extensive which leads to tension between Grace and all of the other characters in the film.As Grace becomes more and more aware that there is a presence (or several) in the house, thanks largely in part to her daughter, her behavior becomes more and more erratic. "The Others" is full of delightful plot twists, and the children themselves are so hauntingly accurate in their portrayals of light and socially deprived children that the blood and gore so common in today's horror cinema is not missed. The film picked up in the last half, which is when I caught on to several of the subtle hints that lead you to a not-so-obvious conclusion. Even though I swore I had the entire plot figured out, I was still delightfully shocked by some aspects of the ending. Viewers will be satisfied, I'm sure, and horror fanatics will be delighted by a film that strays from the norm of the genre. Easily an 8/10, which is only because of the rather slow-moving beginning. Happy haunting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is what you would call an old fashioned ghost story. This is a film which leaves more to the imagination and does not rely on any blood , violence or death ( well not really) but more on a clever script and an ingenious twist.Nocole Kidman plays a mother of two children who lives in an old country house and while she awaits her husband from the second world war she recruits three members of staff . All is not what it seems.I really likes this film. Kidman is good as is Fionnula Flanagan who plays the nanny.This is a slow burner that builds up the tension superbly until the viewer starts to put the pieces of the jigsaw together and in the end it becomes really quite scary.If you have not seen The Others before it is well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisitely tempered pace, wonderful casting, and a crowd-pleasing ending make this one of mainstream Hollywood's best film in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept is lovely: Supposedly deceased husband from the war leaves behind wife (played by Nicole Kidman) and two children. The kids are photosensitive to light so the curtains throughout the mansion must remain closed at all times. Wife hires a new staff of three and then strange things begin to happen.The story is so well-thought out to most every detail, which makes the ending so sound and shocking. `The Sixth Sense' precedes it by two years and regenerated an entire film genre in the Hollywood spectrum. Typically, that film would stand as the measure of the subsequent submissions, which would slowly degenerate into paler imitations until the phenomenon faded out. However, I believe that not only has `The Others' one-upped the sense and raised the stakes, but will hold up much better over time. Not only is the first viewing exciting, but the second viewing shows just how well done this film is. The mansion that is the centerpiece for the film is masterfully shot from the attic to the kitchen, with Kidman opening, closing, and locking doors everywhere she goes all the time, as well as constantly drawing the drapes.There isn't really a weak link in this small troop of a cast. Kidman delivers an especially anal, unreserved performance as an over-protective British mother who teeters on being borderline psychotic. The kids are like Christina and Christopher Crawford: the overly headstrong sister and cute, lovable and innocent younger brother. The maid's kindness, with her sidekicks the mute and the groundskeeper, turns deliciously ominous as we get closer to the secret they carry with them."Open Your Eyes" and "The Others" have been two of the best films I've seen in the last five years. I am looking forward to Alejandro Amenabar's future endeavors.9: Highly recommendable, creepy, psychological ghost story. Inspires repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best psychological horror that lives up to "The Sixth Sense" is the "The Others". "The Others" is a true suspense film in every sense of the phrase. Here are the reasons (spoilers contained within): (1) Nicole Kidman is one of the best screen actresses I have ever seen. Her mentally exasperating and nail-biting performance is the best of her career. (2) Alejandro Amenabar is one of the most creative filmmakers out there right now. He presides over this movie with a hand of a creative master. (3) Amenabar's writing skills are excellent as well. Every scene that he wrote give a sense of the mental dread that the family feels as they progress toward the climax and conclusion. (4) The musical score also enhances the dread. Amenabar is also a musical jack. (5) I love the metaphor of light in a mansion as a water on a sinking ship. (6) The cinematography and lighting leaves no wanting. (7) The events of the story are spooky enough. (8) The last twenty minutes of the film are worth the ticket price alone. (9) The rest of the cast put in excellent performances as well. (10) Truly classic horror methods were used to convey mental dread. Ten reasons give a score of ten. Overall, this is a truly spooky film and it should have received an Oscar for either acting, directing, screen writing or even musical score.PS: Also see "Abre los Ojos" and "Vanilla Sky" to see Alejandro Amenabar's creative genius at work. He along with Tom Tykwer are part of a new wave of filmmakers from Europe that have invaded the United States and brought some clarity and sanity to the supposed normalcy in American cinema. Let the good work keep coming! Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about AnOther?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gothic horror? No. mystery? Nope. Slasher? Not even. Just a dark, dreary film set in the Channel Islands in 1945. Who better to give us a depressing thriller than America's sweethearts Nicole Kidman and (exec. Producer) Tom Cruise. This just may be the key to their split-up. Though this is not a frightening nail-biter it may engage you if you're the pulp fiction/gothic romance fan. It's remarkably slow through the first hour, but the set and the classic characters do provide entertainment. The key to the film's fascination is its ability to keep you wondering who these Others are. It provides a few moments of shock in the process but when you reach your destination you may find yourself looking for AnOther.Grace (Nicole Kidman) mother of two young children and mistress of the house opens the film with a frightening scream setting up audience expectation for something really eerie that really never materializes. Seems that the master of the house has gone off to war but forgot to return when it ended. Three stock characters from thousands of British films turn up to carry the tasks to keep the house together and we're given a tour of the house. See the kids, like the audience must live in darkness or they'll shrivel up like prunes in minutes. The house has no electricity or telephones and is lit by oil lamps at best. Heavy drapes cover the windows and heavy Catholic mysticism covers this family. Getting the idea that this isn't light entertainment? Lesser stars perform their roles admirably, the strongest of whom is Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). I saw her last in `Waking Ned Devine' and her continued strong presence helps bring the film around its plot twist. Daughter and son are cute and annoying, dad returns in a fog and remains perplexed throughout his short appearance and the remaining two characters tread lightly on screen. If you don't like Ms. Kidman, don't come since her visage remains on screen through most of this film.All of the appropriate moaning, creaking, crying, shadows, frightening looks and terrorized kids can be found here. Nicole plays the part of a moralistic home schooler and this part may have been written with her in mind considering her religious convictions. You may think her paranoid but as events unfold, her fears are well placed. She's actually battling the Dyanetic demons and we expect Mr. Cruise (or maybe even Mr. Travolta) to step in as the embodiment of evil. But they don't. Though it's pretty predictable, it's worth your while as an atmospheric piece and if you're like me, you'll wonder about the derivation of the word `smother.' Though I doubt you'll be peeking behind your drapes to see if something is lurking, it's engaging entertainment for most of the family.CyCy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is a psychological horror film that stars Nicole Kidman together with Fionnula Flanagan,Christopher Eccleston,Elaine Cassidy,Eric Sykes,Alakina Mann and James Bentley. It is inspired partly by the novella The Turn of the Screw.The music as well as the screenplay and direction was by Alejandro Amenábar.It tells the story of Grace, a devoutly religious mother of two ailing children who has moved with her family to a mansion on the English coast while awaiting her husband's return from World War II, though he has been declared missing. Their children, Anne and Nicholas, both suffer from a rare photosensitive disease that renders them extremely vulnerable to sunlight, prompting Grace's rule of having only one door open in the house at a time. When Anne begins claiming to see ghosts, Grace at first believes her newly arrived family of eccentric servants to be responsible, but chilling events and visions soon lead her to believe that something supernatural is indeed going on.The Others is another type of horror film with an unbelievable twist.It was engaging and absorbing from beginning to end.Also,it is definitely far from being clichéd and formulaic as the viewer may find oneself completely astounded and fascinated at the last scenes of the film.Aside from its unbelievable twist,one cannot help about the music,screenplay and direction by Amenábar as well as the brilliant performances of the cast especially by Kidman.Overall,it is one-of-a-kind horror film that clearly exhibits Amenábar's genius in film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively bone-chilling, but there's more to it than that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: **** out of 4.Sadly, there are fewer and fewer movies horror stories like THE OTHERS being made nowadays. Ask even some horror movie fans and they might pick SAW or Friday THE 13TH over THE INNOCENTS or DON'T LOOK NOW any day, and to an even lesser extent, some of the horror fans of my generation prefer the PG-13 junk to any of those classic 70's horror thrillers. Well, it's a good think that once in a while, great horror movies like THE OTHERS come out and bring us back to horror movie heaven where we truly belong.THE OTHERS is one of the better horror movies to have come out in years. I can't believe I have only seen it recently! Consider this one of the movies in my "Should have seen it earlier" list. Director Alejandro Amenabar takes us on a psychological horror mind trip rather than the latest disposable PG-13-level release. It's scary but not in ways you expect. There are an occasional number of "boo" moments, but Amenabar handles them better than most; taking full advantage of our expectations and than catching us when we least expect. The whole theme of the story too is far more mature than most films of the genre. Perhaps it ain't as thought-provoking as, say, THE INNOCENTS (a film THE OTHERS takes a few notes from), but it's brilliant in its own clever, mind-blowing way.Having only recently landing a role in MOULIN ROUGE as a playful, sumptuous Can-Can dancer, Nicole Kidman takes an opposite turn playing a dark, fragile character as Grace, a woman who lives alone with her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), in an old dark mansion while her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) is away at war. Grace hires a trio of helpers - housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a mute named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and gardener Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) - to attend to the house. Then strange occurrences start happening, prompting Grace to believe that the house is haunted by "intruders". Anne starts seeing a boy she calls "Victor", as well as an old woman she believes is a witch. Plus something may or may not be all right with the new help.THE OTHERS returns to the classic horrific atmosphere of those old-school horror movies - the candelabra-lit walks through dark hallways, doors being slammed shut by other things than the wind, and specters that look even creepier without the use of gruesome make-up effects. Even without the use of a lot of "jump-out-and-scare-you" moments (though there are a couple here), Amenabar keeps us interested because, unlike recent throwaway fare, he has an excellent story and an interesting array of tragic, unstable characters, and an atmosphere than effectively (literally) keep us in the dark throughout the movie.Amenabar has not made an outright horror outing since (he did make TESIS prior to THE OTHERS, but nothing else after), which is sad. The genre needs more like him these days, one that can perfect the balance of good writing, performances, atmosphere, and scares and delivering a ideal entry in the much under-utilized genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like The Sixth Sense and The Orphanage reside.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar's first foray into English-language filmmaking is a largely successful one. One of the most striking filmmakers to emerge in the late 90s, Amenabar is a skillful craftsman whose talent extends beyond directing into screen writing and also into film score composition. Born in Chile but raised in Spain, the director of acclaimed dramas such as Open Your Eyes (1997) and the Oscar-winning The Sea Inside (2004) gives us a fine addition to the horror genre with The Others, a mainstream production made with authority.The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) and Bayona's The Orphanage (2007) reside. In an uninformed reality, Amenabar's film comes across as a fusion between the two above-mentioned pictures. That being said, it would make more sense to chronologically observe the influences each has had on one another over the years. Similar to Shyamalan's film, The Others has a climatic twist at the end (don't worry, there are no spoilers ahead) which equals in ambitiousness but strangely unmatched in terms of shock value.The Others stars an excellent Nicole Kidman in the lead role as the mother of two children whom are photosensitive (read: allergic to sunlight) and must be kept perpetually in the dark (an intriguing plot device). The huge house they live in does have a sinister past of a ghostly nature. What seems like a straightforward ghost story turns into an exercise in atmospheric mood setting. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe creates lingering, almost elegant-like shots of the exterior of the house which is nearly always hidden in thick fog. For interior scenes it is mostly lit by candlelight (a requirement of the plot device), giving an eerie glow that is both warm yet chilling.Speaking of chills, The Others has one prolonged spine-tingling sequence in the final third: the two children 'escape' from the confines of their room in the middle of the night only to find themselves in a small graveyard with suspicious servants pursuing them. The mood setting here achieves its pinnacle. Amenabar does stick to the rigid expectations of the genre, but he explores them with a fresh approach mainly through its unconventional plot.The role of darkness versus light is reversed in this film. Here, the children seek solace in the dark but are traumatized by daylight. Their mother, on the other hand, feels uncomfortable in darkness but is at ease when it is bright. This allows Amenabar to tap on the fears of the characters and to create tension in two extreme settings. The Others is clever filmmaking, boasts artistry and is clear in its execution. At its heart, it is a film about challenging one's beliefs and the need to stand true and firm when these beliefs are challenged.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomeno.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This original period horror is set during World War II where a mother of two make home to an enormous house. Not long into their stay, the mother believes the house is haunted by a family, however a much needed truth is pretty much twisted in a bundle of suspense and mystery...This film is great for anyone who loves to sit on the edge of their seat although you don't want to sit next to anyone who talks a lot either. The Others is one of those films where you need to concentrate otherwise you'll miss vital bits, it also ruins the hole mood if somebody's talking. Just make sure you have a pillow in front of you abd something to dig your nails in...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky and Dark, yet enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a PG-13 suspense film, The Others is definitely a good film. Nicole Kidman's Religiously devoted character and her photosensitive children make the film very frightening. The film focuses on a woman and her two kids who live in a spooky house that they believe to be haunted(the film sets right around the end of WWII). I had lots of doubts about this film. But ironically, what I found put me in a complete awe. The film starts out kind of lazy. The first half of the film did not capture my interest, as opposed to the second half, where the beast of suspense and thrill was unleashed. I definitely enjoyed this film and it's once again proved that foreign directors have a knack for making awesome flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous movie; very engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performance of Nicole Kidman in this is outstanding. She plays the part extremely well and had me utterly convinced that she truly was the conservative, sensible-shoe-wearing, overbearing mother in the piece, though quite captivatingly beautiful she is too. It does make quite a refreshing change from the regular formulaic Hollywood type 'horror' films that seem to be proliferating theatres and DVD shelves these days. You won't find yourself shouting "don't open that door" like one does in desperation at so many awful b movie characters - you'll be looking at Ms. Kidman's face and you'll be right there with her.This film is set some fifty years ago. Now, normally with some type of period pieces, things start well before some character uses some modern slang/colloquialism and it pulls you right out of the movie. I can assure you that in The Others, the dialogue is simply sublime. Every detail has been attended to to ensure it is faithful to the era; from the behaviour of the children to the address of the servants.The children actors here are simply outstanding. With the help of the excellent dialogue they deliver an awe-inspiring performance that absolutely makes the film.Storywise, it is excellent and original in my opinion - and horror movies are my favourite, so I believe I've seen a few in my time.So if you're tired of clichés, of the group-of-teens.. .camp-in-a-graveyard.. .as-an-initiation-ritual-then-get-killed type movies then perhaps you'd appreciate this eerie, evocative, and downright chilling horror movie as much as I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming to terms with one's death: Amenabar's the Others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third of Amenabar's features is both the most academic and the most intriguing of this trilogy of the macabre. Before next step, the critically-acclaimed Mar Adentro, the three films were a comment about death, in one form or the other. The Others tells of a family, settled in post-war Jersey, consisting of Grace(Nicole Kidman) and her two children. They were abandoned by all: the domestics have gone, the husband went to the war and never came back, and the whole island seems to be deserted, apart from three servants who one day present themselves at the door, and a strange, ghostly presence in the house... Thus taking the shape of a very classic ghost story, with plenty of creepy scenes, based on an interestingly spooky setting, the film is a success thanks to the incredible sense of timing of all concerned, Director-writer-composer Amenabar first of all, since he manages to direct his 7-or-so actors as if they were puppets while allowing them to use their talent in the construction of lovable, believable characters. This last effort is probably the most rewarding of all, since one of the most annoying drawbacks of Amenabar's Open Your Eyes, his previous effort, was the incapacity of both the director and the actor(Eduardo Noriega) to make the character sympathetic, or just nice(the same could be said, however, of Tom Cruise's over-the-top characterization in the remake by Cameron Crowe)... But despite Nicole Kidman's efforts to render Grace neurotic, obsessive, authoritarian and narrow-minded, we still care for her. She has, after all, good reasons to her behavior: her children live, and share with her, an incredible everyday hell, suffering from an incurable disease making them allergic to daylight: this is the source of multiple compulsory tasks: opening doors, closing curtains, lighting candles, that are repeated throughout the film by the main character so as to avoid contact of her children and too much light... No wonder she got to be on the edge. Besides, we learn at one point how mad she got prior to the beginning of the plot, and her killing her children and shooting herself becomes almost understandable. Another important innovation over the previous effort is the confrontation of Kidman with Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs Mills, who steals the show more than once with her mineral presence and her masterful acting that makes her both lovable and mysterious. Add to this the very solid composition by Alakina Mann as Ann, Grace's daughter, and we have a very engaging cast, that contributes significantly to the success of the film. The entire plot revolves around the final discovery that the three characters are ghosts, and the presence they felt in the house(The Others)is that of the living, not of the dead. This idea allows Amenabar to toy with an Innocents-like mood all the way through, going as far as to quote one of the most frightening moments of Clayton's film around the end, when three ghosts approach a window. This shot, by the way, is also reminiscent of a famous sequence in Tod Browning's Mark of the Vampire(1936), thus we can safely think that the young Spanish master knows his history of Creepy Classics... But the most satisfactory aspect of this film, in spite of its very entertaining use of mystery and the author's mastery of direction, writing AND music, making Amenabar the full author of the film, is certainly first the way he deals with his favorite theme, having Grace slowly, but surely dealing with her own death and that of her children and accepting the fact as relief, thus going one step further than Cesar in Open your Eyes; and secondly, of course, the parallel that the viewer can establish between Grace's obsessive Catholicism and Amenabar's identity as a Spanish author, who grew up in an obsessively catholic environment. This can't be a coincidence, and Amenabar's wit(Grace, about the book of the dead: "How could these people be so superstitious?")shows he has probably come to terms with what might be part of an identity crisis. Again, the torment of Cesar, in Open..., had him begin to realize he was in such a crisis; so The Others really cleared the way for Almenabar's next step, Mar Adentro, the film that looks death in the eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Others' is a film I never get bored of. It is beautifully made. I don't want to give too much of the film away so i'll keep it brief. Basically, Grace (Kidman) is living on her own with her two children , Anne and Nicholas, after her husband went to war. She advertises for some housekeepers who come in the form of Mrs. Mills and co. You can tell there's something not quite right about the housekeeper's and they in their own right are quite scary. There is paranormal activity in the house, and child Anne believes she can communicate with a young boy named Victor. A story unravels throughout the film coming to an amazing, unpredictable and dramatic ending.The storyline is well thought out. This film is so good and different from you're typical ghost film. The acting of all members of a small cast is brilliant, especially the two children. I was shocked at how good those playing Anne and Nicholas portrayed their characters. The acting skills of such young children is worth to watch for on it's own.If you haven't seen this film yet then make sure it's next on your list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Within4 of us watched this. The other 3 couldn't stand it &amp; ripped it to pieces. I thought it was quite good, but am aware of what was wrong with it.But to call the ending a surprise is way over the top. There are only really 6 characters in it so the choice was either: none of them are dead, some of them are or they all are, so it was no surprise for me, so don't expect the ending to come as that much of a shock.The other criticism which I agreed somewhat with was that it took an awful long time to get to the point &amp; not a lot happened along the way to get there. It was always watchable but at occasional point not exciting and could've done with being 10 minutes less.On the plus side though, the young girl stole the show with a brilliant performance &amp; Eric Sykes chipped in with a good role.Unlike other films like this, I didn't find any major flaws or even minor ones. With the knowledge of the end, the early scenes all still work, as far as I know. The one grey area was the locking the doors. I failed to see the real relevance of it &amp; don't know whether they were being locked really or not. I doubt it, but am not sure.Whilst I found the ending no great surprise I thought it was a good ending &amp; well done. But I would still describe it as 'An Ending' rather than 'The Ending.' There were many other avenues they could have gone down with the plot which would've worked too.But overall, pretty good7/10</fullReview>

Strange question to start a review with and yet and essential one when beginning to talk about this film.All I will say is that the film is about Grace(Nicole Kidman) who lives with her 2 children, Anne(Alkina Mann) and Nicholas(James Bentley), in a remote house on Jeresy Island in the time after WWII. Her children are suffering from a rare disease that make exposure to light dangerous to them. One day Anne and later also Grace seem to hear strange voices and believe that the house is haunted and...You want to know what happened from now on, go and see the film. Telling you what happens now will deprive you from one of the film which will be remembered from 2001/2002. Because this a film to see and remember. It is good because at the end it make you think about a lot of things. Relations between parents and children. Trust and believe between those 2 parts of the family. Acceptance of things in your life. In a more philosophic level it says something about our perspective and the way we see things. How we take everything for granted while we shouldn't.Kidman is excellent(2nd time this year with a strong part) and seem to be improving every time I watch her. The children and the rest of the cast are also good and complete the strong ensemble which help the movie. The direction is good and is helped by the lighting of the set and the score.All in all go and see the film. The twist somewhere in the film will make you and everyone else in the cinema jump. Recommended by all means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS IS A REAL HORROR FILM !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just came out of the movie theater where The Others has been running for two months. Of course it took a little time before I could put my ideas back in order again, so I could write. This is a real horror film ! Finally someone understood that special effects and other r tricks are fine, but if you lack imagination and talent ( I'm talking to you, Jan De Bont) you will go nowhere. The superb Amenabar's script is clean and effective, grabs us by the neck , forces us to watch every second of it and slaps our face with a real surprising finale. In the meantime,if you can, notice the fantastic settings, the incredible cinematography (90% of its scenes are inside the dark mansion, with minimum lightning) and the performances of the cast. Nicole Kidman is in 99% of the scenes, and surely no actress today can match her combining beauty and talent. Impressive Fionnula Flanagan must be nominated best supporting actress this year. When they are together in the screen you cannot look elsewhere. Do not miss it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The Others has got to be one of the best films of the year. Infact I would say that it's the best, behind that other Nicole Kidman starrer, Moulin Rouge.It all starts out well and good. Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her kids are alone in their Jersey mansion. Their servants have disappeared into thin air and Grace's husband is lost at war. Then one day three strangers show up at their door. Mrs. Mills being the leader (Fionulla Flanigan) along with the gardener (Erik Sykes) and a mute girl, Lydia (Elaine Casasidy). Nicole needs the help so she hires them on the spot. She shows them the kids, Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann and James Bentley). The two have a rare disease that makes them break out in blisters and sores whenever light hits them. So atall time everyone must follow the simple rules. No door can be opened until the one you just walked through is locked and make sure all curtains are closed.Soon enough strange things start to happen. Curtains open in the middle of the nights, crying is heard from someone who doesn't seem to be anywhere in the house, whispering is heard aswell as the piano being played inside the locked room when everyone is in bed. Could the house be haunted? Anne seems to think so. She claims to of seen them. There's Victor, a young boy, aswell as a mother and father and an old woman.Grace wont have a bar of it but she does start to suspect something but instead of the paranormal... she suspects the servents. And rightly so, they are damned creepy.Anyway. Along the way Grace's husband returns (played by Chris Eccleson) from war and the kids discover something sinister about the new servants.The movie is expertly made. Great performances by all involved (Nicole Kidman, Fionulla Flanigan and Alakina Mann being the standouts. I would love to see Nicole get an oscar for this but I liked Moulin Rouge more. A Supporting Actress nod could go the way of Fionulla or Alakina (Remember Anna Paquin got one when she was young!)). Alajandro Amenabar has created a world of haunting beauty. The interior scenes all have a great atmosphere and the rare outside scenes are given a wonderful touch or mystery by the surprisingly eerie use of fog). The directing, writing, cinematography, set design et cetera are all top notch.The ending is great. I never saw it coming. The subtle clues Alajandro gives us are good enough as to not give away the ending but to make us think whether what's happening is real/fake/imagined or possibly even a big nightmare (the movie starts with Grace waking up from a nightmare, screaming).Oh and there is some scary stuff going on in this film. We don't get scared anymore by the latest whiz-bang special effects (see Lost Souls, House On Haunted Hill) but Alajandro creates a sense of fear from what he are thinking. Take for example the scene where everyone in the house is asleep and then the downstairs piano in the locked room starts playing. We are unsure what is going on but we are all know something is going to happen and we get scared by that feeling. Special notice must go to the end scare with the kids in the closet... everyone in my cinema (600 people) jumped/screamed/curses/covered their eyes... everyone was caught by surprise.10/10 A+-SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING FROM NOW-The movie's ending, which has been called a rip-off of The Sixth Sense, is actually a lot better than that movie's ending. Where in that movie they gave it away with the obvious "I see dead people" line the ending of The Others is given away in a much more subtle way and is thus a lot harder to guess.I was totally taken by surprise with the ending. And in aftermath only started to piece it all together. "Mother's gone mad... again", Grace's migraine's, the husband coming back from war then leaving again, the curtains etc...excellent.A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though scaries are not my favourite genre, there is no denying we have a new genius here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not usually go in for anything in the phantasmagoric line; even very few horror films have attracted my attention. This is primarily because I like theatre and cinema to be rather realist, I like it to say something about the world we live in, society, personalities, human values, and so on. I do not look for escapism as a source of entertainment, whether in books, on the stage or on the screen. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule - `Gormenghast' by Mervyn Peake, `The Lord of the Rings' by J.R.R.Tolkien (I am not referring to the film), and of course the universal `Cien A?os de Soledad' by Gabriel García Márquez, among books, or Walt Disney's `Fantasia'. Such that the run-of-the-mill factory-produced science-fiction films generally do not attract me either - exceptions being Stanley Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey' and Ridley Scott's `Bladerunner'.Alejandro Amenábar might change my preferences a little; having seen `Abre los Ojos' (qv) only very recently, I was persuaded rather perfunctorily to go and see `Los Otros' the other night, and did not expect much from what seemed a priori to be merely a `ghost story'. Which is precisely what `Los Otros' turned out to be. But directed and written by a young fellow who also composed the music and seems bent on updating Hitchcockian traditions: Alejandro Amenábar is an extraordinary and highly talented young man. The curious mixture of British Actors with Nicole Kidman, recorded in English, but is a Spanish film, makes it evident that Amenábar had his sights aimed at America. However, the film was not shot on Jersey Island in the English Channel, but in a large `caserón' a few kilometres inland from the Cantabrian Coast in Santander, Northern Spain. The photography at all times, but especially through the fog, is spectacular, but Javier Aguirresarobe is already a past master, having already filmed `Secretos del Corazón' (qv), `La Ni?a de tus Ojos' (qv), `El Perro del Hortelano', `Beltenebros' and `La Fuente Amarilla' (qv), among other titles. Nicole Kidman is pretty good; she plays the part of a mother of two children who is somewhat nervous, even hysterical, as she goes through the house opening and closing the doors as she goes. `Her' two children are very good: Alakina Mann and James Bentley play their parts with a good balance between naturalness and interpretation without exceeding too much in the latter.And the music is extraordinarily good as it accompanies the different scenes, never overdoing any set leit-motif, with some fine orchestration - although in this I think Amenábar had a helping hand from others. There were moments in which subconsciously some influence could be felt from John Barry perhaps, and I also noted a brief passage that seemed to have roots in the Portuguese `fado'. As Rolling Stone Magazine says, this is a psychological thriller; a little in the Clive Barker style but without all that gore, or even certain concepts from some of Stephen King's works in which `the thing' itself is not so ominously present. But, certainly, if Hitchcock WAS the master, surely we have here a new one? Make space over there at Hollywood - a new little genius is about to cross the Atlantic. Unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say that this film is not at all reminiscent of Hitchcock, contrary to the opinion of several previous reviewers. While Hitch did do psychodramas, this is really more of a ghost story. Like other reviewers have said, the movie is very stylized and suspenseful, and above all, entertaining. I don't disagree that it is slow, but in this film, that is a virtue. It allows the viewer to get a real feel for the individual characters and the family/household dynamic- all of which are critical to the climax. It is difficult to give a thorough critique without giving too much away, but I must say that I did NOT see "it" coming- and I always appreciate it when a film can turn my perspective upside down. This is mostly a visual movie and I have a feeling it won't come across as brilliantly on a small screen, so if you're reading this and considering seeing the film, I strongly recommend seeing it in the theater. The use of light and space and camera angles is excellent, and I also appreciated the minimal use of background music- sometimes in a thriller/horror film, the score can become distracting or overpower the dialogue- NOT a problem here. I wouldn't be surprised if this film is nominated for several of the more obscure Oscar categories (the ones I normally wouldn't even notice) like Sound Editing and Cinematography. There are a few minor inconsistencies and anacronisms, but as a whole package, this film delivers. I've seen a lot of comparisons to "The Sixth Sense", but please don't let those shape your expectations of this movie. This is a very different, and in many ways, superior movie, because it relies even less on gore and shock and more on suspense and psychological drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything is spoken in whispers. The atmosphere, music in crescendo at all times, mixes a continuous fog; and the lonely panorama of an antique house. One has to be prepared to fight a phsycological war against the movie: not only because one expects a shock at each time the music reaches a climax, but because one is faced ideologically with a tremendously upsetting and desolating point of view of death. Nicole Kidman's delivers true fear to the audience, and the empty spaces on the dreaded house and suspenseful innuendos will paralyze your back hairs. The twist, marvelous twist, will leave everyone gasping. If you say you'd expected it, thats because you weren't INTO the movie but reasoning apart. Be ready. Ones heart will flutter, the interesting premise will keep you seated. Its a damn fine movie, an edgy thriller.</fullReview>

Why don't they make movies like this anymore? Although, it has only been seven years ago since this movie was made.Grace and her children are put to a struggle because of ghosts. Grace is having a difficult time trying not to let the intruders hurt her children, and not let the sun touch them because they have an intense skin allergy that they can only stand dull light.In the end, it turns out that yes, there were intruders. But Grace and the children are actually the ghosts, and they are haunting the house they live in and always will. A very creepy thriller! I recommend this movie for thriller lovers, drama lovers, horror lovers, etc. This movie was just so creepy. If you love movies about the supernatural and paranormal, watch this. You will be surprised!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Others" is an elegant Ghost flick that not necessarily deals with revenge; it shows that ghosts can still feel. With that brief brain storm explanation, I can say that this movie is deep and emotional on it's own way.It's true that the movie has a macabre plot twist in the likes of "The Sixth Sense" which should be recognized for creating a new way of ending Horror movies (which is not necessarily a good thing). But the ending of "The Others" will leave you satisfied and thinking how emotional the movie is. Sure, there are some scary and chilling scenes but that's not the point of the movie. After the movie's climax, the scary scenes are useless. Talking about the ending, it should send you shivers.The atmosphere in the movie is dark, unsettling and stylish. The movie looks Gothic at some points thanks to a great cinematography. The mansion is creepy enough even without ghosts. All the scenes of the movie have important information that should help in order to create a better experience. I remember that back in 2001 people were really terrified in the theater when the movie reaches it's climax. The same should happen if you watch it home alone.The acting is excellent. Nicole Kidman's performance proves that major Hollywood stars can do great in the Horror genre. The rest of the cast is also perfect.Please, watch "The Others" if you haven't seen it because it's an important Horror movie from the new millennium. Probably one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is always good to come home from a hard day at the office (or behind the bar, in my case) to find a semi-decent film on TV that's on at a sensible time. Usually, it's something insipid with Steven Seagal but today was a surprising exception. The film was "The Others" and it was a TV premier that wasn't on over Christmas, as the BBC like to do. Still, I'm grateful for the opportunity and like I said, this isn't a bad movie to watch at all.Nicole Kidman uses a very good English accent as Grace, the over-bearing matriarch of a crumbling old manor house on Jersey in the latter days of World War 2. Her husband sent off to fight on the Front line, she takes responsibility of looking after her two children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann and James Bentley). Both children have a rare allergy to light, meaning that their world is a permanent twilight behind heavy drapes. It's only after employing an Irish nanny (Fionnula Flanagan) and her two sidekicks that all manner of ghostly goings-on occur in the house. Locked doors being opened, pianos playing themselves, that sort of thing. At first turning a blind eye, Grace is forced to admit that there are other things sharing the house with them.So it's a standard haunted house movie, right? Wrong! Instead of brainless teenagers running like screaming like pre-schoolers in a fun house, this is a genuinely creepy experience. Atmosphere is established from the word go and continues right to the end. True, it isn't a scream-a-minute ride or a mind-numbing chiller but the tone is just about right. The other thing that lifts this picture is the cast. Kidman is just about faultless, though she is thoroughly unlikeable to begin with. Likewise the children but despite my aversion to child actors, Bentley and Mann perform brilliantly well. The weakest link is Flanagan who sounds a little too much like "Mrs Doubtfire" for my tastes and Christopher Ecclestone as Grace's husband (who doesn't appear to do much) but generally, the acting is of a very high standard indeed.But for some reason, I can't mark this higher than an eight. As I say, the acting is superb, the scenery and atmosphere work nicely together and the story is an absolute killer. So why aren't I going crazy about it? Possibly because some things didn't quite make sense. The ending, though well written, never completely fit in with the rest of the film and the appearance of Grace's husband didn't appear to serve any purpose (unless it's a clue for the more eagle-eyed viewer than I). And sometimes, the director resorts to those damned violins to increase the tension - the same trick used every single time since Hitchcock's "Psycho". It sounds harsh but I really do like this film. It's a creepy and effective thriller (not "horror" - Kidman's too nice to do full-blown horror) but not one that threatens to make you leave the cinema demanding a cigarette. Even if you're a smoker, this film is only a little over ninety minutes. It's one of the more successful chillers in recent years and proof that sometimes, you don't need to go to the Far East to catch a good scary movie.</fullReview>

We have seen this before, the people you think you are after turns out to be your own self, such as Fight Club. It reminded me of the 6th Sense(another weak movie), this is of course no accident as it seems like a lot of the ideas are blatently copied from 6th Sense. I thought this was gonna be a very scarey ghost movie with tonnes of ghosts running a muck killing and slaughtering, just general terrorizing and havok. I was to say the least, extremely disapointed.

It's been a long time since I went and saw a horror/thriller and heard nothing in the theater (i.e. gasps, screams, etc...).

		<shortDescription>Old Hollywood fashioned ghost tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this was an awesome return to a classy ghost story. I love films that are this enclosed with a group of people who all have plenty of screen time because it is only the few. Also, films that rely heavily on the performances of the people in them. I guess one of the surprising elements here making the film great are the children in the film. With all the hype that was given to Dakota Fanning for a bunch of screaming and annoying the crap out of her dad while he's trying to drive, you have a great child actress here in Alakina Mann. She really gives a strong performance and holds her ground with the adults. The scenes where she does verbal battle with Nicole are particularly good. James Bentley is also good playing the son, though he has less of a part since his character is young and not rebellious yet. The two children really do seem like brother and sister like the kids who were in "Mary Poppins." The claustrophobic setting is well shot and sinister. Alejandro Amenabar creates a fantastic tale and performs multiple tasks as writer, director and composer for the score(Much like John Carpenter for the original "Halloween.") A fine film here that primarily became successful once released through "word of mouth," which is a hallmark of a good film. True sleeper hit.</fullReview>

But I was in the mood for ghost stories one day and could find nothing else I hadn't seen, so I broke down and rented this one.And I'm glad I did. While I don't share quite the exclamation-point-profuse enthusiasm some reviewers have for it, I was very impressed. (***Don't read any further if you haven't seen the movie yet and don't want to spoil the surprise.***) I had no idea throughout who was good, who was crazy, whether or not there was anything supernatural going on, whether or not the kids were really sick, or how it would end. I, fortunately, hadn't read the other reviews here of it before watching the movie, so hadn't made the obvious comparison to the surprise ending of another ghost story that came out at the same time, ahem ahem...but I didn't mind it. It was different enough, in my opinion, to still be likable, and it had come as quite a surprise to me. And really, excellent as the other movie was, it was NOT the first ever to use such a concept. It was even used in "Beetlejuice," remember? Though in that one it happened at the beginning, not the end.Anyway, "The Others" is a pleasant surprise of a ghost story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the theater knowing only the premise that this was a ghost story. I left the theater thoroughly convinced I just saw the best damn ghost story ever made.Despite having no special effects at all, and the absence of any hint of gore, Director Alejandro Amenabar managed to put together a truly creepy and chilling masterpiece. The dark atmosphere all throughout the movie was perfect, and the plot was gripping and very well written. The actors gave outstanding performances, especially Nicole Kidman. Alakina Mann was brilliant, and Fionnula Flanagan was creepy as hell.The story revolves around Grace (Kidman) and her two children Anne (Mann) and Nicholas (Bentley), who are both suffering from photo-sensitivity and cannot be exposed directly to sunlight. This is why their unusually large house needs to be dark all the time. Following the arrival of their new servants, they begin to suspect that their house is being haunted.Although the pace of the movie is slow, the rewards the viewer will get when they stick with it through the end more than make up for it. A top notch ghost film and one that will hardly be equaled let alone surpassed.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ Alejandro Amenabar's The Others is a film that I feel is a bit overrated, but still a good movie. It's The Innocents meets The Sixth Sense and I have to say that I enjoyed it the first time that I watched it. However, it does not hold up to multiple viewings (much like most movies with a so-called "twist"). While I like it for bringing that old Hollywood class back to the genre, not a whole lot ever happens during the film. And that really hurts when you are watching it a second time. You know what is going on so any interest is gone and there's really no more fun in viewing it. The film in a nutshell is about a family of three living in a secluded mansion that may or may not be haunted. Are there ghosts, or is the Mother losing her mind. You can tell the film was heavily influenced by The Innocents in that regard. Nicole Kidman is perfect here as the mother, but it is the children that really shine. I'm surprised to see that at this time they haven't worked much after this film. The ending may surprise some, but others will recognize what's going on. It's a good ending, but it's been used to death by now. I would urge everyone to see The Others once, but only once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is a phenomenal ghost story brilliantly told by master filmmaker Alejandro Amenábar, who, since winning an Oscar for "The Sea Inside" a few years back, seems to have vanished into a ghostly netherworld.Nicole Kidman, in what I consider her only enjoyable performance, plays Grace, a mentally frayed young mother driven to the edge of hysteria by her singularly impossible situation. It is the late 1940s on the isle of Jersey, one of the few regions of England to suffer under Nazi occupation during the war. Her husband, who went away to fight, has not returned, and she's been told to give him up for dead. She finds herself in lone charge of her vast, dusty old manor after the help suddenly disappear without warning. This is doubly difficult because her two children are photoallergic; they cannot tolerate any light brighter than that of a candle, or they blister, seize up and eventually die. No curtains can be left undrawn; no doors can be left open. The children's universe is a house-sized black cocoon. This has meant that Grace has spent most of her life alone; bringing them up in what she herself describes as a "prison of darkness." Not surprisingly, she suffers from migraines and cannot stand even the slightest sound.With this ingenious setup, Amenabar creates an ideal horror atmosphere: an old house lit only by candles, kept in a state of near silence. It also allows him to orchestrate a series of situations governed by one of the all-time great suspense concepts: "Whatever you do... don't do that!" Usually in a horror film the darkness is to be feared; in this case it is sanctuary. It is the light, advancing like a predator, that is to be fled.The children, brilliantly played by remarkable young actors, are left pale and ghostly by their lifetime of confinement. Their perpetual isolation has left them sullen, resentful and lonely, and the daughter in particular is beginning to rebel. Grace, realising that her control over them is slipping, literally puts the fear of God into them through her strict religious instruction. But the daughter has read her Bible, and can give as good as she gets.If Amenabar had merely played this scenario as was, without a supernatural element, it still could have evolved into a superior Gothic domestic drama. But he's too in love with the fantastic to leave Grace's world unturned. At the film's beginning, a trio of housekeepers straight out of Emily Bronte show up her door, claiming to be answering an ad for help they could not have known about. Suspicious but desperate, Grace agrees to take them in. It becomes increasingly obvious that they have a hidden agenda, though what that agenda is is unclear. For a time, things go well. And then the Others arrive.The children notice them first; the son claims to have spoken to them. They laugh invisibly in the halls, play the piano when the doors are locked, and, most disturbingly, draw the curtains and unlock the doors, leading Grace to conclude they are engaged in a war against her and her children. Under siege from a force she cannot locate, Grace begins to step over the edge she'd been skirting for years, and fall finally into madness.This is an intricate tale, brilliantly constructed. Not a single scene or line of dialogue is wasted. Indeed, from a simple storytelling angle I would say it is superior to "The Sixth Sense," to which it shares many similarities, including a shocking, brilliant twist ending. However, although there are moments of pure terror and an overarching theme of dread and despair in this story, "The Others" isn't quite as scary as Shyamalan's masterpiece, mainly because Amenabar perpetually pulls the rug out from under the audience's expectations, so that the Others, unlike the Dead People stalking poor benighted Cole Sear, remain a complete mystery until the film's conclusion. Are they ghosts? Human intruders? Some plot by the new "help" to drive Grace mad? Or simply all in Grace's increasingly distracted mind? As such it is often difficult to know whether one is supposed to be frightened or not, and for the most part this film takes on the air of an old-fashioned Gothic mystery, rather than a horror film. But when the plot finally unfolds completely, nearly taking Grace's sanity with it, the audience is treated to a sustained climax of genuine fear that leads to a mind-bending conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only the mildest of spoilers.This movie is perfect. Normally, if I'm watching a horror movie, I prefer a balls-to-the-walls frightfest like 'The Excorcist'. And I'm always disappointed by horror movies with no gore. But after watching 'The Others', I think it actually might be my favorite horror movie ever. The dark atmosphere is delicious, the plot is just excellent, and all the performances are top-notch - especially that of Nicole Kidman, who despite her character's numerous flaws, manages to make you like her and care what happens to her. The dialog written for her character is so authentic; it's so refreshing to finally see a film set in the past where the characters actually use the appropriate kind of language &amp; tone. The language in this film made me feel like I've never seen a 'period piece' with authentic language.'Rosemary's Baby' is often mentioned as a prime example of a film that creates a great sense of tension without any killing or monsters or gore. But I'd have to say that 'The Others' far surpasses 'Rosemary's Baby' in it's bloodless delivery. You are not left with any disappointment at all. After 'Rosemary's Baby', I thought "Well done, but they should have at least shown the baby." But 'The Others' is absolutely perfect. There is nothing that they should have shown. There is nothing that could have made it any better. And how nice to finally have a great horror movie that is truly spooky that you can actually watch with your kids?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, frightening film is best of its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that nothing could surpass my first terrified viewing of "The Haunting" when I was about 15. That's when I became a lifelong fan of supernatural psychological thrillers. Good ones are few and far between -- so, I have waited 31 years for the incredible experience of watching "The Others"! It has been worth the wait. This is the first time I have ever had goosebumps all over my head! I am usually completely unaffected by so-called "thrillers" and I find horror movies to be laughable. But "The Others" is in a class by itself.After my first viewing of this beautifully-acted, beautifully-filmed, intelligently written story, I had what I call "movie hangover" for a couple of days. I was intrigued, and I knew I would watch it again. Scenes and lines kept coming back to me, along with the impression of all of the amazing performances in the film.Tonight I watched it for the second time, sharing it with my two 13-year-old sons. They were blown away, and wanted to discuss it long after it was over. We talked about not only the movie, but also questions of the nature of life and death. For me, the second viewing was far, far richer than the first, as I was able to pick up on dozens of clues about which I was "clueless" the first time around. My boys can't wait to see it again. And I have to admit that now I DO love it, and we're buying our own DVD of "The Others"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard of this film before its premiere on BBC1. I decided to tape it, after all the great reviews it got from IMDb users. I'm very glad that I did...This little gem starts off with a Christian family living on an isolated island at the end of World War 2. The family have recently got some new servants, after the last set of servants 'disappeared' (the reason for this is explained at the end with an unforgettable twist). It is very clear that the mother isn't entirely stable, and when her daughter says she has seen a boy, and then an entire family who want to take over the whole house, she begins to get extremely paranoid, leading up to a great climax! This has everything: drama, suspense, horror, and it just oozes atmosphere, especially in the few final scenes, on a dark, misty night, when the truth behind the terrifying mystery is finally revealed! For fans of subtle, scary ghost movies, give this one a look!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The final collaboration between Nicole Kidman and ex-husband Tom Cruise (he produced, she starred) is a sharp horror thriller with one of the more memorable jumpy scenes in a while ("Who are you? What did you do with my daughter"; "but mommy, I am your daughter") which also earned the film a rightful parody on one of those endless Scary Movie flicks. While the twist has already been used in other films (*cough*), the film as a whole is a real roller-coaster of excitements and scares every horror buff owes himself the right to watch. Look out for the spooky setting that takes place exclusively in the area of the house, making the structure a living and breathing character in the film - perhaps more than some of the real characters.</fullReview>

It is only vaguely worth it for its trick ending, and let's face it, if it didn't have an ending like that there would be nothing to the film at all.Everything plods along so slowly, and there are quite a few things which seem illogical, for example how the daughter screams wildly at some things but is very matter-of-fact about sightings of intruders in the house.Because nothing much is happening, it is only inevitable that some major shock ending is coming, and quite frankly, while it is surprising, it's not really that mind-blowing, and certainly doesn't make the whole movie worthwhile.Could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

Furthermore I almost felt asleep during the movie, 'cause it was SO very slow. No excitement at all! Dull is an understatement for this movie! No horror, no sudden, scary moments, nothing at all...So was it all bad? No, I also agree with ppl here who say Nicole Kidman did a gr8 acting performance.

		<fullReview>I'll try to comment without spoiling anything. I consider myself a very big fan of movies, horror and thriller particularly. So when I saw the ads for this movie I thought, finally a good psychological, scary movie. There's been so much said about the "surprise ending". I'll say this, if you don't see the ending coming half way through this movie, or sooner, then your dumber than a post (and that's insulting dead wood). The visuals of this movie were nice and there were a few "boo" parts that left a few giggling with nervous laughter in the theatre after they were scared, but on the whole I was disappointed that the ending was broadcast so far in advance. My recommendation, wait for the rental or better yet cable or rent the original version of The Haunting, The Haunting of Hill House or The Haunting with Liam Neeson (a bad version but still more scary than The Others).</fullReview>

Also I had heard some good things from a couple friends that had seen it. To get right to the point, the only reason why I didn't turn this movie off after the first 10 minutes was because I was hoping it would live up to the hype. I can't even tell you how many times I looked at my watch during this movie, each time calculating how much of it had passed (i.e. 1/4, 2/5). It was that boring. The acting I thought was brilliant from the two kids (especially Anne) and from Mrs. Mills. Kidman, on the other hand, horribly overacted in a couple parts. She is not the actress that people give her credit for. Cinematography (probably misspelled) was good but contributed to the extremely boring setting. This movie is highly overrated and does NOT deserve to be on this top 250 list. Grade = 3/10</fullReview>

Although the set-up has some originality and there are some good performances, once you figure out the ending 'twist' (well before it's revealed, if you're smart), it becomes hard not to hate this movie for the 'been there, done that' feeling you get.I can't believe the film is so highly rated and getting such good reviews.

		<fullReview>Possible plot revelations ... warning.This movie is an anemic rip-off of "The Sixth Sense." While "The Sixth Sense" was original in its mood, plot, and shocking twist at the end, this movie robs that same device with a plodding, slow development and too quick wrap up at the end. It is incredible that someone would even try to make this and open themselves up to such criticism. "The Sixth Sense" also explained the "doctrine" behind the parallel spirit world while "The Others" fails to explain the "why" at all. For instance, we know why the main character in "The Sixth Sense" could not tell he was the dead person, because "dead people only see what they want to see." There is no such explanations for anything in "The Others" -- and then to top it all off the movie attempts to create sympathy for a paranoid schizophrenic child murderer. Huh?! Disappointing on many levels. One positive note: the acting was above average by all players, which was appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very unsatisfied with this movie. Rarely were there parts that made you feel insecure or scared. Sure I jumped maybe once or twice, and the setting was a little eerie, but I was never scared. The previews made this look as if it was "the sixth sense" meets "what lies beneath." Acting was good, and the plot had a foundation to build on, but it was built upon poorly. This story could have been much better than it was. Good main idea, but in the end the two didn't work out together. The ending was unsatisfying, but I'll leave that for you to find out yourself. This movie could have been good, had some more thought been put into it. Good idea, but more jumpy scares and a more explained ending are highly needed. 4/10</fullReview>

I said to him, "Let me guess the ending, I think I know it." I was able to guess the ending with great detail. Seem impossible? Well not exactly, you see I was able to put together the ending and the plot just from the commercial and the coming attractions for it. I finally decide to see the movie because I wanted to be able to critique it. So I pay for my ticket and go watch the movie. It was so bad. Nicole Kidman cannot act.

The reactions and expressions are so pristine that makes you pity the poltergeist for taunting her. As the movie unfolds each step it gives a riveting experience like none other Initially i was susceptible for the characters in the end, well in the end it all turns our rather gory and makes you realize what you have been witnessing is a horrific story from the past and you will feel relieved as the movie is over When we realize "The others" we would be dumbfounded on the plot that we were supposed to be focused and after the movie is over backtrack all the events that took place and connect the dots to make sense, that's how profound the screenplay is, hardly any noticeable flaws and backed up by exceptional and sharp dialogs If you want to watch a movie a horror movie that haunts you only until the movie time, leave the cinema hall with satisfaction and still have no aftermaths in the night, Do watch this and you will be glad you did!</fullReview>

Her character in this is quite stuck up and stuffy (ie true to form) but her presence belies the intelligent and thrilling nature of the movie.This said, she puts in a solid performance, in a genre which would be foreign to her.

The protagonist is a mother who has two small kids - a daughter and a younger son. Her husband is out fighting in the war. So she is all alone in her huge house with her photosensitive children. In the meantime three mysterious servants arrive. She has to manage the household stuff, take care of her kids and bear the unusual happenings taking place in the house. We get to see everything through the eyes of the lady- her anxiety, terror, fear, care for her children and loneliness. We get suspicious of everybody we see and wait for a twist, a climax. It does come when we expect it to but only prove our predictions to be wrong. The husband pays a visit in the middle of the film but simply throws us into more confusions.... Nicole Kidman simply rocked her role. The actors have performed very well too... The down sides are the behind the age music. Though the movie is set in the past century. Moreover it does get a bit monotonous as we can't make out anything in the second quarter.... #mustWatch....</fullReview>

The return of her husband(played by Christopher Eccleston) from the war proves a temporary respite, as he leaves once again, forcing Grace to confront the awful truth about the haunting(or does she?)

		<fullReview>Not one, but two spine-tingling twists in the story towards the end will make you babble with amusement. That is if you pay attention, The Others is an immensely scary movie.Nicole Kidman is outstanding; no one could've done a better job at this role and I appreciate the makers to use confined rooms for their scenes. Well, they do induce some chills. With an amazing setup and the idea of inventiveness about the characters, the plot talks about the story of a woman and her two children. A gardener, two housekeepers enter their mansion for work and trouble begins. Some sequences, coupled with eerie sound mixing and BG music are sure to keep you hooked. The two children are amazing, as well.And when you reach the final 20 minutes, blast! the plot will hit you like a cold corpse from 200 feet above. That is the effect of The Others. It is not void from goofs and dull moments, but if Scary Movie 3 can spoof one of its scenes, it sure gotta be good.BOTTOM LINE: American or British or take Spanish (The Orphanage for instance) horror movies don't scare me much, but if I had to list, this one would sure find a number.

		<fullReview>The Others is a psychological horror movie directed and written by Alejandro Amenábar, and it's his first English language movie. Amenábar is a director, actor and a composer. He wrote the screenplays for five of his movies, and composed the majority of the soundtracks. The Others was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, which is pretty rare for a horror movie. As a big fan of ghost movies, I consider this movie to be a masterpiece.On a huge estate, in an always darkened house ? darkened because of the two of her photosensitive children ? lives Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), the mother of a boy and a girl whose husband hasn't returned from war in the past year and a half. As a very religious person, Grace insists on her children's religious education, teaches them about God's morals and reads verses from the Bible. Because of her inability to conduct all of the house work, she employs three workers who should help her with the children and around the house. Since she has a heavy rheumatic disease, Grace keeps silence in the house, but it is one day disrupted by piano sounds, children's cries and sounds of footsteps. Her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann) tries to convince her and her brother that she frequently sees a little boy, Victor (Alexander Vince), and his family, but Grace blames the workers for everything that's happening.The Others has a very good atmosphere because of the creepy soundtrack (present in all tense situations), the old house in which many families have lived, the constant fog and the isolation from every form of civilization. Despite the fact that there are not many jump scares and blood, the tension is still present and it's created mainly by making the house dark (the curtains are always closed) and silent. Nicole Kidman, in spite of being reluctant to accept the role, since before this she was working on Moulin Rouge!, turned out to be excellent in the horror genre. She amazingly portrayed hysteria, as well as kindness to her folks, and her facial expression freezes one's blood (like in the scene where she starts finding out the truth). The movie is dominated by the opposition between the guessing what could be going on, the religious beginning and the overall thematic ? and what's really going on, and the sudden annihilation of the aforementioned.The role of the children in the movie was very big and very successful. Their regular conflicts about their mother and father create drama and tension. The character who leads the audience, and the other characters, to the discovery of what's happening, is nurse Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who tells Anne that she trusts her and that she also feels the presence of the boy Victor. She also tries to convince Grace of the existence of the supernatural. As a remark, I'd say the character of Charles Stewart (Christopher Eccleston) felt unnecessary ? he has no impact on the rest of the characters or the overall plot. The movie's ending is exceptional and is worth every minute of the movie's duration. The movie doesn't want to leave the revelation to the very end ? instead, the truth is progressively exposed throughout the movie, but still manages to lead to an unexpected finale. The Others, despite not being a movie that will haunt your dreams for weeks, manages to keep its quality and level of creepiness with every subsequent watch. A definite recommendation!

		<shortDescription>A truly good scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea why people are comparing this to The Sixth Sense. I called The Sixth Sense in five minutes (much to the chagrin of everyone around me in the theater; I really hadn't hoped I was right and it was THAT predictable) whereas The Others was one of the handful of movies that immensely impressed me by how well it was done. The acting was superb (this would remain my favorite Nicole Kidman movie until The Hours came out) and the ending genuinely caught me off guard- a rarity.I thought that this was an excellent movie, a wonderful nod to an age when movies didn't need CG and other effects to be genuinely scary. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very suspenseful movie with many plot twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is a psychological horror film about a family being afraid of what is inside their house. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) has two children who cannot be exposed to sunlight due to their medical condition. Because of her children's medical condition, Grace has strict rules that the children and the three newly hired servants must follow. Strange things begin to happen in the house, such as footsteps, thuds, and noises coming from empty rooms. Anne (Alakina Mann), the daughter of Grace, informs her mother that there are other people in the house, but her mother does not believe her. In the end, the true ghosts of the movie were the main characters themselves. Grace, Grace's children, and the servants are haunting a family in that very house.The Others is a very good horror film. From the beginning to the end, The Others will keep the audience guessing what will happen next. There are many plot twists throughout the movie so the audience never expects what will happen next. The ending of the movie has a plot twist, which makes the audience think. Because of the ending, the audience now knows why everything happened. The whole movie ties together and doesn't leave the audience confused.It is dull at times, however, each scene is very suspenseful. Suspense is what makes The Others such a good movie. Also, the mechanics of the film are flawless. Music plays into the suspense the audience feels. It is very eerie, and keeps the audience alert and on their toes. Each scene has perfect lighting. The lighting adds mystery to the movie since no one knows what's going to appear. The ending of the movie is a plot twist. Grace, her family, and the servants are really haunting the family living in that house. By including this scene, the audience understands what has been happening the whole movie. Everything comes together in the end making the audience satisfied with what they have watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Piece With An Antiquated Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old fashioned haunted house/ghost story done with a cast delivering perfection. It is the performances from all involved that captivate this story. The atmosphere is appropriately apprehensive and the pacing is solid. It is unfashionably stoic and is probably somewhat understated for some, but if you don't mind subtle surroundings and low key development this can be a mesmerizing movie with a probable ending.It is rather downbeat and somber with not much to cheer about but has enough surprises getting to the grounding of it all that can be spooky enough if simplistic in its tone. This one may be a bit overrated but is a solid piece of an antiquated style that is worth revisiting from time to time if only to catch one's breath after the latest gore fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghost stories come in all shapes and sizes and The Others, for a while, seems to be a pretty ordinarily shaped ghost story, but there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a devoutly Christian woman who lives in a large country house with her two children who have a disease that makes them react terribly to sunlight. At the beginning of the film Grace hires three new servants to help her around the house, as it is only her and the children because their father is off fighting in World War II. As soon as these new servants come into the house strange things start happening and suspicions arise that the house may be haunted. Clever spookiness ensues in a film that doesn't phone it in on cheap thrills, but rather builds a slow crawling suspense throughout the film.It's always a blessing to watch a film like this. It's one that manages to be spooky and suspenseful, but it's also high quality entertainment. It's a beautifully shot film that uses lighting wonderfully to amp up the chills. One of the major plot points is the children being basically allergic to sunlight. Because of this they can't travel alone through the house. Any room they go into or just pass through has to be darkened. This calls for the constant closing of shutters and drapes that gives the whole house a dreary and depressing ambiance which makes the whole bleak mood of the film all the greater. There is no room for joy or happiness in this story, and the way the ominous story and dim cinematography come together is excellent, and it's what makes this film so utterly creepy.For a long while The Others is fairly straightforward, but also intriguing and unique. It helps knowing that the film is a well rated film by fans and critics because throughout the slow building suspense you know that there will certainly be some sort of great pay off in the end. And there is. What seems like your run of the mill ghost story has a great catch to it that rounds the film off as an awesomely surprising story. This is a great film for any fan of suspense thrillers. It's not painfully terrifying, but just spooky enough to make you shudder the next time you walk through a dark room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A familiar ending. It's actually a re-make of a 1961 British film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tale of mystery, not horror. This is one of the best performances that Nichole Kidman has ever done. A ghost story of the highest caliber; but if you watch it too carefully, there are so many "clues" that you will guess the ending long before the final reel. For another version (a similar story) watch "The Innocents" (1961). The story seems familiar because it is a partial retelling of "The Turn of the Screw." I won't reveal the ending except to tell you that this is a ghost story told from the ghosts' point-of-view, which really reveals too much. (The young boy Victor, one of the "intruders", can see the ghosts.) A handsome production with excellent cinematography and sets. Well directed and very atmospheric but too intense for very young children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OMG!! I was scared seeing a movie for the first time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The film is going in my favorites list." They have truly shown that for making a film you do not need to have sound effects and ghost with bad faces. What is worth noting in the film is that you will feel scared at least for one point of time. I give most of the credit to the actress ? "Nicole kidman". And of course nothing is possible without a fine piece of direction. The director is new to me but I will remember his name forever. The idea of inducing photo sensitivity in the children so that there will be darkness in the house all the time. I think this reason gave the film an edge regarding the reasons, As many horror films employ everything in dark and without giving it a thought that why everything is to be done in the dark. The ending could not have better. The sound effects are kept to a minimum and fear is induced by the situations and the circumstances. The only thing that I found unnecessary in the film was the character of their father. Other than that this is the only horror film that has made me feel scared."A must watch for everyone."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the horror movies usually scare you "out of your wits" with sudden sounds and unexpected moments of evil appearance. Well, this one doesn't. It's well composed, and the acting is brilliant. Personally i want to give credit to the old lady Mrs Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), she is simply the best in this movie. Sometimes she appears as a kind-hearted nanny, but at times - very sinister. The plot is widely known to have an unusual twist, but regarding the title of the movie, i guessed approximately in the middle. It didn't spoil my pleasure, and later i rewatched the movie a couple times just to grasp the details of the other view of things. I would say that the vision of the situation shown in the movie is what you should watch it for. Though the atmosphere is all the way suspicious and chilly, the movie leaves a feeling of warmth and a light touch of regret. 9 of 10 for the whole conception elaborated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Others" is a 'twist film'--one that relies heavily on a twist ending that gives the film a great 'AHAH!' moment. But, if you know about this twist ahead of time, it really negatively impacts your viewing of the film. Unfortunately for me, some idiot talked about the twist and so I avoided watching the film for many years. It's a shame--and folks who do this sort of thing deserve to be tied up and forced to watch every episode of "Three's Company"! The same can be said for those who insist on telling everyone about the twist in "The Sixth Sense"--a film which, fortunately, I was able to watch before some dummy told me the spoilers! Even with the ruined twist, the film is still very good and merits an 8. It's a bit overlong but solid throughout and quite original. I could say more, but I don't want to be one of those jerks that spills the beans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up until I saw 'The Others' I did not think Nicole Kidman was much of an actress but was really surprised at her performance as the mother. The director pinpointed the dark crevices of Nicole's personality and she was wonderful. There are very few good Ghost movies out there and this is definitely one of them. Nicole Kidman's British accent was excellent and the British are supreme in making movies about Ghosts. The ending totally stunned me and struck at the fears that all parents have felt at one time or another i.e., that there is a dark side to being a parent. Maybe, just maybe you will 'lose it' and do something terrible. I am ordering it through Amazon as my son wants to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A woman who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive children becomes convinced that her family home is haunted.If you like pacing, haunting atmosphere, and surprise twists, this movie is for you. The Others is a very religious horror film and I see many hating it because of that. Same reason people didn't get into The Exorcist that much. I really liked the religious twist though, and for some odd reason religion makes a movie more creepy and daring. The twist is out of no where and I loved it, kept you in the story until the end and that's what movie making is. Nicole Kidman is a very good actor as we should all know and she does her part perfectly here too. At first in the story I thought she was crazy and then later on I realized she is just paranoid of the kid's sayings. The kids also play their part pretty well too, and thank god it wasn't like those modern movies. And then we have the PG-13 rating which some people hate. They all think R makes a movie scary and that's not the case. The Others is a very great horror movie and I really enjoyed it's slow, eerie pacing and descending into a well-done twist. 7/10.</fullReview>

The movie is incredibly suspenseful, scary, and thrilling. It has an almost Shymalan like feel to it circa Sixth Sense and it remains as one of my top movies of all time. Nicole Kidman is brilliant as a mother trying to protect her children from forces of evil, which reminds me a lot of a role she's set to play now in the movie "Trespass"- in this, she plays a woman defending her family from violent intruders.

		<shortDescription>Great acting job by the lead, but a rather lame end twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two kinds of people: those who like The Sixth Sense better and those who like The Others better. I'm part of the first group, and with reason. For starters, the musical score. In TSS the soft, melancholic, soundtrack is part of the plot; you can't imagine one without the other. Then, even if you have a similar final twist in both, the one in TSS is more effective, having all the advantage just for having come first. Speaking of advantages, TSS got also the most important one: the characters. Every one of them there is likable; we get in their shoes, we rejoice with them in their happy moments and suffer when they suffer; we feel their pain--to use a Clintonism. We load upon ourselves the emotional burden Malcolm is carrying, that of having failed to one of his child patients, we experience the night terrors of Morgan; the frustrations of Lynn, the loneliness of Anna. It's all that which maintains us completely focused in their personal stories, their sorrows, their plight, and so when the bang finally comes it hit us with full force, because it catches us looking elsewhere.In The Others instead there's no one single likable character. Now, I understand that to make the end twist credible we have to be convinced that Grace is a psychologically unbalanced woman; and that's how she comes out, but at the price of making her unlikable, even more so with her unnerving habit of locking every door after her?even when running to her kids' help!. I don't know if this was Amenábar's intention, but after 30 min I had enough; I had become unsensitized to anything that could happen to her, so when the time for real drama came I watched it all with mostly indifference. I can't possibly compare that to Toni Collette's work in TSS in a similar role. In her best moments there she even made that old empathy meter melt. As for the kids, they are weird more than anything else?even if I can understand why?and the servants are even weirder; not to mention the absent husband, who seems to have come back just for a one night stand. You can talk me all you may want about score, cinematography, acting, pacing, and so on, but this film needs something more to be able to work?as the plot itself is quite simple, to the point of lameness--and that can only be likable characters.Note something else here; the atmosphere, the mood, is not set by a combination of elements like settings, score, camera work, all of them firmly in the hands of the filmmaker, but almost exclusively by Kidman's acting work. She is the one who sets and defines the mood here and the one keeping it still for some time during the film. I understand that is most probably the director's artistic choice, but it looks a lot like laziness--"Okay, let's just set the lights low and make her do the rest". That's another important difference with TSS, where Night Shyalaman's hand can be clearly seen in every frame, every image; he never lets the actors do what is his own job. Most probably such a choice was made here out of necessity, as the story is built in such a way that there's no other alternative, but that's a choice and sometimes you pay a price for the choice you made. Here, you take out Kidman's work and all you got left is unexplained noises here and there and five rather weird characters. The whole plot falls into pieces.Judging for what I see in The Others, Amenabar looks very much like any other Bu?uel disciple, although I wouldn't go as far as to call him a wannabe, because he's clearly his own man, artistically. But Bu?uel's influence is so obvious in this film and this isn't praise anyway. I don't remember having seen any likable character in Bu?uel, because he was always tackling deeper, meatier, more complex issues than a simple puzzle about who is dead and who's not. Many times you get so lost in his films, you have to spend your time trying to find the exit or figuring them out; you don't know if what you are seeing is reality, or a dream; or which scene happened after which other, of if such scenes even happened at all. You had your hands full enough with all that to be caring much about likable characters. But in Others you got to care for them--as the "twist" is obvious for many from the very beginning, I guess--and if you don't, the movie loses all its interest for you (as for myself, before 20 min. I had already guessed that the servants and the kids were ghosts and was left doubting only about Grace. So much for surprise twists).The film have great suspense moments anyway, specially the ones in the junk and the piano rooms. But undoubtedly the last 15 min. are the best, as they bring about the climax and the denouement. The séance bit is excellent, but Amenábar lost there the chance to make it spookier and more consistent with the rest of the film--why they only see the alive NOW, not before? The point is, there was no need for showing the alive, as all what we--and the family--needed was to see the pencil frantically scribbling on the piece of paper, and the voices of the living, to understand the truth; just watch this scene with your eyes closed and you'll see what I mean. All in all, 6/10. I would have given it more, but I at this point I had become rather emotionally detached from the characters.BTW: would you feel comfortable living your after-life with the mother who murdered you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids dealing with frights in the night may end up relying on some saving Grace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A highly effective horror, written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar, The Others is not a movie for those who need breakneck pacing and painfully quick edits. It's a rather sedate slow burner of a film and one that continues to impress upon repeat viewings through quality acting and execution of the material.Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother to two children (played very well by young Alakina Mann and James Bentley) who both suffer from a condition that sees them endure pain and possible death if exposed to an ultraviolet light source for a certain amount of time. And so the large house they all live in is kept dark and cocooned. Strain begins to show as Grace educates and disciplines her children, pines for her missing husband (Christopher Eccleston) and tries to keep the new household servants in order. Things begin to get even more strained, however, when it appears that they are not alone in their house. Intruders are making noises, unlocking doors and even moving curtains so essential for protecting the children. Grace becomes increasingly frantic while the servants, strangely, remain calm in the face of increasingly bizarre events.This is a basic, enjoyable ghost story in the vein of those written by M.R. James and other past masters and best experienced on a dark night by a roaring coal fire. The acting is solid, Kidman gives a fantastic performance but the children hold their own among a solid cast and deserve a special mention for their performances mixing innocence, mischievousness, impudence and fear.Director Amenábar handles everything superbly, never rushing towards the next goosebump-inducing moment but simply creeping around events and making the most of every little detail. It may be some footsteps heard where nobody should be moving, a piano playing in the night, a door opening and closing or something worse but it's always portrayed with maximum tension and a genuine feeling of inexorable, building dread.It may feel a little old-fashioned to some people but this movie simply proves that when it comes to the horror genre, less can so often be more. A good yarn is a good yarn in any medium and this remains a great, intelligent, classy entry that fans should always recommend to those often willing to easily dismiss horrors as nothing more than slasher movies or gorefests.See this if you like: The Innocents, The Changeling, The Haunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning of the movie 'The Others,' Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children live a life of closed doors and dark rooms waiting for her husband to come home from war. Then, one day three strangers show up on Grace's doorstep looking for work. A few days after the strangers started working in the house, things start to happen that can't be explained. Grace finds herself trying to protect her family as well as trying to piece together the puzzle of the new staff working for her. The critical intention of director Javier Aguirresarobe is to make us think about everything that happens in the movie long after it is over. Javier wants the audience to put the pieces of the story together on their own. He made the audience think about the movie, so every time we watch it more and more of the story line becomes clear. Parts which seemingly had little significance in the beginning start to make sense. The critical technique in the film did exactly what it was suppose to. The camera angles did not reveal too much until it was important to the story line. The scream in the opening scene set the tone for the movie. I was curious to know what she was screaming about. The colors of the clothing, lighting, and outdoor scenes made me believe that the movie was really taking place in an old house during the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film The Others places the audience in post World War II England where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives with her two children in an isolated mansion. The year is 1945 and Grace struggles to keep her family safe and her sanity in tact, even though her husband set out to fight the war a year and a half earlier and her hired helped disappeared the previous week, complicating her struggle. She finds herself not only in a world of her own, but it is a dark world, as a result of her two children having severe allergies to all light except candlelight. The seclusion is soon broken by the introduction of Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia(Elaine Cassidy), three eerie applicants for the hired help positions. The mystery begins and the casts' silent existence quickly transforms as they begin to sense inaccessible intruders in the home. This film probes the thin line between sanity and insanity and how close we all may be to crossing that line if tormented enough. In the same respect, the way we perceive existence may be completely opposite from the reality of it. This movie deals with human psyche from the opening scenes to the climactic ending. The Others is nearly flawless. Constant darkness adds the play of shadow and fog to the story and makes the audience sympathetic to the suffocating life that Grace leads. Due to a lack of pyrotechnic visual effects and blood and gore, this movie is a suspense and thriller instead of a horror flick. Throughout the entire two hours, a full cast of approximately twelve people are introduced, once again running with the theme of solitude. Innuendos all through the story leading up to a surprise ending make watching this movie a second time a must. Writer and Director Alejandro Amenabar has resorted to simplicity, creating a fresh and thought provoking mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spoilers: a ghost story from a different point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersMy favorite part about this movie was the play they made on point of view. While the Sixth Sense (which everyone compares this to) was from the point of view of one "ghost" amongst the living, until the very end when they have the seance, this movie was based entirely on the experiences of all "members of the ghostly realm..hahaha.)" As a person (still alive..I hope) who has lived in a "haunted" house it was an interesting premise for me. Far more interesting than the 6th Sense because of the feeling I had of ongoing ownership of the house and the refusal to leave. I thought the whole movie was very creative. I actually feel a bit offended by all the people who call it a "rip off" because of the "surprise" ending. Really, all films are genre films be it romance, horror, action, whatever, and this one fits into the "ghost story" category, like it or not. The 6th sense was not the first ghost movie, nor will it be the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mini masterpiece from a new director to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just after the end of world War II, a woman and her two photosensitive children live in an old isolated house in Jersey. However strange happenings start to occur after her servants quit in the middle of the night without warning.Amenabar wrote the script, directed the film and even wrote the music score too and I tell you what - he does a great job in all departments! He may speak English as a second language, but I couldn't tell from the use of language. Indeed he not only knows English, but also period English and slang!This uses light so sparingly that we get dragged in to this strange candle lit world of locked doors and drapes. What a smart and curious device that creates shadows and in intrigue in every corner - like a permanent night. There is no gore, but despite this it gives you the creeps and has many jumps and frights. I don't care how much you turn up the central heating you will feel cold watching this movie.Good performances all round here and Kidman just gets better and better. She should have been nominated for an Oscar for this. How strange to see Eric Sykes as the gardener with a secret. No English director would have cast him because he is a vet of English TV comedy and not serious cinema.This is not a big enough or original enough a piece to give the title classic, but it does what it sets out to do with style and then some. This is as good as Hitchcock and Kubrick when not hitting their absolute peaks. Think of The Birds and The Shinning and you get the general idea.When you think about it, it manages to do everything with a manor house, a small set of actors and a fog machine. No CGI, no stunt men and no blood. We will know a lot more when the director takes on his next piece, but let us hope he is as good as he appears to be here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is a riveting and darkly menacing thriller, yet, during the course of the film, not a drop of blood is shed and no one dies. It is a reflection on the talent of director Alejandro Amenabar that small things, like a door slamming shut in one's face or a ghostly hand upon one's cheek are far more frightening than any amount of special effects that films in this genre are increasingly becoming reliant upon. A sense of claustrophobia is introduced from the outset by the thick fog surrounding the house in which most of the action takes place, and also by the permanently closed curtains and doors that prevent sunlight from brightening the rooms.In this house the light must always be contained, because the two young children (who live there with their mother) are photosensitive, and exposure to daylight will make them very ill. But it would seem that the family and their three somewhat mysterious servants are not the only inhabitants of the darkened house. Footsteps are heard, doors are opened, curtains are removed, but search as they may, nobody can find the perpetrators of these actions. And it would seem that whatever these beings are, they bear an ever-increasing amount of malevolent ill will towards the family.The film's conclusion is unexpected, even for those viewers who have managed to second-guess an earlier plot twist prior to its revelation. The surprise factor is at least partly due to the outstanding performances by the cast; special mention must be made of Alakina Mann, who is a young actress with a very bright future. This film is an example of outstanding cinematic production, and to maximise its impact, it is best watched in a darkened room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most memorable spine chillers of recent years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What at first glace looks to be an example of a classic ghost story soon shapes up to become one of the most memorable spine chillers of recent years.Set during the 1940's in Jersey ?The Others' is the story of Grace, a woman living in a secluded manor house, caring for her photosensitive children and struggling to come to terms with the loss of her husband in the battlefields of World War II. When three new housekeepers arrive, sinister happenings in the house force Grace to question her Christian beliefs and her sanity in this atmospheric supernatural thriller.Because of her children's allergy to light Grace is forced to live in almost complete darkness, which makes for a gloomy and sinister mood. The pace is unhurried with Director Amenabar deftly and subtly developing the story right to the finale, keeping the audience guessing all the way. The cinematography is excellent and plays a key part in the psychological delivery of the movie, really building on the claustrophobic atmosphere. Kidman is on top form playing a proud but desperate woman with belief and a lot of sensitivity. The supporting cast provide strong performances without over doing it allowing and doing enough to let Kidman to play off them well and provide the emotional aspect. A particular mention must go to Alakina Mann who plays Grace's young daughter Ann, who stands toe to toe with Kidman in many of the films more dramatic scenes and proves herself to be more than a competent match for her elder in all respects.Despite all of it's merits, this won't suit all tastes as it opts for well crafted and intelligent suspense as opposed to cheap frights and crude shocks. The tension is racked up right to the finale where there is a shocking twist, which I did find a little anti climatic however still satisfying, tying up the story well and not leaving any loose ends.I am sure there will be comparisons made with ?The Sixth Sense', however while I agree that the style is the same and the success of M. Night Shyamalan's debut may have aroused new interest in the genre, ?The Other's far surpasses it. Overall I was pleasantly pleased with the end result and found it to be a haunting and sombre new twist on the ghost story.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We just bought a DVD player. We went out to rent a DVD and since neither I or my husband have seen this movie, we decided to break in our new player with The Others. OMG! I'm glad we did! I knew it was going to be good. If you liked the Sixth Sense, let me say now that you would love The Others. From beginning to end, there is a sense of isolation and desperation. There are children who cannot be touched by sunlight, a mother who is trying to hold together what's left of her family after her husband doesn't return from the war, and three mysterious servants who show up to work in this large echoing house. You want them to be able to reach out to people, but they can't. Why? Watch the movie and find out. There are several psychological twists and turns in the movie that will take you by surprise. A few you might be able to predict but only after the appropriate clues are given. And one has to look a little hard for those because they're not obvious. Everything all comes down in one of the last scenes and the truth is revealed. It's a beautifully haunting movie about the afterlife and how people view it. I highly recommend it. Don't wait for Halloween! Go rent it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No blood and guts needed, just atmosphere, quality direction plot and acting is all that's needed to make a movie creepy. Better than "The Ring", almost as good as "The Shining". Kidman proves that she's more than just a pretty face with good support from the other actors with Eric Sykes, renowned as a comedian, playing well against type. This movie will scare you - go see it but not by yourself. Probably Kidman's best, along with "To Die For" (haven't seen "The Hours" yet).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOT SPOILERS: I guess I should have seen it coming, what with the sixth sense it's almost like a new trend in plot twists. But I never even guessed that they were all dead. And I'm usually pretty good with that kind of thing. And the equally amazing thing is I liked the child actors. I usually hate child actors. Especially those of the home alone and ET variety. Maybe it's the fear thing, but the last three underage performances I could stomach were Osment, Ricci, and now Alakina Mann. Maybe it is the hope that she could blossom into another Jodi Foster that colors my perceptions. Maybe it was the overall creepiness that brings a warm glow to all the performances. Maybe it's the Fred Astaire factor, he could dance with a hat rack and make the hat rack look good. Acting opposite Kidman makes it all seem easy. Kidman did it all for me on this one. Loved the book of the dead. Had some minor difficulty with the time code though - what year was this what year was that - I suppose ghosts have no way of keeping track of time - but I seem to remember her wearing a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macabre but not frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like I always do, I see films like this one trailered and I rush to the cinema in the vain hope that I'll be frightened out of my socks, ignoring the little voice in the back of my head that says "it will be a let down". Well this time, I wasn't frightened, but the little voice was also wrong! More of a psychological thriller than a horror (wrongly hyped), the characterisation in the film was so incredible that I stopped caring whether or not the film was chilling.This is Kidman's finest role I have seen to date and I have always been a fan of her acting. Her accent was brilliant and her portrayal of a strict, principled mother who is ultimately the most vulnerable person in that house is mesmerising. Of course, the unique relationship with her children could not have been adequately portrayed without the fantastic performances from Mann and Bentley. Altogether, the characters were realistic, funny and sympathetic.Ultimately, this film was predictable, but it was more complex than a cheesy one-dimensional horror. That is not to say that the film did not have its chilling moments, such as when Mann is possessed by the medium (or vice versa), but it drew its suspense from the emotional rather than the visual.A fine film with unique individuality and intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThis movie has the perfect atmosphere a highly successful ghost story. It reminds me of the old english tv films which always scares the s++t out of me. It has this typical big old spooky house placed far away from any sivilisation in the english countryside(although actually shot in Spain), a lot of fog and almost no SFX(except for the fog that is), just plane old great acting and a chilling atmosphere.I´ve read that one of the Director´s favorite movies are THE CHANGELING and some elements from it are in this movie. The ending with the psychic old woman is very similar(also brilliant scene in THE CHANGELING) and the old man´s name is probably taken from it also.The ending is a blast. I don´t think many people see that coming. Earlier in the film you thought maybe the tombstones belonged to the woman and her two children, or the servants. When they are revealed you can block out the first alternative. Then you know who the ghosts are but who are the third part, the so called "others"?Other chilling ghost stories:THE SIXTH SENSE,THE CHANGELING,GHOST STORY, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR any english film made for tv specially THE WOMAN IN BLACK(utterly horrifying).10/10!</fullReview>

I can't explain much of the movie without giving away anything, but basically the whole film is supposed to bend your mind around different plot twists and turns. I just thought the whole thing was irritating and not scary at all. This movie annoyed me because of the weak attempts at trying to make people feel "moved." I've seen scarier things in public bathroom toilets. I've determined that most people I know that enjoy this are female aged 15-30.

		<fullReview>While waiting for her husband to return from the war, Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children live in a secluded island mansion. Because of the children's incurable condition, the three of them are forced to live a lonely existence behind locked doors, drawn curtains and dim candlelight. Then one day, when a three mysterious servants arrive, strange things begin to happen within the house. Soon, Grace finds herself in a terrifying battle to save her children from these daunting intruders, and to keep her sanity at the same time.Out of everything in this film, the thing that stands out the most is Nicole's flawless portrayal of Grace, a woman pushed to the edge, by something she can't control. Nicole Kidman has always been my favourite actress (watch Moulin Rouge and you'll understand why). She is truly one of the best actresses in Hollywood today. The way she inhabits the character, and really lives in her skin is incredible. As Grace struggles to uncover the truth about these scary intruders, she becomes quite frightening herself. But towards the end of the movie when she begins to understand, you really see true emotion in her undying love for her children and her willingness to risk anything for them. The rest of the cast also pull off strong performances, especially the children, since they are big parts of the story. Another thing that really stood out was the role the atmosphere played in the movie. Darkness and silence are key to the suspense, tension and mystery of the whole picture and are both well orchestrated well. Overall, not one of the most scariest movies in the world, but definitely full of enough suspense, tension, shocks and surprises to satisfy anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd viewing and still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** / ***** (GOOD)My post-virginal viewing of this film was surprisingly entertaining. Usually, horror movies are never as scary as they are on first viewings. Okay, while this film isn't frightening enough to be considered a masterpiece of horror, the fact that it is effective at all, considering my familiarity with it, is really cool.Nicole Kidman's portrayal of a housewife raising two kids, at first, feels over-done; over-the-top. But during my last viewing, I began to realize that maybe writer/director Alejandro Amenábar intentionally convinced Kidman to ham it up.You see, Kidman's character, named Grace, has been raising her two kids all alone, ever since her husband, who has been ghost for a long time, went off to war. Grace is sexually-deprived, over-whelmed by the kids, and claustrophobic (she never leaves the house).. and maybe some other unhealthy adjectives. If THE OTHERS makes a statement about anything, it is that a woman, or single parent, should not have to carry the burden of raising children alone.This is pretty similar to Jack Torrence's conflict in THE SHINING. Deprived of the "finer" things in life: sex, alcohol, friends, an exit out of the house, etc... Jack ultimately went cabin crazy. You know the story. If not, you should see it, along with this film. They're, like, the brother and sister of each other, giving male and female perspectives on the experience of deprivation.Many of the film's most chilling moments are suggested. You hear sounds, and then you hear nothing.. and then the goosebumps arise. Then you get defensive, preparing yourself for the sudden entrance of a horrible being. Wickedly, the film toys with you. Sometimes you're shocked with images, and other times you're not. Without revealing anything, there's a scene involving a painting, hiding in the darkness. I swear, that image gets me every damn time that I watch this picture.Also worthy of note is Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's daughter, Anne. She's totally convincing as the older sibling who gets a kick out of frightening her younger brother. Fortunately, she even sends chills up our spines, with her suggestions of eerie things behind the curtain, or right beside you, breathing on you, waiting for the right moment to scare the living daylights out of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shadow of its intentional self</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was half expecting a version of The Turn of The Screw. Amenabar has the period paranoia in mind, but the story is a different one (and Ben Bolt's 1999 TV-film with Jodhi May 'and' Colin Firth is as good as a screen adaptation of Henry James gets. Britten's opera is where the author is really honoured).Despite being a star vehicle for Kidman, the ensemble works as such (just as much credit to Kidman in this respect). The true star of the show is the house on the Jersey Isle, beautifully shot from within and without, adding to the pathos of the final twist.Alas, pathos is all that's left after Amenabar cranks up the suspense past its elastic limit. In setting it up there are so many questions opened but unanswered that by the end the viewer's patience has gone. And the pathos is more of a nostalgia anyway; the humanity of the characters comes largely from the children and the gardener. Alas its all a bit one-dimensional. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cleverly-conceived movie (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar did a superb job on the screenplay for this movie. Also, the set, casting and acting were near-perfect.Many people have complained how this film was a "rip-off" of the Sixth Sense, but I disagree. For a start, the screenplay for The Others was apparently written before The Sixth Sense even came out; and secondly, the twist contained in The Others was superior.The Sixth Sense for me contained only one point of shocking realisation -- only one critical moment where everything you saw previously got turned on its head.The Others, however, contained a whole series of such moments. For instance, the first minor revelation came when the whole attitude of Mrs Mills changed -- it was at this point that I became very suspicious of the three servants. Such suspicions were confirmed when I heard the servants' comments about the gravestones and the difficulty of "convincing" the children and their mother.The second revelation came when the two children escaped the house and Anne saw the names on the three gravestones. Only half of the twist registered with me at this point.The third revelation appeared when Grace meets up with "The Others" -- and then I finally realised that the true nature of Grace, her children, and the three servants was indeed all the same.But the final revelation was the one that completely turned everything on its head. It took me a couple of seconds after Grace's confrontation with"The Others" before the true gravity of this astounding twist registered with me.Overall, The Others is a film that I enjoyed thoroughly. It does not rely upon your stereotypical Hollywood special effects to cause fear, but rather it relies upon the psychological impact that it creates with its incredibly sombre, haunted atmosphere. It is a movie which must be watched at least twice so that you can go back and see how the whole twist fits in flawlessly with the storyline.I give this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did there have to be a séance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without spoiling too much I will say that I was slightly disappointed that a séance was performed at one point in this movie, with the implication that a genuine connection with the, shall we say "spirit world" was made. Even the movie Ghost knew better than that! All "professional" mediums, without exception, are charlatans and con artists, and promotion of a rational viewpoint in life is not helped by otherwise intelligent movies falling into this particular trap.And it is an intelligent movie. For the most part the film manages very well to tell its story in little revelatory bits and pieces, whilst keeping the tension high. It even manages well the part where the returned father actually being dead is so obvious to the audience, although Grace and the children (of course) don't recognise it. It is handled in a way that it doesn't matter. He's there for character and plot development, not shock value.The problem arises in the final act of the film. It's at this point that, not simply because of the plot, but something in the way it was written, lit, shot, acted, edited together: somehow one is suddenly no longer watching a movie, but an episode of television melodrama. Maybe it is because the movie doesn't finish with a cathartic climax with, say, the house burning down or something, but rather one of those ambiguous twists which reminds you of "Tales of the Unexpected" or "The Twilight Zone". But also (again without going into too much detail) there is a marked increase in phoney looking period detail, and the look, acting and writing suddenly puts one in mind of a rather sub-par episode of "Poirot".Despite all the praise received from professional critics, my view was that Kidman's performance was the weakest of an otherwise excellent little ensemble (particularly Alakina Mann as the daughter who is just fantastic). I was especially keen to see the magnificent Eric Sykes, who seems to be getting more work as he gets older. For non-British readers (and indeed anybody under 30), I would like to point out that Eric Sykes is not just a consummate character actor, he is also one of the funniest writers and performers this country has produced, beginning over 50 years ago with his collaborations with Spike Milligan on the legendary Goon Show, and right up to the 1980s with his own sitcom, "Sykes". He's still acting on stage and screen, despite having been profoundly deaf for many years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little bit too The Sixth Sense for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman stars as 'Grace,' the Mother of two photosensitive children whom reside in a large Victorian house in this great yet reasonably predictable film.Towards the beginning of the film things start to stray from the formulaic horror-film plot and from then onwards it does not look back. It is this most of all that keeps you watching - if The Blair Witch Project scared you then this will scare you too.Personally, being part of the 'American Werewolf from London' generation only in-your-face horror frightens me but nevertheless this is a tempting film that urges you to keep guessing where the plot is going to go next. You may guess correctly on the first plot twist but the second will probably elude you. This surprisingly does not detract from the film and my attention was not detracted for a moment.75%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcockian classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the dollar theater about a year ago and it was the best movie I had seen in a while. Thankfully I own it on dvd now. It is not the best movie I've ever seen but it is up there. The director's style reminds me of Hitchcock's. Very artistic but not too flashy. This movie is not for you people that have to have the plot spoonfed to you, or special effects thrown at you. And it's not for people that like monsters jumping out of the screen for it to be a scary movie. If you enjoyed Psycho, The Birds.. Pretty much any Hitchcock movie then I would recommend this. I can think of some people these days that don't have the patience for this movie. It's because we're in a fast food society. This movie is pschological. It creeps into your mind until (if psychological movies affect you) it totally freaks you out. So, this movie requires some patience. If you don't have that patience, then avoid watching the movie and save your time. If you have patience, then sit back and enjoy this artistic masterpiece. And honestly, if you think this movie was unoriginal and boring then open your eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely have I felt compelled to comment on a movie as I have about this one. While it requires patience and attention from the viewer, the last twenty minutes make it a worthwhile endeavor.Nicole Kidman, as always, was convincing. Her acting skills carried the movie during its somewhat tiresome first thirty minutes. However, the ending is great and is a totally unique perspective. At least, I have never seen it done in over forty years of movies watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing's first... Nicole Kidman was absolutely brilliant. This movie raises creepiness to a whole new level. The direction and suspense level are just excellent. Very few horror movies are made this way. The less you see and the more you feel and hear... the scarier it gets. The main character, Grace, is determined to keep herself and her children protected from strange "intruders" in the house which she has been living in for five years. The sudden appearance of three mysterious servants hasn't made it all that easier for her either. So, you can imagine the extremely tense feeling that Grace is overcome by throughout most of the movie. And Nicole does the perfect job of keeping that tense expression on her face for the entire duration. Both of the kids did a great job and though Christopher Eccleston's role was a bit short, he was great too. Very interesting, full of suspense and some fantastic twists and turns. Highly recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a darkened old house full of intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie I saw recently was "The Others",directed by Alejandro Amenábar and starred by Nicole Kidman, as Grace Stuart in the leading role. The movie was amazingly set in the 1800s, and it's about a woman who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive children,and who becomes convinced that her family home is haunted. From this moment on the intriguing plot develops.In spite of the ending, this is a really good movie which has everything that a horror film should have. Darkness surrounds all the place and it creates a perfect setting for a movie like this, supplemented with the great performance of Nicole Kidman, as a terrified mother who tries to believe the fact that there are ghosts in the house. The direction and the acting were really good, particularly the leading roles.Another fact that was amazing were the scenes that were carefully shot, trying to reach perfection.In conclusion, I found this movie interesting and dramatic. And if you like movies like this one, I think that it is well worth seeing. However, if you've already seen it, I recommend another one which is along the same line: "Sixth Sense".Mariana Roccia, 15, Cutral Co, Patagonia Argentina.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie " The Others" in the cinema, two years ago. The movie is directed and written by Alejandro Am?nabar and starred by Nicole Kidman ( as Grace Stewart), Fionnula Flanagan (as Nicholas Stewart), Christopher( as charles Stewart) and the other actors and the leading roles. Nicole Kidman stars the main character as Grace Stewart, a woman who lives with her sons in a darkned house because the children are photosensitive. The kids become convinced that her family home is haunted. The film is wonderful, I like the theme and plot. The actors perfomed their roles very well. The director is the best, he is a genius as well as the crew. I recommend this film because it is very interesting, it has a bit of drama, thriller and horror. If you liked sixth tense you have to see this one.VANESA MEJIBA. 26-03-03.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually found this movie really good all though I had my prejudice thoughts. From the minute it starts (and the starting is really brilliant!) you get the image that The Others is not as cliché filled and normal kind of thriller. I liked the way the film was full of good little scary parts and not just a horrifying end and nothing happening in between like in many lame horrormovies. The music and the zooming with the camera were effective. And what a great idea it is to make a horror movie with two children allergic to light! Scary movies are supposed to be gloomy and grey looking and the allergy gives a ReAsOn why the movie is darkish.Nicole Kidman gave a strong performance and I was very pleased of her but mostly I was impressed with the two children. They were absolutely great, natural and true. Expecially the girl, Anne, she had a hard role in her shoulders but she handeled it like a professional actress.And the ending...of course I´m not going to tell about it because it is a delicious treat if you don´t know what happens in it. I WAS suprised!</fullReview>

But this film should definately be watched on your own, with some dorritos, a large capaccino, and a very large blanket to hide under, because this film is really really creepy from beginning to end, and when you see the end you will see why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great atmospheric horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The others" is one of the best horror movies of the last ten years.The story is quite simple at first sight:Grace Stewart(Nicole Kidman)lives alone with her two children,who suffer from photophobia(that is the disease which makes people vulnerable to light).The narration starts when the new family in servants arrives in the house... If you think deeper,the idea of photophobia is really genius!It sets a really dark and atmospheric setting where the plot takes place.Moreover,it is one of the very few films of its kind,which does not make you wonder:"Why the hell don't they turn on the lights?"or"Why don't they open a window"etc. The plot has many surprises,some of which quite predictable I must admit,but it manages to keep the viewers interest till the end.Nicole Kidman is quite convincing and shows that she can be a very good actress. In overall this sure is a worthwatching movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ending -- if you make it that far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many times have you said `That would have been a great movie, but the ending ruined it'? Well, THE OTHERS left me feeling just the opposite. The ending is a truly unexpected twist on the classic haunted house story. If only I hadn't had to suffer through such a tedious movie to get there.To be fair, the intention was good -- to make an artistic horror movie. But I had the same problem with THE OTHERS that I had with several other such artistic horror movies, such as THE HUNGER and THE SHINING. There seems to be an underlying assumption that horror can't be truly artistic, so that the only way to make a truly artistic horror movie is to subordinate the horror elements to the artistic ones. The result is a movie that doesn't scare you and does suggest there's something wrong with you if you actually like horror. A truly artistic horror movie is made by someone who loves and respect the genre, and so wants to create the best example of it that they know how.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of the best Ghost stories ever put on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scream opens the first scene.But was Graces dream that she had just awoken from in terror just that,or was it a filtered reality?Filtered like the dreary grey light that hangs heavy and oppressive within the walls of her huge Jersey Island Mansion.The year is 1945,and Grace(Nicole Kidman)is having a hard time looking after her young children alone in her home since her husband went to help fight the war.The children,Anne and Nicholas,played superbly by Alakina Mann and James Bently,have a rare disorder which has them allergic to any light brighter than a Lantern.Therefore the curtains must always be drawn.For their photo-sensitive skin to be exposed to the sun would inevitabley be fatal. One day three mysterious strangers call at the House,claiming to be responding to Graces advertisement for servants.She duly hires them.But soon after Anne begins to claim that there are strange apparitions moving about within the Mansions many rooms.Grace,strong in her faith,chooses not to believe her daughter,until she herself experiences strange noises and events.Could the house indeed be haunted?And what significance do the three new servants have?I will not say too much more.This movie is very complex in it's progression yet very subtle in it's delivery.It is the sort of film you HAVE to see at least twice to pick up on everything that in the end summarily binds together for a satisfying resolve,if not a somewhat sad one.This has quickly become my favourite movie,and I don't hesitate to give it 10/10.The cinematography creates such an atmosphere that it almost envelopes you,and the performances,especially those of Nicole Kidman and Alakina Mann are absolutely mesmerising.Definitely one of the best Ghost stories ever filmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Just Want Car Chases! And not St Augustine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my entire movie-going life (and I go back to the original ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS)I have never found a movie so engrossing, moving,heart-rending, fascinating, overwhelming, cathartic, and a hundred other things along these lines which you always read in movie reviews and until now always seemed so pretentiously overblown to me...And yet I'd give it only 3 out of 4 stars. I can see how others would find it overlong, repetitious, and structurally ill-conceived in spots.. But it is absurd to say that this is a bad movie, or a Horror film which is not horrifying and so on. It's simply NOT a Horror or Suspense Film or a Ghost Story. It belongs to another genre entirely. Quasi-Augustinian Creepshow.I haven't seen much mention of Religion in reviews I've read. Odd, as Angela Lansbury would say. With the very first audio a recitation of the very first verses of the Holy Bible? With an extended reference to the not especially well-known martyrs SS Justus and Pastor? (That's the Spanish influence, by the way.) With countless scattered references to Limbo, Hell, the Rosary, priests, Holy Communion, the Virgin, Christ,God, and Noah? And with all that, a main character named GRACE? At the risk of seeming patronizing...THE OTHERS is basically an ambiguously ironic (or ambiguously confirmatory? But the BOY should then have been SEVEN, not FIVE or SIX) look at Roman Catholic Theology concerning God as Ruler of All generally, and more particularly, the Fates of various categories of Immortal Souls in the Afterlife . If you're not at all interested in that subject you are bound to be constitutionally bored by this movie. If you are utterly captivated by that subject you are bound to be at the least fully engaged by every frame of this magnificently photographed, acted, and scored film. (The screenwriting is not SO magnificent.) If you are a strictly orthodox Catholic you will probably be offended. If you are a strictly orthodox Catholic wannabe for whom "things have just not worked out" this movie will come as something of a painfully gratifying shock. Yes, I would definitely say that this is one movie reaction to which will depend greatly on predisposition towards thematic content. Unfortunately, interest in that content as regards THE OTHERS is about on the level of interest in the development of Esperanto.So again, I can sympathize with the "two star" reviews. But it's hard for me to see how anyone could fail to be sufficiently moved by Nicole Kidman's character and performance that they wouldn't find a satisfying emotional pay-off at the end. For me, her performance here is one of the ten best I've ever seen in a movie. That conflicted reaction to a simple offer of a nice hot cup of tea in rather odd circumstances... Amazing. Beautiful. Heart-rending. Cathartic...</fullReview>

Most of it are indirect or off-screen, resulting in something that is more of the bone chilling type of scare.I don't think every piece of the puzzle connects at the end, but nobody is trying to follow some rule here like the way they were trying to in The Sixth Sense, which by openly defining what one could and could not do, and following that rule on the screen does not mean the character could function as if they are normal and not detect their state.All in all, a very good movie if you want to get the chills.

Viewing this movie in your home probably won't make you scared or frightened. In the theatres you would be terrified. The Others scared the hell out of me in the movie theatre. The atmosphere of the theatre made it really creepy too. A large, dark, and loud room with a very scary movie playing. When I rented this movie I wasn't impressed. It didn't thrill me and I found it boring. I suggest if it playing in a dollar cinema go see it there.

		<shortDescription>An old-fashioned chiller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>6.5 out of 10Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, an overly protective mother of two whose children have a rare disease that demands they be kept from bright light. She hires three new caretakers to help around the house (actually, a mansion), but not long afterward, that's when the "others" arrive. This old-fashioned chiller set in the late 1940's is a decent attempt at emanating the filmmaking style of the haunted house movies of the 70's. The film is undeniably atmospheric and there is a quiet tension that's almost impeccable.Unfortunately, despite a terrific performance from Kidman and the child actors who play her children, the movie is coldly impersonal, never developing truly likeable characters to sympathize in this understandably maddening situation. Even worse, the movie is ultimately little more than an excericse in crafting an eerie mood; by the end, you'll note little of importance has occurred and the climactic plot twist, while ingeniously executed, is somewhat obvious and doesn't quite add the extra spiritual depth writer/director Alejandro Amenabar was aiming for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "The Sixth Sense," "The Others" is a somehow melancholy, leisurely exercise in slow-building suspense. Unlike "The Sixth Sense," where those properties were used to good effect and contrast with the modern setting, "The Others" places its characters and their various sadnesses in post-war England. The film, although clearly modern, and extraordinary in its production values, feels and moves like a classic ghost story.The acting is uniformly amazing. Like Haley Joel Osment, the child actors in "The Others" are accomplished beyond their years. And though I'd always liked Nicole Kidman's charisma, this was the film that made me truly respect her acting.Finally, make no mistake: slow-paced though it is, dependent on twists and turns it may be, but this movie is truly frightening, in a way that "The Sixth Sense" was not. (And I don't get scared in movies very often.) As I'm typing this, the film is in my VCR; I originally saw it on the big screen. Despite my knowledge of the plot, it's creeped me out enough to have to pause mid-film for a web-surfing-and-review-writing break.See "The Others." Even if people have "spoiled" it for you, you'll still get remarkable enjoyment from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amenabar and Kidman concoct intelligent, scary entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most intelligent and scary film since Kubrick made "The Shining" and Hitchcock made his humorous murder thrillers. Like Hitchcock, Amenabar is able to make you laugh at yourself at the end of the scary film--while Kubrick could only made you sigh with relief at the end of his intelligent work.This is my first Amenabar film. The early scene of Kidman's screaming face switching from the vertical to the horizontal gives you a clue of what will follow--intelligent viewing, constantly requiring the viewer to re-evaluate earlier impressions. This is mature cinema. This is the stuff John Berger would love to include in his "Ways of Seeing" if he were to re-write the book. It is not without reason that in the DVD interview Amenabar says that he was most impressed by Kidman's eyes. It appears to be a frivolous comment. Yet Kidman's eyes are not only providing the impression of being terrorized or her character's steady descent from normality to lunacy, but they become the central sensory organ to a film in which light and darkness assume unusual importance. Amenabar is the Svengali. For a young director it is impressive to see the director working on his own story and composing his own music, to be able to get such topnotch performances from Kidman, Flanagan, Sykes, and the kids. Watching this film reminds you of Orson Welles' cinema, though Welles would have loved to be in front of the camera as well.The way Amenabar has crafted the story is so intelligent that you cannot help admiring how his story works backwards, with the end providing the pivotal point for the beginning of real entertainment and correct perspective. You begin to love the film after the movie ends--somewhat like the narrative structure of "The Usual Suspects." The prologue on the Creation, narrated by Kidman to the kids, would in retrospect be the appropriate epilogue. The film continues to entertain the viewer after the film has ended as the viewer is forced to pick up the clues thrown at the audience as the film progressed on the impending end.This is a European film in style and far removed from Hollywood's predictable approach to mystery, supernatural, aliens, etc. This style is what makes the film outstanding in the genre--it provides entertainment by teasing your senses and perception of what is real. Even when dealing with a supernatural subject it exudes a pristine charm of children and Bible readings. As the film progresses you note that often initial elements of charm hides a not-so-innocent mind (Flanagan's character Bertha Mills, Kidman's character Grace, etc.).Kidman is lovely to look at. Yet she is only truly impressive when a good director is in charge (first Kubrick in "Eyes Wide Shut", and now Amenabar).The strengths of this film also lie in the art direction, sound editing (superb), and cinematography.The film does leave holes in the story. What happens to the postman? What happens to the first batch of servants that preceded Bertha Mills et al.? Were the children really having a medical problem? What were the pills that Grace was having and what was Bertha giving her that Grace found suspicious? Probably these unanswered questions add to the richness of the film.This is a major film of the decade because of the narrative structure, which would put off conventional viewers of Hollywood products. The special features of the DVD are below average (e.g., interview with cinematographer is in Spanish, some of the English interview snippets are pedantic) while the sound recording is top notch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twists and turns! WARNING: SPOILER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm such a wimp when it comes to horror movies. I was 8 when I saw Poltergeist and I have been deathly afraid of clowns and under the bed ever since. (Even though I'm 14) So, seeing this movie was extremely frightening for me! In it we follow this depressed woman who has lost her husband in the war. She lives in her dark secluded mansion with her 2 children, who can't be near the light because if they are exposed to it they will die. So, the movie is all dark, which is freaky. In the movie Grace Stewart (the mother) played by Nicole Kidman is slowly going insane and she has hired some new servants to replace her old ones, who just disappeared one day! Grace is noticing all these strange things happening in her house and she suspects Natzis are hiding in it, though soon the suspicion turns to ghosts because of the freaky pale faced daughter, who can see one of them. The servants know what's up, though they are acting like they don't. Then, Grace begins investigating all of this, and looks at old books and tries to find out if the house has a bad history. She even finds a book of the dead, which has pictures of dead people in it, all dressed up. grace gets really freaked out, and tries to walk into town to get help from the church, but during her walk, fog surrounds her and she finds her husband! She takes him home, and he's all depressed, and doesn't seem to know what's happening, though again the servants do. The children are absolutely ecstatic to have their daddy home, but then begin telling him terrible things that their mommy has done to them. Because, children, mommy went crazy! So, the next day the father disappears, and more terrible things start to happen. Grace knows the servants know something so she sends them away because she thinks they are evil. Then, that night, while looking through the book of the dead, she sees that the SERVANTS are in there!!!! They were ghosts. Her children, who have snuck outside, have just realized this because they see their gravestones in the yard! And the servants are creepily following them! So the kids run inside to their mothers arms, and Grace tells them to hide upstairs, while she tries to stop the 3 ghosts. But, while upstairs, hiding in the closet, the kids notice that there are even more ghosts there! And then you see this horrific old woman's face open the closet! Meanwhile, downstairs, the ghosts are telling Grace that they just want to help. She runs upstairs into the room where her kids are hiding, and sees a group of people at a table. The old woman is writing some stuff very fast, and the kids are telling her what their mother did to them! Grace screams, and takes all the papers and throws them in the air and destroys them. Suddenly, the scene changes and we see it from the other people's point of view! The papers are flying up by themself, and they are trying to reach the ghosts that live in the house! So, now we find out that Grace and her children, and the servants, and the lost soul of the father are ALL ghosts! Apparently, one day while they were alive, Grace went crazy and suffocated her children with pillows and shot herself in the head. It appeared to Grace and the children that they had survived and that God had given them a second chance! But, sadly, that was not the case. They were ghosts. It ends up with the servants telling Grace that they didn't know they were dead either, and wanted to break it gently to her. They also say that once in a while they will make contact with the other world, but only sometimes. They decide to stay at the house, especially since now the children can be exposed to light, (because they're already dead) It really made you think and it was a great horror movie. All great movies make you think, not like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, both of which are terribly predictable. There are so many twists and turns in this movie, and it was really freaky in the theatre! Go see it, or if you have, watch it again! Out of 5 stars: 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadnt heard anything about this movie until at the theater when I couldnt find anything good playing and someone said to see it. This was one of my favorite movies of the year. (i`ll try not to spoil anything, i dont think i will) The movie is about a woman named grace, who enjoys everything quiet and simple because of her migranes, and her two children, who are deathly sensative to light, living in a secluded mansion, waiting for her husband to come back from the war. After their recents maids or, yeah maids and groundskeepers leave unexpectedly, grace put a letter out for maids and groundskeepers. A older man and older woman and a mute girl soon show up and start with their duties. Though out the movie alot of things goes on with alot of little clues and hidden feature that you probably wont even tink about till after you watch it or untill you watch it again, or maybe for some people they wont. What was really good about this movie was the way it continually built up the intensity and then exploded at the end, and the way it made you feel kinda empty and dark, or just gave you the feeling they had. Another thing that was very different was how it hardly used any specials effects and just used the story to be scary instead of having people with their heads cut off or things jumping out from behind people, like other scary movies like 13 ghosts or whatever. The acting is brilliant, Nicole Kidman is one of my favorites and the kids were incredible. The Direction was very unique and different, very elegant and dark, and the story was awesome, different entirely from the sixth sense and if this is said to be like sixth sense then pretty much their isnt a ghost movie that isnt like the sixth sense. All in all an excellent movie which will give you an erie feeling for long after the twisted ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the British Crown Dependency of Jersey a woman lives alone with her two reclusive children in a creaky old house during the immediate aftermath of WWII, and clings to the hope that her husband will soon return home from battle. Preparing for the possibility that he may be KIA, she hires a trio of household servants but soon feels threatened by what she believes to be a supernatural presence in her home. Interesting, enjoyably old-fashioned thriller with a perfect part for Kidman is effective in creating a gloomy, spine-tingling atmosphere, but it never reaches a high level of intensity or suspense, and has a familiar ending that doesn't quite deliver. Still, it's hard to deny the film's skill and craft. **?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Haunted House-Ghost Story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have for a long time had a lot of problems with the haunted house or ghost-in-the-house type movie. There is generally way too much screaming, gore, special effects, and worst of all, these movies tend to take their ridiculous premises way too seriously. The exception has always been "Poltergeist", because so much warmth and humor was part of the story of a middle-class American family under siege in their nice suburban home, and because it definitely had some really scary moments. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, one more time!So, when I first saw "The Others", I was not expecting much. Was I ever blown away! First: Nicole Kidman gives one of the best performances of her career in this movie -- better even than "To Die For" -- so why was she nominated for an Oscar for that pathetic role in "Moulin Rouge"? Second: This movie throws out all the other haunted house and ghost story cliches. The premise of the story is actually quite simple and believable if you believe in ghosts, and it cannot be repeated here. See it and enjoy it. There is no blood or gore. There are, quite frankly, no special effects. It is just a great story, within the confines of a ghost story and a haunted house setting, with a dynamite twist ending, with fantastic acting from the entire cast (especially Kidman as the strictly religious, super-control-freak mother of two very different children, and kudos to the little girl who portrays the daughter who knows too much and to the elderly lady who plays the wise nanny-housekeeper who also knows more than the mother). Fantastic direction, moody cinematography and spooky music.This was chilling, shocking and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, and I was watching it in my own home! I saw it again tonight, and it still is every bit as fascinating and chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT the Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen The Sixth Sense before, I can assure you this is not a ripoff of that movie. First of all, The Sixth Sense was NOT the first movie to use surprise endings (see Se7en, Carnival of Souls, any Hitchcock movie). Yes, there are some similarities but overall, this a far superior movie. Nicole Kidman plays her greatest role yet as a single mother guarding her two children. Should you feel sorry for her at the ending? No, but this is a movie- should you feel sorry for Norman Bates in Psycho- no, but it still doesn't make it any less of a great movie. Having said all that, I must say that the subtle use of sounds and noises are frightening. Even having watched the film numerous times, there are still parts in this where I am startled. The only negative comment I can see is the movie is a bit slow but give it time....you won't be disappointed. The best movie of 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie - as someone else had commented, it's one of the few to literally send chills down my spine. It takes a lot to get that kind of reaction out of me.It's also one of the few to be described on the cover as having a "surprise ending" that I didn't see coming in its entirety, though in retrospect, all the clues really were there. It is, actually, very unlike a Shyamalan movie, though the comparison to "The Sixth Sense" has been made. The clues in "6th Sense" were ridiculous and mostly useless - the "red" thing for example. The only times that the colour red stands out as remarkable are the shots of the doorknob - otherwise: people wear red clothes, and have red balloons at parties, so no one will notice or care. The clues in "The Others" are more subtle than the red doorknob, but not subtle to the point of being uselessly obscured by their common-ness.The pacing, I thought, was perfect. Any faster and there wouldn't have been enough time for the fact to sink in: there is something really not right about this household. Any slower and it could have become a very tiring thing to watch. This film is very much like being strapped into a medieval torture device handled by the most excellent Marquis de Sade himself - it's not in the pain of the device or the surprise of the ending, but in the anticipation of it that the thrill lies.Very moody film, highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kidman's Best Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very pleased by this movie. The cinematography is wonderful and helps to make the house seem more claustrophobic. The director captures an ethereal quality in the actors. The mysterious sounds and voices that disturb this family, led by Kidman, ultimately come from more than one source. Their deepening confusion, and struggle to maintain sanity, is what propels the plot. Obviously, this is the type of movie that demands to be seen and not spoiled by too many revelations here. I think Kidman is cast perfectly in this role. This is her best performance. In some respects, this is a story about seeking redemption. Can eternal love achieve forgiveness for a heinous sin? There are some interesting questions posed herein by the director. This movie has a wonderful cast, excellent acting and terrific cinematography. It is not a superficial or facile movie, although it might appear to be at first. The Others rewards a perceptive, attentive moviegoer with a great experience. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this film is excellent. I was not a big fan of Nicole Kidman before I saw this film, (firmly believing that she had yet to come in to a role where she shined). Well this movie is a vehicle for her. I feel the tone of this movie is Nicole Kidman. I see very little flaws with this film. The cinematography completely captures the power of light in the film, and it sets a great feel. The directing is very strong, helping portray the confusion and struggle of a family realizing that they arent alone in the house. For anyone with an attention span longer then a commercial, you will thoroughly enjoy this film on a second, third, fourth e.t.c viewing. I feel there is nothing in this film that is unnecessary, and everything helps build up to what is in my opinion one of the most dramatic and completely shocking endings I have ever seen from a movie. If you are a true movie enthusiast, then this is a film I'm almost willing to guarantee, won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***Before I saw this movie I was one of the few people who couldn't stand Nicole Kidman. But with Moulin Rouge and The Others, she has became one of my favorite actresses to watch.It is important to realise that this movie is all Nicole Kidman. She obviously headlines the cast, and despite fantastic performances by her supporting cast, it's Kidman that drew people to this film, and will undoubtably bring new fans to the cast.The movie follows Grace Stewart (Kidman) and her children Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who suffer from a rare disorder that forces them to avoid sunlight at all costs.Desperate for help, and perhaps company Grace employs the mysterious Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flannigan) and her companions Edmund Tuttle (Eric Skyes) and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy).But as things start to go wrong in the house, Grace becomes more and more paranoid and begins to suspect her help, more the mute Lydia who seems to know more than she is letting on.The movie builds up to a brilliant twist that I for one, never saw coming and appreciated fully.Kidman is brilliant as Grace, accent and all, and mixes paranoia with strength and determination. Fionulla Flannigan, Eric Skyes and Elaine Cassidy are suitable mysterious, Flannigan particularly and Cassidy put in a brilliant performance for a simple role, though she does look tired and worn and pale. The kids are utterly brilliant, specifically Mann as the suspiciously defiant older sister. Christopher Eccleston appears for a short time, and the movie's only other big name puts in a quietly impressive performance as Grace's MIA husband who turns up in the fog.9/10.</fullReview>

Think about the twist. It isn't at all the same as The Others' twist.Stop comparing two different and unique films just to be bitter and cause annoyance to The Others fans. This is a BRILLIANT film,last year's best and one of the genre's best to date. Nicole Kidman gives what can only be described as a spellbinding performance in this critically acclaimed and haunting shocker.- definitely her best performance to date. With more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and a suffocatingly intense atmosphere, The Others is undoubtedly a winner. Fionulla Flanagan is superb and the two child actors are on level footing with, dare I mention Haley J Osment and overall, this film is not to be missed. Sixth Sense fans, get over yourselves !!! The Others is an elegant, beautiful, intense, unsettling, horrifying, chilling and haunting shocker.Truly unpredictable, with spectacular performances all round, particularly from Nicole Kidman who gives an unforgettable performance- without a doubt her best ever. She is truly mesmerizing as Grace and definitely deserves the huge amount of critical acclaim that she's received. She plays the part to perfection and her English accent is superb. This film is a flawless masterpiece. A wonderful cinematic experience that's not to be missed! Just view the reviews below for a taste of the acclaim it's received by fans and critics alike!

		<fullReview>"The Others" can be considered the festival of quotations. There wouldn't even be the need to mention "The Sixth Sense", which Amenábar said he has seen when he had already achieved the script. From the plot reminding "The Haunting" by Robert Wise to the Victorian atmosphere which sends back to "The Innocents", the film Jack Clayton took from Henry James' "The Turn of the Screw" in 1961; from the ambiguous mix of reality and reverie which prevents during large part of the film to distinguish the world of the living ones from the world of the dead ones, like in "The Other" by Robert Mulligan, recalled even in the title and that a few have noted, to the soundtrack, composed by Amenábar himself, full of echoes of the works included in "The Shining" (the "Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta "of Béla Bartók and the quartet for strings by Krystof Penderecki), this film assume the shape of a glamourous, well crafted collection of quotations that a young unquestionably skilled director dedicated to (or stole from, it depends on your point of view) his favorite authors. Therefore we are dealing with the work of a director who probably doesn't have anything to say, but he says it very well. In that being very modern.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classical Sixth Sense!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that the beginning and the middle of the movie were quite disappointing to me. Because in spite of all the good criticisms which I had heard of here and there before seeing the movie, in some points of the movie I felt that critics have played a trick on me or maybe there are some artistic sides in the story which I can not figure out!! And because the setting of the movie belongs to the 1940's, it was hard to imagine that it can have a modern ending. But of course I was wrong. What makes "The Others" a noticeable movie is exactly the climatic ending. In the last minute, all of your thoughts are mixed, and you should just sit there and see the credits with your mouth wide open!! Where are the others? BOO , Actually we are the others!!And in the end you understand that this is not only a B-Movie which only depends on some adrenaline-rush scenes... It is far beyond that... It's a movie which makes you sit in the cinema for one hour and a half wondering: "SO WHAT?" but in the last ten minute, it gives you an answer which you can think about all the way back home, and even for days...Setting and acting reminded me of 1960 classical movies. But what is obvious is that Nicole Kidman was not the one whom always a bunch of guys can sing "HIP, HIP, HOORAY!!" for during the movie. It was a "PORTRAIT OF A LADY" kind of performance for Kidman. So I guess it was a little bit boring for those Kidman fans who want the erotic Nicole Kidman of Eyes Wide Shot, with some extra hanky-panky scenes.Generally, the conclusion is that although the movie was in the genre of horror, but it was not for fun or just spending time... It was a movie which can easily be seen for the second time for more pleasure. Quite like "The Sixth Sense", it must be so interesting to see the movie for the second time from another angle. Because when you know the end of the story, you go searching for other details.The philosophy of Alejandro Amenabar about life and death, the living and the dead was somehow sarcastic. And also it should be mentioned that some lines of dialogues were very intelligent (like the ones about the world war and that all English folks are right in their deeds!!). Such dialogues are not common in movies of this genre.For more sharp gossip lovers, the attractive part of the credits is Tom Cruise as one of the executive producers!! No further comment ;)I would give the movie 7 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The key to a good ghost story is in the telling. The pace has to be just right ? not so leisurely that the audience loses interest, but not so fast that the intriguing details are lost. There is a good, spooky story in this film, but the film takes too long to get to the resolution. The performances are very good (Kidman is plausibly mad), and there are some legitimate shocks; there is zero reliance on bloody special effects. Unfortunately, by the time all is revealed, I was just bored. This would have made an engrossing 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is the scariest film of 2001 and right up there with chilling films such as The Changeling, Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark, The Omen and The Sixth Sense.Nicole Kidman plays what I believe to be her best role ever as she plays Grace Stewart who lives in a large house with two young children. Her husband has been missing in action since the end of the second world war. Grace is a strict Christian who can't let her children leave the house because they have a rare condition which causes them to react fatally to sunlight. One day three servants show up to start work at the house after three other servants left unexpectedly. Then, the horror starts.The majority of the film is set in an eerie darkness where you never know what's hiding. I don't want to give anything away so I'll try to be vague. Grace believes there are intruders in the house and that is when the real horror starts. The film gives you a few clues (and a few red herrings) throughout and you are constantly wondering what the hell is going on? Is it all in the children's minds? Is the house haunted? Is there a more scientific explanation?The ending of the film is extremely chilling and totally surprising. When the movie ended I had to quickly turn on the light because it sent a cold shiver through me. It was very original but downright scary and it stuck with me for awhile.It's good to see that movies can still scare us without having a drop of blood shed. And this film reiterates the belief that horror that is implied and unseen is far scarier than guys in masks or rubber suits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With rare exceptions, thrillers these days are utter garbage. I wasn't expecting much from this one but boy, was I surprised! This was the first movie I've ever seen to actually send chills down my spine. Everything is done beautifully in order to create a genuine scary atmosphere. It doesn't use cheap tricks to be scary, it takes its time to build a good story and bring the audience into it. And I haven't even mentioned the ending yet. I guess all I have to say is that it took me a while before I was able "got over" what I had seen and get up and get on with my life. I went to see this film without knowing anything about it except that it was a thriller staring Nicole Kidman. Now I realize how lucky I was for that because it made the experience even more intense. And yes, this was even better than The Sixth Sense, which is a saying a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, Hollywood delivers a smart, taut suspense picture which actually provides an intelligently written story along with the thrills and chills. A lot of suspense or horror films (like, say, "The Haunting") seem to consist of various scary or gory scenes around which the writers loosely draped a story to link them together. In a film like this one, the story is interesting enough on its own; the scares flow logically from the established characters and plot. That's the way it's supposed to work!The previous comments here do a more than adequate job of summarizing the film's plot, so I'll not retread that territory. I'll simply add my voice to the chorus of accolades: "The Others" is a superbly crafted story that is satisfying on every possible level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly Suspenseful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others, the first American film by the young Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar (Open Your Eyes), is a low-key, psychological horror story that achieves its creepy results without using in-your-face special effects. The film takes place in an old British mansion (you guessed it) on the fog bound Isle of Jersey in 1945. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the owner of this spooky house who, as the film begins, hires three new servants to replace those who have mysteriously left without leaving a note or saying goodbye.Grace's two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), have a rare ailment that requires they cannot be exposed to light. Thus, all curtains in the mansion must be drawn and each door in the house shut and locked before a door is opened to another room. The house has no electricity, no radio, TV, or phone, and Grace must look after her children by herself. Grace's husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) hasn't returned home from the war, and she hasn't received any word as to whether or not he is still alive. Grace is icily distant and rigid and has given her children a strict religious upbringing.When three servants arrive, the elderly Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), the mute, young Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and an aging gardener, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), it soon becomes apparent that they have some knowledge that Grace doesn't. Anne begins to hear voices and tells her mother she has conversations with a young boy named Viktor. Grace refuses to believe her daughter until she starts to hear the sounds and voices of intruders in the house herself. "Sooner or later, they will find you," Mrs. Mills murmurs. When the mother discovers photo albums filled with snapshots of dead people, she's ready to start believing Anne.Practically the entire film takes place in shadows bathed in an ethereal glow, creating an eerie and dreamlike atmosphere. Amenabar uses the darkness to increase the tension and feeling of claustrophobia. Nicole Kidman is effective as the emotionally constricted mother trying to protect her children and maintain her sanity. The Others is a highly suspenseful thriller with a shocking plot twist that will make your heart go bump-bump in the night.</fullReview>

The script is also pretty good on the whole.The plot however could have done with some tweaking and I feel that some elements of the screenplay could be more subtle.The twist was far too obvious for me - as soon as the husband returned it was obvious what was going on.I guessed even before that however - as soon as servants arrived at the house. There are too many unsubtle clues - especially if one is au fait with ghost stories.A film well worth watching - but not as good as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie scared me to death, and that's why I liked it so much. The shadows and coloring gave the spooky effect that the movie needed. The camera never went crazy, and it never did do those annoying close ups like so many other horror films, where it's as if the camera is eating the person or something. The music was very eerie and spooky. The only thing I didn't like was the way Nichole Kidman would whisper, than I would have to turn up the volume. The next thing you know, they would be screaming, or loud music would be playing and it would be way too loud. Finally I gave up, and just put it on captions. The sound quality might be a problem for people who buy the movie on VHS. Keep that in mind incase you want to buy the movie. Of course if you don't like loud startling sounds in horror movies, the DVD player would be the way to go. Other wise, it's a wonderfully scary movie, that proves you don't need blood in a horror movie just to make it scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW, I was really impressed by this movie. It starts so slowly and harmlessly, although with this mysterious atmosphere that keeps you watching like in hypnosis. Then you begin to realize things and you start thinking about what could be wrong in the house. You start to suspect things and several theories start evolving within your mind. But whenever you think you've almost figured it out, something happens that makes you chase another even more horrible theory. And in the last 15 minutes of the movie when the horrible truth is revealed, you lose your breath about how brilliant this movie really is. Although there are almost no special effects in this movie, the atmosphere together with the superb actors (especially the two children and Nicole Kidman herself) and the brilliant storyline make this one a real treat. I've never seen anything better in the horror genre. You gotta see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is; Nicole Kidman's best film and best performance to date. She is simply STUNNING and MESMERIZING as Grace - a truly top notch performance as all of the performances are in this classic. This film is NOT a copy of the Sixth Sense. The idea is taken from a COMPLETELY different angle to the Sixth Sense.The screenplay was written BEFORE the Sixth Sense was released AND in my humble opinion anybody who thinks it is a copy is being VERY UNFAIR . It was one of the best films of last year and the only people who didn't like it probably didn't understand it, or, like different genres, and, probably enjoyed incomprehensibly idiotic, brainless, pathetic, painstakingly awful, critically panned films of 2001, such as Tomb Raider, Pearl Harbor, Jurassic Park and some of those ridiculous comedies etc.[ no offense to anyone who liked these, everyone's entitled to an opinion] -basically unoriginal laughably acted films with waferthin plots and even thinner performances. The Others is a thinking person's, intellectual horror film/thriller. The Others is a VERY clever and unpredictable film. It is an elegant, stylish, beautiful, intense, unsettling, horrifying, chilling and haunting shocker that should not, has not and will not be forgotten. A classic if there ever was one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have became a big fan of Amenabar since I watched Abre los Ojos and Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky. This movie obviously looks more like a big budget Hollywood film than Abre los Ojos and the visuals are much better.If it had been a small budget pic, it would probably had the same sort-comings of Abre that Vanilla Sky rectified. The Others greatly improved Amenabar's status as a writer and director in my eyes and I see no room for improvement for this story. But, unfortunately, I had the movie figured out pretty early because one scene was sorta close to one from (now hold your laughs) Beetlejuice. Those who have seen both movies might make the connection... But, all in all, he made another movie I myself would have loved to be in on. Kidman's performance was good, to me it was a 7 and a half, maybe an 8, out of 10. And kudos to Amenabar to keeping to movie to 104 mins., any longer would have been overkill. This one is worth watching, and for Amenabar fans, it's a keeper</fullReview>

Of course I cannot tell anything about the plot without spoiling your viewing pleasure! Anyway, for the plot only my mark would be close to 10/10.Sadly the story develops very slow. In fact I believe that the first hour or so could have been told in half the time. That could have created extra time to raise the suspense or to put us even more on the wrong leg. The last half hour gives us what lacks in the first hour, however. The plot moves fast towards the climax then. Acting (especially by Nicole Kidman) is great. Photography is beautiful and the plot -as said- is very good. Didn't the makers see the flaw in the movie or did they lack some more creativity to repair it? My mark: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film very much but it was spoiled, to a certain extent, by certain characters whispering. Nicole Kidman was very bad here and, at the end, I missed what she was saying to the children so I had to guess at the full outcome of the plot. Even by turning up the volume it was very difficult to hear - in fact I found the entire film quite lacking in volume, except for the screams of course. I watched this film on DVD but see no reason to believe that the cinema version would be any better.All good horror films seem to have to be shot in low light and sometimes I find myself shouting 'Put the light on!' when the person (normally a young lady) is wandering about a house looking for intruders, ghosts etc. This film covered that very well by stating that the children were allergic to light so I had no need to shout in this case. My daughter (35 yrs old) will not watch this film by herself and I see why, as it gripped me very well. N.B. It was not a rifle that Nicole Kidman was carrying but a shotgun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film after hearing so much about it - how it relied on creepy atmosphere and sound to supply chills rather than jump out at you gore. Well, it certainly doesn't have any jump-out-of-your-seat frights. That's for sure. It barely has any thrills at all. Creepy atmosphere will only take you so far. Like Blair Witch Project, The Others is like sex without climaxing, all build up and no pay off.The ending is rather pointless and really doesn't add anything to the story. It's an easy twist to figure out and from the moment I did, I realized everything happening had no point as the ending renders it all moot. The only good moment is the way the twist is revealed but it can't redeemed the 100 minutes of tediousness leading up to it. How this managed to get on the Top 250 list here is beyond me. I think I'll go watch 'Signs' again, to see how slow build and creepy atmosphere can be done well *and* pays off with genuine scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh and refreshing look at a familiar subject.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to get around to viewing this film for the first time just the other day. And it is one of the most beautifully made movies of the past several years.As I viewed it, this film struck me quite quickly as a cross between "The Sixth Sense" (1999, M. Night Shyamalan) and "The Haunting" (1999, Jan de Bont). The eerie sound effects are reminiscent of the latter, with a plot that loosely follows the former (Grace's daughter Anne is able to see and talk with the spirits in the house, while Grace herself cannot see anything at first, much like Cole Sear and Bruce Willis in "Sixth Sense").The things that attract my attention in a movie aren't so much the dialogue, but the look of the film, the way it feels and flows and the way the actors portray themselves.The look of the film, just from looking at it, must have been very difficult to photograph in such low light. Although it features a production crew made up of people I've never heard of, they managed to put together a magnificent set and managed to be able to photography every single square inch of it. Photography was obviously well rehearsed, with the low-light visuals and excellent angles used throughout the film.The feeling of the film is very emotional and has a religious theme. It's really quite amazing to see how much influence religion has in horror/suspense films. The emotions flow primrily from Kidman, who excellently plays against her usual roles to play a very protective mother in 1945s post-WWII United Kingdom.The fact that Kidman looks a great deal like Grace Kelly was, if intended, a magnificent choice for the film. Grace Kelly, for those that don't know her, was a deeply family-oriented woman who even quit her movie career to dedicate herself to her new family shortly after marrying the crown prince of Monaco. In the movie, Kidman aggressively tries to keep her children in line and under control, and for the most part, succeeds.This is one of the most striking films I've seen in a long while. It's fresh and masterful approach to a familiar subject is a welcomed refreshment.</fullReview>

I haven't been so scared in my live, and then we all started to laugh at ourselfs for been so silly.But we weren't silly. This movie is scary, and the first Amenábar scary movie, but still with his touch of psycological thriller. If you haven't seen Open Your Eyes, at least you must have heard of Vanilla Sky, and God knows the Spanish versione is ten times better. And what about Thesis. I haven't seen it but a friend of mine did and he says "Es cagantísima" which means prety much that he was scared even thought he saw on the TV. Amenábar is a genious.As for The Others. Yeah, the ending is quite familiar, but indeed the movie is great. The performances, by ALL of them is great, but more especially when talking about Nicole Kidman and the girl who played Anne. The characters are so real, and even though there's still the ghost story element. The quite, dark atmosphere, and the way the director plays with the light makes umberable to live in that house, that gourgeus house I would kill to get for many reasons, and you understand Grace's actions when doing what she did.I thought she was a strong character, something a little like Scarlett O'Hara, some women that, having everything, has to survive through horrible things, but at the end she was weak -you'll understand after watching the movie- but lovely just the same.I love this movie. I bought it on DVD, not because of the scary parts but because of the Good Parts, which is how I call a movie I'd like watching more than once. And you americans just think that in here that DVD costs more than 50 bucks in several stores, and 45 in others.Judge it for what it is, not for what it should had been, what they told you it was, what you remember ir was (talking about the Sixth Sense), just sit down, scare the hell off, and judge it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching this film the first time, and enjoyed it even more the second. The acting was first rate with Nicole Kidman turning in a very intense performance. The rest of the cast did a great supporting job, adding greatly to the intensity of this story.I really liked the way the story slowly unraveled, it did not feel rushed and events seemed to happen very naturally. I found myself easily getting into the rhythm of this movie and was never bored even though there is very little real action.The only complaints I have deal with two specific scenes, the first is when the caretakers see Nicole K's character go off towards town. Instead of them speaking I would like to have seen the old lady just point at the headstone. The other is when the caretakers are in their attic room talking; again I would have preferred silence or just to cut the scene. In both cases I felt that less would have been more. Otherwise, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys well written, directed and acted suspense thrillers.-Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. I can't believe some of these reviews! they are totally off. This movie does not fail in any way. The acting was great, the scenes were so well made and the ending was a total shocker. I loved it. My husband was reluctant to see it but afterwards he couldn't stop recommending it to people. It makes you look at what you thought was one thing, but is really something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumphant American debut for Alejandro Amenabar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Alejandro Amenabar has burst onto the motion picture scene in a major way with this, his first American film. The Spanish auteur had already made a mark in Spain with `Abre Los Ojos', a film he wrote, directed and scored, which was remade four years later by Cameron Crowe as `Vanilla Sky', starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman's ex-husband who co-produced both films.This film is outstanding in almost every respect. With a microscopic budget of $17 million and one bankable star, Amenabar turned a great idea into a brilliant film. As he has in past films, he also composed the music, which is exceptionally powerful and a perfect fit for the story. There are few directors with the talent to write, direct and compose this effectively. It is even more impressive when you consider that he is barely 30 years old.Amenabar's use of shadow and light is phenomenal and he is extremely adroit at utilizing the camera to maximize the suspense. He is also very insightful in his direction of the actors. While Nicole Kidman is a veteran, the children are both in their first film and Amenabar elicits terrific performances from each.The story is elegant in its simplicity and the ending is difficult to predict. The use of the séance scene to flip the film on its ear is inspired, creating a defining moment by taking an indirect approach. He brings us a supernatural thriller that is scary without the need for blood and gore, making the most of what is unseen. Often compared with `Sixth Sense' because of the final plot twist, this film is better in most of its technical elements, despite being slightly less flashy in its presentation.As if Amenabar's genius weren't enough, Nicole Kidman kicks out the jams and delivers one of her best performances to date. She is utterly believable as Grace, the neurotically overprotective matriarch and mistress of the house. Her interaction with the children is exceedingly genuine, replete with nurturing affection and backbiting irritation at her daughter's perceived recalcitrance. Grace's daughter Anne is played by Alakina Mann who gives a phenomenal performance in her first film. Mann is sassy and stubborn and shows a strong backbone in the face of her oppressive mother. James Bentley, as her brother Nicholas, plays off Mann extremely well. Bentley's timidity and reliance on his sister creates a strong symbiosis between them that is extremely realistic.This is a fantastic thriller by a director with a very promising future. While the pacing is sometimes overly deliberate, the story, music, camerawork, and the acting are first rate. I rated it 9/10. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best films i have seen for quite a while. I was very surprised to see Eric Sykes in the film and he did quite well in the small part he had. But Nicole Kidman was outstanding and the two children excelled, and i don't think i have ever been so engrossed in the final 20 minutes of a film.It's just one of those films you want to talk about for ages after. If there is one fault, it is the part half way through when Christopher Eccleston appears as Kidmans husband. A bit pointless and they could have changed that part of the story a little.Apart from that, a great film and that should have been Kidmans OSCAR nomination. I bet you jump at the wardrobe bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Been Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to love this movie. Couldn't wait to see it. Didn't happen for me. One would think that excellent acting, directing, editing and design would be a shoo-in. The other commenters can deny this is re-worked material all they want, but it is. It is definitely an interpolated version of The Turn of the Screw (The Innocents) with a nod to Sixth Sense. Beautifully executed? Yes. But, AFTER, you see this movie, rent The Innocents and watch Deborah Kerr and those kids scare the hell out of you. If you're under 35 you may be surprised to find that, before the 80's and 90's, hollywood did make movies with great actors. Deborah Kerr was one of them. Henry James, author of The Turn of the Screw wrote this great novel long before special efx and wide-screens were even dreamed of. The Others is a good movie. The Innocents is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the BEST ghost stories ever done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the very few examples produced by Hollywood of how a great ghost story may be done without gore or cheesy special effects or dead teenagers or some ghoul jumping out of a dark corner to grab the heroine. As so many have said before, the film's story and script themselves are solid and compelling. The direction, acting, cinematography and editing are excellent. The suspense is genuine and the audience really feels for the characters and their emotions.If Freddy and Jason and the other slashers are your thing, then by all means stay away from this film as you will be disappointed that no one is cut or tortured or hunted down in a screaming mayhem to die a gruesome death. If, however, you want a true, old fashioned, ghost story with well developed characters and a mysterious plot, then you will love this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Film Making. Well Written &amp; Brilliantly Acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar (writer,director) has used all the appropriate elements (light &amp; dark, Noise &amp; silence, action &amp; reaction) as tools to create a masterpiece of film making. Using an Old English Mansion as the back drop to a ghost story maybe cliche'd, but it's meant to. This movie, like all great thrillers, works on our assumptions. And this is a great super-natural thriller. Amenabar's story is pure genius. It has been compared to the 1995 title 'Haunted' directed by Lewis Gilbert and starring Aidan Quinn. It has also been compared to M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' starring Bruce Willis. In my opinion 'The Others' makes the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' look Second Rate. The story, the directing, and the acting is far superior. Kidman is brilliant as the lead (In my opinion her best performance). And she is well supported by Flanigan, Sykes &amp; Eccleston. The children are played by Mann and Bentley and are quite remarkable. Especially Mann, who is going to be an absolute star (even bigger than Haley Joel). This Movie is an all-time classic. It deserved higher praise from the critics. If you enjoy quality film making you will like 'The Others'. Quite simply it leaves THE OTHER movies in this genre looking amateurish. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't ruin the movie for readers by revealing the ending and will simply say it's a shame it didn't do bigger "box office". In this wonderful piece, Kidman is scarily the reincarnation of Grace Kelly but even better an actress. She looks like Kelly, acts like Kelly but her actual performance surpasses anything Kelly ever did, in my opinion. I'm not sure when this movie would be Academy Award material, but it should be or should have been. I see no flaws in the movie whatsoever. Just fantastic performances by Kidman and the two children who play her kids--and the mansion staff. Also the photography is as perfect as it gets--lighting, angles, etc.--all simply incredible. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this an 11. It's a must-see shocker which also has extremely important current relevance. Once you've seen the movie, you'll know why I say that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possible unintended spoiler "guess" at twist ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of this date, 7/15/02, I have not seen THE OTHERS. It is on my list and since I loved THE TURN OF THE SCREW's film adaptation - THE INNOCENTS, and since this seems a similar set-up (strong woman, two children, ghosts), I do plan to see it.I have just read the first page of comments and all refer to a twist ending. My writer's brain has picked up the threads of the story without anyone revealing this twist. I have not read any reviews that reveal the twist nor have I read the original novel, so am completely in the dark. What I am going to attempt here is a "guess" - what would I have the twist be if I was handed this scenario and told to write a shocker ending??? Let's see if I'm right and if so or not, I'll post a new comment after I've seen it.For me the most obvious twist would be for the Kidman character, her children and servants to learn that they are the ghosts, not knowing they have died, and that the people who appear to them as ghosts are actually the living owners of the house.That's my guess - let's see if I'm right or close to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a truly dreadful film. The 'twist' wasn't remotely worth the effort of sitting through 2 hours, despite the moody cinematography. At no point did I care wat all what happened to any of the characters - such as they were - there was no development, just a succession of dull, static, but pretty figures. Making a film this futile surely takes talent, but is probably best done as a solo project, in the dark. Releasing it to the public does no-one any favours, except maybe for the creators and those viewers who need the painfully obvious spoon-feeding to them over the course of 120 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just plain great to watch a horror movie, where the horror isn't about violence, blood, intestines, monsters and big blokes running around in a hockey mask. In The Others the suspense is inherent in the plot and the characters - and that's what makes this a great, and scaring, horror movie. This is horror in the classic sense. On top of it all, Ms. Kidman (again, one dares to say) plays with superb talent and is extremely convincing as the neurotic, uptight, and religious housewife. Marvelous.THIS is why I love to go to the movies (and why I'm waiting for the DVD to come out on R2).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spooky ride of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OTHERS was written in the year 2000 by a Spanish guy named Alejandro Amenabar. Yes, the same guy who wrote the Spanish film that VANILLA SKY was based on. So, instead of just making a film that rips-off of THE SIXTH SENSE, he also makes it in Spanish, titling it "Los Otros". Touche!Nicole Kidman did an okay job of acting and we soon understand that her two children have the rarest of rare diseases. They are allergic to the light. So, when three mysterious servants arrive, strange things begin to happen. The cast is basically English, which is definitively odd since this film was written by a man of Spanish origins. The story moves along quickly and as everything is happening, it all seems to make sense. But then we wonder to ourselves, why is all this happening now? Why did it not happen years earlier? These questions are never explained and that is what helps make the film retched. Better examples of the genre would be the all-time classic, THE SIXTH SENSE, and many more consisting of WHAT LIES BENEATH, DRAGONFLY, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES and about a hundred others. In fact, most of the above films are somehow cliched in the film, so that might be where the title came from. THE OTHERS can mean that the film is consisted of stolen material from "other" movies. But, that is only my interpretation. See it for yourself and see what you think. It is okay on a level of spookiness and chills. But that is about it. There are some creepy twists and turns which help the story stay thrilling enough to keep the viewers awake, but after it is over, you will be wondering the same very questions that I was. THE OTHERS: 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS IS A FILM YOU'LL REMEMBER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would dare to say that one of the best films of the last decade is `The Others'. `The Others' has a very interesting and original plot. It tells the story of a young mother who lives with her two photosensitive children in a house, somewhere in England, after World War II. After the arrival of three servants, the family starts to suspect that the house which has to be kept in darkness because of the kids' illness is inhabited by an other family. In other words it's haunted. What I enjoyed the most about this movie is first of all the unexpected, totally unforeseen ending which really renovates the horror film genre. The performances of the whole cast and especially of leading actress Nicole Kidman are natural but brilliant. The photography with its game between `light and darkness' is excellent and the settings are perfectly attached to the chronological period represented. The mysterious, sentimental score and the well balanced direction of Alehandro Amenambar give this film its unique atmosphere. This is undoubtedly a film worth seeing as it combines drama with horror. The movie leaves us with a bitter taste afterwards and questions which remain unsolved. What it teaches us for sure is that hell - if it really exists - is never the Others. What scares us the most is the ability of human beings to cause terrible pain to those whom they love most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic thriller in every sense of the term</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" delivers on the promise of its trailer: a well-directed and well-acted Gothic with plenty of frights. All the elements are there: an old mansion inhabited by mysterious people, strange, possibly supernatural events, and tons of red herrings and camera tricks.On the other hand, it's also a Gothic in that it's thoroughly predictable.Nicole Kidman is excellent as Grace, a reclusive war widow (or is she?) who seems to be walking the edge between sanity and madness. She is extremely protective of her children, who suffer from a rare skin condition (or do they?) that condemns them to life at home in the dark. Just days after the servants "disappeared," along come three mysterious new servants, who dress in the clothing of another century. Then, unexplainable things start to happen.Sounds great, right? All except the predictability bit. I'm not going to reveal the much-hyped "big twist ending," but I will say that if you are a fan of "Twilight Zone" reruns it will be no twist to you. In fact, you'll have it figured out in the first twenty minutes. Not that director Alejandro Amenábar hasn't created a wonderfully moody picture. Many of his camera tricks are right out of "Halloween" (the first one), but they are still effective. Kidman is alternately likable, sexy and creepy, and it's always refreshing to see child actors who can "really" act. But if you rent this, expect a great buildup with a disappointing final half hour.</fullReview>

There are just enough characters to keep it all interesting, and the old mansion and outdoor scenery make for some great cinematography for the time period (WWII).

The emotional development of the story is deliberate and thoughtful while the supernatural logistics of the story seem kind of arbitrary, and that kind of undercuts the final punch of the plot - the suspense is strong but the explanations are invariably weak. Themes of penance and spiritual absolutism introduced at the start don't quite make it to the finish line, at least not explicitly enough. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend but the weaknesses made themselves known the second time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole Kidman delivers, the movie does not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OTHERS is certainly one of the best-looking ghost movies in years. Rich with atmosphere, you easily feel as if you really are inside a WW2-era English mansion. Without a doubt, the atmosphere is the next best thing in the movie besides Nicole Kidman. She scores a bullseye with her performance as a mother of two young children living in a mansion on one of the English Channel islands, a mansion which appears to be haunted. Her daughter claims to have seen some of the spirits, and the new team of helpers who have arrived know more than they're letting on.Unfortunately, the well-set up film fails to deliver. The story meanders seemingly forever, and I can't even recall how many times I found myself glancing at the clock to see how much time had passed during the first thirty minutes alone. The pacing is terrible. Some scenes go on too long. Others just fail to be effective. The suspense is almost non-existent with the possible exception of a few moments here and there, but even then it's rather lackluster, with only some good performances to keep you awake.Alakina Mann and James Bentley are good as the kids, though why must one of them always be a little brat who likes to torment the other and mouth off? It's getting tiresome. Fionnula Flanagan is the next best element of the film, but otherwise, there's not much to get out of the movie. The story drags and drags until the final ten minutes or so when things finally began to pick up, only to lead to a twist ending that (while unexpected) seems just as much of a cop-out as the ending to THE SIXTH SENSE. Thanks to that overrated film, ghost story movies now feel they must offer a "shocking twist ending." At best, this could have worked as a short film of about fifteen or twenty minutes. But as it is, it's just like THE SIXTH SENSE: nice to look at, but ultimately completely unsatisfying.</fullReview>

The pace and intensity was good, but this idea has been done before, eh? And all too recently to be overlooked. Most other copies have waited a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler ahead!!!Alejandro Amenabar has said in interviews that he wrote "The Others" in 1998, one year before The Sixth Sense was released.If this is true, it must have been very frustrating to him. Now everybody will compare his movie to the 6th Sense, and label it as unoriginal.Anyway, I find this film better; While in "The Others" the ghosts are cute... in the other you have Bruce Willis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE OTHERS is devilishly good entertainment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a woman awaiting the return of her husband who has been at war for years. Her children are eerily allergic to sunlight and the curtains must always been closed. Whenever you leave a room, make sure the door you just closed is locked, before entering into the next room. When three mysterious people show up for a job as servants in Grace's isolated estate, disturbances begin...a family can be seen by the children, the mother sees strange appartions, and all together they can sense the industructable powers of evil! This lavish production contains sensational acting along with a mind-blowing script, eerie sets and a haunting score. With a wicked twist of an ending, THE OTHERS will shock, thrill, scare and terrify anyone who is afraid of the living dead...and the living. Since THE OTHERS is on video and DVD now, I suggest that anyone rent it and then purcase it to keep for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is movie is one of the best I have seen in the thriller-genre. All actors do an amazing job, thoroughly directed by the young director Alejandro Amenábar from Chile.What Amenábar uses instead of computer graphics and explosions, is the art of being subtle. Things are often more frightening when you don't see them, but can only sense them or hear them. The movie itself is very brilliant visually, and Amenábar has made the eerie music that goes with it, too.Though the story takes place on a british island in 1945, the location (a house) was found in northern Spain. The house, that is the 'frame' of the whole story, had to have some gothic elements without being a stand-out cliché. The house they found was perfect for this story. One final thing I have to praise, is the acting of Nicole Kidman, but also of the 2 children. Alakina Mann and James Bentley acts so naturally, that one can not help believing their characters and being swept into their tiny world. This movie is a modern classic that will have a special place in my heart forever. An absolute 'must' for thriller-fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Others" is an old-fashioned ghost story in every sense of the word. It does not rely on graphic violence, but on atmosphere. Notice that for the duration of the film, the setting is always foggy and dreary, one of the time-honored spook staples. While there are some creepy scenes every now and then, none of it is showy or special effects-laden. It's surprisingly minimalist for a modern horror film, taking the "less-is-more" approach. When something otherworldly happens, it's usually off-camera; giving us the eerie feeling of unknowable things happening just around the corner or above our heads. Have you ever been alone in a dark house at night, and had the feeling that unseen, scary things were around you? That is the feeling that "The Others" tries to evoke; while the viewer rarely sees anything, the power of imagination goes a long way. There is an interesting deviation from convention: darkness is a friend, light is the enemy. If we are honest with ourselves, we will agree that--in a way--we feel the same way when watching a horror film; dark, gloomy scenes are just more interesting than bright settings. Nicole Kidman gives the best performance, needless to say. She successfully runs the gamut of emotions, from love to anger, faith to doubt, calm to panicky; all these emotional transitions are accomplished without ever striking a false note. The best supporting performance comes from Fionnula Flanagan, whose quite strength and grace provides an effective counterbalance to Kidman's hysteria. Alakina Mann also comes off well as the independently-spirited daughter. The remainder of the cast turns in decent work. I doubt that "The Others" would have been financially successful, at least to the degree that it was, without the presence of Nicole Kidman. However, it's not just a "star vehicle." It's an honest, legitimate ghost story that just happens to have a name actress; quite frankly, I can't imagine anyone else in the role. Much has been made of the twist ending; I won't reveal it here, but in retrospect, it was inevitable. As a whole, the film does a solid job in achieving its stated goal. It isn't one of the horror greats, but it works.*** (out of ****)Released by Dimension Films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why, but I had rather low expectations of this film. I was definitely pleasantly surprised. I still wouldn't say this was a terribly great movie. It was good, but nothing great. I'm actually VERY shocked that this film made it into IMDB's top 250.Also, I must admit that the film was MUCH better on the second viewing, perhaps it gets even better on the third time around. I'll have to test that theory one of these days.The acting is pretty good for all the cast members, Nicole Kidman being the only cast-member that I've previously heard of. Although, I did recognize Christopher Eccleston (Charles Stewart) from "Gone in Sixty Seconds", but I certainly didn't know him by name when I first saw the film.The story is quite interesting and takes a very interesting route of telling the story. There is a number of similarities between this film and "The Sixth Sense", but I think I must concede that this film is pretty good in it's own right. The only complaint about the story in the film is, I didn't like that the children had this weird photosensitive disease. Does this condition ACTUALLY exist? I can't imagine it does. But you know the saying, sometimes Fact is stranger than Fiction. The children having this condition does work quite well with the story, so maybe I should just accept it.If you're into creepy/strange/odd/ghostly movies like "The Sixth Sense", then you'll probably like this film too. I would have a tough time saying this film is for everyone, but like I said, if you're into creepy movies, then you may want to take a peak. Anyhow, hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody, intriguing Gothic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kidman gave the second half of her one-two punch of 2001 (the other being "Moulin Rouge", of course) in this Gothic thriller. She stars as a wan, highly detailed and regimented mistress of a huge, virtually abandoned mansion on the island of Jersey in 1945. Her husband has gone to war and has not been heard from. She and her two young children are joined by a trio of servants just as strange sounds and occurrences begin to happen in the house. The children suffer from a rare (and real) disease that causes them to be sheltered at all times from harsh light. Before long, it becomes clear that something mystifying and disturbing is happening in the house. The film hinges on several things...the vision of its director (who wrote, directed and composed the music!), the atmospheric cinematography/sets and Kidman's striking performance. Clad in well-tailored dresses and with a Grace Kelly-esque hair-do (he character's name is even Grace), she makes a stunning figure in the claustrophobic and sometimes creepy surroundings. She does a magnificent job in the role (though to nitpick, her accent doesn't always stay in line with the character) and the audience is along for the ride almost immediately. She is matched by a terrific Flanagan as a wise, yet enigmatic servant. The children are also very solid and expressive. Eccleston makes a brief appearance, looking something like a more ravaged Ralph Fiennes if he'd starred in "The English Mental Patient". There are a few times in which the pace might seem that it could use a shove, but the overall texture and feel of the film is based on a deliberate mood which is set by this pace. Some people may be able to see one or more of the twists coming, but regardless, it is fun and suspenseful getting to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being Australian I have been a huge fan of Nicole Kidman since the early 80s. Since the 90s she hasn't been able to show the world what she could do as her performances in some Aussie movies and mini series were absolutely mesmerising - Dead Calm, Bangkok Hilton, just to name a few.Last year she stepped out of the shadows with her brilliant role in Moulin Rouge and now with The Others, she's finally showcasing her talents.The Others is not a film to watch alone. I love movies like this one where you don't know what to expect or how it'll end and this certainly didn't disappoint and it definitely sends chills down your spine.The performances of her children were wonderful as well and I think Nicole should've been nominated for an Oscar for this film as well.Definitely one of the best films of 2001 and one not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling supernatural jigsaw that really grabs the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best chillers to emerge in the modern era, this moody and nerve shredding tale is well worth anyones time to watch. It combines an intricate story line with wonderful ensemble acting and intensly moody direction. The plot borrows some of it's neater twists from other recent Hollywood ventures into the supernatural and the visual style is very much that of Hitchcock (Kidman bears an uncanny visual resemblance to Grace Kelly in REAR WINDOW for instance)but the sheer strength of story and performances are what you will remember most. Kidman, playing an upper class English woman, with considerable conviction, only lets the cut glass accent slip slightly here and there. Her character's increasingly frantic situation draws out a career best performance with it's wide eyed incredulity and overbearing religeous zeal. The children she so desparately tries to protect (they have a lethal allergic sensitivity to daylight so live behind closed curtains) are both superbly portrayed, a rare occurrence for such young English actors who, as a rule seldom behave as naturally on screen as their American contemporaries (and I say this as an Englishman born and bred). The curious trio of servants who arrive apparently looking for work at the beginning of the film never seem quite "right" and this aspect is central to the story itself. In fact nothing seems to be quite as it should be, from the continual foggy weather to the piano that plays itself - or does it?. This clever, and subtle displacement of reality keeps the viewer guessing constantly throughout. Just what IS going on here? Of course it all becomes clear at the end in time honored style and you will either pat yourself on the back for having worked in out or kick yourself for not doing so.Either way it will be satisfying. In this respect it's a film that has combined the elements of both a classic whodunnit and a supernatural chiller with great success. Are the children really at risk from the light? Are the servants working to some hidden agenda? Has the lead character become divorced from reality behind those closed curtains, alone with her dependant children and her deep religious beliefs ? Just why did the previous staff walk out and what has happened to the father who went off to war and has yet to return?Perhaps the sense of time and place isn't quite achieved. The location is the island of Jersey, shortly after it's liberation from years of Nazi occupation but aside from a few references to power cuts and having to make do, this could be anywhere at almost anytime from the 1920's to the 1950's. The whole film is set in and around a large country house and the fog keeps out any picture postcard scenery, the staff don't have local accents or backgrounds that we are aware of and such things as fuel and food rationing are never even refered to, although they would have been very much a part of life at the time.Aside from that it's a rattling good yarn and the small cast are all convincing in their roles. The atmosphere is built up strongly from the very beginning and it's carefully paced to keep the viewer thinking all the time without becoming bored at any point, even if things do, by design develop very slowly throughout. Top marks to all concerned, a film that has lived up to it's word-of-mouth reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens when the cork's in too tight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is not a typical horror flick. Instead of scaring us with the dark deeds of Lucifer and his minions, as is typical, it takes us into the personal hell of a devout believer, who has managed to create her own damnation out of the very fabric of her religion and faith. And it's so effective because we've all known people like that. Some of us can identify with her, having lived life in a similar religious hell. It's a gripping story about someone who thinks of her supreme being as an angry, vindictive old bastard. She creates her personal reality out of this fundamental, unexamined assumption. The main character's name, Grace, is a beautiful irony: she has no grace with herself, or others, which is, ostensibly, the essence of her faith.Adroitly played by Nicole Kidman, Grace is a woman oppressed by religiously induced fantasies about what should and shouldn't be, to the extent that, when it isn't so, which is most of the time, her pious aspect shows its righteous and terrible wrath. She's a `pocket' angry deity, a miniature Jesus of the book of Revelation, p***ed off, with a sword and a big white horse and eyes blazing and just itching to raise whoop-jamboreehoo against the ungodly. Though a clever woman, her mental abilities lie dormant on the fallow ground of `thou shalts' and `thou shalt nots,' which she uncritically absorbs from her blessed catechisms. Not only does she torment herself with externally derived notions of personal perfection, but she persecutes everyone else with her anally conscientious moral rectitude. If she showed up at your office cocktail party, you'd probably find yourself on the opposite side of the room. She just has the cork in way too tight.We ask ourselves throughout the film, `What's with this obsession?' And then we find out with the movie's surprise ending, which, I confess, caught me like a good left hook. Wham. Right on the chin. It's a very clever variation on an old theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning, this is more of a Trumpeting review. Not much story line or other such discussion here.This movie was great! In my opinion it is tied with Sixth Sense as the best movie of it's type. The ending is as good as Sixth Sense where it really all hits you at once, and there is not much chance of guessing it using foresight.A good friend of mine pretty much summed up my current feeling on movies: The longer the movie goes before you "get it" the better the movie is; until the ending, where if you don't "get" everything, it becomes a very bad movie.Following that line of thinking I think it is one of the best movies lately. However, about half of the people that I have talked to now, I have had to explain the ending. My guess is that if you "get" the end, you will put it along with your favorite movies, otherwise you will feel like you have wasted your time.I would have compare the movie along the lines of "Sixth Sense" for it's general direction, and surprise ending. The ending however is as good as movies like "Momento", "The Game", and other movies where you never quite know what you are in for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political/historical metaphors in the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie -- I'm not going to offer any spoilers or subjective criticisims about the style or look of the movie. I'm not going to compare it to the Sixth Sense or to the old Hitchcock movies either. What struck out at me the most ALL THROUGHOUT the film was the political and historical undertones that served as a subtext to the action and dialogue of the characters. The film takes place right after World War II - in Ireland - during the period that the British Empire was beginning to see the restlessness of its colonies and the rumblings for independence. It is unmistakable that Kidman's character can be likened to that of the imperial British Empire, which no matter how hard it tries, cannot shelter or protect Her colonies forever. For Grace, she is beginning to lose control of her life and the authority she holds over shielding her kids from the outside world. Her son and daughter play the roles of the long-suffering colonies under the British autocracy. Then along come 3 wise old 'veterans' who can see what's in store because they remember from the past. They are akin to the revolutionaries and free-thinkers of the colonies that try to cry out for freedom and independence. After World War II, Britian's empire (like Grace and her family) was dying or perhaps already dead. With the independence of Her colonies, Britain was beginning to come to grips of their "new" role in an "old" world (Grace's vast mansion). Whether you buy into my crack-pot idea or not, you should still see the movie. DO NOT watch it in hopes of gory special effects or teen-slasher elements. Watch it rather for some genuine suspense, sharp dialogue, brilliant cinematography, and a stunning score. Rule Britannia</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're creepy and they're spooky....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems like when folks talk about the good old days of movies, they talk about movies that made you think, movies that scared you not by showing you something scary but by not showing you something at all. The fear of the unknown, conventional wisdom holds, is the ultimate fear. We do not fear the dark because it is dark; we fear it because of what it masks.The Others harkens back to those oldtime scary movies, a haunted house movie that answers some questions, invites many more, and always keeps you on the very cusp of collapsing into hysterics. It's not just a neat ghost story told well; it's practically dripping with atmosphere.Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a gigantic old mansion with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, waiting for her husband to return from World War II. The kids have developed a sort of photosensitivity disease, and cannot be exposed to any light more than that of a candlelight. This leads to the house being shrouded in darkness much of the time, and Grace even goes so far as to direct that no door may be opened without the previous door being closed, so as to prevent extra light from shining on the children.Grace hires a troika of housekeepers and handyman to help around the house and with the kids, but the three older people seem... well, a little off to her. And soon the Stewarts come to believe they are not at all alone in the expansive manse, as daughter Anne insists she has seen and spoken to a little boy named Victor.Who's behind the spectre appearances? Is it the hired help? Are the kids fibbing to their stern mother? Or is it all in the mind of Grace herself? Adding to the confusion is the return of Mr. Stewart to the house - like the help, he seems more than a little bit off-center. What is going on?The mood is positively eerie, and it's accomplished by a pronounced lack of musical accompaniment. In most horror movies, one hears a melodramatic chord or two, leading up to the victim being slaughtered. Not in The Others. Silence is deadly and heightens the tension and suspense immeasurably.This is probably Kidman's finest work, and in my mind it mostly erases the painful memory of watching her attempt to act in Eyes Wide Shut. Stripped of the baggage known as Tom Cruise, Kidman is simply superb, mesmerizing the viewer to the point of feeling a deep empathy for her plight. The plot's no slouch, either, full of twists, including an incredible denouement. As ghost stories go, The Others is one of the best I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a thriller worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the teen horror flick genre was revived in the mid 90s by the success of Scream and its many imitators, Hollywood has in turn again found a market for the sophisticated horror thriller. The Others fits into the sophisticated horror thriller category that brought instant success to The Sixth Sense writer and director M. Night Shyamalan.Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, a lady of leisure in a big estate house in Jersey, England, who has two children suffering a disease which makes them ultra sensitive to sunlight. Her husband has gone off to fight the war and her domestic staff has deserted her. The children live under strict supervision and must not be touched by sunlight, otherwise they will die. When new domestic staff arrives, the threesome find strange things occurring in their house and their day to day regime is threatened. The story unfolds slowly but with enough tension to keep you wondering about the varying motives of Grace Stewart and the domestic staff. The late great director Alfred Hitchcock would have been delighted with the dark set pieces and the visual nuances, including the swirling fog that constantly enshrouds the country house. However, it is also highly likely the master film maker would have tied up a few of the loose ends that do take a little bit away from The Others. Kidman is great as the seemingly neurotic mother, while Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who play Anne and Nicholas Stewart, make good feature film debuts as the scared young children. Bentley in particular looks authentically frightened during the entire film. Outstanding British actor Eric Sykes, who plays the gardener, gives an excellently understated performance as the working partner to nanny Bertha Mills (played by Fionnula Flannigan). The Others has been compared, sometimes unfavourably, to The Sixth Sense, and in many ways it is very similar as the story unwinds and the characters come to terms with their fate. Maybe it's not as good as The Sixth Sense, as predictability and a number of indifferent scenes remove some of the drama, but this does not take away from the wonderfully eerie aspect created by the old British tradition of a haunted country house. Definitely one to watch on a cold, dark night.</fullReview>

In and of itself, this bodes well (so to speak- for the viewer, at any rate): likening THE OTHERS to classic fright films based on classic written works automatically elevates it to a height most fright films (unfortunately) never even ASPIRE to, let alone attain. Ambiance can be EVERYTHING in a fright film- hence, the term- but, all too often, the alleged "auteurs" prove themselves more "hack" than visionary. Fortunately for filmgoers, director Amenabar is one of the more gifted young filmmakers now plying their trade. (Should Dan Curtis again resurrect DARK SHADOWS, it might prove a wise move to enlist the aid of the capable Amenabar.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this on its DVD release. It was her choice not mine and at the time felt it wouldnt be something that would hold my attention. How wrong I was. Easily the best film I saw in year 2001 I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a film with a great plot as opposed to all out action.It is essentially a story of woman who believes that the house she and her two children live in (just after the 2nd world war)is also inhabited by ghosts.Watch it and prepare to be blown away by its twisty,turny final 15 minutes.Mark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RIVETING AND ASTONISHING!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the most suspenseful and thrilling films I have ever seen. Nicole Kidman gives the performance of her career as a suspected widow in 1945 England. She lives alone with her two children or so she thinks. She begins to realize that what her daughter is saying, that they are "others" living in the house with her, may be right. There is one problem. They cant leave the house. Dense scary fog and photosensitive diseases make the children unable to evacuate. They are allergic to sunlight. Three suspicious servants arrive that make the plot full of even more twists. This was an excellent masterpiece with one of the most shocking endings that have ever been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just rented this movie because of all the good reviews, and it is terrible. it is incredibly slow, and almost nothing good happens. the only redeeming point in the movie is shown in the previews when Nicole Kidman's daughter turns into a 90 year old woman and says, "are you mad? i am your daughter!", and when you see Nicole Kidman undressing, and even that was disappointing. other than those moments, this movie was a total waste of time and money. i hope nobody sees this movie with any high hopes, or you will be extremely disappointed. for your own sake, avoid this movie. unless you like bad movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings??? Ha! This was the best movie from that year, hands down...better than Moulin Rouge, Monster's Ball, Shrek, In the Bedroom, A Beautiful Mind and all the rest. Many people have compared this movie to The Sixth Sense, but note: this movie was written BEFORE the Sixth sense ever came out. Alejandro had this eerie little gem planned for years, which makes it even more of a marvel.This is also the superior movie because of the all-around great acting that Sixth Sense lacked in places. Fioluanna Flanagan -- an all-time underrated character actress -- plays the maid with stunning precision. Compare this to her other great "maid" role in the TV movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden. And Eric Sykes as the bumbling-yet-creepy Mr. Tuttle does extremely well, delivering the movie's funniest line...you'll know what I'm talking about. It's made hilarious simply because of his pitch-perfect delivery.Also, these child actors, Akina Mann &amp; James Bentley, are unbelievable -- I kept wondering where on earth the casting director found them. They're sort of a dark version of the Mary Poppins kids and every bit as good if not better. Bentley, especially, manages to be cute and terrified without also coming across as annoying and over-the-top like other, more-acclaimed child actors.Nicole Kidman is gorgeous here. She's really hot. Besides that, I do believe Kidman's performance here is inferior to the role in Moulin Rogue -- people simply think this one is better because it's a dramatic film (most people do not realize how hard it is to do comedy well, let alone musical-comedy). In fact, this movie is more of a dramatic chilly family melodrama that horror. It's not really scary or even suspenseful; that is, even if you figure out what's going on early on, the tension and the dramatic storyline will still keep you watching, as happened to my best friend when we saw it. However you count it, Kidman is definitely a goddess, starring in the two best movies to come out of one year. The Others is just well-done, nothing fancy, but with a few brief moments that will have you screaming at the screen. Well-acted, extremely well-written (very, very rare nowadays), and brilliantly directed...this is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Amenabar film that leaves you at the edge of your seat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OTHERS is the greatest example of the limit of human creativity. Alejandro Amenabar is clearly one of the best directors in the world. Not only because he can create the excelent climax of horror film, because he can go pass the teenager masked killer films and give the horror gender a whole new definition.This movie belongs to the Amenabar style, as proved in Abre Los Ojos, another excelent high recommended movie, because the resolution is only at the end of the film and not everybody is who they seem to be. The plot is around Grace Stewart ( Nicole Kidman ) and her two children( Alakina Mann and James Bentley ). The children have a misterious condition that doesn't allowe them to be exposed to any light. That is why their house is dark, and lonely. Her husband is off to war and the servants dissapear. Thats when Ms Mills ( Fionnula Flanagan )arrives to serve in the house and a series of events lead them to believe the house is haunted by evil spirits.This is clearly one of the best movies of the decade, and the best horror movie ever. I am glad that I've found a movie that doesn't include a masked killer, a young girl tormented by him, and low quality special effects.Nicole Kidman appears in one of her most impressive roles of the year, with Moulin Rouge. The children are impressive actors, it's very surprising; it is a revelation to find such good actors that are KIDS these days. And Flanagan is an excelent actress as Mills. This is the final statements. THE OTHERS the best horror movie ever, one of the greatest Amenabar's movies. Hello good horror, goodbye bad teenage films and ugly sequels.THE END</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited when I saw that Mr. "Open Your Eyes" had also written and directed this film. I saw the preview before "Moulin Rouge" last summer and it literally had the hair standing up on my arm. I guess the most thrilling part coming when the little girl says "are you mad, I am your daughter." I finally got my chance to watch the film on DVD last night and I ended up confused as to whether this film was very good or just better than average.I thought the acting and setting were top notch. From Nicole Kidman, to the children, and all the way to the house help were outstanding. This film had my attention all the way through, probably due to the fact that this is without a doubt one of the scariest movies to come out in years. I am a big horror fan, but most horror films are not scary. I made it almost a whole year without anyone giving the ending away, which the movie company let everyone know about a twist in the film. I had my apprehensions about what was going to transpire, but there are so many turns before you get there that you are too confused to know what will really happen.I came away feeling sad. Being a parent, and this films take on what occurs as being just a usual happening, this film touched me deep inside. Maybe it is a usual happening, but I do not like to think about it. I found the whole film to be better than average, but not very good to excellent as other imdb users have voted it. The whole movie was complete and thorough. The cinematography and country setting were beautiful, which does improve a films worth. I will always be interested in this writer/directors projects, as he is a master of the shock ending, confusing until you have no clue as to what's really going on. Well worth the watch. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar is going to be one to watch in the future and may we all (movie-lovers and not)wish him a long fruitful life to give us this sweet end of entertainment. For the reader who doesn't know, he is the writer/director of some other great films already rated in the tops of all time at the ripe old age of thirty (such as Abre los ojos-"open your eyes"-which so inspired and captured Cameron Crowe, writer/director of "Almost Famous" etc. etc., that he rewrote it for American audiences in "Vanilla Sky"). Not that emulation is any form of flattery or what have you...Anyway, I'm not going to blab on to talk about the movie, but just wanted to note the originality and unique ideas that are coming out of this exciting mind. Couple a little originality with some sound solid acting and voila, we can step away from the mundane without too much of an art house feel that steps away from reality. Unless you're already jaded and watch movies like this saying "challenge me" to yourself in your seat--just try it, you'll like it!</fullReview>

I had expected it to be a standard, entertaining, scary/jumpy film but was surprised to find that it was far more clever than that.It does a very good job of keeping your interest throughout despite being based almost entirely in one house, and the acting is very good by all the characters.The end is what makes this film though, just when you think you have it all worked out they hit you with a class story twist that really does make sense. You are left feeling very satisfied with the whole thing.A very well thought out film that ranks up there with Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No Spoilers here -My first impression of this title was "oh, another Kidman movie". But my girlfriend asked if I could pick it up on my way over and I though "what the heck, I'll watch it".I was very surprised. I have never seen a more thrilling, spooky, chilling performance from this (IMPO) overrated actress. Her character comes across as a truly overbearing tyrant of her house (by necessity) in a post WWI environment. She guides the viewer through the house and reveals her story to us piece by piece building anticipation and the 'creepy' factor until you find yourself making excuses to get up to go to the fridge just to take a break.The house is filled with tension from more than the story line, the children have a condition that restricts them to darkened rooms, and Grace (Kidman) constructs an elaborate door opening/closing method to keep the sunlight away from them. Which always leaves you thinking about the doors... and which ones are open.You are a prisoner of the house just as Grace and the children are, walking the halls and discovering what the house holds in it's secret darkness - and who is looking for you on the other side.Kidman and company excel at bringing the viewer into the world of 'The Others', and when the movie was over, I stayed up late to watch it again.Many kudos to Kidman for her performance, which was only possible due to the superb portrayal of the children and servants. Leave 'The Peacemaker', 'Batman Forever', and *shudder* 'Eyes Wide Shut' behind... this ones a keeper.</fullReview>

She is very protective of her children, considering they suffer from a rare malady that forces them to refrain from sunlight. However, the arrival of a trio of servants begets the arrival of some sinister forces, and her world starts to unravel.

		<fullReview>The Others is a very well executed film. The script andperformances are near-flawless. However, the suspense is sodrawn out that it keeps you guessing until you are forced to figureout the big secret. The clues are too overwhelming and obvious toignore. My wife and I had figured out the secret before the film washalf over.My other main complaint about this movie pertains to the treatmentof Nicole Kidman's character (SPOILER). The movie seemed tobe a little overly-sympathetic to an admitted child murderer. Canyou imagine the reaction if someone made a movie with SusanSmith as the sympathetic heroine? It would be outrageous.My only other complaint was that it seemed that Nicole Kidman'scharacter had learned nothing from her family tragedy. Even as aghost she encourages her children in their denial: "This house isours." Will she ever learn? Personally, I find her character quiteunsympathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is a great film, excellent in every way. Every now and then something truly outstanding comes along and so it was with The Others. Nicole Kidman, quite possibly the most beautiful woman of our time, checked her ego at the door and dressed down to portray a depressed war widow with two young children. The mood and atmosphere are perfect and one waits with eager anticipation the next offering of the film's young director, Alejandro Amenabar. The time is just after World War II and the place is a gloomy house sitting in the mist of the Jersey Isle. One is reminded of Wuthering Heights with the constant sense of Gothic dread and unease which Amenabar so capably created. Grace's (Kidman) children are ultra sensitive to light and the house must be kept dark at all times, a point which Grace hammers home to the new house servants who unexpectedly show up at her doorstep to offer their services. It seems they have worked in this house before and know it well -- too well as we soon see. Grace's daughter claims to see visions of others in the house and Grace worries about her emotional health. The daughter is precocious, her son unhealthily timid and it is obvious Grace is a very burdened woman. Grace becomes convinced that the house is indeed haunted and the suggestions of hauntings are what make this film a masterpiece. Unexplained sounds, sightings, shadows and timely creaking doors come along at just the right time. By the film's last few minutes, we have learned about the mysterious house servants and Grace's husband. We are now on the threshold of learning a dark secret and experiencing an interesting plot twist. The use of shadows, lighting, sound, music and the body movement of the players (I have not mentioned what a fine supporting cast appears with Ms. Kidman, another important reason this is such a fine film) bring back memories of the conventional haunted house stories of days gone by. 21st century technology is an asset, not a burden here, and that is, sadly, not always the case. It is interesting to note also that The Others is every bit as atmospheric viewed in your living room as it was on the theatre big screen and that is a credit to Amenabar's skill. You may even say his genius, because this is one fine piece of work. It may very well be that this becomes his signature offering, for it will be very difficult for him to top The Others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Others' comes from a short line of well made, serious-horror films since the early years of cinema history. It scared me! It filled me with awe as to the power and effectiveness of film (today, many filmmakers are truly clueless) Among these aforementioned serious films are `The Uninvited,' `The Innocents' (based on Henry James' novelette `The Turn of the Screw') and, most recently, `The Sixth Sense.' `The Uninvited' (itself a film based on Dorothy Macardle's novel, `Uneasy Freehold') offered a plot twist (one good ghost, one bad) at the end of the story, answering the audience's possible question, ?why is the ghost trying to kill her beloved, living daughter?' `The Innocents' were motherless children (one boy, one girl) who, suppressing their knowledge of the possibility of ghosts ended in the death of one of them, somewhat indirectly, at the hands of their governess, a sexually frustrated, yet well-meaning heroine.Along came `The Others.' This is a clever reworking of ?Turn of the Screw' (the ?governess' here is now the children's religious, overprotective mother) and continues the cleverness in plotting, as seen in `The Sixth Sense."Watching `The Others' I quickly realized that the director relishes good, old-fashioned ghost stories, and doesn't make a habit of insulting the general intelligence of his audience. Throughout the production, we are given hints as to the very super-nature of the narrative (the fact that the curtains must always remain closed, hints at the metaphor of the mother's unwillingness to ?see the light' of the truth).The ?Others' cast rises to the transcendental occasion. Flanagan is a seasoned stage veteran, and years ago appeared in the excellent television horror film `The Legend of Lizzie Borden,' here again playing a house servant. Doesn't the young actress (playing the mute girl ghost) look something like Anna Paquin (although I know she's not her)?Like "The Innocents," the adult, female lead character walks alone about the mansion, night surrounding her, carrying a candle-holder and expecting... Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll end this review here, I've said too much already!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb and scary thriller, yet there is no gore, no bloodshed. In fact, there's barely a ghost to be seen, and yet, you sit in your living room scared to death the entire time the film roles. Nicole Kidman stars as as the strict and fearful Grace Stewart, who, along with her two children, live and wait in a huge, old, spooky estate house, for her husband to return from the war. Her servants have inexplicably run off in the middle of the night, although the children think they were frightened away. Enter three new servants who "just happen" to be looking for work and the fun and the spooks begin. Alakina Mann is completely plausible as Kidman's daughter, who tries to convince her possibly psychotic mother that the house is haunted. Kidman's performance is absorbing and chilling, as Grace tries to figure out if the house is really haunted and if so, by whom. Are the children playing jokes? Are the new servants trying to scare Grace and the children away? Or, is she simply going mad (again)? Add to this a surprise ending and you'll be starting the disc over or rewinding the VCR to watch it again. This is truly a downright good and scary movie that doesn't succumb to the use of gore or violence seen in so many "thrillers" today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read many of the comments on this movie and while they don't "spoil" the story completely, they do make too many references to other movies, one in particular, which could make the impact of this story less effective. I think The Others is unique. When you consider how predictable storylines are today, after seeing this one you'd have to give it some credit. I give it a lot of credit. And, this is on the story alone. The movie is beautiful. The use of lighting is fantastic. Pay attention to the scenes in the dark, especially when Kidman is carrying a candle while searching for the others. The candle could not possibly create the lighting you see. To me it's like a painter on a canvas with the light, but it's transparent and skillful, so you hardly notice it. It's difficult for me to explain. It's unapologetic and true to life, the story and the occurrences, which I find rare in film today, especially in the States. There are no judgements on what happens or what happened in the storyline. The ideas of morality and good and bad seem to be dead and buried once the movie ends. This makes the story even more chilling. There are no clear-cut endings or explanations. This is why I find it so good. It seems the majority of the viewing public want popular justice and easily understandable and predictable endings and plots. The references to this movie being like another movie, I think, are true because the stories are of a similar topic, but more importantly because they're both powerfully independent and true to themselves. You know when you see these films because they affect you profoundly and are difficult to shake off. You find yourself thinking about them for days and watching multiple times. Horror/Suspense is my favorite genre and I'd easily say I've seen every popular horror movie and many, many of the rarer sort in the genre. This one is great. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Despite its PG-13 rating, I would hesitate to allow anyone under 16 to see this film. It's very unsettling. But don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic film. Kidman and the cast demonstrate that it doesn't take gore and chainsaws to create a true horror movie. This film is intelligent and skillfully filmed. Every nuance; every scene is perfectly crafted to recreate a mystery. There is no red herring, yet the complex story keeps you guessing. I'll have to see the movie again to appreciate how much the storyteller does give away and how obvious the mystery's solution seems in retrospect. The foggy mists and gray colors and dark corners will haunt you...but you'll savor every minute of it. I love horror movies...but this is a movie I'm glad I waited to see at home.

Unfortunately this movie had nothing to do with hauntings it had to do with a psychotic mother and her two screwed up kids. The only "scary" parts were cheap visual or audio tricks to get you to jump. When a door sudenly slams in your ear you jump involuntarily whether it scared you or not. The movie was way to long. I didn't understand the subplot about the father, nor did I care. And as for the "surprise" ending I figured it out at the begining of the movie. It was way too predictable. If you're planning on watching this movie because you think your going to get a great thriller pick up something by Hitchcock instead. Don't waste your time on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Others" is a superior ghost story in the old fashioned vein without any glitzy special effects, no blood and guts, no graphic sex and no gruesome murders. What it is, is an atmospheric, eerie and claustrophobic scare the pants off of you haunted house ghost story. The story involves a young mother Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two light-sensitive children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann, James Bentley) who live in an isolated manor in the middle of the countryside in 1945. The father has gone off to war and has not returned. Along come three mysterious house servants, Bertha Milk (Fionna Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and the mute Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), who show up unexplainably to apply for the vacant servant positions. Elaine and the children then begin to hear voices and things that go bump in the night. Are there ghosts or intruders in the house? Are the servants who they say they are? Can Grace protect her family against the evil forces? Director Alejandro Amenabar keeps us guessing throughout. He presents us with a creaky old mansion with all of the haunted house cliches (slamming doors, unexplained noises, creaking floors etc.) but does so in a style reminiscent of the classic ghost stories such as "The Uninvited" (1944), "The Innocents" (1961) and "The Haunting" (1963). He gives us a slam-bang ending, with a few surprises, that you won't want to miss. Nicole Kidman, after playing second fiddle to ex-hubby Tom Cruise is finally receiving the roles and recognition she deserves. Always a beautiful and talented actress, she proves in "The Others" what a fine dramatic actress she can be and does so without any of the trappings and glamour such as she had in her previous film "Moulin Rouge" (2001). Alakina Mann and James Bentley are excellent as the children. Veteran performers Flanagan and Sykes as well as, virtual newcomer Cassidy stand out as the servants. Take it from me, you won't want to miss this one.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, I had to watch this movie in pieces because I started it so late in the evening but this turned out to be a good thing. I watched about 45 minutes the first night and I hadn't quite put it all together yet and just knew there was something coming to do just that and I was right. This was reminscent of The Sixth Sense when things start to all fall into place and you say to yourself "I should have known that." It's shot in very low light so it's very dramatic throughout. The other thing I really liked about this movie was that there was really only 6 main characters so you could really focus on what's happening without all the distractions of a lot of extras milling about to fill up space. If you liked The Sixth Sense, you'll like this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love This Movie!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am in love with this movie. I haven't liked a thiller this much since I saw The Sixth Sense. It was so good because it kept you guessing on what was going to happen next and at the end everything you thought was true turned out not to be. This is one of the best movies I think Nicole Kidman has done too. I think that she should have won the Golden Globe for this instead of Moulin Rouge. I hope that hollywood takes a hint from movies like The Others and The Sixth Sense and starts making more psychological thillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't believe in watching horror movies after 1990, but this one proved me wrong. First of all, I wouldn't really call it a splatter horror movie, it's just an old ghost story. But, if you've seen this movie and don't understand (like I did the first two times) I'm going to explain it to you. And if you don't want me to spoil it for you please do not read ahead. Ok, I'm going to attempt to explain: Nicole Kidman lives with her two kids who seem to be haunted by a family of ghosts... but, Nicole Kidman and her two kids ARE the ghosts to the other family. In the final scene the family sits with a psychic trying to contact Nicole Kidman and her two kids when the psychic DOES reveal that Nicole Kidman had killed her kids and shot herself, which did happen... Nicole Kidman's family was haunting the other family. I found myself saying "Ohhhhhh!" at the end when the family (NOT Nicole Kidman's) decided to move out they put a "For Sale" sign up. So what I'm trying to say is that Nicole Kidman's family are the ghosts actually haunting another family, though we are lead to believe that the Nicole Kidman family is the "good living" family, they are actually dead because Nicole Kidman went crazy and killed them all. Okay! You probably can't understand that but if you can it will help you. I had to buy this movie after seeing it and I give it a 10/10. The only weak point in the film is the accents that the characters have, but, I guess it does kind of give it an eerie feeling. Check this out. Nicole Kidman and her two kids do great acting and great direction by Alejandro Amenabar! I promise I won't say Nicole Kidman again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely surprised! Much better than expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I purposely waited to see this on video because I had read enough negative reviews about this movie, that I did not want to waste my money on seeing it at the theatre. Well, now I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner. The negative reviews completely misled me.This is the best ghost story and haunted house story I've ever seen on film. It has completely believable characters, a lot of hints dropped throughout (which I didn't catch until the ending), a growing tension and fear, excellent acting, and perfect cinematography to capture the story. If you have ever been turned off by the House On Haunted Hill type movies, believe me, you will like this so much more! It showed that this type of film does not need gore and special effects -- just a good story, the right atmosphere (music, setting and cinematography), and exceptional acting by all in the film. One question: Why did Nicole Kidman get nominated for that flimsy role in Moulin Rouge, but not for The Others? This is possibly her best role ever, next to To Die For. Her portrayal of the rigidly protective mother was masterful, and she convincingly brought out the full range of emotions.I was completely surprised by the artistry of the movie, how well it gripped me as a drama as opposed to a horror flick, and how the ending just plain floored me! This was not the B-movie I was expecting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman delivers a terrific performance as the neurotic mother of two photosensitive children, trapped in a fog-enshrouded house which has attracted some unwanted visitors. A genuinely creepy and unsettling film with moments of sheer unadulterated terror - the scene in which the little girl is trying on a bridal dress, for example, is particularly nightmarish... I'll say no more.Avoid finding out too much about the plot before seeing the film, and in particular make sure no one tells you how it's going to end. Should anyone reveal the devastating twist to you, you would be quite justified in cutting off his ears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally saw this film when it first came out to theatres with a few friends. I didn't know much about the plot - only what I had seen in the teasers. We just sort of went to see this movie to pass time...not really paying much mind to it.But from the moment that we sat down - we could not stop staring at the screen - it was hypnotic in so many ways. We put so much attention to the story and how they explained each character and watched as they developed. This film was written and directed with such percision that is absolutely amazing. It starts off slow but each moment builds towards the end and the more you pay attention to the little things - the greater the ending will be for the viewer...as it was for us! Everyone had their own scenario of possible endings but we were all wrong - Very Deceiving.Last night I rented the movie and watched it for the first time with my kids...and this time I paid very close attention to all of the smaller details while they went through the same motions I went through the first time. I must say that each time you watch this film, you come to a greater understanding and catch all of the hints it gives to you throughout the film - and even though I already knew how it ended - it still ran chills through my spine. And to see my kids react the way that they did...made it even a greater experience the second time around.So go get a pillow, blanket and that significant other, cuddle up on the sofa and watch this movie...I am sure that you will enjoy it just as much as my kids, friends and I have!!</fullReview>

SO COOL! The score was very good, the acting was excellent (also, anne and nicolas were VERY VERY good child actors), the plot was nontypical, it was very well done as a 1940's period piece. The costumes, the set, the dialogue... They are all very beautiful. It was not as scary as i thought it was going to be but i guess thats just because the movie was made out to be SO SCARY in the trailers but it isnt that type of movie, its more of a "freaky" drama. Its sort of like Nicole Kidman's other movie, Moulin Rouge, in the way that Moulin Rouge was billed as a really sexy, stripper type of movie but it wasnt like that at all, it was more like a love story... DEFINATLEY SEE this movie, Preferably TWICE. =) [10 of 10]BOTTOM LINE: THIS MOVIE ROCKED! SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> The Others is not a great horror film, but it's an effective thriller, and as a showcase for the ever-evolving talents of Nicole Kidman, it's pretty near perfect. All this film lacks are one or two genuinely frightening moments -- there are plenty of little shivers, but nothing that puts it into Shining or Exorcist territory as far as terror goes. The script is a marvel of narrative ingenuity, though -- it's amazing that Amenebar gets away with as much as he does given the cynical, questioning nature of most horror fans -- and the photography, which deserved at least an Oscar nomination, is so stunning that it makes even the lulls diverting. Probably the best film of its kind since "Jacob's Ladder" -- a pyschological thriller with meaningful themes and a satisfying, unforseen resolution that, rather than simply pulling out the rug from under us, imposes logic, and, yes, significance what came before. All this Meaningful Stuff, and it's also just an entertaining ghost story,like the kind they used to make in black-and-white out of great little short stories. Call it *** 1/2.</fullReview>

This movie should have been nominated for Best Picture at The Oscars because of it's plot and development. The Others was underrated in the summer movies of 2001. It was only supposed to bring a mere $40 million and made a whopping $96.5 million and the summers most surprising movie gross. I recommend this movie with a large amount of respect.

		<fullReview>Although I did enjoy watching The Others, it did seem a little over rated to me. Apart from the performances and the surprise twist at the end, there wasn't an awful lot to this horror. At no point did I find The Others scary, so fans of ghostly horror movies may be somewhat disappointed with that revelation, nor did I feel that the main characters were ever in any real danger. But as I said before, the acting in this movie is stunning, particulary Kidman's eerie portrayal of the tormented mother. She is, I think, the only true female star left in Hollywood, all the others have either retired or have died from old age. Surprisingly, the children were very good too. Overall, I give this movie a 7.5/10. Worth watching twice</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the joys of being a movie fan is finding a particular gem for which you have no great expectations and then finding to your surprise that the film is in fact a genuine classic. I found this to be the case with The Others. I was never too enamoured with the previews, the 12 certificate was a little offputting for a supposedly scary movie and after watching the first ten minutes I was slightly disapointed as it seemed too reminiscent of a boring English period drama, how wrong I was and how rewarded was I for not switching off, this movie is an understated masterpiece and should stand shoulder to shoulder with other supernatural classics such as the Shining, Rosemary's Baby, the Omen, Poltegeist and the Exorcist. It is THAT good! I'll not go in-depth with the plot as you need to watch it with little knowledge of what it's about to truly appreciate the story. But I just had to RECOMMEND this movie to film fans out there. Great acting, great set, great atmosphere... great job. Genuinely eerie and very convincing. If you're a fan of supernatural thrillers, or just great movies in general, rent out this dvd/video NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the finest horror movie I have ever come across. Never have I jumped out of my chair so many times, no matter how many times I have seen this movie. Those who compare it to "The Sixth Sense" are absolutely ludicrous. The dense fog surrounding the house adds to the mystery of the movie along with any discussion including "When mommy went mad". The acting is excellent. These are the best child performances I have ever seen. But the greatest thing about this movie is the acting of Nicole Kidman as an uptight, overprotective and very religious mother. The whole time she had me convinced that she was Grace and her accent was perfect. This was the finest performance of 2001 and the best of Nicole's career. Had she been nominated in this role for an Oscar (instead of "Moulin Rouge") she definitely would have won. There are so many twists and turns in this movie that you never know where it is going. In fact, the first time I saw it, me and my friend came up with a dozen possible endings before the end, but we were WAY off. Some of the best scenes include; Grace in the junk room, Grace in the music room and when Grace finds out the truth. This is a fresh and original movie that was both critically acclaimed and a box office smash. Nicole Kidman tried to pull out of the movie, but luckily producers would not let her enabling her to give a knock out performance. I give this movie 10 out of 10 and recommend it to everyone. The first 10 minutes may seem a little slow to some but once the creepiness kicks in, so do the thrills. The cinematography and score are excellent and do wonders to the film. The best movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Narrowly better than the sixth sense, which itself was excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is a film similar to the Sixth sense, and like the Sixth Sense is very good. The Others in my opinion is narrowly better. I think that the film is so wonderfully shot and Kidmans performance is so good it narrowly beats Bruce Willis's flick. The gorgeous Nicole (you idiot Tom!) Kidman steals the show here as the mother of two children, the kids are photo sensitive and will die if exposed to light, after excuciating pain and suffocation that is, and their conditon makes way to create the chilling atmosphere of the film by the fact that the house is in near constant darkness. The films lighting is very spooky and the direction was very good, I was very uneasy watching this and I must say that it takes a lot to scare me but I nearly had a heart attck on a number of occasions with some very well timed jump moments. The film is scary, it makes you feel so nervy because of the dark atmosphere built up through brilliant cinematography and an eerie score. The other actors are good, the three people who play the mysterious house keepers were good and the two kids were a very high standard although do not compare to Haley Joel Osment but then again he is so far better than most child actors he is almost un-naturally good for someone his age. As I said before Nicole Kidman is excellent, she really earned some desreved respect in this film and Moulan Rouge. The film is very good with some great twists one of which I did see coming although it is not blindingly obvious, I just followed the classic rules of the movie world that most films of this type usually go by. If you stop and think you'll probably guess the main twist because the film makers will always go for the jugular when it comes to a plot twist. Overall 9/10 make sure spare undies are readily available before watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest I've seen in a long time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had only read a few reviews of this film before I saw it. I had heard that it took place during WWII (more or less) and that there were something about children with a weird illness and that it was horror (more or less).So I went to the cinema and I saw a film that frightened me... And it was good. (Scary Movie frightened me too but that was mostly because it was horrible... In the meaning that it was a bad film [ot]) After seeing it I felt hypnotized, there was something about this film that made it "magic". The lightning and sounds were superb (even in the low-class cinema we have where I live) and there were no blood... only a "scare of the dark/light" (much like Blair Witch Project.. which had a similar way of scaring... you saw nothing but imagined a lot).Also the ending was quite good, I found myself wondering how they would end this without it feeling too "over" (Like I felt in Ninth Gate and Thirteen Ghosts). I must say it turned out well, thinking about how hard it is to make a satisfying ending.And just to mention if you see this film I strongly suggest that you don't watch trailers before (or atleast not think about it) you go see it. I downloaded the trailer after seeing this film (to "steal" screenshots for my homepage's review) and I felt that the trailer revealed too much... But do as you please, I can't stop you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other ghost and horror film makers take note. This is how to make a terrifying movie without resorting to millions of dollars worth of special effects and gallons of fake blood. In all honesty I don't think I have ever seen a film that scared me as much as this. From the opening credits to the superb finale I had a layer of gooseflesh that would not go away. I was reminded somewhat of the original film of "The Haunting" for the sheer atmosphere and the ability of the director to create all the terror inside the viewers head. The skill in making you feel more apprehensive when nothing happens rather than when it actually does coupled with a non intrusive musical score makes this film making of the highest order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really, really liked The Others starring Nicole Kidman, I saw it last summer a little before it took that re-boost at the box office. It is a drama-thriller, that's classy and well acted, with a great plot. And while it is along the same vein as other movies like The Sixth Sense at parts, it's original, not the same idea with both movies. Nicole Kidman never does cease to amaze me, and wow did she give a great one in this movie as Grace, the mother of two children living in a mansion in 1940's England. And the children happen to be allergic to light. The plot is also such a good one, one that I can't give too many details about, if you haven't seen it already see it when it comes to video. The movie as a whole as gave me the great feeling of an almost throw-back to older, classic, almost Hitchcock-ian thrillers. Ones where extreme violence reigns suppreme and gratuitus nudity is all over. Concluding, The Others was a great classy and smart thriller, please do yourself a favor and see this movie if you haven't. It's great. Nicole Kidman is her always amazing in this movie that is greatly acted all around. Just a great drama and thriller at the same time.</fullReview>

You have to watch it carefully and to the very end to fully find out what has been going on.This is a truly gripping and scary film and unless you are Mr Spock you will have goose bumps at times and will jump out of your skin at other times. What you must do to really appreciate it is to watch it from start to finish without being distracted. During the film you will get totally absorbed into the story and to have to finish the ironing for the last half hour of the movie simply won't do.If you like horror films you must see this movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When was the last time you saw a scary horror movie rated PG-13?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes! This movie eschews all the special f/x, cheap scares, gore and viscera. None of the typical big budget Hollywood scare tactics in movies like Scream and the hideously bad remake of The Haunting. The Others is a genuinely creepy, suspenseful movie that uses psychological cues to increase the terror. PG-13. Can you believe it? This is actually a scary movie that an adolescent can watch. But take my word for it, it will creep you out even if you are in your 40's. The atmosphere is dark and unsettling, and the acting by Nicole Kidman, and the two child actors are convincing.To tell you the truth, after some reflection, nothing particularly "terrifying" or "scary" ever actually happens in this movie. It is the acting by the characters that really makes you frightened. Their fear is palpable and it conveys itself to the audience. You feel as if though you are there with Grace in that big empty house, hearing voices and footsteps, and seeing things in the corner of your eye. You can actually sense the slow burn Nicole's character is going through as she creeps toward possible insanity. Magnificient. Kidman should have been nominated for Best Actress for this role as opposed to her role in "Moulin Rouge".I definitely recommend this movie for ghost-movie and scary story fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of a thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what a good thriller/horror movie should be like. The setting is classic thriller material. A house where doors have to be closed before opening another, mysterious servants, and excellent development of the main characters. Throw in a good cast and an excellent storyline, and you have "The Others", a must-see for all cinemagoers. Once again, Nicole Kidman proves why she is one of the most admired actresses in Hollywood by giving a stellar performance. A mother forced to keep her two light-sensitive children out of the light, her character is conveys strictness and frailty at the same time. Her presence on the screen is powerful even when she is not speaking.The supporting cast complements each other. The three servants have a silent yet tangible devotion to one another, and the big sister-little brother relationship between 909879 is convincing. This movie is does not rely on fancy effects and heavy makeup to keep the audience scared yet begging for more. Rather, a combination of good lighting, good acting, and good timing scares the audience out of their wits. The plot moves along at just the right pace, keeping the audience in continual suspense without straining their patience.Though critics claim that its ending is carried over from "Sixth Sense", this movie was written before "Sixth Sense" was produced. However, comparisons between the two movies is inevitable. Without going so far as to say that "The Others" is the better movie, it is no doubt one of the best thrillers to have graced the screens in 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what a good thriller/horror movie should be like. The setting is classic thriller material. A house where doors have to be closed before opening another, mysterious servants, and excellent development of the main characters. Throw in a good cast and an excellent storyline, and you have "The Others", a must-see for all cinemagoers. Once again, Nicole Kidman proves why she is one of the most admired actresses in Hollywood by giving a stellar performance. A mother forced to keep her two light-sensitive children out of the light, her character is conveys strictness and frailty at the same time. Her presence on the screen is powerful even when she is not speaking.The supporting cast complements each other. The three servants have a silent yet tangible devotion to one another, and the big sister-little brother relationship between Alakina Mann (Anne) and James Bentley (Nicholas) is convincing. This movie is does not rely on fancy effects and heavy makeup to keep the audience scared yet begging for more. Rather, a combination of good lighting, good acting, and good timing scares the audience out of their wits. The plot moves along at just the right pace, keeping the audience in continual suspense without straining their patience.Though critics claim that its ending is carried over from "Sixth Sense", this movie was written before "Sixth Sense" was produced. However, comparisons between the two movies is inevitable. Without going so far as to say that "The Others" is the better movie, it is no doubt one of the best thrillers to have graced the screens in 2001. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been Better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very frustrating for me because it had a lot going for it. It was beautifully filmed, had a good cast, and atmospheric music. Unfortunately, it was also too long, there was a lot of repetition, and it was hard to like any of the characters. Nicole Kidman spent too much time yelling at the kids and the servants and it took too long for her to figure out that maybe the house is haunted. Everybody else in the movie is as stiff as boards.On the other hand, it is still better than 99% of the garbage out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this film tonight. I have been looking forward to seeing it forever (big Nicole Fan!). It was worth seeing, but I was let down with the "big surprise ending" that everyone has been buzzing about. My hubby and I had the ending figured out not even half way into the movie. Don't get me wrong.. Nicole was great in this role and visually, it was great and all but honestly, how many times can the whole "Sixth Sense"-type thing be done? It's just not surprising anymore and it's getting a tad stale...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Haunting Experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has spooky atmosphere, a wicked twist of an ending and an ice-cold grabber of a performance by Nicole Kidman as Grace, a mother who isolates her two children in a Victorian mansion on the British isle of Jersey near the end of World War II. Grace, who fears her husband (Christopher Eccleston) has died in battle, keeps her two kids - Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) - in the dark. Literally. She tells the new housekeeper (the expert Fionnula Flanagan) that daylight will cause fits in Anne and Nicholas. Curtains must always be drawn and doors firmly locked. Then the noises start, and the visions and the strange voices.No fair revealing more plot details. But you should know that The Others is the American feature debut of the gifted young Spanish director Alejandro Amenebar, whose 1998 film, Open Your Eyes, has been remade as Vanilla Sky by director Cameron Crowe and stars Tom Cruise, who served as co-producer on The Others before his marriage to Kidman went kaput. It's not hard to see what Cruise sees in Amenebar - this is a filmmaker who knows how to hold an audience with artful stealth. Only some bumpy, arid passages in the script keep The Others out of the master class occupied by the likes of The Sixth Sense and, my favorite, 1961's The Innocents, based on Henry James' The Turn of the Screw. When it comes to turning the screws of psychological terror, Amenebar is an expert technician.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, Nicole was only mediocre in "Moulin Rouge"[she can't really sing-no offence].However, she was superb in "The Others" and was robbed of an Oscar nomination for that by "MR" and she recently admitted in an interview herself that she would have prefered to have been nominated for "The Others" as she believed that she would have a better chance of winning.I agree with her.She was mesmerizing in "The Others" and although Nicole garnered many awards and nominations for it, I believe she deserves more.She deserved an Oscar nomination alright but not for Moulin Rouge.Good luck to her though!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who knew horror movies could be this terrifying?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is surely the most superbly executed movie I have ever seen. The film tells the story of Grace, a hypochondriac Catholic mother who tries to protect her children from their morbid allergy to sunlight, despite the schemings of three new servants, and a mansion gone suddenly awry. The terror of "The Others", unlike other horror movies of the "spooky old house" brand, relies not so much on flashy special effects as it does on perfect timing, a suitably chilling soundtrack, and, most noticeably, the believability of its actors: Nicole Kidman delivers stunningly as a fiercely devout British mother who seems constantly on the verge of some horrifying fit of insanity. Alakina Mann and James Bentley never fail to frighten as the precocious and decidedly innocent children of Grace. And Fionnula Flanagan, veteran Irish actress, stretches thin the line between amicable housekeeper and fearsome hag with an ulterior agenda. From the unsettling opening scene, through a tightly wound web of suspense, intrigue, and a select few well-placed scream-packed moments, to the genuinely chilling conclusion , "The Others" never fails to terrify and amaze its audience with its innate sense of style, and a simple, but ultimately gripping, plot construction.

		<fullReview>Post WWII Horror Film starring Nicole Kidman, 1 missing husband, 2 kids, 3 new servants and 4 or 5 'others'. Grrrrrgh....This is a very creepy film. THAT old woman was very scary... But ultimately, one can't help but be strangely moved by this understated piece of cinema. Nicole's subtle but no less piercing performance for this ghoulish yarn should have been rewarded with an Oscar nomination.But in a world when a cheese burger can cost more it used to yesterday, and deserving films get chewed up by big budgeted crap, nothing is fair. Just think about it, isn't losing husbands (a real one, and a reel one) already a bad enough punishment for this woman? Imagine all those years of neck damage from having to look down all the time? Is it all worth it? Such injustice, the ways of the world, such utter injustice!(But I digress. Can't helpit. Sorry.)Anyhow, all is not lost as this eerie little movie earned so much money(close to US$100 million, and US$1 million more than Vanilla Sky at that! ITS TRUE!), it went on to become one of 2001's biggest surprise hits.Miss Kidman is now hotter than ever before. And of course, she did garner a nomination for that other film(Moulin Rogue!). You know what they say: "Unlucky in love....." Nicole you are a free woman now. Take comfort in that thought. And guess what, you may now finally fire that chiropractor of yours and start enjoying the view! You go girl!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of 2001!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" was totally robbed. IT should have been nominated for at least FIVE Oscars (including Best Picture), not NONE AT ALL. I loved "Moulin Rouge" (it was my second favourite film of 2001 after this), but Nicole Kidman's talents were more obvious in Amenabar's (freaky) masterpiece.This film, unlike many these days, is intelligent. It is classy, brilliantly acted, and mysterious. Plus, it packs a massive punch in the end that'll overwhelm you. I predicted the ending of "The Sixth Sense" before I'd even seen the movie, but I just didn't see this one coming."The Others" will amaze you. I was so gobsmacked by it when I first watched it that I went back to the cinema the next day, the day after that, the day after that, and again...the day after that. Unlike most movies, this one will stay with you LONG after the first viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD. If you haven't seen the film don't read so much as a single word below. ...As with "The Sixth Sense", I believe you're MEANT to guess halfway through. When Grace meets her husband it's a "Vertigo" gesture: we now know the central truth that's eluding the main characters, they don't, and the tension comes from us waiting for them to find out. Anyway, it's not as if the series of broad hints we are dropped during Grace's walk in the woods reveal ALL secrets, or clear up all mysteries. We weren't told at that point that the caretakers are also dead, or that Grace murdered her own children, although the film plays fair with us and tells us all we need to know to work these things out.The list of clues I failed to see the significance of at once is an embarrassingly long one (although the chagrin was pleasant): the undelivered letter, the mysterious departure of the servants, the day that "mummy went mad", the fact that Lydia underwent some trauma that rendered her mute... But in addition to all these clues there's one EXTERNAL to the narrative, a matter of technique, which I failed to read correctly even though I saw it mentioned before I saw the film, and noted it while watching.It was in a review by New York critic Godfrey Cheshire. It wasn't favourable. An essential component of the haunted-house story, Cheshire argues, is "daylight reality", which means that in order for the spookiness to work we MUST see the people who are about to be haunted doing ordinary things in broad, unthreatening daylight. And he's right: "daylight reality" IS an essential component of any story of this kind.So when the film opens with Grace emerging from a nightmare, breathless with terror, in a dark house surrounded by fog, it DOES appear to be a stylistic defect. But it isn't. Grace, it will eventually turn out, is a ghost, a haunter rather than a hauntee. "Very well," I thought to myself when I discovered this, "but what about the caretakers? Why don't we see THEIR daylight reality?" The answer to this question is the same: because they, too, are ghosts (you think by this stage I'd have got it). Not until the very end, when we meet the "others", does the sun come out. This hard-won "daylight reality" is no less effective a part of the ghost story for coming last rather than first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thrills and chills are those inside our own heads. Everyone knows it but Hollywood keeps trying to outdo itself with more gristle, more gore and ever bigger vats of blood. Not the case with this film, which is almost a throwback to the ghost stories of the 19th century and the B&amp;W mystery films of the mid 20th century. Revisiting that territory, in a film as tidily put together as this one, is refreshing.Nicole Kidman is radiant as Grace, the isolated, migraine-prone mother of two perturbed children (Alakina Mann is wonderful as the older child Anne, James Bentley is good too). Both children suffer from photosensitivity and Grace is meticulous in protecting them from the daylight. But all is not well. They are marooned in a mansion house (Grace appropriately compares the house to a ship at one point), the place is eerily fog-bound, the postman hasn't come, three new servants have arrived unexpectedly and the children are noticing that they don't appear to be the only ones on the house. Then Grace starts noticing things too...The most trivial things become objects of fear and suspense in this film. A face in a picture, shadows, a moving curtain, a door that moves suddenly, a bump upstairs, half-heard whispers, a piano playing behind a closed door, dense fog. The atmosphere is developed superbly and Kidman plays her part - when required, she looks utterly s*** scared. But don't expect gory shocks for there are none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming right off her popular turn in Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman firmly established herself as an excellent and very versatile actress in 2001. She makes the movie, and as Grace, she seems to be Grace Kelly reincarnated as the quiet, devoted, but frightened and overprotective mother of two while her husband is lost at war. Excellent scenery and props of a creepy haunted house and a housekeeping staff that may not be what they appear keep the film on its toes, and it delivers an ending that rivals only the Sixth Sense in surprise endings in recent history. If Nicole Kidman can keep up the momentum following her two triumphs of 2001, who knows how far she can go??</fullReview>

It is not a violent movie, but it is creepy and have some scares. It is very well acted and directed, it manages to create a very interesting and moody atmosphere, it uses sound effects skillfully and it will keep you interested and entertained throughout the whole movie.The story is clever and so is the ending. Unfortunately the same can not be said about those reviewers who are giving away too much about the plot here on IMDb and who make obvious comparisons with another movie which also can ruin your experience of The Others, so don't read any more, just watch The Others. I urge you who are writing reviews here to stop inventing your own rating systems and use the official 10 grade scale of IMDb. My rating of The Others: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inflated Twilight Zone episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start I was irritated by Nicole Kidman's performance as the lead character in this. When she doesn't have some definite emotion to convey, like anger or terror, e.g. in a plot set-up scene, she can't carry it off. Moreover, she has to shoulder a great deal of the movie by herself, and I felt her pain a bit -- it looks like hard work. It's not all bad however. The gimmick of the light sensitive children provides some embellishment and amusing filler. And it does have some creepy, spine tingling moments. The two children and the rest of the supporting cast give impressive performances. This as a haunted house/ghost story with only one arrow in its quiver. It's set in the 40's, and reminds one of the pulp magazines filled with such stuff around that time. It has that lurid, somewhat tasteless feel of a story scribbled out at 2 cents a word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creepy, spine-tingling, twisting, etc...these words plus many more could describe the nature of this film. Set in an erie, remote house, this film uses psychology to thrill as opposed to blood and gore. It uses the thoughts on what happens when you die and plays around with them, ultimately delivering a very pleasing film. While in my opinion it took a little to long to get started, the scary enviroment, jump-scenes (not to many but when they occur, watch out), and the overall ending was worth the time spent.Overall, if you are looking for a suspenseful and respectable (not to often do you see those two words together when talking about a horror film) thriller, this is a good bet. Creepy and crazy, when this movie is over you will be thinking about it for hours.7/10 - Points were subtracted for the while it took to get started (in my opinion the makers took to long to set the background), plus they needed a few more jump scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this movie really an horror film ? Obviously yes, as it is often chilling, and full of very classical elements from very classical horror films (ghosts, frightened children, haunted house lost in mist...)But it is much more sober, less silly (and bloody) than most of the so-called "horror movies" - perhaps because, actually, it's a genuine psychological drama, at the same time striking, beautiful, sorrowful, with unforgettable atmosphere and plot. For that reason it may recall more "Rebecca" than "Shining" (another fantastic familial drama)No spoiling here, I'd only like to say that the surprises of the script are much less artificial and sheerly mechanical as in most movies with "coups de théâtre", because they finally give a totally different approach to the psychology and the attitudes of the characters.Eventually, I recommend this beautiful movie to all the people who enjoy suspenseful films, with surprising, clever plots and some genuine human depth ... and with, as only special effects, Kidman's anguished face, whose beautiful expressivity here is simply unforgettable !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite genre has the last 10 years been horror-films. Films that chill you to the bone, films that makes you not want to go to sleep. It all started with watching "The Omen" when I was 12. I was scared to death, and I fell in love with the feeling. Since then I have tried to find a film that would give me the same feeling as "The Omen" gave me back in '92, but I have never found one. Until now... "The Others" is a extravagant film that we have not seen in the theaters in a long time. I was so scared I could feel tears popping out of my eyes and it felt wonderful. My girlfriend even asked if we couldn't leave because she was so scared, but I just wanted the film to last forever. To keep injecting this fear-drug into my blood. You might think we are very easy to scare, but I wouldn't say we are. This film is really scaring, the only film that can come up to this would be Robert Wise's "The Haunting" from 1963. Alejandro Amenábar has made what others for so long have tried to accomplish. He has chilled us to the bone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman was again very good in 'The Others'. A film of a almost unknown Spanish director. I heard it was good and oh yes it was!! Especially the end was great. The film was a drama, thriller and also a bit of a horror movie. The story (screenplay) and the acting were the great points of the film. Also the children were remarkable (for both it was their first movie). Nicole is the top actress of the moment and she deserves it. I can't get enough of her acting. I hope that her next movies will be as great as this one. The story is difficult to explain but I will try it. -Grace a woman lives with her two children (Anne &amp; Nicholas) in an old, lonely house. She has 3 servants who help her, but than she hears some strange noises. It makes her crazy, but what is it?You have to see this, I can't believe the bad comments of some people, I enjoyed this movie very much and it is certainly one of the best films of 2001.Nicole Kidman is now working on Dogville with Lauren Bacall (also a great diva) and Jeremy Davies... probably one of the great films that are expected.

"The Others" is a co-production between Spain and USA, and this thing liked me. Alejandro Amenábar had one of the best casts I´ve seen, overall Kidman and the children;---SPOILERs--- every actor makes you feel frighten and you don´t know in what state (living or dead) are them. Yeah, the first twist (the servants are dead) is very easy for the public recognize it. But the other twist (think about it more than a minute and you will feel more fear) is only perfect (the idea of live together dead and undead).--- ---END SpoilerSThe photograph, the lightning, the actors, the scenary, the direction, the score... all are good for create a dark and intelligent atmosphere. For the fans of fog use in films (I remember "Sleepy Hollow" as a good use of this Special Effect) this is a good instead.For last, I think this is a classic and the best haunted house film of cinema history. I´m waiting for the next film of this young talented director.IF YOU LIKED "ABRE LOS OJOS (Open your eyes)"9/10 YOU´LL LOVED the OTHERS (10/10)_______</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is truly one of the best movies I have seen this year. The intelligent scripting and the surprise twist and turns in the story will keep you thinking throughout the movie. It's not like one of those Hollywood blockbusters where all you do is sit back and let the special effects, explosions etc. carry you along. In this movie, the story unfolds through the dialogue from scene to scene. Nicole Kidman's performance is wonderful. The supporting cast is also good as well particularly the children. This movie is a definite must see!!! The frightening parts may be few and far between but there is always a sense of eeriness, which is unsettling throughout the movie. And probably the best thing about this movie is that most of the scares are provided not through gory or frightening visuals (such as a blown off head, a scarred face, people hanging from ropes ala The Sixth Sense) but rather through simple visuals such as a photograph or a hand reaching out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the Sixth Sense - this is better on all levels!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally. A ghost story which is amazingly simple yet effective!THERE WILL BE PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE HERE, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANY MINOR/MAJOR PLOT DETAILS, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW!!!! I'LL GIVE *** TO LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S SAFE TO READ.First of all, let me say - I worked out the first twist. The servants being ghosts and all, but the second one sent my brain reeling in all directions!!! WOW!***This film is a great film. It uses the simplest of techniques to achieve the highest desired effect - to scare us witless! Doors opening and closing on their own. The piano being played in a room with no-one there. This might all sound familiar to the avid horror/thriller/chiller fan, but it is dealt with very careful means. And anyone expecting a slasher film, go somewhere else.***In hindsight, if you actually sit down and think about what you have just witnessed, the twist makes sooooooooooo much sense, AND it holds water, unlike the Sixth Sense.Take the two worlds - the living and the dead. As Grace (Kidman), in the world of the dead, keeps closing the curtains during the day to keep her children safe from the sun, and closing every door behind her so none are open, to the living, it seems that they have ghosts. If the 'intruders' keep opening the curtains during the day and leaving doors open, then to Grace, SHE has ghosts. This is so clever and really plays on a person's perceptions of events. God, I can't even put into words what I'm trying to say. But you who have seen this will definitely understand!!!!***No beating about the bush, Kidman SHOULD get the Oscar for this film. I havn't seen Spaceck's performance yet, but so far, Kidman deserves it. She nails the British accent, she gives a powerful performance, and she is believable.The two children are also outstanding, the girl was genuinely creepy at some points - when she was doing the 'red-rum' style two voiced exclamations in the room with her brother.I'm still in shock I think after seeing this film, it does make you think. Which is always welcome when I watch a film.Great direction. Very controlled. He knows when to keep us on our toes, or scare us half to death with tension. And there is, to be honest, only one special effect in this film, and that's in the scene toward the end when Grace rips up the papers.Go and see this film, you will not, I guarantee, NOT, be dissapointed!A simple and perfect, just like the film, 10/10!!Enjoy!***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so impressed with this movie. It's smart, you don't get anything handed to you - it requires that you make an effort to figure out what's going on, and pays off beautifully. It's not just the story, because that by itself is not that original. It's the way the idea was expanded and executed by a very talented writer-director. Nicole Kidman handled her role extremely well, but I was expecting her to, having read a ton of positive reviews. Also, I've always considered her a very talented actress. But I was just amazed by how well the two children did: they were simply brilliant, especially the girl. In fact, The Others was well acted all around.  Some reviews claimed this movie was slow. Huh? Maybe in that there were no explosions or video clip editing. So what? If the writing, design, cinematography, music, and everything else mentioned before work so well, who cares? The pace suits the movie just fine. I'll take The Others over fast paced junk any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky, chilling and completely fantastic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'The Others' last year sometime and I absolutely adored it. It was a sophisticated thriller along the lines of 'The Sixth sense' or 'What lies Beneath' and in my opinion just as good if not better than both of these movies. Nicole Kidman is wonderful and convincing in the part of a woman who gradually begins to lose her take on reality. The children were also great, although the girl was a little bratty. The somber colors and musical score keep you on edge as does the constant shots of the mist shrouded house. I was on the edge of ym seat throughout the viewing and at some points jumped as did the rest of the theatre audience. If you have yet to see this film then I suggest you find a way to see it now! It is a masterpiece and will certainly stand as a classic for years to come.10/10 A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent combination of the Sixth Sense and Beetlejuice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD: In 1999, M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" raised the bar for the modern day horror/suspense film. Now, despite the disappointing similarities to Shyamalan's arguable classic, "The Others" raises the bar higher. Like Shyamalan's film, director Alejandro Amenabar clutters his film with many subtle details to sink your teeth into. For example, the religious overtones of the film (from Grace's stern biblical morals that she instills in her children to her belief that the living and the dead will coexist ONLY at the end of eternity) are not just intriguing as character traits of people in a horror film but as pieces that assemble together and form the film's story. Since the film is told through Grace's eyes and since the film ultimately builds up to Grace's realization of herself and her family, it is imperative that we the audience experience the same feelings that Grace does. And, thankfully, the acting is superb all around, anchored by Nicole Kidman's flawless portrayal of the hopelessly tormented Grace. She manages to pull off the tough task of convincing the audience that while she is grounded by her religious convictions, she is internally conflicted by the madness around her. When can she trust her daughter? How can she keep her sadness directed toward her husband away from her innocent children? When does she have time to rest? It seems as if this woman always has something to worry about, but has nobody to talk to about her problems. Even so, the audience never is unsure of what Grace is feeling inside, and this is because of Kidman's tremendous performance. Unfortunately the film's payoff is not as tremendous as the film sets it up to be. Now, there is nothing wrong, per se, with the film's resolution. But, like others have pointed out, one can not pretend when critiquing this film that "The Sixth Sense" does not exist. In fact, I repeatedly attempted to predetermine the film's twist ending, and was unable to conjure a satisfactory conclusion. The film stumped me. But when the last minutes did unfold, I felt as if I were cheated. Basically, if I knew the filmmakers did not mind retreading the twist to 'The Sixth Sense,' I would not have tried so hard to think of an ending that was not similar to that of "The Sixth Sense." As it is, in relation to "The Sixth Sense," the ending is too similar even to warrant one's forward perception. Along with this drawback, add to it the fact that, ahem, the ending admits that the whole time we were watching just a serious retelling of part of the "Beetlejuice" concept (Grace and her children are just like "Beetlejuice"'s Maitland couple in the beginning of that film) and the ending turns out to be a real downer. Therefore, the best advice I can give is to see this picture before "The Sixth Sense" and "Beetlejuice." Nevertheless, even if you have seen those pictures, the strong performances (Kidman deserves that Golden Globe nomination) and the film's first 95 minutes make for one taught, thrilling, dense, and sometimes tense, ghost story.

		<shortDescription>Good enough to see once, but will it become a classic? (Last paragraph: possibly spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this one is a ghost story in the most traditional way: it creates a frightening atmosphere, there are few very well set shock effects without any blood/gore. The story is quite good, but could have been asking more questions (and some of them being answered).After seeing a movie I ask myself mostly the same key questions: Did I like it (and why/why not)? Was it so good that I would want to see it again? Can I recommend it? Was there something new/original in this film? Yes, overall I liked it and I can recommend it, it is worth looking. I would watch it again, but only after a longer period of time and not in cinema (although the surround sound effects were really impressive). Maybe it is not quite fair, but the similarity to "the sixth sense" is close at hand. Compared to "the sixth sense" this one loses a bit, and not only because I saw "the sixth sense" first. There were not enough new things to make it a classic of the genre. Unfortunately I could not sympathize so closely with the characters as I did in "the sixth sense".! Warning: possibly spoiler ahead! I think the story is incomplete in some ways: for example in the end the question "why did Grace do it?" comes up, but there is no hint of an explanation ("crazy" is not satisfying enough) and I could not detect a sufficient motivation for it in her acting before. But I see this as a lack in the script, not in the acting of Nicole Kidman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a brilliant movie! It has something haunting about it! I saw it last night and I kept thinking about it today. The story is brilliant and intriguing. The movie has an extraordinary atmosphere and great cinematography, lighting etc. Basically everything about this movie is great. Nicole Kidman (with this movie and Moulin Rouge I really like her), the children and the woman who plays Mrs. Mills were all excellent. At the end of the movie one is likely to compare this movie to The Sixth Sense but thinking about it you realize that it varies the topic in a very interesting way. The script is wonderful giving you some hints but not giving away the plot. So overall, the direction, acting, setting, lighting, script and story are truly outstanding. It's a movie you think about and wanna see again to totally get it. I can recommend it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing. It hooks you, makes you get the chills, and at one point literally makes you jump out of your seat. Those who see the movie will probably know what part this is. It was the only time I have really heard a whole audience scream all at once.Aside from being a great work of entertainment, it displays fantastic acting from Nicole Kidman, the two children, and especially the servant lady. The plot twists and turns with much cleverness.The Cinematography is what catches most people's eye. Although the others doesn't have any flashy special affects, the camera glides around suspiciously at the house, and the people, adding to the suspense.This movie is the best of 2001, and so far the best of the decade. The only thing that disappointed me about this movie was the rating. COME ON PEOPLE, there was no blood, no sex, no nothing, so why did it get PG-13? Do a better job next time on that one.Actually, I was glad that there was no blood or sex, because that usually makes movies dull and boring. Good job guys! You created a masterpiece for 8 and up! If you haven't seen it, and you are older than eight, go see it. YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dejavu in many ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not very original and in terms of the acting little convincing, yet stylish flick with a twisted finish that reminded me (and some of the other reviewers here) of "The Sixth Sense". Rumors spread that Amenabár wrote the script before "The Sixth Sense" came out, but even if that would turn out to be true, it wouldn't make "The Others" a more valuable film.Amenabár evolves a very conventional haunted house plot, with Nicole Kidman in the centre of attention, as she gives an above average but not compelling performance as a strict and at the same time desperate mother, concerned about her two kids. The youngsters are over-sensitive to light of all sources as a result of a rare disease. Since they can't be exposed to daylight, all windows of the inhabited mansion are permanently darkened. Three domestic servants move in and strange things start to occur, like the floor board creaks without anybody walking and the kids begin to hear voices and so on.The film is too much about Nicole Kidman's character and the kids aren't believable for most of the time, showing once again the difficulty of finding talented low-aged actors. All in all "The Others" looks somehow dated and creates tension just in a few good moments. The photography is quite good though.Rating: 5-6/10</fullReview>

But it had that 'been there, seen that' right across its face. Unfortunately I had heard about the Sixth Sense-like twist before watching it and so figured it out half way through the movie.I also felt kind of cheated at the start when you were constantly made believe something terrible is about to happen soon and then it doesn't. Reminded me of the first half of The Shining. Perhaps the director wanted that buildup but I didn't like it.If you don't know neither Sixth Sense nor The Others and would have to decide which one to watch first and which one to skip (cause you'll know the 'surprise' by then): Watch 'The Others', if you like thrills. Watch 'Sixth Sense', if you like feelings in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2001...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good horror movie, I really do. When I went to see The Others, I had no idea that it was actually supposed to scare you, and that made it even better than I first could imagine.Basic story: Nicole Kidman lives alone in a very large house with her two small children. The children are sensitive to light, if exposed, they will develop skin complex and eventually it will kill them. One week prior to where the movie begins, all the servants of the house they live in just disappeared. When the movie begins, three people arrive at the house as to be the new house help. They are told how to handle the doors in the house - "no door must be opened without the previous one being closed first". The reason, of course, is that the children must not, at any time, be exposed to light. "This house is like a ship, where the light, as water, must be contained at all times"...or something like that (can't quite remember exactly what's being said).Anyway, I was frightened by this movie - I had to see it twice in as many days just to get a better look at it. The images are beautiful, and old, gigantic house, the fog (oh yes...the fog) and the lighting is great. Nicole Kidman is a great actor, the children (especially the little girl) play great parts, as does the others.If you like to be scared and like a good movie, I can only say one thing: go see this one. Right now, if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning, spoilers ahead--please don't read unless you've seen the film!Predictably, a lot of know-nothings are complaining about the twist at the end of The Others, claiming that it "rips off" The Sixth Sense. Well, guess what, the-protagonist-who-is-already-dead surprise was *hardly* introduced by The Sixth Sense; this plot device has been around since at least the old days of The Twilight Zone television series of the 50's, and as recently as in an 80's movie called Siesta, which was directed by Mary Lambert and starred Ellen Barkin (oops, looks like I just gave away the ending to that--sorry!). Besides, I have to admit that the twist here (actually the DOUBLE twist) completely threw me, and I was one of those who managed to figure out The Sixth Sense's big surprise midway through the film. Anyway, surprise endings aside, there is much else to admire in this fine ghost story. Nicole Kidman gives a very good, sensitive performance, and she has an excellent supporting cast behind her, particularly the two children, who are entirely believable. The film is rich in atmosphere and uses all the trappings of the classic ghost story (the isolated house, mysterious strangers, darkened rooms, etc.) beautifully. If you like ghost stories (and like me, are happy to see them back at the box office thanks to the success of The Sixth Sense) then hie thee to this fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully realised, scary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quick comment first: I loved this film.Of course that should be apparent from my review, but lets not leave it to chance.The Others is a reminder that a lot of work goes into making a film and that, at its best, cinema is art. The director, Alejandro Amenábar (try saying that three times after a few drinks), has done a superb job of crafting this film.The basic plot line involves a woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who lives with her two photosensitive children in a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second World War. They live alone with their newly hired servants as they wait for the return of the husband/father from the world war. Needless to say, there is a suspicion that the house is haunted and the tension skillfully generated in the film is a result of this suspicion.The film succeeds in conveying a tangible feeling of Grace's isolation as she struggles to raise her, sometimes wilful, children alone. Amenabar, through the plotting, cinematography and soundtrack produces a stirring experience, the film is genuinely moving and totally involves the viewer.Nicole Kidman is magnificent as Grace and manages to say "Oh" 15 times in the same scene without it appearing repetitive, she acts with great subtlety appearing both fragile and strong at once. It does not hurt that she is also beautiful - Tom Cruise, what were you thinking?The other cast members are equally brilliant, with the children especially good. Alakina Mann was so good as the elder child that I wondered if it was an adult who had been minified (a-la Mini-Me) to play the part.In addition, the end of the film is a triumph. Before I saw the film I had heard that there was a Sixth Sense-like ending. I was straining my brain throughout the movie to ascertain what the twist could be. However, I did not see it coming, and, like all great twists, it made perfect sense in the context of the movie and left me with a wry smile on my face asking What the?This is cinema as it should be - well done to all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night here in Asunción,and the audience really got scared!,some of them jump from their seat and scream!, Iloved the eerie claustrophobic atmosphere in the film...this is a very stylish,very classy picture...Nicole Kidman restraint performance is just wonderful, she goes from opposite poles: some times rigid and histerical,other times delicate and emotional,she breaks like a porcelain doll,oh well, maybe because she is impossible beautiful like Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion"(maybe Amenábar saw this film),but Nicole looks like Grace KELLY, IT WAS NOT A COINCIDENCE that her name in the film is "Grace".If actresses like Julia Roberts and Gwyneth Paltrow won Oscars maybe such a"corny award" is not made for a REAl talented actress, then Nicole has little chance next March...if she is understimated from the academy WE SHOULD LOVE HER MORE! right?,and that girl who play her daughter "anne"(Alakina Mann)in the film,she is magnificent!,when she appears we forget that boy who saw "dead people". Definitly "the Others"is a great "ghost movie",like in literature Wuthering Heights represents a great gothic/tragical story...it echoes Kate BUSH when she sings " Heathcliff,it's me, Cathy come home I`m so cold,let in-a-your window"...that break our hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excelent movie for suspense lovers and cinematography admirers..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say that I have admired Alejandro's work since he made his first feature length film, Tesis. The Others, even though it's his third film, it's his first english spoken film, and what a thrill ride it is. As the film goes deeper into the plot you feel totally immerse into it. The casting was great and even though I personally don't like Nicole Kidman as an actress she excels in this role as well as the two kids that play her son and daughter. this unique film comes from the mind of a practically new film maker who has taken Hollywood by surprise with this moderately budgeted film that earned millions at the box office. Alejandro has a way of telling a story by images, words and music (he directed the film, wrote the script and also composed the score) that he seams to be ahead of the audience all the step of the way. He uses cinematic techniques that film makers now a days have forgotten or refuse to use and that is what makes him special. The film does not require stunning special effects, or the overuse of sex to involve the viewer. With simple lighting he was able to create an atmosphere which lots of films fail to produce. In these days films often have twists and turns, but few have the creativity of a genius behind the scenes. Besides the suspense, the jumping out of the seat and the twists and turns of it all, I enjoyed the cinematic work of art the most. I Highly recommend this film if you're into it. I also recommend "Open your Eyes" and "Tesis".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-crafted horror story but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Amenabar ("Tesis" &amp; "Abre los ojos"), I went to catch this film as soon as it opened in Paris cinemas. He didn't fail to deliver. "The Others" is a traditional, well-crafted horror piece; Amenabar excelled in creating the atmosphere for the film, clever, simple, dark and creepy, with no over-indulgence in special effects unlike some of the recent "horror" films. The setting was just perfect. Nicole Kidman was excellent in executing the role of the lady of the manor. Clearly, this must be one of her best performances. For me, Fionnula Flanagan stood out exceptionally as Mrs. Mills. Having watched her in various TV-movies in the past, I must say that she almost outshone everyone else in the film although she played a subordinate part. The parts of the children were very-well and convincingly portrayed. Amenabar, at only 29, and with just two films to his credit prior to making "The Others" must be lauded for this latest effort. However, my disappointment lies in the revelation at the end of the film; the climax was superbly executed but it reminds one of a very recent "déj? vu"....UNFORTUNATELY. It could have been a little more original. But I still recommend it for the wonderful performances, direction and photography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much work and not enough screenplay makes the Others a dull film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it sufficient to be a master director to make a very good film? The Others and the other movie-with-a-much-similar-story proves not. It's nice and halfway through the story we begin to wake up, and so? Nothing because the whole script derives from one idea which is to tell a peculiar story and explain only in the end why it is so peculiar. Thus nothing really happens except cheap thrills here and there to draw some kind of a tension. Some evoked Hitchcock: he played on his audience's nerves which is a lot harder than just stating our nerves are tensile. I have had enough of those movies that think they're clever because there is something to be said but ye shalt wait for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely better than the rest.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film, doesn't matter what genre, country or story, needs to have a magic that only comes true when every single thing coexist in such a good cinematography harmony, that without any hesitation, becomes itself in a great deal, so better than the rest. That it's why "The others", the Hollywood film debut from the acclaimed Spanish/Chilean director Alejandro Amenabar, have such of an amusing magic that definitely makes you want to say that real horror films are back.The story takes place in a old and creepy house that is home of a very religious educated woman, Grace, and her two children, who by the way, have a terrible skin condition that makes them extremely allergic to sunlight and force them to be condemned to darkness. Everything changes until the day Grace receives the visit of 3 strangers who come for a housekeeper job being announced and by coincidence, after this hiring, she starts feeling the sensation of being haunted by "ghosts" in this old house. This situation takes us to a journey of emotions, most of them scary, breathless and claustrophobic to get to an end which will be unexpected, very chocking and surprising. The others is a very deep original production so smartly written, effectively and elegant directed and so amazingly acted that it is definitely one of the best horror movies ever. Amenabar takes good care of every single detail of the movie, taking them to a magnificent level that only masters like Hitchcock were known for adding such a deep suspense and make a film so intriguing and very unpredictable.Robinson Almanzar</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films, that came to being in something of a boom, that started when The 6th Sense became successful. The boom of the supernatural films. Since then we have seen (or not) The Gift, What Lies Beneath, Unbreakable and (of course) this one (many will follow). This film may be one of (quite) a lot, but it certainly is not 13 in a dozen. Although this film is not original at all times (borrowing a bit from the 6th Sense and being sort of predictive) it still is well made, well acted and well directed. Compliments for making something not original in a good way. If you like this, try Alejandro Amenábar's Tesis. It really ROCKS!!!7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chills haven't stopped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit straight out that I get scared easily. I couldn't sleep for months after watching "The Sixth Sense", and I really want to watch "The Exorcist", but I fear my heart wouldn't be able to take it. "The Others" is one of those movies that I know would scare me senseless, that I should avoid if I want to sleep in peace, but the more I realise that, the more I want to see it. It's a funny thing, human nature, it's almost masochistic. I can never understand why I enjoy scaring myself so much.(spoilers) "The Others" concludes on basically the same note as "The Sixth Sense". Like I said, the latter film scared me, but I found "The Others" somewhat more chilling and thrilling. In "The Sixth Sense" (a very good film too), I was scared by the images of the ghosts, like the woman in the kitchen. But in "The Others", I was scared by the POSSIBILITY of what haunts the house. We don't get to see who's behind the mysterious closing and opening of doors and things like that until the very end, and it's a good thing, because it allows the viewer to exercise his/her imagination. The film doesn't show the audience its scares; it suggests them, and it's a lot more effective than creating a CG ghoul that floats about and have it boo at the audience every few minutes.I have another confession to make: I screamed out loud at possibly the scariest scene in the movie, during the climax. The last time I did that was during "Scream 3", which wasn't scary, but everyone in the theatre was screaming, so I thought it would be fun to join in (it was). But here, I didn't scream for fun; tension was building up, and you're dying to see what's behind the closed doors (I wouldn't say what doors), and when you finally do, you see a sight that is so...grotesque that you can't help but scream. Needless to say, I got laughed at by my dad, but even he admitted that that scene sent chills down his spine.Throughout the whole movie I kept feeling goosebumps all over my body, and in fact, still do now, when I think back to the film. Its geographical and period setting, its small cast, its music, its cinematography, everything contributed to its creepiness. I was surprised to see that Kidman was actually good in this, after her unintentionally comical performance in Moulin Rouge!. She displayed a range of emotions and daringness that I did not expect. Very much like "The Sixth Sense", the truth that was revealed was more tragic than scary (though it did scare me), and Kidman, along with the two kids, evoked a pity in me that almost made me forget how scared I was. That, I think, is a real accomplishment.The movie boosts some of the greatest props I've seen in a while. I absolutely hated the photographs of the dead. They're old and yellowed and the most important photograph made me want to hide behind my cushion. The film also doesn't have any special effects or elaborate CG images. It's all atmosphere and mood, and it works very, very well. This is a brilliant and subtle horror movie that is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock is everywhere in this film. Perhaps that's what makes it a quality film. Once again, we have proof in our hands that there's no need for violence or gore to shock the audience. Tension is built gradually, while some angles and cuts increase the adrenaline levels. All the actors deliver memorable performances and, having been cast by true experts, embody perfectly their characters. The plot flows smoothly, except some necessary elements that lead to the grand finale. I think this film will eventually stand the test of time and will be considered a true masterpiece of the genre!</fullReview>

Nicole Kidman has probably gained from her traumatic events with Tom Cruise. She acts with a nerve she hasn't shown before.

		<fullReview>I watched The Others last night having heard rave reviews. I must say that I wasn't disappointed.The film is extremely atmospheric, the children's medical aversion to light conveniently making it very dark and very spooky. Don't expect to be scared out of your wits. With the exception of a couple of moments, this film doesn't make you jump out of your seat. It does however make you feel very uneasy and there are moments of suspense where you want to look away from the screen.The Others proves that you don't need to spend millions on CGI or Special Effects to make a good film. The extraordinary twist in the tale is hinted at quite often but I didn't guess it before it was revealed. The characters are padded, believable and likeable.Now that I know the story twist it will be hard to enjoy the movie a second time but it's well, well, worth seeing if like me you've managed to avoid somebody spoiling the surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It's fun to notice that in these recent years of ultra-expensive special effects the power of suggestion and good acting (very powerful performances of Nicole Kidman as the mother and Alakina Mann and James Bentley as her daughter and son) can still be very effective in frightening audiences. The twist that Amenabar gives to the traditional haunted house theme in this movie is -to my knowledge- quite original. This interesting plot in combination with the whole atmosphere of the movie and the excellent acting makes The Others a very entertaining experience. In an effort to create a nice sound bite and trying not to spoil the movie, I'll describe The Others as a movie in which The Sixth Sense meets The Haunting (the original, of course).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, Tender and Refreshing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautifully constructed film, which relies on suspense and psychological inference to convey its romantic brand of terror. There is no question that there is Hitchcock here, but so to are there influences from the 1940's 'Gaslight' and a host of other romantic ghost stories from this era.The film is as much a tragedy as it is wilfully frightening and Kidman's isolation and despair whose only respite is her desperate adherence to strict religious piety is powerful and heart wrenching.Emotional turmoil and spiritual awakening have always complimented each other well but here the relationship between them is pulled off with great originality and flair.Strong performances all round pull this essentially simple film (note the short credits to cast and crew at the end) up a level and certainly make it a contender for one of these years' best films.In the 1940's directors relied on the psychology of fear tapping into the emotions and often-subconscious fear of an apparently fast secularising society. The loosening of censorship guidelines brought us the Hammer genre of increasing gore and a sexual dimension. Sadly the mixture of psychology and gore which peaked in the mid 1970's deteriorated so that by the 1980's we were treated to a blood bath which was disturbing but quite frankly cheap, vacuous and most of all not very scary. The postmodern outlook of Wes Craven was certainly refreshing but The Others like 6th Sense resurrects a genre where fear and emotion intertwine. Where impact is complex and haunting for loss of a better word. Rightly so, the modern cinemagoer is both educated and complex something which Hollywood would do well to understand and in this case has. Cool, intelligent, thought provoking and tender The Others is a fine attempt at resuscitating the golden age of the romantic ghost story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is that it looks really good. A brilliant gothic atmosphere envelops the entire production and the acting is first rate, but it doesn't quite all come together, I can't say exactly what it is missing, but it just adds up to less than the sum of it's parts. ***What follows are not exactly SPOILERS, but what I have to say will probably help you work out the ending even easier than you would have.***Think of the ending to the overrated THE SIXTH SENSE, remember that? good, now think, maybe even more so, of the ending to the underrated HAUNTED(the one with Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale), there's your ending, maybe you won't guess every tiny detail, but you will have pretty much worked it out early on. Making it even worse is the fact that the movie seems to be trying it's hardest to give away the ending at every opportunity, the children are firing off clues every five minutes and the house keepers don't exactly make it any harder either.When are writers going to realize that you don't have to have a surprise ending every time(unless you have come up with something truly new), it's no longer a surprise if every movie has one, and when you know that there is a surprise ending before you see the film you invariably end up spending the running time of the film just trying to work out what the ending will be.THE OTHERS is still a good movie, certainly better than THE SIXTH SENSE, but there are better films in the haunted house/supernatural genre, such as THE CHANGELING, HAUNTED and THE HAUNTING(the 60's version).7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right. If you're thinking about going to see the film, and you've come here to read about it, don't bother. Stop right now and just go. It's very good, worth your money, and you're bound to come out of it with an opinion on it.(Spoilers ahead, so if you haven't seen it PLEASE don't read on)To anyone who has been, and especially those who've posted a comment, please wake up. I think this is a fantastic idea for a film, that completely takes you by surprise, IF YOU DON'T KNOW THERE'S A TWIST. I didn't and thought it was brilliant. I didn't see it coming, and thought it was completely original. And if you think it's too like the sixth sense, you're just wrong. in The Sixth Sense, dead people are all around, existing in the same world as the living. In The Others, the worlds only cross over occassionally. And The Sixth Sense is just blunt and obvious, ("I see dead people"?? Well there's the clue with a big flashing sign on it), The Others is much more subtle, using migraines as pointers, and that's about it. Everything else can be explained by ghosts, and, strangely, the living. However, you just don't think about that, unless you know there's a twist and are desperate enough to spend the length of a film trying to defeat it rather than just enjoy it. It's like the other comments on this film which say it's not scary. I guarantee these people don't find The Exorcist scary either, just the latest straight-to-video slasher that gives big jumps, but no psychological impact. Films like that never leave a lasting impression. The Others and The Exorcist will be thought about for days afterwards.So, if you've read this little piece and are still not convinced, please don't just go to a film with the aim of "beating it". You might just end up enjoying it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kidman' moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why some people get shocked by Nicole Kidman' performance at this film? It is really unaccountable. Are your eyes wide shut?Excepting Dead Calm, where she was demanded to show some centimeters of her splendid anatomy -and never it was too much at the movie- Hawaian born girl demonstrates to cinema and theater spectators her gifts like entire actress. She did it at Batman Forever, To Die For, The Portrait of a Lady and, of course, Eyes Wide Shut, between others solids works.I didn't watch Arthur Schnitzler' play The Blue Room (La ronde) but people who did, said she deserved to win the Golden Globe to Best Actress. She made representations to Londoners and New Yorkers till exhaustion -she got a laryngitis- of five different roles.Being making Los otros in a wet location at Palacio de los Hornillos, Spain, she felt the effects of a injury in a knee after the efforts in a Can-Can dancing-girl part at Moulin Rouge previously interpreted. She flown to L.A., USA, to be cured and came back again to Spanish set till the end of shot.And all that only a very professional actress is capable of doing for. So don't' be so surprised by her actuation at this film. Many spectators, the wisdom ones, were seen this moment -the Kidman moment- would came. And here is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once upon a time there was a young Spanish Director who had a sixth sense for ghost stories!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OTHERS, I must reluctantly admit has its moments. However, it is not a "classic" horror film, it isn't in fact a classic anything. It is a well photographed, flawed psychological thriller, a tad low on thrills.The "Once upon a time" opening is a major mistake first-up as it telegraphs clues to the point of striking the viewer between the shoulder blades..."excuse me....this is a clue!!" A curious threesome, by way of Mrs Mills, mute Lydia and gardner Mr Ed Tuttle (the rarest of oddball roles for Brit once-was-a-funnyman, Eric Sykes) turn up at her door, curiously just as she is looking to replace the last help which disappeared into the night. Successful in gaining employment (or re-employment as it turns out, hint, hint!) Mrs Mills and the audience are introduced to Kidman's light-sensitive children, feisty daughter Anne and mega-wuss, her younger son Nicholas.For most of the remainder of the film, well actually....nothing really happens when you come to think of it! Doors slam, we are given to believe that Anne sees dead people, the sound effects crew are given carte blanche to wring every last wrench, rip, tinkle, slam, shriek and ghostly presence you could hope for. Oh, and her lost-at-war husband turns up during a sequence that blatantly telegraphs what's going down here, IF you're paying attention.Now, it has been common knowledge from both critiques and advance press on the flick, that it borrows heavily from the SIXTH SENSE (a better film in my opinion) and therefore I would have thought the general outcome would be obvious to most anyone, the only question is - which?????? The film answers this poser long before the last few scenes which subsequent to the denouement, are actually the best in the film. For my money, Nicole Kidman though credible mostly, yet almost 40's Crawford at times, is just over the top and downright "hammy" once in a while. Her best scenes are undeniably at the conclusion of the film. Fionulla Flanagan is flawless as the kindly housekeeper Mrs Mills and simply acts Kidman off the screen....sorry fans! Alakina Mann all but matches her stride for scream as the daughter with attitude and a rather fetching look beneath that veil!*****POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD *****Clues are littered throughout, with such ludicrous gems as "Mummy's gone mad...again!" and multiple references to "that night." Even if you DO work out the basic premise and I have to be honest, I did quite early (Half is obvious almost immediately....the other half later!) the "actual" explanation at the end is acceptable without necessarily being logical - you can put up half a dozen "Yeah, but what about's" In the end, not so much derivative of the sixth sense but an arguable rip-off, dove-tailed with Henry James concepts in TURN OF THE SCREW. The latter being filmed in 1961 as THE INNOCENTS which leaves this for dead (excuse the pun!) Chilean born Amenobar has undeniably turned out an "interesting" film (only his third) with strong European influences, never more obvious than from Aguirresarobe's gothic-inspired cinematography. The buzz that THE OTHERS may be in Oscar contention, may be a little premature. One person could well live with that, is Executive Producer, the ex Mr Kidman, Tom "let me get on with my life" Cruise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time I got around to seeing this movie, many of my friends had already been to see it, so I had a pretty good idea of the spread of opinions out there. Some claimed it was the best thing since sliced bread, but upon examination, it turned out most of these people were self-confessed Nicole Kidman fans. And hey, us Aussies tend to be a bit parochial at the best of times. But an upswelling of opinion worldwide that's enough to propel this movie into the IMDb's top 250 is something you simply can't ignore.The first thing I noticed about this movie as a whole was the art direction. The cinematography was not necessarily anything to write home about--it was above workmanlike, but not as outstanding as other films I've seen this year--but the set design, the layout, the costumes, the lighting, the sheer *beauty* of this film really made me sit up and take notice.Perhaps unfortunately, for me art direction is a means by which plot can be expressed. In films where it's appropriate to think about the plot (and as a cerebral horror/suspense movie, this one falls squarely in that category), Plot Is King. SPOILERS AHEADOkay, if you're still reading and you don't want to ruin any surprises, STOP NOW!!! Right. When we reach the end of the movie, we learn that Nicole went mad and smothered both her children before shooting herself with a rifle. They've been seeing 'ghosts' throughout the movie, but these 'ghosts' are actually real live people that have moved into the house. At first only the Nicole's little girl can see them, but as the truth becomes more apparent, that the only real ghosts are the protagonists themselves (and their servants, but that's a side-plot), the real people become properly visible.Obviously, this is always going to draw parallels with The Sixth Sense...and if you haven't seen *that* movie and don't want it ruined, stop reading now too! Bruce Willis discovers he's dead at the end of that movie--murdered by an intruder to the house he shares with his wife. Some have said that The Others handles the revelation better, others have said it's worse. I fall into the latter camp. The thing is, when you're watching The Others, you're wondering where it's going throughout the entire movie. There's no sense of purpose. There's definite interest, and you don't get bored, but there's no secondary plot to keep the audience engrossed in a storyline, nothing to stop them from picking the movie apart at each step. The psychologist/patient relationship between Bruce and Haley in Sixth Sense offers that. Plus you get a greater sense of backstory in the history of Willis' character's life.Also, unlike Sixth Sense, The Others refrains from having subtle pointers to the real truth. Instead, it opts for one big pointer, and then a lot of red herrings. Where the path to the truth in Sixth Sense was obvious once you knew how, the path to the truth in The Others is littered with what appear at first glance to be inconsistencies and plot holes. Put simply, I preferred Sixth Sense on its ability to *draw* the audience into the storyline, to bring out an interest in the characters' situations and for its masterful working of the backdrop behind it. Sixth Sense is a less beautiful movie, that much is true. However, there are so many little things that could have tipped you off to the truth in it.Sixth Sense brushes you lightly with a feather every now and then in an effort to make you see the chicken. The Others tries to bludgeon you with the entire chicken once or twice and then throws fish at you just to make you think about something else for a while. Having said all that, it's still a very good movie, and one I'd recommend going to see. A pity that it's just not quite as good as it might have been.Pros: Atmospheric, beautiful, highly suspenseful, and well worth going to see. Plus the two kids are the best I've seen on screen since...well...Haley Joel Osment, really. Cons: It just doesn't *quite* get there. Likely Oscar nominations: Largest budgetary allocation for light bulbs, 2001. Verdict: If Sixth Sense was on the highest salary in the country, The Others can still put its kids through private school, university and afford braces for them both. However, it'll never afford the mansion on the hill. Good...but could have been better. 7? out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this after my work colleagues had been saying how good it was and how they were surprised it was only a "12" certificate. What I saw was 2 hours of complete boredom. It shouldn't have been a "12"..... a "PG" would have been more appropriate. After about 80 minutes I turned to my wife and suggested that the final 40 minutes must be really good to redeem the film ..... but it wasn't !! It was about as jumpy as a frog with no legs !! Massive 2 out of 10 just for being able to see Eric Sykes on screen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever plot but not that scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this I thought it was going to be a classic haunted house story, I was expecting an updated version of "The Haunting" (1963), creaking doors and shadowy figures. What I got was similar but it didn't seem to flow as well, I seemed to be waiting for the next spooky scene, though when they appeared I wasn't disappointed. I was expecting a spectacular twist in the plot and I wasn't let down, its a very clever idea. The film isn't really a haunted house story its more of a look at ghosts and well I can't say anymore without spoiling the ending but all the scenes are leading up to the clever twist at the end. Overall a very clever and original film but not really a horror. But still 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie in a generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big claim? Well yes and no. Firstly I should define what I DON'T mean by horror - men in rubber suits or teenagers with outsized cutlery. If these movies were ever scary it was in the early 1980s when 'Alien' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' defined those particular genres to such an extent that no one has ever matched their standard. What I consider horror is something much more subtle and far older - the fears that we all carry inside of us whether we admit it or not.The terror of death; the ache of loneliness; the fear of a believer that there might not be a God, the worry of the most convinced atheist that there may well be one; the committed rationalist who outwardly denies the unknowable; the constant temptation of evil - those have been the staples of horror from the dawn of time and they still have the power to influence us. Who hasn't lain awake in the small hours with their heart pounding? Has anyone not glanced behind them when walking down a lonely country road? Is there anyone who can honestly say that they haven't thought of doing something that they know to be wrong - just for the sake of it?Unfortunately these ideas have been out of fashion for a long time. No one has come close to the superb horror of Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' which made a terrifying movie out of banging on the walls and a shaky staircase. Perhaps it is only 'The Blair Witch Project' that has recently attempted a minimalist approach to horror, but that film could not hope to live up to its advance hype and consequently was something of a disappointment. Fortunately 'The Others' arrived in the UK with mercifully little hype and is something of an unknown quantity.'The Others' takes the staples of a traditional ghost story from the pen of M.R. James and most particularly from Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw' and produces something that manages to be very familiar and at the same time wholly original. The opening is a wholly discordant voice from childhood radio 'Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.' It is the end of 1945, the war in Europe has ground to a halt and a world where the living and the dead are intertwined is trying to recover from the devastation. A young family is trying to settle into a large old house, unsure if the soldier father is alive or dead. The opening shot follows Grace (Nichole Kidman) as she walks to answer the front door. There she finds three servants looking for positions in the rambling house. Apparently the previous household staff had got up and left the house without rhyme or reason, Grace escorts the three through the house, insisting with fragile urgency that they always remember to lock doors after them.She offers to introduce her children Anne and Nicholas to the new housekeeper, Mrs. Mills. This is the first of many deeply unsettling moments. The curtains *MUST* be draw and lamps lit. Grace disappears into the children's bedroom and wakes them; what monstrous things are going to emerge? The suspense is drawn out until breaking point and then Grace reappears with two angelic looking children. not for the last time the movie throws you off your balance. The children suffer from a form of acute photosensitivity preventing them ever experiencing daylight, hence the locked doors and shuttered windows. These are the simple props used to support everything that follows.People and a place on the edge of reality begin to slip into another world entirely. Doors open and close of their own accord, the protective curtains are thrown open, furniture moves, a piano plays in the middle of the night and Anne claims to have seen other people in the house. Throughout, Grace tries to reconcile events with her own deeply-held Catholicism, a terrifying construct where Hell and Purgatory are very close at hand. It is this belief that comes under attack, gradually at first, but as the movie progresses, her world begins to crumble. With control always shifting towards the increasingly sinister Mrs. Mills.A slight tale to be sure, but then the best horror stories only provide a skeleton (real or metaphorical) for our own fears.The house is just as much a character as the human beings that live in within; it appears to be adrift from the rest of the World. There might well be a world beyond the massive wall but equally there might be nothing at all. With the curtains constantly drawn the house is filled with a perpetual twilight, but even those times when we are able to glimpse through the windows there is precious little to see with an unchanging grey fog shrouding the autumn countryside. The movie reeks of death; there is persistent question of whether father is alive or dead; the belongings of departed former occupants are covered by shroud-like dust sheets, antique photographs of unknown people (including a particularly macabre photograph album) look out from shelves, whilst the garden is covered with autumnal leaves. Mortality is a presence in the house, even the hope of an afterlife is coloured by Grace's firm belief in the fate awaiting sinners and the less penitent.Nicole Kidman is as pale, brittle and delicate as porcelain in the role of Grace. As her grasp on the control of the house slips with ever-increasing speed, her world begins to falter and it is entirely possible that Grace will shatter under the pressure. She believes in a loving God yet he appears to shun her when she needs him most, whilst the fight against evil appears to have robbed Grace of her husband. Outwardly she tries to maintain the restrained chill expected of an upper-class woman in the 1940s, yet inwardly this is a loving mother and distraught wife, desperate for some form of emotional support.The children are central to the film - there is none of the preternatural adulthood offered by Haley Joel Osment, these are very real children. Nicholas (James Bentley) is at the age where he is stilltrusting of everyone and tied firmly to his mother, a very real innocent. Anne (Alakina Bentley) is older, just at the stage where she is starting to show independence and at an age where children are capable of very real cruelty. Much of the narrative is driven by Anne's interactions with the remainder of the cast, and Bentley proves more than adequate for the task, sometimes frighteningly adult, at other times a helpless child.The servants are characters from the pages of Dickensian fiction, the slightest of the roles is Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) a disconcerting mute who clearly knows something about the house's past, but cannot, or will not let on. Eric Sykes plays Mr Tuttle the gardener and manages to cast off a long history of comedy roles to give a subtle, almost otherwordly performance. However it is Fionnula Flanaghan's Mrs Mills who provides the counterweight to Grace. She gradually unveils herself as the movie progresses, starting off as the sweet-smiling, efficient servant, but slowly transforming into the centre of power in the house; threatening, all-knowing and truly terrifying. Mrs. Mills is a worthy successor to Judith Anderson's legendary Mrs. Danvers from Daphne du Maurier's 'Rebecca'.Extraordinarily, this very British movie is directed by Spanard - Alejandro Amenabar who has redefined the genre with complete mastery much like Ang Lee's take on 'Sense and Sensibility'.'The Others' is an astonishingly beautifully made movie. Each scene is set and lit like an oil painting. Shadows and the darkness play just as important a role as the warm glow from oil lamps and the fires. Daylight where it is allowed to intrude is a frigid blue-white colour, bleaching life and colour from everything it touches. Sound plays an important part in telling the story, there are plenty of minor chords and shrieking strings to set your nerves on edge, but it is the quiet that is the most memorable. Entire scenes are played out in near silence serving to heighten the almost unbearable tension of the latter part of the movie.So is the movie scary? Undoubtedly yes, the pacing is perfect with enough false climaxes and unexpected shocks to keep even the most demanding horror fan happy. It takes its time to set up all of the pieces, but as the whole story is put into place, the screw is gradually being tightened. Situations becomes increasingly claustrophobic, Grace's nerve falters and Mrs. Mills appears to feed on her weakness - where is it leading?Fortunately the end of the story is extremely satisfying and comes quite unexpectedly. In retrospect, or on a second viewing you will see all of the clues to the solution littered through the narrative, but none are so obvious that you will put the whole thing together until the director is ready for you. Oh and I didn't sit comfortably at all.</fullReview>

I must confess I was not able predict any part of the plot.But the plot is very vulnerable, you know.

I agree with others when you say it wasn't a very original storyline, but they have tried to make it into something original by taking a base idea and changing it slightly.

		<fullReview>Is it really so bad for a film-maker to re-explore an old idea? If the game of predicting the end of a movie becomes too easy, try watching for a different reason. Narrative in a ghost story is always more important than plot anyway - it's in the telling.For the record, the parallel being drawn by many is incomplete: in The 6th Sense, Cole was alive and saw dead people, in The Others, Anne is dead and the 'intruders' that she sees (and we see later) are living people.Incidentally, I wonder if Kidman shared Ewan McGregor stories with Christopher Eccleston and Keith Allen. She seems to be co-starring her way through the entire Shallow Grave cast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe the number of comparisons here with Sixth Sense.. I regard that film as being brilliant for its story and its twist but on seeing this one, I never even thought about Sixth Sense until now. Just because they have a similar idea doesnt mean that it blackmarks this film one bit and the shock from this twist fat outstripped the one from the other film.Simply put, this on first glance seems like a strandard horror tale told slowly and carefully and doesnt *seem* to have anything special about it until you see the point of it all at the end. While other users have posted spoilers, I have no intention of doing so but this is one of those films that shows how much it shines when you *think* back on what you saw through the film. Just like Sixth Sense, the twist raises the film to new heights. The acting and cinematics are brilliant as is the mood throughout the film and it gives a new *perspective* in horror films - a perspective not told many times before to my knowledge.Heartily recommended as a benchmark for future horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Not unlike the Sixth Sense starring Bruce Willis, this movie illustrates the existence of alternate existences or parallel universes/worlds/dimensions colliding and infringing upon each other.Nicole Kidman's part is one in which she remained in denial of her own death (change in dimension), until proven otherwise by those in that dimension.To fully understand the concepts illustrated therein, it is usually necessary to understand quantum physicists who believe in alternate realities/universes/worlds/dimensions, etc., or to have actually experienced same.The movie is much appreciated for going out on a limb in that respect and is also considered "fiction with a purpose" since it teaches truths to those who are ready and/or willing to accept truths. Otherwise, it's just another scary movie containing a lot of darkness and fear.Aside from quantum physicists' theories in re parallel universes, etc., there are some spiritual references to alternate realities, as well. One being from the teacher Jesus, his statement, "In my Father's house there are many mansions".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film which could have otherwise ended up as another run-of-the-mill horror (see scathing critique of Jeepers Creepers by yours truly) generates instead into a masterpiece of modern-day cinema. The story unfolds in an excellent manner, allowing the viewer no chance to question what will occur subsequently, but only to absorb every piece of information thrown to them, and to try to decypher what it is actually taking place. The end is excellently thought through and transforms the entire film from a shock-horror into a well crafted tale of misinterpretation and retrospective reasoning.I felt the acting throughout was strong, with especial mention to Nicole Kidman, who not only commanded the English accent and demeanour of the mother brilliantly, but also gave to the audience a character whom they could follow, as we discover the truth as she does. The children were entirely convincing, and delivered their lines with the skills of someone much older and more experienced. And the appearance of the great English comedian Eric Sykes really brought the atmosphere home. An excellent film which I heartly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>all I can say is WOW!I was completely taken aback by this fab little thriller which actually spooked me!I went to see this yesterday and didnt really know what to expect-having only a 12 certificate I thought it wouldnt scare me and so went along anyway!I could not take my eyes from the screen throughout the entire movie-some say it was too slow but i really didnt notice anything slow and thought that the time flew by!The build up of tension was great and the whole film had a really edgey and spooky feel to it and then every so often there was a shock moment that made the entire audience jump from their seats!Nicole Kidman was amazing as were actually all the characters-particularly the two children who were really convincing. But the last 20 minutes of this film were the best-some say it ripped off another film *not mentioning any names* but i DID NOT think so. I really saw the first part of the twist coming and was disappointed thinking that this was the major twist-BUT then the twist arrived and smacked me on the head and i'm sure my jaw dropped to the ground! overall this movie is soooo good and much better than the average slasher as it has far more brains and actually builds up the scares rather than relying on gore infested scenes! see it NOW or you will regret missing it on the large screens-dont go alone! ***** 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mother on the edge and her two children in a creepy fogbound house, complete with odd servants. The film creates a rising atmosphere of oppressive, paranoid dread that makes you feel genuinely uncomfortable and disturbed. Kidman's performance is faultless as a woman who appears to be teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Her highly strung characterisation only serves to complement the sense of foreboding that flows through the film. Brilliantly, the film gives nothing away, and throws nothing at you, but leaves you to do the work - acknowledging that the viewer's imagination is far more vivid than any film-maker's art. Very little, physically, happens in the film - but by the end you feel as if you have run a marathon. The final denouement is something to behold - and will have a certain director of 6th sense weeping into his morning coffee. BRILLIANT. WATCH THIS THIS FILM!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched this film I had the same feeling I had when I watched Gattaca. The movie has an excellent plot, but something was missing. I don´t know if it was the actors, the editing or something else, but I surely know that the movie could have been a lot better. Me and the friends that watched the film together even laughed at several scenes. I think that in a good horror film this isn´t suposed to happen. But the plot is surely a good one: the point of view of the ghosts, the intrudors being the living etc. Well as I said, good plot, median movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A traditional ghost story that lacks impact.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Others' is, in essence, a typical ghost story. Swirling mist, eerie green light and mysterious piano playing all contribute to creating an effective ambience in which the characters experience strange going-ons.Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, lives in a large isolated house on the island of Jersey in 1945. Her two children suffer from an allergy to light, doors are kept locked and curtains drawn in Grace's attempt to protect Anne and Nicholas from the sun's rays. (As a result much of the film is in dim light and the suspense is built up with the fumbling of keys trying to get in and out of rooms.) When three 'visitors' turn up at the house Grace receives them in and is grateful that they can now take the place of the servants who `mysteriously disappeared a few days ago'. Unfortunately not all her problems are solved when she discovers there are 'intruders' in the house.The Others is not a bad film, on the contrary, the acting is faultless, the atmosphere suitably chilling and certain touches in particular are very effective; such as Grace's frantic search for the intruders to the backdrop of her daughter's bible reading, and the beautiful image of Grace as she stands against the wrought iron gates. The story line does, however, lack the structure and definition which have made similar films (namely The Sixth Sense) so memorable. The film seems to waver somewhere in the middle and as it nears the end the audience are almost craving a final momentous twist. When delivered, though, it fails to give the 'punch' that is expected and leaves the viewer less than satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although"The Sixth Sense" was a very good movie, the histrionics it generated were largely due to the performance of the child actor, and the supposedly unguessable twist. "The Others" has two marvellous child performances, two hammer-blow twists and Nicole Kidman in a display that is in my opinion, the best by an actress since Frances McDormand's Oscar in 'Fargo'. And yet it is not as if the film needs such a performance to carry it. Everything, from the lighting, to the fluidity of the camera, and the mesmerising music, knits perfectly to a truly magnificent whole. I hope it gets the credit it deserves come oscar nomination time. The first real must-see film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy ghost story in the best tradition...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Jersey at the end of World war 2 and filmed in Spain, The Others is a good old-fashioned ghost story with all the classic ingredients - tinkling pianos in deserted rooms, doors that slam themselves shut, strange whisperings and sinister servants. The film is lifted onto another level, largely due to a superb performance by Nicole Kidman, ably supported by an excellent cast.Like 'The Sixth Sense', the film is deliberately slow, ponderous and very atmospheric with finely judged 'scary' moments. The twist at the end is totally unforseen and very effective, though as with the Sixth sense, it doesnt really stand up to close scrutiny. A very welcome change from the tedium of latex-filled monsters, gore and computer generated fx.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really cool Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This really surprised me. When I saw ads for it I thought what a load of tripe. Another Horror movie which makes you laugh like crazy. Seen enough of those thanks. This isn't really a horror movie though either its more of a suspense thriller. And it really did keep me in suspense the whole movie through. I do think however the experience would be greatly diminished if not seen on a big screen with great sound. As far as strong points go this had lots really I thought the story was good it really was interesting and held you just in the right place to knock you over at the ending also kept you guessing the whole way through. The Atmosphere was also very good with only simple directing and not many amazing camera shots. The acting surprised me the most because I have not liked Kidman at all up to this point. She just seems so weak and pathetic normally but in this she really holds up very well and plays a very convincing paranoid mother. Finally I think this movie deserves Brownie points just for this, I hate movies where the director and the writers all conspire against you to completely obscure a truth and send you're mind of in a million different wild goose chases to find out whodunnit or whats going on only to turn around at the end and 'surprise' you and contradict all the feeling of the rest of the film just so the director can be right you can be wrong and you can't say oh well I knew that was going to happen. However in this movie there is a big twist in the end and it does sort of bend from the feeling of the rest of the movie but with a subtle twist which is very clever and innovative if not inventive. You'll have to see the movie to see what I mean though. By the way the movie is not fast but I really like slow paced movies. I pay good money to watch films and I don't expect to be whisked out of the theatre ASAP. I gave it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of Suspense and Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film was the best horror film I've seen in ages. The performances were excellent. All of them, were able to relay the subtleties and depth of their screen personalities to a great extent. The set lent itself very well to a film of this nature; the spooky old mansion and the ever present fog helps to create a feeling of isolation and an out of this world quality.The only thing I would say about this film is that it was a bit too similar to sixth sense and so i can see why there are so many comparisons. It is just a shame that The Others was not released first because it is a far superior film. Sixth Sense relies too much on that typical Hollywood over-sentimentality which, rather than make you warm to the characters more, actually makes you want them to get it. The Others conformed less to the Hollywood stereotype, the characters were not wholly likeable but ALL had enough depth and mystery that you were really interested in finding out what happened to them so . This also meant that the film had less need for special effects to keep the audience interested. Also, the slow pace of the film, in my mind, actually made the film as it built up the suspense . In that way it reminded me of blair witch. you never actually see anything in Blair Witch but that is it's strongest point; you are always imagining what might just be around the corner..... I think the fear of the unknown can be very scary and these 2 films portray this to great effect.I think you need to have a vivid imagination to enjoy The Others as you never actually see anything,. If you are someone that is not affected by something until it is hitting you in the face then this film is not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole Kidman is having a good year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is a scary and well-executed ghost story with a great script and excellent acting. It seems that Nicole Kidman is having a great year movie-wise despite the split-up with tom cruise, putting in her best performance to date (in my opinion) in this movie. The character of Grace is complex and of a nature not often seen in movies. She is elegant yet near-hysterical at times, with a hint of mystery about her that suggests she is not what she seems, which of course she isn't. The brilliant twist at the end (which works a lot better than that of The Sixth Sense) would probably lead people to hate Grace if she wasn't played with the skill that Kidman uses. She carries the movie and gives her character the extra layer of emotion that cannot be written in words and is the resposibility of the actor. The film has some very scary moments. Though it is slow to start, the movie would not have worked at all with the fast pace of most horror movies which takes away all scariness. The Others becomes downright creepy at times (ie the part with the old lady with the girl's voice, and when the servants are standing at the door to the house after the first twist) and the scary parts only come when they are needed to advance the story. Fionulla Flannigan makes a great semi-sinister nanny, with just the right amount of menace mixed in with friendly motherly qualities.The children give very apt performances, particularly the girl, although the boy is occasionally grating. The Others does have a few humorous moments. One part in which the little girl informs her mother that only children who haven't been baptised can go to limbo, is quite funny and the expression on Kidman's face is classic, as she displays the comic ability and timing that was ever-present in To Die For. Overall, The Others is definitely worth watching (a few times even) and contains some scary moments that actually make a lot of people in the audience scream aloud, and top-class performances. I really think Kidman will get an oscar nomination for this, and Flannigan has a chance as supporting actress. The photography was brilliant too and sacrifices flashy visuals for moody shots and ambience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An ambitious disappointment, "The Others" is one reason why I hardly take word-of-mouth from critics and viewers, positive and negative alike, into account when I go to the movies. Directed by Alejandro Amenabar (and featuring an executive producer credit for Tom Cruise), this film's strong points include solid but unspectacular acting that is enhanced by the cinematography and production design that nicely enhance a foreboding, isolated English mansion and spacious surrounding grounds (which were all filmed on location in Spain), but it is overshadowed by its incredibly slow pace and thin, recycled plot (which unfortunately has led to inevitable conclusions to "The Sixth Sense"). It is backed up by a flimsy score that descends into silliness during tense moments, thus killing their effectiveness.As she should, Nicole Kidman provides the film's best performance as Grace, who, despite the insistence of her young daughter (Alakina Mann), refuses to believe that there may be ghosts inhabiting her house, where she pines away every day while waiting for her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) to return home from the war.She takes in three new servants - a codger (Eric Sykes), a mute (Elaine Cassidy), and a crone (Fionnula Flanagan, who, for some reason, reminded me of the maid portrayed by Hermione Baddeley in "Mary Poppins"), after her previous help mysteriously disappears, but there is a lot more to this strange trio than she could possibly imagine.Mann and James Bentley, respectively, make their first big screen appearances as Anne and Nicholas, two youngsters who have a potentially fatal allergy to light - or who are "photosensitive," as Grace verbalizes it - which results in an exhausting routine to make sure every door and shutter in the house is always shut and every curtain always drawn. It's a subplot that doesn't have much of an impact on the film as a whole.Despite "The Others" being hailed for its suspense factor, all the suspense is couched into the last thirty minutes. The early scenes in which Anne insists that there are indeed supernatural visitors lurking about (in particular a little boy named Victor), which lead to Grace's eventual inspection of her surroundings, have no punch at all - save for one sequence in which Grace discovers an old photo album - because it's too predictable and...well, boring. It's something we've all seen a million times before. The music repeatedly hams up the "scare that's not really there" schtick, which quickly became tiresome.But there's no denying the impact of the ending, which saves "The Others" from becoming a total disaster and what makes the needle spin on the adrenalin meter. I can't speak for everyone, of course, nor will I reveal any details, but the unexpected swerve completely dispelled anything I had theorized.One thing that this film should be commended for, despite its failure in the scare department, is the fact that it succeeds for the most part in presenting a ghost story that doesn't rely on intense special effects or blood and gore (in fact, there's not one drop of the red stuff to be seen anywhere), instead relying on good old fashioned storytelling.While "The Others" didn't work for me - and don't knock me for not understanding the plot; I grasped it plenty, thank you - it definitely will do the trick for horror/suspense fans who are sick of the ineptitude of dreck like the "Scream" series and who yearn for the days of good ghost stories once shared around the campfire. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a plea for visceral enjoyment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I'd just like to say I've read many of the other comments here, and I do not understand why some people feel the need to belittle the intelligence of those who enjoyed a film, when they themselves did not. Enjoyment of a film can be visceral - it gets you in the gut, your adrenaline rushes, or you may be overcome with waves of inexplicable dread or melancholy. This kind of enjoyment does not need to be intellectualised - it is felt or it isn't. Even a technically bad film can produce such affects in some members of its audience.So your wife fell asleep in the film, and you were bored. Does this make you a superior being to the people who sank low in their seats, voraciously absorbing the gloomy atmosphere, and feeling our insides turn to ice water? I fell asleep once in Jean Luc Godard's 'Breathless' (however I've managed to stay awake during Tarkovsky films - no mean feat according to some). And yet that film is considered a masterpiece by many. It just didn't resonate with me.Anyway, I think you can tell that I loved 'The Others'. It's haunted me all weekend. I saw some things coming but resisted the temptation to 'second guess' the plot, allowing the film to reveal itself to me in its own time. The children - let's not compare them to Haley Joel Osment for that kid is a freak of nature - were pinched faced and touching, reminding me of my relationship with my own malleable younger brother when we were that age, and I could make him believe anything (hehehehe).In a time when most films with a supernatural bent rely on what is seen and what horrors can be made visible through special effects, it was refreshing to find a film which relied on what was hidden. It was more about sound than vision. I'll be seeing it again, hoping to recapture some of the delicious ambivalent dread of my first viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of Movies, the year 2001 has had a shocker, yet one film named "The Others" finally worked the so far- bad year out. The Others was a film based in the 1940's during the war, the house is haunted by "Intruders", the mother (Nicole Kidman) resides with her son and daughter, the daughter often complains of seeing "Ghosts" in the house. The chill factor in this film is pretty low, yet one with patience must watch this film.The Others is a ghost film after all, so dont expect blood and gore, if thats what your looking for...Jason, Freddy &amp; Michael are all waiting at your local video store, this movie was scary, not frightening but the eerie camerawork and environment was enough for me. In terms of the plot, it was very well thought of, the script was fabulously written and the acting was flawless, what more could i say? This film deserves to be in the top 5 movies of this year, infact...Number ONE is a good number!ACTING: The acting was fabulous in "The Others", infact it was Flawless, especially by Nicole Kidman, such beauty portrayed on film, also the kids did a good job, especially the young girl, delightful to watch!ACTORS: Good, a few new faces in this film, but definantley not to waste, Nicole Kidman doesen't chose the best movies, but this time around she made the RIGHT choice, good range of actors, and good new-comers.SCRIPT: Terrific, this movie couldn't live without its great script, everything flowed in very well with the movie, the film had a dramatic twist at the end, could be predictable, but worth the wait.CINEMA: Brilliant, the use of the fog effects was breathtaking, the mansion was fantastic, the use of lights was brilliant, the camera-work was top notch material! Awards must be won.SUSPENSE: Quiet low unfortunantley, yet it is a ghost movie, it did have a couple of jumps, yet most of the film could be said to be "Slow Paced", yet the thrills actually make you jump they are very effective the moment they approach.MUSIC/FX: Nice, especially during the scenes where Nicole Kidman gets tormented by the ghosts, the music was used well and the music did add to the suspence, very enjoying.OVERALL: "The Others" is definantley better than "Sixth Sense", infact the Sixth Sense was way over-rated, this film is much better. It developed a better plot and much better twist at the end, the only complaint some would have was the pacing of the film, a slow start, yet viewers are rewarded with the MANY upsides of this gret film.**** (4 STARS)</fullReview>

Without a single doubt, one of the 10 scariest movies ever made, but without the use of gore and other foul-tasting methods devised to make the audience hurl. On the technical view, the movie is superb, the lighting is great, as well as the acting and directing. A must see for any fan of the genere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I've seen this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is, by far, the best movie I've seen this year, and I haven't seen a lot of good movies this year. "Traffic" was awesome, "Pearl Harbor" was good... but "The Others" is the best. I usually go to the movies with my mind packed with everything about the movie I'm about to see. But this didn't happen to me with "The Others". I didn't even know who was in it!!! A friend told me: "It seems to be nice, Nicole Kidman is in it". Well, I gave it a try, and I thank my friend for the tip. It scared me since the very beginning (you'll know why), it captured my attention since the first minute and it didn't let me go. It doesn't, actually. It's still stuck in my head. By the way, I've seen it twice.I'm not telling what the movie is about, you can find that in the plot summary link. I'm just telling you my comments about it, and my comment is, as I said it earlier, you should give it a try. Don't go to see it with the idea of watching "The Sixth Sense Part II", both movies are different. Don't go with the idea of trying to discover how it's going to end (to my point of view, you'll never find it out). Just go with the idea of getting into it, feel the atmosphere and have a great time. The spooky elements (it's not predictable as you may think), the great acting (the kids and the housemaid are superb in their acting, Oscar material, definitely), a great direction, a smooth photography and the ending sequence (which left all the audience shut) will do the rest. Go see it twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Electric Spine Tingler!. (Better than 'Sixth Sense')</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie to give me a couple of electric spooky shocks for a while. Excellent!. My only regret about seeing this movie is knowing it had a twist ending before I saw it... Had I not known this then I wouldn't have spent most of the movie trying to guess what it was.Other reviewers have compared it to 'The Sixth Sense' saying it ripped it off and in a way it did borrow a couple of ideas here and there but I thought it was far better and spookier. The acting in it is great as is the atmosphere of the movie. People have also complained about the slow moving nature of 'The Others' but this is what's required when creating an atmosphere otherwise you end up with silly movies like 'The Haunting' which didn't work because it was fast moving and it didn't have the right feel about it. The slower the better I say.All I can say is that in my mind its a pity that 'The Others' didn't come out before 'Sixth Sense'. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyment depends on imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen this movie and I cannot believe some of the negative comments by others here. The actors performances are all good, especially kidman who once again demonstrates her versatility and skill as an actress. The cinematography is excellent, bettered only by 'Traffic' this year IMHO.The screenplay and plot appear to be the bones of contention amongst others. As far as I am concerned, of any movie in recent times, what the viewer gets from this movie depends a lot on their personal imagination. There are no special effects; the suggestive camerawork, the intense acting and the subtle (deliberately) slow-burning storyline are designed to allow you plenty of room to scare yourself in your own imagination. The film is a masterpiece at building tension in the audiences minds. The visuals are intelligent in this regard, and the sometimes minimalist script contributes nicely at suggesting there is more to some characters than they let on.I can only assume that the people who have criticised the movie as 'drab' and 'slow-moving' are the kind of people with minimal attention span and inactive imaginations who don't enjoy reading books for much the same reasons that they dislike the movie.In my book, the best tension-builder since The Shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Ghost Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story develops inside a mansion; it's set in England in the 19th century. It starts off somewhat slow, but still it has the ability to grab the attention of the audience as the plot develops. Since the start of the movie, the tension is present and as the story expands the tension grows and becomes omniscient in the film, transmitting the message to the audience. It's an original ghost story. It also has the elements for a good horror film: the silence, the fog, the darkness, the house, , the doors, the trees, the pond, the cold, the elderly, the madness, the children, the graves, and the most morbid photographs. The director combined all these elements into a tasteful dish of the macabre!The Others is an interesting and intelligent ghost film. In the horror genre, ghost stories masterfully created are amazing because they are creepy and many times send the audience the full effect that only the beautiful genre, that is HORROR, can transmit.* * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kidman has been busy. The second film from this versatile actor in as many nights. While I fawned over last nights offering 'Moulin Rouge', I have to say that this left me feeling a little cheated. 'The Sixth Sense' had reminded us to think about a film while it's showing rather than after it has finished, or you may miss something important. This comes too soon after that wonderful film. The outcome too obvious and one too many ends not tied up evenly enough for my liking. Excellent performances from most though the children (bless them) were not up to anything like scratch, especially after seeing the likes of Haley Joel Osment at work. Jersey - 1945. Two sickly children and their mother are holed up in a mansion, never seeing the light of day due to a rare light sensitive condition. The husband had failed to return home from the war, though he does make a cursory appearance later on. It seems that they (and the servants) are not alone in the house. The eponymous 'Others' are visiting them. Much roaming about in the dark ensues and there is much made of locking doors and things that go bump in the night. Needless to say, in an effort to match the previously mentioned Shalaman picture, there is a surprise at the end. It may have stood in greater standing if it didn't if the truth be known. The audience is expecting a twist these days and these people should know this and not make the surprise so darned obvious. I worked it out early on and spent the rest of the picture waiting for it to be announced to everyone else. Nice locale, nice score, nice acting but shabby writing and the plot was thin to breaking in parts. A valiant effort, but an effort unrewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic ghost story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OTHERS (2001) Rating: 10/10Man, I have always loved ghost stories, and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever. It's like one of those great old black and white ghost stories but better. As it takes you on a slow, and uncomfortable ride. It's uncommon for movies these days to really absorb the viewer, but The Others succeeds at this quite capably. From the opening scenes (in which Grace lets loose with a bone-chilling shriek) you'll be sucked into this film, where there are more than a few good scares along the way.Nicole Kidman delivers her best performances to date as the haunted Grace. She was very believable in the part. The two kids in this film were also fantastic. Alakina Mann as Anne was terrific. She played the bullying sister great. She and James Bently, who played Nicolas, really seemed like siblings. A sensational job by both. Fionnoula Flanagan is terrific as the mysterious Mrs. Mills. She really creeped me out, and you never know where she stands. Was she good or bad? I didn't know.Alejandro Amenábar directed The Others with such atmosphere. The dark lighting is creepy, and the cinematography is beautiful. To accompany all the atmosphere we get a fabulous score by the director himself. The music is creepy, and really adds to the feel of a 40's ghost story. It also sets the mood of the film, and makes the scary scenes, even scarier. And not only did Amenábar direct, and score the film, but he also wrote the great, and well-developed screenplay.The Others is not without a great twist ending, that should shock everyone. I did not see it coming, and it's such an original concept to use in a ghost story. It worked well. Such an outstanding finale.Unlike others who've commented that the film was a bit too "slow-moving", I never found it be considering I was hooked-line-and-sinker from the first shot. The Others did great at the box office, and deserved every buck it earned. This is a film that will not be forgotten. It'll be stuck in my mind for a long time. It's a fantastic campfire tale of a movie, delivered with incredible style and a solid sense of outright "creepiness". It's a film that delivers a solid bang for those who've paid attention throughout, and is one of the best horror flicks to come out of Hollywood in some time.</fullReview>

See it again to appreciate what the screenwriter and director are trying to say. As for Nicole, the kids, servants and her husband...they did their part...you just might not get it the first time!

		<shortDescription>A film that makes you feel fulfilled after watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the most entertaining movie i have possibly watched at the cinema. This and 'Saving Private Ryan'. The Others I can assure will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. The suspense is excellent almost straining on your senses to just give you that big scare that you actually want. The jist of the plot is fairly straight forward but the film itself is truly out of this world. Nicole Kidman is a mother of two living in a huge but pretty much scary house who is waiting for her husband to return from war. Her children have some sort of condition where they cannot be exposed to direct sunlight which can harm and possibly kill them. Therefore for the majority of the film they have to stay in dark rooms with candles as the only light source almost living like vampires. The candles in the house only add to the intensity of most of the scary scenes eg. was that shadow moving something or was it just a shadow flikering from the candle. These questions you cant help but ask your self throughout the film. Even during the day you cant escape from the scary atmosphere with the curtains pulled in every room and the lingering fog which never lets up. On the whole this film is fantastic. it's not just an excellent horror film it's an excellent film. Nicole Kidman is an extremely talented actress and is a very sexy women and her kids do there job especialy the small girl who was the better of the two also the the actress from 'Waking Ned' Mrs Flanangan was also great. On a whole again this film you should watch. My girlfriend almost gave me a blood clot on my arm she was so scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "twisty-chiller" is the new buzz-genre in film, filling the gap left over from the "self-referential-nudge-wink-slasher-movie" genre that died with Scream 3, Scary Movie II and Sorry, But I Am Still Aware of Your Activities A Number of Summers Ago. The key elements: no gore, minimal special effects, twisty plots, pervading atmosphere of foreboding, scary young children.Nicole Kidman is a bit of a weird hermit whose kids are allergic to light. She's not a terribly nice lady: she seems to enjoy locking her kids in the dark all day and scaring them with stories about hell, purgatory and limbo. She's also done something quite nasty - something we don't find out the truth about until the very end of the film. Her kids are allergic to light, so naturally they are very pale skinned and a little bit disturbed - particularly the girl, who seems nice enough, but has a strange tendency to turn into an old woman from time to time.Into their cosy little world come three strangers, who may or may not be the "others" of the title. They seem nice enough, but they have a strange tendency to cover all the gravestones in the garden with leaves and wander around looking shifty.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because there's not much of it anyway, and what plot there is would be spoiler material if I posted it here. Most of the movie is given over to building the creepy atmosphere and setting up the denoument. If all this makes the movie sound dull, sorry - it's certainly not dull. Of all the "chillers" I've seen recently, this was probably the most chilling, and while the ending doesn't have the impact of the Sixth Sense for example, you certainly won't feel cheated either.8/10 (points off for giving Keith Allen paid work)</fullReview>

It uses every known cliche of so-called "spooky" films including gloomy old house surrounded by fog,a cemetery in the front garden (which no-one appears to have noticed), pianos that play themselves and doom-laden servants - including Eric Sykes who could not be taken seriously in this type of part by anyone in the UK - a masterpiece of miscasting! Frightening it was not, relying on a few loud noises for a "jump" factor and even these corny effects failed to keep my wife awake as she dozed off halfway through the film! As to the so-called shock ending, well this became patently obvious long before then and whilst the cast made the best of the trite dialogue it still rates as a turkey that barely justifies it's "12" certificate.</fullReview>

It succeeded where so many other recent horror films have miserably failed: it created a perfectly creepy atmosphere and created some genuine scares.What gives this film it's impact is that it doesn't try too hard; i.e. it doesn't rely on gore, cheap shocks, etc, to generate scares or interest. It simply creates a spooky atmosphere and allows that to serve as its foundation.On top of it all, the acting is appealing and believable.

The film develops slowly and is much the better for that.I found that I appreciated this more by reflecting upon it afterwards. It was not simply a movie but an experience. Our experience of the events remains with the characters and develops with them to the ultimate revelation. I felt that the film had a claustraphobic feel to it and I did not like this at first but if anyone feels this I would urge them to stick with it because it is vital to the outcome.Also one of Nicole Kidmans best performances.</fullReview>

However, there's something about a rip off ending that really wrecks a movie for me. True, this is a re-make from an older movie, but come on - wait ten years before releasing something identical to one of the biggest movies in history. The only redeeming factor is that Nicole Kidman plays one screwed up mofo, once you realize what she did. All-in-all, I left the theatre wishing I had waited for video and saved 8 bucks, since I paid that the last time I saw it in 1999.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a brilliant film. I was impressed from beginning to end. All the characters built up the suspense brilliantly, with their constant shifts from hateable to likeable or vice versa. I didn't think any of the characters were out of place. All of them fitted into the plot perfectly. Nicole Kidman is a very under rated actress. Her performance as Grace was wonderful and she bought out the whole atmosphere of the film. I don't just want to praise Nicole though, the child actors gave a solid performance that was believable and spine chilling. Every other actor involved was very convincing and Eric Sykes was an unexpected bonus to the cast list. The film itself is well written and beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar. The story is interesting and the 1945 setting is an interesting choice. It will make you jump a few times, but along with the rest of the audience you'll nervously laugh it off. A fact I noticed was that there was barely any special effects. Frankly the film would have been ruined if special effects had been put in.I respect a film that relies mostly on acting ability and plot to build up atmosphere and horror rather than having someone hack a limb off someone else just to frighten you.Possible spoilers below I won't give away to much of the ending (because I hate people who do) apart from to say it is unexpected and leaves you guessing right up until the final 5 minutes. End of spoilers Finally just to say If you're hesitating about going to see it go and see it anyway you'll probably love it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw her on the cover of Bazzar and remembered The Others. This film looks like molds of glowing wax-sculpted and made into a wicked cartoon. Its a dark tale of a woman with kids during The Great War. An English woman, sophisticated yet modest. Proud of never giving in to the Axis Powers, particularly Germany. The kids are pale with dark hair. The boy is faithful to his mother while his older sister is rebellious and taunting.They both have a skin disorder that's allergic to the sun so all the windows remain draped. An older couple and a girl knock on the door looking for work. Every door has to be closed and locked when entering and exiting rooms. Nicole Kidman, a nervous yet controlled wreck, lives life haunted while the minutes drag. She looks like those old movie stars or that girl from Killer's Kiss. The film turns here, the addition of characters makes them un-human. The lighting and backgrounds of burgundy-browns look like old tobacco smoke creating a surprising effect. The kids get haunted and one gets possessed, black &amp; white pictures of an old customs to photograph the dead look familiar, daddy comes home from War. You think its ghostly but its pure evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Others' is a strange sort of film. It's neither good nor bad, and, oddly, I can't say 'it could have been much better' (as with many other movies) as I doubt if it could, given the subject matter and the enclosed arena, in which all of the film is set. I know nothing about the story's background, but it is very theatrical, so maybe it started life as a play(?) It's one of those films whereby you can't say too much about it, for fear of spoiling it for the others, but suffice to say it is a ghost story, and, although it contains no sex, violence or expletives, definitely merits the '12' certificate. With the ghostly ingredients of a spooky house, two frightened children and a quirky performance from Nicole Kidman, I expected to enjoy this so much more than I did. I think the main problem is that the story has no real 'middle'. It starts and finishes adequately but drags in the middle, and, as I said, I doubt if, with the subject matter, this could have been improved upon. Overall, middling entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling movie. One of 2001s best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman plays Grace a retired woman who has two children, Anne and Nicholas, both of whom are allergic to sunlight. It's towards to the end of World War II and they live alone in a quiet mansion in Jersey, waiting for Charles, Graces husband and the children's father to come home after fighting in the war. Grace then hires a couple of servants and a gardener, Bertha Mills, Lydia and Mr. Edmund Tuttle to come and help round the house, look after the children, etc. But, soon after there arrival strange things begin to happen around the house, which leaves horrifying consequences and a dramatic conclusion.Now, I have to say I've never been that keen on Nicole Kidman. I've only really like one movie of her movies (If any.) and that's Practical Magic, but here she's really different from all her other roles and she gives a great performance. As do the rest of the cast including the great Eric Sykes. Great suspenseful directing from Alejandro Amenábar too, who also wrote the wonderful script to the movie.I enjoyed The Others for many reasons. One being I love movies with a supernatural Ghost nature and this movie of course has just that. I also love a good twist at the end of a movie, and The Others features an amazing and brilliant twist. One of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The Others is it's own right, is original. It really should stop being compared to The Sixth Sense, by certain individuals. Once you see The Others it will really leave you thinking this is a simply great movie. And, once again I have to say the ending to the movie is brilliant. I give The Others a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking in the paper for something to see and noticed that The Others was still playing on a few screens. I hadn't read much about it, but the reviews seemed to be favorable, so I decided to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did!What a wonderful movie. Very scary, and no gore at all. Several "boo!" shots, but not too many (five at the most). One thing I really liked is that there wasn't a "boo!" every time there could have been. This made you even more tense because you literally never knew when one would come and get you.Kidman was awesome, and the little girl was a delight. (Can't say as much for the pasty-faced little boy, though.)At times it may have been a little slow, but I think the ending makes up for it.Anyway, highly recommended, even if you don't usually like 'horror'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Completely Enjoyable Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a complete experience of expectation, thrill and final realization. The director certainly took his time to develop the story fully, and to me, that requires a high degree of patience and confidence. The end result is worth it all. If he had rushed into it, it would have been an entirely different kind of film - probably one that would have relied more on the visual aspect instead of the thinking aspect of the story line as in here.And Nicole Kidman was an excellent choice. She's beautiful as the mother and she has not disappointed with her performance. I saw this film after I had seen Moulin Rouge and so I carried a certain level of expectation of her here. She was certainly impressive there and just as much here. I didn't really notice her at all previously; I kind of remember her in Batman but there was really not much there to remember anyway. She has changed for the better as far as I'm concerned.And to complement it all, the supporting roles were excellently played too. The children were beautiful and the nanny Mrs. Mills were creepy as she should have been in particular.Well, I look forward to the next film by this Chilean director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Near-perfect ghost story. Comparisons to Turn Of The Screw and The Haunting, as well as to The Sixth Sense, are apt. In my opinion The Others is actually superior to the latter. The performances by the various actors have been widely acclaimed, and justly so. Kidman, who seems literally luminous here, is actually upstaged at times by the performances of the children. It would be hard to praise the direction and editing too highly. The climactic scene contains a POV cut that feels and acts like a dissolve (you'll know it when you see it), but that is to pick only one example from an overall virtuoso effort. Though this is not a film that will appeal to all fans of Sam Raimi or Wes Craven,it will move quite fast enough for those who enjoy subtler, less effects-laden spookers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Poor Misguided Ghosts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More attention paid to Nicole Kidman's wig and makeup, each with its own staff of designers, than to the story or acting. The usual haunted house--slamming doors, rattling chains, fog, etc. Kidman's shrill tenseness wears thin; supporting cast doesn't support much. Plot twist at the end arrives too late and offers too little to redeem this otherwise pallid mess. Observation: Nicole certainly succeeds with perverse asexuality, much better than with the reverse, the lush sexiness attempted in "Moulin Rouge" or "Eyes Wide Shut". Will this be her future type casting, esp. as she ages? Incidentally, Spanish manor substitutes for English, a fake fake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've already seen Los Otros (the title here in Spain) twice and I recommend to do the same to the people who enjoyed it the first time. I love this film. I've appreciated the details, the development of the script, the real thoughts of the characters. Please see the face of Fionnula Flanagan: she's obviously thinking on another things (the true secret of the others and themselves) when she talks. Also, is the daughter telling the truth or a lie? This film doesn't tell a story like another films do. This film is giving us information about the past life of the characters from the beginning to the end. It's a discovery movie. It has got the most perfect scares I've seen in a movie in years. It's full of suspense too. Amenábar is a very clever guy. And the best of all: he's young!, he can do a lot of masterpieces like this in the following decades. We the Spanish are very proud of him.The end is not only original, is wonderful too, plenty of humanity. I've cried with the final family hug, when they find all out. It's a very beautiful story about a family. Can you see? Crying in a scary movie! Because of that this is a very different film. Finally, the cast is simply perfect. Can a woman be so beautiful? (I'm talking about Nicole Kidman). Can a laugh be so innocent and frightening? (I'm talking about the daughter). A note: this script is previous to The Sixth Sense.The Others will be remembered for a long time among the people in the world and will be studied at cinema schools.(I'm sorry if I've written some spelling or grammatical mistakes)</fullReview>

I certainly hope the girl that plays the daughter is nominated for best supporting actress. I've paid to see this movie 3 times. It starts rather slowly but all the while the plot certainly thickens on the fog shrouded island that lends atmosphere to this project. To me it was like seeing the best of a 1940's thriller for the first time. Then I had to see it again to pick up on clues. Yet the third time I went was the time that made me jump the hardest. The plot is truly engrossing and you're never really sure exactly what is happening until the final climactic moments. You'll leave the theater with your mouth hanging open.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understands what really scares people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director, Alejandro Amenabar understands what really scares people. Ghosts, monsters, and masked psychos just aren't it, I'm sorry. But it is the idea that something is lurking in your home that really chills the bone. When you're unaware of what's making strange noises in your presence, all kinds of ideas run through your head; it could be a monster, a ghost, a killer, or a combination of the three. But when you do know what you're facing, then the only thing you worry about is surviving. Chances are, you won't be equipped with any Ghostbusting material. That's why Alejandro's style of suggestion is so effective, and new.The two kids in the film, particularly the little girl, hold their own ground with no parental supervision. What I love about these two kids is that I can really identify with them. Back when I was little, my sister, like the girl, would take advantage of my fear of being alone in the dark. She would plot me infront of horror movies; and while I wasn't going to play little wuss for her amusement, I would try and withstand the horrible experience -- man she was cruel! The little girl registers the bigger-sister demeanor very well; she might've manipulated me into some scary situations if I were her little brother.The film's beautiful! I imagine the cinematographer chose to use only natural, lit candles for lighting. The movie, 90% interior, relies on candle light since the little kids have a terrible reaction towards bright light. But this isn't just some gimmick so as to play with the audience's fear of darkness. The use of lit-candles actually accentuates the facial expressions of every actor in the film. It's like when people tell camp/horror stories, and the speaker takes a flashlight and puts it under his face so as to make himself look scarier. The feelings and reactions become clear through the brilliant glow candle lights give-off. Think of "Barry Lyndon," and it'll give you an idea of the look of this film.Silence and suspense. Most horror movies deliberately throw excerpts of loud bangs into your ear for cheap thrills. This movie does the ingenious job of teasing you. Often in horror movies, the director presents a character walking towards an area where the killer might be. You aren't exactly sure when the killer will show-up. But when it does, then you've jumped out of your seat -- but the fear is all over. When the director, like Alejandro, keeps the viewer in suspense even longer, then the viewer breaks-down. They feel uneasy, which is a great feeling considering there's nothing gory, or ugly on display.Nicole Kidman. Thanks goes to the cinematographer for keeping those beautiful eyes of hers, front and center. For it is in her eyes where her reactions of fear really alert the viewer. And I imagine it was hard work for her to stay in a mode of fear for the more suspenseful scenes, considering they last longer than usual. She also gives a commanding performance as a currently single mother (her husband is at war) running the mansion, kids, and butlers by herself. She gives ultimatums with surprising conviction. In fewer words, she gives a beautiful, strong, and touching performance without stooping down to hammy theatrics -- it's all in the character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly worthy tale of suspense and intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into The Others not expecting much. Most 'ghost stories' today are just bloody messes with no real plot, nothing to keep you interested. I constantly find myself looking around the theater to see if anyone else is as bored or disgusted as I am. Not The Others. First let me say, I am a huge fan of literary ghost stories, well done, frightening tales that don't use blood or gore or any other media than written word and your own imagination to scare you. I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was amazing, the plot very well thought out, and remained true to what I consider real Suspense. This film proves you don't have to be a bloody gore-fest or a plot-less, mindless killer-kills-all-girl's-friends-in-really-bloody-ways-for-no-real-reason. No suspense, no intrigue, no thought needed the only thing that scares people in those films is the gore, not the story. The Others really takes you into it, I forgot completely I was in a cinema, and was completely engrossed. Having read, as I said, a great many 'suspense/horror' novels I kept mentally trying to see where the story would go, but while I did guess a few things, I could not guess it all and was thrilled beyond words by the cleverness of the tale by the end. I was truly held in thrall every moment waiting to see what would happen next and was blissful with the style it was carried out in when I left the theater. I cant say enough good about this movie. Nicole Kidman (who I thought was amazing in Malice and Moulin Rouge, and Far and Away) really astounded me. Her performance was stupendous. I dislike Tom Cruise as an actor and a person, and I don't want to give him any credit for this fantastic tale, especially since he was just one of 9 producers and they really don't do much but pony up some cash, so give the credit where it is due, the actors (especially Ms Kidman), and the writer and director, Alejandro Amenábar. A truly worthy tale of suspense and intrigue that Rod Serling, Shirley Jackson, and Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's almost impossible to discuss The Others without bringing up 1999's already classic ghost thriller The Sixth Sense. Both are films that move deliberately slow, drawing in the audience with a fine eye for details and no special effects, creating a brooding atmosphere and getting frights from suggestion and small effects. Still, Amenabar's The Others goes even further with his minimalist style, constructing a film that becomes increasingly creepy with the slightest sound effect or plot point.Nicole Kidman, in a bravura, chilling performance, stars as Grace, mother to two children with a rare disease that makes exposure to sunlight deadly. She lives in a mansion on an island, fog smothering their secluded existence, when one day three servants come looking for work. She hires them, and suddenly strange noises and occurences start descending on the house. Slowly, it becomes evident that they are not alone when her daughter begins to describe her experiences with a mysterious ghost boy named Victor.The Others is an elegantly mounted film, and Amenabar succeeds in building an uneasy tension with striking cinematography that makes the light and darkness seem to come alive, as if it were a character in itself. At times, the look and feel of it seems more like a macabre Merchant-Ivory production than a haunted house movie. Amenabar's pacing is perfect; it's refreshing to see a summer movie that slowly and confidently ups the ante to the point where the audience doesn't know where the story is going to go. When the film finally reaches it's end, its quite a spine-tingling climax.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After suffering through two of the worst films ever made that fall into the same subgenre as The Others (if you had to guess, its The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill- the remakes) I was definitely starved for a subtle and spooky ghost story. So, why didn't I like The Others? It had a good cast, great set, a whole lotta fog. I guess what it really lacked was a feature length story. Not much actually happens in this film, simply because the story could have been told as a high brow episode of Tales from the Crypt. Too many of the shocks turn out to be nothing, simply because the movie is just dragging you along to its twist ending, and has to spend at least an hour and a half getting you there. Another detraction to the film is the characters. Not the performances mind you, just the characters being portrayed. As a filmgoer I do not demand moral, pure or saintly protagonists, just ones who I do not wish to throttle every time they speak, or don't speak in the case of one character. The lady of the household is a fussy witch. Her children are just a mild step up from brat. The servants are so docile and old they might as well be dead. I guess the servants were alright. For those in the mood for a quiet and haunting cinema experience, The Others may be just what they need. Me? I'm still looking. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely have I been so impressed with a movie's wry, knowing, and uncanny ability to produce a story of such wry, intellectual, spiritual, and haunting power. There is much and many things going on in this flick- and it will surely tapped for a few Oscars, especially Cinematography, Set Design (check out those props and chairs and house lights- they're the real 40s stuff!), and even perhaps Best Original Screenplay. On an even more impressive note is the emotional scope and raw energy with which Nicole imbues her portayal of Grace, as well as the uncannily adult and responsive acting ability shown by the supporting characters. (Check out those child actors! what are they, adults in kid suits? I've never seen anything like it! Haley Joel doesn't hold a candle to these kids' ability)*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Let me first start off by addressing some of this film's many themes. The whole idea of Nicole having to "lock" each individual room's door when entering and exiting creates the whole idea of barrier and isolation, as well as emotional barrenness.The whole idea of "lighting" takes on a surreal effect in this film, not only in its importance to Nicole's children and the exquisite, special cinematography to be found here, but also in the creation myth that begins the film and the idea of "light" and "darkness", of "other" and "us".Exquisite is a hard word not to use when writing about this one. It's the real thing- "The Others" is a movie at once brilliant without drifting into the land of the quasi-pretentious, as Memento has a tendency to do, (being so "smart" that it's oftentimes impossible to follow and understand). "The Others" is at last an emotional look of the bonds of a three-membered family, of human interaction, of spiritual explanation of death and the paranormal, and a wry inquest into what "ghosts" in of themselves have to say about us the living, us the dead, or, as this film may have us believe, the very thin lines that separates the two.All in all, will definitely garner some Oscar recognition, as I stated before, and even (who knows?) get Nicole that Best Actress nod she's deserved for some time now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman stars as a single mother of two, left alone in a large mansion as her husband goes off to war. Their home is completely isolated and it is constantly smothered in fog. To make matters worse, their home has no electricity, and her children are deathly allergic to sunlight. In the first five minutes, this movie had all its ducks in a row, to create a chilling thriller. It could have been so good, but writer/director Alejandro Amenabar failed to turn this wonderfully eerie setting into a scary movie. It was like the haunted house that looks creepy and scary from the outside, but has nothing frightening once you get inside.Early on in the movie three strangers approach the house seeking work. Grace(Kidman) welcomes them in to work, commenting that her previous staff had recently disappeared. Immediately we are aware that there is more to these three than we are being told. Grace's daughter Anne has seen people in her house that nobody else can see. Are there ghosts? Or does an simply have an active childish imagination? The remainder of the movie seeks to answer these questions, with Kidman's character seeming to lose more and more of her sanity along the way.There are a few very excellent qualities about this movie, the first being the previously addressed setting. Also there are very strong performances throughout this movie, which is extremely important sice the movie revolves around a very small cast. Firstly, I am not normally a Nicole Kidman fan, and so to say that she was fine, is to say that she did not annoy me. That is quite a compliment in itself. Secondly, her children are wonderful. Particularly Alakina Mann in the role of Kidman's young daughter. There were scenes between her and Kidman that I thought that she completely stole. Finally, Fionnula Flanagan as the elderly maid Mrs. Mills held this movie together. Every time I got bored and disinterested, she would come on the screen and renew my interest. I know that these are not familiar actors, but they were wonderful with what they had. The problem was that they had very little. This movie plods along with nothing really happening.The one other very strong quality this movie offers, is the final ten minutes. These final minutes are wonderful and priceless. I only wish that all of the writing leading up to it had been as interesting. Unfortunately I can not recommend sitting bored for 120 minutes, only to enjoy 10 of them. If that ratio is fine with you, then enjoy those last ten minutes.Ultimately this is a movie with much promise, much potential, but sadly lacking in substance. Thrillers must either create tension, or scares, and there are too few of either one for me to recommend this movie. Wait until it's out on video and then you can fast forward as necessary.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie today and really liked it. Nicole Kidman did some of her best acting in this. The other actors, and actresses do good too, and the script is good, and the plot is also pretty good. I actually thought this would be alot like poltergiest. But it was way better. This movie is definitely not scary, but there are a few parts in the movie that makes ya jump. I'll give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of us older folk could compare The Others to both The Innocents and The Uninvited. It helps to have read Henry James' The Turn of the Screw; it also helps to be patient with this movie. If you don't particularly enjoy Nicole Kidman, it will damage your enjoyment of the film as she is in almost every frame, looking like a Hitchcockian version of Grace Kelly -- LIke the filmmakers weren't aware: her character's name is Grace. This is a yummy little ghost story, offering a nightmare or two to suggestible ones. Sweet dreams!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chilling Tale that Stays Close to Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a warm muggy Friday night. I was tired, and I had no desire to go out to the clubs again. No, it was time to relax a bit, and begin a journey of theatrical sorts. I was determined to start catching up on the recent movies I had missed. What better way to begin than by seeing one of the weekend's new releases, "The Others"?I had been interested in seeing "The Others" since I first saw the trailer a month or so ago. It is an eerie trailer, and what especially caught my attention is its lack of outrageous special effects. This was a promising sign, and I began to wonder if Hollywood had finally caught on to the idea that true fear is more effectively conveyed when it is rooted closer to reality. Special effects used in excess, although often visually appealing, usually act to detach the moviegoer from any sort of fear that they may have been feeling. This mistake was all too evident with the "The Haunting" remake as well as with "House on Haunted Hill," another remake. Knowing Hollywood, I wasn't about to put too much faith in a trailer. However, from the trailer alone I could see that "The Others" was going to be different from most of the recent Hollywood horror fare.I sat down to watch "The Others," at almost two in the morning. Although it was late, my excitement and anticipation for the film were enough alone to keep me awake. My friend, who is a local theater manager, ran the film for the two of us and a friend of ours. We were glued to the screen, but our friend fell asleep at the beginning. Let me state that this was not because the movie is boring, it was because it was so late and he had started work rather early that day. Okay, enough excuses for his exhaustion. Let me continue by saying that "The Others" may just be the best movie I have seen all summer. This sounds like a strong statement, but there really hasn't been anything else worth writing about, except for maybe "Shrek" from what I hear (I haven't seen it yet. Like I said, I have some catching up to do.)The film begins with Nicole Kidman waking from a frightful nightmare, just before she hears a knock at her door. It is then that three servants arrive to help her care for the house. The servants are played excellently, although their roles are not nearly as demanding as those of Nicole Kidman and her children, Anne and Nicholas, played by Alakina Mann and James Bentley. Nicole Kidman gives a remarkable performance, maybe her best yet, as Grace, a mother of two children who are afflicted with a disease that requires them to be kept secluded from bright light. They live in a house where, during the day, the curtains are kept drawing and candles are used to dimly light the darkness. No one can enter a new room without shutting the door to the previous room from which they have entered. These rules add to the morbidity of an already eerie atmosphere. With this, we do not have to wait for the night to bring the element of fear that is associated with darkness.The film takes its time in developing its plot. As it does this, it offers us information that stirs our interest. We increasingly begin to wonder what lies beneath, no pun intended, all of the strange and awkward things that begin to take place. Young Anne sees ghosts. A piano seems to be playing by itself. A thunderous rumbling comes from the floorboards upstairs, but wait, the servants are outside, there is no one upstairs. You get the idea. Grace refuses to believe in things such as ghosts, but all the evidence proves her wrong. A sort of hysteria sets in, one that we the audience feel as well, and from that point on we are carried along on the edge of our seat.All along a secret exists that the children know, but are prohibited by Grace from speaking about. Gradually we begin to feel the weight that this secret bares. It must be something awful, but what could be that awful? So awful that days after we leave the theater, in thinking about the film, we can still feel that freaky disturbing horror? You'll have to wait until you see the film to find out, but I can say that there is a twist. It is almost inevitable since it is hard to make sense of the film until then. However, it works very well and is almost without holes. Nicole Kidman is a true pleasure to watch. She is brilliant in this role, conveying the necessary emotion, sternness, and disbelief that are required of her. She never goes overboard. She has never been more balanced and poised in a role before, and at times we begin to see her only as Grace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this Nicole Kidman's year or what? First she stars in the dazzling, cinematic spectacle that is "Moulin Rouge". Then she takes a turn and releases the "The Sixth Sense" for summer 2001, "The Others"."The Others" takes place in 1945. Grace (Nicole Kidman), a widow and single-mother, lives in a secluded home with her two children, Anne (Alakia Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). She is forced to live in darkness, for her children have a severe allergy that causes them to break out and blister when exposed to mass amounts of light. All is going well, but soon, Grace begins to learn the she, her children, and her servants are not alone in her house. Grace becomes determined to find out who the intruders are...and drive them out to regain her home.This movie was just beautiful. The story was sharp and original. It wasn't just some cliche`d haunted house movie with spooky sounds and bumps and creaks in dark rooms, with boring ghosts that you seen any old day. The story used the idea of the haunted house, and twisted the story to make "The Others" into an original, creative, and new telling of the famous tale. This practice of taking and creating is what made "The Sixth Sense" so remarkable, and therefore makes this movie great as well.The acting was just as great. Not only is this Nicole Kidman's year for her movies, but for her acting as well. She has managed to give Oscar-caliber performance in two movies for this year alone. She convincingly plays the strict but caring mother, who is torn between the logic of the beliefs she grew up on and the apparent happenings in her house. You almost forget that she is acting. Alakia Mann and James Bently also deliver key performances as well. In fact, there wasn't one cast member that let me down."The Others" was also cinematically beautiful. The dark tones on the movie set the perfect mood for this movie's theme, giving regular scenes the right amount of light and sinister scenes the deserved amount of darkness and horror. The camera angling and positions also wonderfully gave the "oomph" needed to make the scenes be seen in the proper mood.A well-crafted dramatic thriller, "The Others" is a must-see for thriller-lovers and movie-lovers alike. While not quite up to "The Sixth Sense"'s calibur, the movie is still a must-see.9/10, A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can I start... Since I watched the trailer for "The Others" I felt intrigued by it... How long has it been since we don´t enjoy a spine chilling movie to the point of make you hold our breath for at least 95% of the film? I was on Madrid on vacation and the movie was advertised all over the "Gran Via", how could I resist? The only problem? to go alone... I took the courage and went to enjoy what it is until know the best suspense thriller since YEARS!! I have to agreed with other users that this victorian hunted house story is filled with drama and that is thanks to the spectacular script and beautiful acting!!Nicole Kidman is an Oscar winner!! I'll be very disappointed if not...We have to thank Alejandro Almenabar for writing, directing and composing the music for this elegantly, perfectly detailed suspense ride!!Don´t miss it!!!PS: I was lucky to have sit next to a girl who went to see the movie by herself too, we couldn't resist to hold hands twice during the movie... it was a relief!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffers from the UNBREAKABLE disease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can be compared to that of the SIXTH SENSE but suffers from the same fate as UNBREAKABLE. You could watch the sixth sense and skip the ending and still enjoy the movie because of its plotline. The ending is just the kicker that makes you want to see it again.Like UNBREAKABLE though, THE OTHERS has very little plot. It spends the entire movie with a setup for a "surprise" ending (which is not very surprising). Without the ending, the movie just states facts about its characters and the situations they are in (not what they are doing).This would have been better suited for a short (like a TALES FROM THE CRYPT type story). Stretched over the course of 2 hours, it is very thin. There are also some "plot holes" which took of a point for me. It is too close to others movies out there to get anything above a 7, but since someone may see this that hasn't seen any other movies that are similar, I gave it just that for its technical points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Others" Review: Pros- A very scary and mostly fun thrill ride through a haunted house. Decent performances, by a good cast; and an interesting, somewhat original story-line help the movie. The ending is also very creative. Cons- Some performances are weak. The story is VERY complicated and confusing at brief points. A little disturbing in some areas. The setting is god-awful, which really makes the stroy less interesting. Bottom Line- A fairly good horror film with a decent cast and some spine-tingling sequences. You should, however, probably rent it, rather than see it in theaters. My score(0-10): 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please see "Haunted" (1995) (spoiler at very end)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is a slow, autmospheric movie that builds off of minute details, which may be missed, and ultimately Alejandro Amenábar explains everything with an ending that seems predestined for a huge payoff.Yet, instead of a payoff, you should feal ripped off.In the era where most trailers give the movie away, The Others has a great trailer that in truth does what a trailer is supposed to do. Basically, it gets you hooked, without giving away key elements of the story.However, in the era of media, The Others falls flat. It was hyped as "The Sixth Sense of 2001" or "with a twist ending that will make you want more.", etc...In truth The Others is an interesting movie because instead of being a total horror movie, thriller, detective story, or period piece, it instead borrows elements from spine-tingling horror thrillers and constructs a fable about a lapse/period of time where familial strength and the elements that can pull them apart are in the shadows for us, the detectives, to dicipher.Yet, Alejandro Amenábar does not just borrow the "surprise ending" from elements of past thrillers and chillers, instead it is a blatent rip-off of the theme of the 1995 movie "Haunted".The Others is destined to get more press than "Haunted" ever did (except for Kate Beckensale fans)and "Hauted" is probably a movie that will sit dormant at rental stores for 90% of the year. "Haunted" really isn't a better movie, but it had the original shock of finding out that the people you thought were real, were really the ghosts and that the others were actually real people invading the ghost world in varying degrees.While The Others does not take the entire ending of "Haunted" (i.e. there is no fire and no living to dead marriage proposal), the thematic elements are there and for me at-least the media droped the hint of the ending.After hearing that there was a huge "twist ending", I thought, there is no way that then ending of "Haunted" would be used, that would be a cool idea, but a cop-out. After seeing the ending see The Others, there was disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pice of art better than the sixth sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It´s incredible to see how Alejandro Amenábar grows in each films he do. "Thesis" and "Open your eyes" are very good movies, but this one is probably the best film of the year. The script (Alejandro wrote it 3 years before "the sixth sense")it´s a very intelligent mixture of drama and horror. The anguish is in every part of the film and that happens for three things: 1) Nicole Kidman has done her best work on this film. We don´t know if love or hate this "Grace" because of her human character. She has to win the oscar because is (at least in this film) the best actress of the moment. 2)The director of photography, Javier Aguirresarobe has made a pice of art: the darkness, the fog, the forest... It´s really superb. 3) Alejandro Amenábar: a genius. The music, the script and the direction, and in those three categories has done a very good job.Please, you have too see this movie. You will thank you me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has been talking too much and have said that `The Others' has a similar ending than that other movie about strange kids and dead people. However, I am going to stop there so I will not sound like these other idiots that spoil it for everyone. `The Others' is about a woman and her 2 offsprings who for some reason are allergic to light. They live in a mansion in the middle of nowhere. The neurotic woman, portrayed by Nicole Kidman, hires 3 stale servants who have a history of their own. `The Others' does have its scary moments. Unfortunately, what really scared me the most was the unorthodox screenplay it possessed. `The Others' maybe will require an other viewing for me to enjoy it more, or then again I could just see another movie instead. It does not matter too much one way or another? *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the lights dimmed in the theatre, I was prepared for Gothic mystery, the supernatural, and some good story telling. To my surprise, I discovered that I was not seeing one film, but a combination of three that came to mind almost immediately. Take "The Innocents" (1961) mix with "The Sixth Sense" (1999) and add a drop of "The Night Has Eyes" (1942), and you have "The Others". Much of this film is derivative -- the religion-obsessed maternal figure, the sheltered young brother and sister, and the oh-so-accommodating hired help all set in a nice spooky old house perpetually surrounded by an eternal fog. There are a few plot threads left dangling, to say the least. Discussing those would involve getting into some spoilers, which I never do in films of this type. But then again, you'll probably figure the story out long before the characters on the screen do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "MUST SEE" EXCELLENT MOVIE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie knocked the wind out of me. I was GLUED to the screen and could not look away and that's a feat in itself. It seemed to zip by and felt like only 30 minutes. In fact, I didn't want it to end. I am a big movie critic and 98% of the movies made in the past few years are trash, dumb, and a waste of time. It's wonderful to see that there still are a few chair-gripping, CEREBRAL (to the dense, "cerebral" means "boring"), good scripts out there. Another good thing is that ACTING involves facial expressions, eye expressions and (heaven forbid) emotions instead of blood, gore, and cursing, flying around amid shallow car chases set to bombastic and robotic "music" that is used to overwhelm and distract the viewer from the lack of script and acting abilities."The Others" is a fantastic find. Nicole Kidman is excellent in this. I never gave her much of a chance before, but now see that she is very talented. Julia Roberts couldn't have pulled this off. Nicole's expressions and eyes screamed volumes as she made me feel what the character felt without having to say a word. The children's performances were some of the best I have seen by kids. The other three main characters were perfect as well! They kept me guessing!I find most movies completely predictable and the soundtracks to be overblown and distracting. That is not the case with this one. I loved the quiet moments that were used to build up the suspense and to allow the viewer's mind to race with ideas---------something that has been sorely missing from films for years. The music ENHANCED the movie!! What a nice change that is! It was perfect and added mystery, eeriness and helped solidify the aura and tone of the film, instead of banging you over the head and being annoying and obnoxious."The Others" has terrific acting, a wonderful story line, an enhancing soundtrack, is full of feelings, emotion and fear. We all fear the unknown.A splendid time is guaranteed for all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as familiar as some would think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beautiful thing about this movie is its slow pacing. Most would write it off as boring, but to many, the pacing only adds to the tension. "The Others" is a slow-paced thriller that offers some familiar territory, but if one re-examines, realizes the differences are abound.First off, Nicole Kidman's performance is dead-on perfect. She enchants, much in the same way as earlier this year with "Moulin Rouge". She is one of the greats as far as actress go, and this movie displays her at her best.The story is confusing, but rightly so. So many unanswered questions that leave you wondering where this movie will go. Although sometimes it is a little obvious, the way they are presented never fails to surprise.Another bright point of this film is the mood. While most thrillers/horror movies rely on the dark to frighten, this movie uses light. This is due to the conditions of the children, where they are sensitive to light. There are many particularly frightning scenes in which a spot of sunlight sends chills down our spines. The film has a noir-ish look to it, and at some points, almost looks black and white. The twist in the end is what turns most off. But, to those who ponder it, they will walk away satisfied. At first you may think your experiencing deja vu, but relax. Its a lot more clever than you think. I've never been to a film that had the audience so attached to their seats, screaming and laughing at the same time. This is a rare gem in a particularly drab summer. See for yourself why this movie is so fantastic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusual twist on an old idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "The Others" last night, and I must say that although I found hints in the movie that reminded me of at least three other movies I've seen within the past thirteen years, I feel "The Others" can stand on its own, mainly because it brings something new to the table of films of its ilk. Alejandro Amenabar should be commended and hailed as the next Alfred Hitchcock, because he was able to direct a suspense thriller without any gore. This film works on the mind, and does its job brilliantly.Special kudos to Nicole Kidman and her supporting cast, Mr. Amenabar's effective score, the cinematography, sound editing, costumes, and sets. And just when I thought I had everything figured out, more details came to the surface to jolt me some more! In a year of woefully substandard movies so far, "The Others" stands out as a film of intelligence and real chills without flashy special effects. It is a return to solid storytelling, intriguing characters, and the mark of genius, in that it transported me to another time and place and involved me so much, that I thought I was part of the story. For a few moments, I was able to forget the problems of the real world, as I got lost in the world of "The Others." Go see it with an open mind...you'll get lost, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling and unique experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been an avid fan of horror films but despite of this, I still can decipher which are the good ones and which are the bad ones. Personally, this is one of the good ones. I extremely loved this film! It's story is truly original, one that you thought you knew how the story goes, and then suddenly you find out that your wrong. And then from there you think you know how the story goes, and then BOOM, you're wrong again. This is one of the things you don't expect in a horror film. In most horror movies, you expect to be scared from right to left with the bombardment of visual effects, scaring you with what is on the surface. Werewolves, vampires, witches, ghouls, or ghosts and the looks of them and how they mingle with characters in a film are mostly what keeps a horror film going. But this one had an added element, a good twist! The twist of the story line is very good. It came rather unexpected and surprising which made this film worth seeing.It is also because of this, that personally, I believe why The Sixth Sense was such a success. Something new and something that wasn't just merely a kid who saw dead people. We've seen a lot of films where people can see dead people and that somehow they find out that they need to help the spirits of these dead people. But personally, I think what made this movie good was something that no one was expecting, the nature of the character Bruce Willis played. But between the two films, I liked The Others more in that I never guessed the outcome. In The Sixth Sense, I've had friends who said that somehow they got the twist of the movie, but with The Others, they, including me, didn't.I highly recommend this film and I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed with the performances of Nicole Kidman, Alakina Mann, James Bentley and the rest of the cast. The spooky backdrop, the sombre costumes, terrific performances and the great twist made watching this movie a chilling and unique experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is all around a superb film that I loved. I've seen many complaints that the movie's plot is too slow. However, the way the movie is made you simply can't rush it along or it just wouldn't work. It isn't a slashing gorefest without much plot that needs to have nonstop action and violence but rather a subtle film that focuses on the fear of silence and what you can't see. The film never jumps out at you but rather maintains a frightening atmosphere throughout the entire movie. The acting in "The Others" is excellent all around. Nicole Kidman truly shines in her role as a mother of two sick children who hasn't seen her husband since he went to war. She grabs your attention as soon as she appears on screen and never loosens her grasp. She deserves an Oscar nomination. Heck, I'd even say she deserves the Oscar. The supporting cast is also wonderful, especially the children who are very realistic as a brother and sister. Everything else about "The Others" is excellent as well. The cinematography, score, screenplay, and direction all range from very good to Oscar worthy. So all in all, don't listen to the film's detractors and see "The Others" for yourself. And if you are among those who say it is to slow, watch it again try to see why it can't be rushed. I give it 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amenábar and Shyamalan: two brilliant directors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar has created another masterpiece of film. "The Others" is an incredible production with everything that a film needs: brilliant story, incredible creepy atmosphere, brilliant recreation of the '40s and outstanding performances of Nicole Kidman and the rest of the crew.I didn't find the film slow at all. I went to the theater thinking of what I heard from lots of people: "The film is good, but it's incredibly slooooooow". But in my opinion, "The Others" needs a deep atmosphere, with dark scenarios and only with candle lights. That's how Alejandro Amenábar has included the tension that keeps you frightened from the start till the end of the film.Nicole Kidman is incredible (in all the meanings ^_^). She performs her character (Grace) with a lot of credibility. Also the two children, specially Alakina Mann, do incredible performances.A thing that surprised me is that there's no blood on the film. At any time. We don't find terror movies without blood&amp;guts these days. Also, there're no CGI or modern special effects in "The Others", a thing that must remind us that the special effects are an addition to a film, not the main event of the production.SPOILER AHEAD:"The Others" is pretty close to "The Sixth Sense" in different points. The plot is quite similar and the end too. Also the kind of atmosphere is really similar to Shyamalan's film. Even though, I'm not saying "The Others" is not original. It's a brilliant production from one of my favorite directors. Keep on Alejandro!!! We're waiting for your next masterpiece!!!Worth look! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read a lot of comments about this movie and I think most of the people that is saying "slow, bad film" or "characters not developed" really didn't understand this film. Yes, it starts so quick, you get into the mansion and into the plot so fast, and after that you could see that time stops. But it's because time has really stopped. I won't do any spoiler about the film, but all the "slowness" that people find is the way to show how is Grace suffering, you have to live with her every second of agony. The film is superbly elegant, and this "slowlyness" is a important part of it. I really think that the only mistake is the trailer, it's trying to sell a horror movie, and it's really not. It makes you jump a couple of times, but it is not so scary. It's by far a drama, with a suspense atmosphere. And it's great. And about the final, it's by far the better I've seen in years. Predictable or not, I won't complain on that, because there are SO many clues all about the film. And it's not like the Sixth Sense, its simply the other point of view! (and the script was written before...) Conclusion: a master piece of cinema: 10/10</fullReview>

It's true in these days, horror movies are far away from the quality we can appreciate in "The Others". Mr. Aguirresarobe's work is amazing, as well as Nicole's. In my opinion the only weak point is the repeating scenes, inside the house, waiting for 15 minutes until something comes out. Anyway, brilliant!

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan vs. AmenAbar- such an uneven fight...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no way you can walk out of a theater where you've just seen "The Others" without making an association with the simply brilliant "Sixth Sense". That's the first connection you make: Others-Sense.Soon enough, however(and thank God)you decide to go deeper into that primal thought and you realize the wide gap between the two movies. Indeed, "The Others" is a movie of medium if not high quality, but the images, thoughts, and feelings Shyamalan and his cast create are on a far greater level. "The Others" might have been more than just a fresh breath of air in a summer full of "chokers"(excluding a few truly good flicks), but it lacked four basic elements that made "The Sixth Sense" a classic: the cast, the suspense, the idea, and most of all- the timing.Nicole Kidman is not a bad actress, but she can never achieve the impact Jodie Foster(think of Clarice Starling in 1940's England) or Julianne Moore(back to redheads) could've had on this film. Ms. Kidman's role is not shallow ,but she can't quite achieve the image of the distressed mother that Toni Collette creates. Moreso, "The Others" doesn't impress with a memorable cast(except for Alakina Mann- God bless this child) whereas the trio Willis-Collette-Osment leaves a wide mark on your mind.Probably the most important question surrounding "The Others" was- is it scary???Well, if you are expecting a new exorcist, you're in for a disappointment, but on a whole basis, "The Others" does have its moments. The problem that AmenAbar and his cast fail to overcome is the slowness of the action- you can't have a masterpiece where one really good scene is followed by two extremely boring(I understand the "husband" episode is important, but did it have to go for soooo long- and with Christopher Eccleston???). That's basically "The Others"'s main problem- slow plotin which the really important points might be missed by the half paying attention viewer.Anyway, I'm sorry I had to compare this movie with "The Sixth Sense", but that's the final problem AmenAbar has-time. This movie simply came out too late and it turns out there are "other" movies that belittle this one.</fullReview>

Now if they only edited it so that the intro. was only 1/4 of the film versus 2/3 of it. For example, I think the husband's visit could have been longer, and his reactions more telling of his VERY mixed emotions re: his wife and her horrific misdeeds, not to mention more on his own confusion of how/why he suddenly appeared there. With editing, this could have been a real classic.</fullReview>

The manner in which the story is told is similar mainly in one respect: The subtle, detail oriented approach.Otherwise, this movie takes place in a different time period, the children play different roles in different circumstances, the photography is different, and the plot is different. The twist shares one element: people turn out to be dead instead of living. Well, is that the entire twist? No. This movie manages to take the haunted house story and literally turn it on its head, with the dead being haunted by the living.I would urge people to focus on movies that actually do copy shamelessly from other movies, that are formulaic, and leave this fine movie alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes You Have To See Things Without Using Your Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most of us, we have to see stuff to believe in them. Before we could see a fire burning in a fireplace, we must see the flames or the smoke coming from the chimney. Even without a fire burning, we know what a fireplace is used for. Do we have to see a ghost before we start believing in them? Do we have to believe before we can see a ghost? Should we believe in ghosts and never see them? When you read the premise of Nicole Kidman's THE OTHERS, you know it is a ghost story. Her place is haunted. Yet, her character is unwilling to believe in them. She hears them, but she doesn't see them. Watching this film, it was very captivating for various reasons. The children are unable to go outside because they are very sensitive to the light. Nicole's character locking the doors, which is a significance to the pressure that she feels. She feels closed in. The house has basically become her prison and the "Intruders" want her out of the house. So, does she give in and leave with the children or does she stay and fight the "Intruders"? The script was well written and the acting makes the situation believable. We believe that there are ghosts in the house, but are there? Nicole's character went mad, so her madness could be returning and using her daughter's ghost stories as her means to express it. If you have seen and enjoyed Sixth Sense, you would enjoy this movie. I am thinking that you might have to see this movie, again, to fully comprehend it. It has many questions. Like a maze, the movie has many enjoyable twists and turns. The movie is spooky, so you might have to prepare yourself to be jolted by some of the scenes. So, after watching this movie, you may have to see the movie again, but using something other than your eyes :-) The tagline should be "Believe in ghosts because they believe in you!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well meaning but predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The makers of this film sought, in part, to create a mature and intelligent blurring of the line between the "living" and the "dead." Unfortunately this formula has become trite, and this is what inevitably causes "The Others" to be compared with movies like "The Sixth Sense" (which I found equally predictable and disappointing). I had hoped for more originality, a new "Haunting of Hill House," perhaps, or "Turn Of The Screw." Alas, 20 minutes into the story, the ending of "The Others" was obvious. And its ending is depressing. Stories involving supernatural themes edify us most when they are uplifting as well as thought-provoking (e.g., "The Secret Garden"). If they are not uplifting, then they chronicle a descent into madness, and we already see too much of that in everyday life. A voyage through hell is only valuable when it is used to reveal the Light. This is especially true today, for as a society we are not bored and wish to be deliciously scared; instead we are stressed out and wish for some indication that peace and sanity are still possible. No such indication is provided by "The Others." Regarding the movie's set decoration and camera work, these are passable but not on par with even so much as the recent "Legend of Sleepy Hollow." And the use of relentless white fog to suggest inter-worldly limbo has been around at least since 1944's "Between Two Worlds." No real originality there. Nonetheless, the trashier a summer-cinema season, the more elegant any alternative like "The Others" becomes by sheer comparison.The main value of "The Others" lies in what it reveals about our culture's growing pessimism about virtually everything, including life after death. "Ghost" had a positive ending, but since its release in 1990, almost all stories involving supernatural topics (other than gratuitous horror flicks that entertain because they are hilariously awful) do not have characters going to Heaven, or even hell. There is no longer any Light, God, or Savior. The afterlife consists only of an endless, dreary, solitary limbo. The basic difference between this world and the next is that in the latter, we are each exposed as neurotic losers after all. Thus, movies with Satanic elements fail today because we have no divine elements to look forward to. Death only brings us eternal drabness and solitude. Even cinematic romances today mostly hinge on doomed love (e.g., "The English Patient," "Bridges Of Madison County," etc.) All we can do any more is hang on and grapple with our mounting anxieties. "The Others" might have used this reality as a springboard to suggest some fresh pathway to salvation. Instead, we have another example of political correctness applied to a supernatural theme, wherein we are asked why we and ghosts "can't just get along" in our mutually mirroring limbos. What a downer.</fullReview>

Yet for some reason only one of the suprises in the movie actually suprised me-the very end, the "Sixth Sense"-like ending. When the older lady servant was answering questions about where she and the other two servants had come from, I knew right then and there that they were not of this earth, the fact that they seemingly appeared out of nowhere gave it away, and they all seemed so vacant and "out there". I also knew right away that Charles was dead, he also had that same "vacany"a bout him. I have read a lot and seen many TV specials about the supernatural and ghosts over the years, so perhaps that is the reason why I wasn't as spooked as the rest of the audience was, which was disappointing! I know I would of been a lot more spooked if I went into this film with a clean slate. The little painting on the wall effect was simple yet effective!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE (B)OTHERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have already commented on this film. Now I'd like to comment on the comments.I know fans of this film will dismiss negative remarks by insinuating that some of us can only appreciate horror films with horny teen-agers and loping ax-murderers. This isn't always the case. As I remarked before, I have enjoyed "psychological thrillers" like CARNIVAL OF SOULS, THE INNOCENTS, LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, THE SHINING, THE HAUNTING (the original, not that piece of recent drek) as well as sci-fi movies that are sometimes considered too cerebral for some.... BLADE RUNNER and DARK CITY come to mind. I also like more "low-brow" horror such as EVIL DEAD 2, FRIGHT NIGHT, and HALLOWEEN. I found Kidman's acting to be very good...as was everyone in the film. I liked the mood.My main criticism of the film is that it never seemed to go anywhere. After the initial chills....it just seemed like it spiraled down to nothing.I laugh when I see user comments that said it hardly had any similarity to SIXTH SENSE. Um, SPOILER ALERT..........THE "SURPRISE" ENDINGS WERE THE SAME!!!!I appreciate that the cinema needs more well-done supernatural thrillers that are better-written and are less about American teens being chased by the boogeyman......I just wish THE OTHERS would have been one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Haunted House Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a movie is creeping me out when I feel like someone or something is going to grab my ankles from behind my seat. This film did that, with gusto. I found that the incredible performances all around, most notably Nicole Kidman's turn as the frazzled lady of the house, made up for a VERY predictable "twist" ending. The scene that I found the most unsettling was when she found the photo album, and it stuck with me. The setting was incredibly ominous, and the shocks kept coming, even though I correctly predicted how it would end halfway through. A film this predictable has to have some very strong merits in other areas to get a good review from me, and this one has plenty. Destined to become a classic, because it already feels like one. This is a film that could easily have come out 40 or 50 years ago, and that's a great compliment. The lack of special effects HELPED the movie, in my mind. I remember giggling insanely at the "ghosts" in 1999's "The Haunting", and thankfully, the effects were muted, if not non-existent here. This is a classic haunted house movie, and it delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Others' embodies all there is that makes the ?suspense' genre so popular. The isolated mansion, the fragile woman alone, the sinister servants who know more than they can or will tell and the darkness inevitably combine in unworldly ways.All of these elements are used superbly by the director to create a movie that is scary with out being bloody. No bodies hang from trees and no skulls fall from the closet shelf. Yet something is wrong, very wrong. It might be the voices that the daughter of the house hears or pretends to hear. It might be in the new servants who conveniently showed up shortly after the prior employees vanished without giving notice. It might be that there really are intruders in the house, people long dead with issues unresolved. To the lady of the manor the one unthinkable option is that the isolation and strain could be wearing her down and causing her mind to play tricks on her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So slow it almost stops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Building on the current success of supernatural thrillers with a twist at the end, ?The Others' stars Nicole Kidman as Grace, a recluse living in an old mansion with her two children Anne and Nicholas. After placing an advert for servants, the mysterious Mills family shows up explaining that they had worked for the previous owners of the house.Grace hires them, but only on the understanding that her strange house rules must be obeyed. Her children are allergic to sunlight so all curtains must remain closed and the doors must be locked after they have been used. Grace quickly becomes annoyed with her new servants and fearful for her children as her rules are seemingly ignored. But with Mrs Mills denying all knowledge, and her daughter claiming to be able to see ghosts, her children's safety might not be her only problem.The Others is build around a slow, methodical pace building up to a crescendo at the end. Director, Alejandro Amenábar's filming is almost Tim Burton-esque in its darkness and filming, yet lacks any sort of surprises or dialogue to keep you interested. The ending is intriguing, but after two M. Night-Shylaman films, the cinema-goer is already expecting something similar. If The Others was looking to cash in on The Sixth Sense's success, then the least it could have done is hone in on the biggest success, namely Haley Joel-Osment. As it is, the children, are sorely under-used with too much emphasis on the two-dimensional, neurotic Grace, and the servants, who come across as retarded weirdoes. The return of Grace's husband three quarters of the way in serves little purpose other than to stretch out the already overlong plot as well as leave the viewer even more bemused. The Others shows elements that, if used in the right way, could have been put together to form a half decent movie. Unfortunately the attempt at Hitchcock style pacing falls flat on it's face, with its dull tempo and tedious length letting down what could have been something quite distinctive.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had to be the most entertaining movie I've seen all year. It has a great story that is presented perfectly and keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. I know that everyone is comparing this movie to The Sixth Sense, which is unfair in a way, as this movie deserves to be looked at for what it is, a great flick. One thing that it does have in common with the sixth sense is that there are enough story elements and clues that lead you to the big ending, and when you watch the movie a second time, all of the dialog and actions take on a whole new meaning and it's like watching a totally different movie. This is definately a movie you shouldn't miss, go see it before you have the story blown for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the looks of the previews, this movie looked like it was going to be a bit scary, but not too much. Wow, I was in for a treat. It takes place in 1945, after the war. Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children live in an old, large house on an island in England. Grace hires 3 servants after the others mysteriously vanished and makes a few things very important. Whatever room the children are in the curtains must be closed, as they are allergic to light. All 50 doors must be locked at all times, no door can just stay open. Soon Ann (her daughter) starts hearing and talking to Victor, a boy who claims he and his family live there. Ann insists he isn't a ghost. Grace tries to block the fact that they may be sharing the house with other people, but soon catches on... This movie is excellent, it will have you on the edge of your seat. Some people actually screamed at one part. It's great because the previews don't give away the best parts. Terrific casting, acting, and directing. It's a chilling experience with a twist ending. I loved it. **** out of **** stars. Go see it today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another movie completely reliant on "twist" for validation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!Okay, I kinda liked it. True, it was slow but it was interesting. Note, however, while interesting, it was not even remotely scary...at all. And believe me, I did what I could to talk myself into being scared but to no avail. I did, however, jump once when a door slammed. GEE! Had to admire the restraint that characterized the movie (in comparison with many of the other contemporary horror/thrillers) but might've hoped for a little more of "the good stuff."Kinda liked the theme that life is a little more complex than we think and will continue to defy our little systems of thought with which we try to pin it down. I also liked the fact that the message was given gently. Grace's religion and parental stringency were shown sympathetically. Nevertheless, while useful and helpful we saw that they were inadequate to explain EVERYTHING. Once again, this movie (like many others) was completely reliant on its "twist ending" to validate it. I really don't like that. A good twist should deepen things and give you that little "more than you bargained for" bonus. When it becomes the only point of the film, it ceases to function as it was intended. This is especially so with "The Others". The two twists: a) Omigosh, the cleaning crew are really ghosts! and b) Omigosh, the family is really ghosts! were pretty lame. Perhaps had they beaten "Sixth Sense" to the screen they might've worked but THEY DIDN'T. The only reason I hadn't already figured it all out as I watched was because I thought, "No, they wouldn't be that dumb." They were though.Okay, finally, in order to end positively, I'll say this: The post-mortem photos were great. Having already read about these in Clive Barker's A-Zs of Horror I thought their film treatment was appropriately eerie. As Grace said, "How macabre."So, in summation, I'm glad I saw it but I will probably never watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What old estate in England is not haunted?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about a ghost story. This one has an interesting twist to it. Living in isolation in an old manor along the British shores is a prim young woman(Nicole Kidman) and her two children. The children are allergic to sunlight and all the windows in the estate must be shaded. It is apparent that this woman lives for her children. An odd trio arrives to help with the upkeep and day to day living. Mrs. Mills(Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle(Eric Sykes),the gardener and a young mute, Lydia(Elaine Cassidy)turn out to be no strangers to the homestead.This film is very slow and I am not certain that more viewers will not feel satisfied with the less than power packed climax. The movie is creepy and is sustained by the eerie mood and atmosphere. High suspense makes up for the small helping of horror. Some of the camera positioning made me think I was watching Grace Kelly instead of the equally beautiful Miss Kidman.This movie will keep your interest from the opening scream. Miss Kidman's talent is tested and she comes through with flying colors as usual. Suspense and a few chills. Nerve wrecking fun. Don't miss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great, chilling film. I won't mention anything about the plot, because the less you know the better. There are SOME similarities to "Sixth Sense," but to compare the two films or judge this against the other is not fair. "Sixth Sense" was a classic, but "The Others" stands by itself as a great work. Alejandro Amenábar is an enviously talented guy. Besides the brilliant script and direction, he wrote a score that darn well should be at least nominated come oscar time.Also, you may hear about how "slow" this movie is. I completely disagree. First of all, it's not an action movie. But, if it developed any faster than it does, it would be silly. I can also say that I felt tense at least 90% of the time, all the way up to the finale. In fact at 114 minutes, I almost wanted a bit more, ALMOST. The great direction, close-ups, acting, low-lighting, and creepy cinematography allow you to feel the fear as the characters do. There's not an ounce of gore, and none is needed. Definitely among the best 3 or 4 films of the year thus far!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The supernatural genre vs. slashers and other horror genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is another great example from the supernatural genre, in the tradition of "The Sixth Sense," "Stir of Echoes," "The Innocents (Turn of the Screw)", Ken Russell's "Gothic," and, perhaps "Flatliners," "The Hauting," and "The House on Haunted Hill." There are always people who will criticize these films as "boring" but the fact is, these films are examples of a particular genre, and will only appeal to their intended audience. The same goes for any genre.The supernatural genre is sometimes categorized as a sub-genre of "horror," but "horror" also includes slasher films, zombie films, and other styles that usually contain a "thrill a minute." Fans of slashers and the like usually will not like films of the more subdued supernatural genre. If you're a thrill-seaker expecting another "Freddie's Dead," or any number of slasher films, skip "The Others" -- it is not intended for you, and I guarantee you will not like it, or any other film of this genre. And here's another thing people just don't ever seem to get: just because you don't like it does not mean it's a bad film (or genre).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, the Others really wasn't as mediocre as people make it out to be. The atmosphere was great, the music kept you on the edge of your seat, the acting was well done, and the ending had a good twist, plus some emotional pull. Not to mention Nicole Kidman's acting in this movie made you feel like you were actually there with her. Altogether I'd have to say it was a pretty good movie. I'm not saying it was the best movie I've ever seen, but I still really enjoyed it. So, if you're not looking for a bloody, gory, horror flick with no plot and you want to see a good movie with a very well done story behind it, see the Others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a "horror" film that doesn't rely on gore, Jason, or Freddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say much since there's lots of info on this film. I will just say that this was a fantastic film!!! Despite some people's comments that it wasn't scary, I found it wonderfully gripping and far more terrifying than any film in recent memory. Then again, I don't find the usual Hollywood Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street pap scary at all. Gore is gore and granted it can be appealing if you like that kind of film, but it's not SCARY. This is film is psychologically scary, especially if you have ever been afraid of being alone in a haunted house or even remotely scared of the possibility of ghosts. What makes this film scary is that it preys on your own fears in much the same way Sixth Sense did (another great film, better than The Others in fact, but only by a bit). And if you find it slow, then you are probably one of the sorry victims of too much MTV and instant gratification. If you like Hitchcock, Sixth Sense, or a horror film that engages your mind, then you'll probably love this film. If you hate it, then you'll probably take comfort in the fact that you can always go home and watch your collection of crappy Hollywood horror crap (ok fine it can be enjoyable in the same way a B-movie can be enjoyable, but admit it...it's crap) and unplug your brain altogether. Then again, perhaps a lot of you could fall into the latter "sub-gerbil" intelligence level. Often the worst films seem to make lots of money and the films of masters like Godard can't get a multiplex release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, predictable, slow, no characterization, and did I already say slow?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: SPOILERS.Alejandro Amenabar has created one of those Hollywood rarities - a film that can warp time. Unfortunately, this film makes its 104 minute run time feel like 3 hours.The film is clearly an attempt to recreate vintage Hitchcock. Like a 1940 suspense/horror classic, Amenabar attempts to using pacing, lighting, and atmosphere to create suspense. It fails. Instead, we get a slow film lacking any suspense and with an unoriginal if not predictable ending.I first glanced at my watch 45 minutes into the film, certain that we were around the 1.5 hour point. I stayed for the whole movie mostly because I was curious which of the possible endings the director had chosen. Given the lack of anything compelling, I was also sure that it would be an ending I had seen before. I was not disappointed.Let's start with character development. There is none. As a result, its very hard to care about these people. Why did Grace go mad and kill her children? Frankly, the kids aren't that appealing anyway.All through the script you keep asking, "why?", and never get an answer. The script is just bad. With "Sixth Sense", the second time you watch the movie you realize how brilliantly it handled Bruce Willis' character. The clues are all there. In this movie, very early on the "Sixth Sense" ending is on your list, but the clues aren't there to support it. So much is just wasted. It makes no sense.What was the point of Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) being light sensitive? It's just not that relevant. What's with Grace's husband (Charles - Christopher Eccleston)? His appearance neither moves the plot along nor gives you clue's into Grace's psyche. Why did she go mad? Why did Charles leave again? What's the story of Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy)? Why are they still at the house? Why are they trying to enlighten Grace?This movie manages to run for 104 minutes and still when its done you know virtually nothing about the main characters.Wait for the video so you can make liberal use of the fast forward button.</fullReview>

I try to see all horror films, because I like to be scared, but until this movie I haven't ever really been scared. I am fairly analytical and I usually know what's going happen long before it does.

The movie owes a lot of its spirit (no pun intended) to the Sixth Sense. Problem is, the pay-off to The Others is essentially identical to that of its predecessor. I couldn't help feeling a small bit of "Oh, not THAT story again..." at the end of this film. It seemed a little TOO similar for my taste.That said, this film is a great one on its own, and I enjoyed it tremendously. I didn't have the same issues with pacing that some people have had. I thought it was a well-executed storyline, even if there were some plot holes here and there. For what it is trying to do, it does it very, very, well. It's a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>finally, a horror movie with a story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i used to love elaborate horror movies when i was little; films with really deep, cerebral perspectives on what the word "scary" could mean. if anyone remembers such movies as "lord of the phantasm" and first two "hellraiser" films, you'll know what i mean. i'm sick to death of these stupid teen films ("scream", "i know what you did last summer", "the faculty") which are just cranked out one after another with absolutely no substance or story, as to satisfy the legions of lackwitted HI I HAVE ADD! dimwits. "the others" is a work of art.*****spoiler*****it's hard to say what i liked best about this movie; everything was great. the imagery was familliar, but not at all "comfortable", and the time period was morbid enough without help. the effect of the book of the dead, on me at least, manifested in a deep "agh crap!" feeling in my stomach. i've had an aversion to photographs of people anyway, but just the thoughts of living in such a place during that time and then finding an artifact created deliberately to devise an afterlife... *shudder*.i once lived in a house where many of the same phenomena occurred... and the people who say this movie is slow and boring seem as if they just can't "get it", perhaps due to a lack of similar experience. the subtle changes in atmosphere in the house, the sounds, the frantic search for the curtains; all these built up to an ambience that must have spooked, if not terrified, some of the more intellectual audiences. towards the end, when we learn that the living have been haunting the dead, i was forced to wonder if nature could actually be as such... i was definitely creeped out and very awake for hours after.unfortunately for me, my experience was dampened by a crowd of rude yard-apes in the back row who insisted on shouting, walking around, and loudly cackling throughout the whole movie. i had to fight the urge to turn around and flood the dark with loud obscenities several times, and once complained to a security guard who had to come in and sit near the teenagers to keep things down. i almost never attend movies in theatres, expressly because of rude children and the laws against throwing them over the sides of the seating area. i'd recommend seeing this movie at a late show during the week, primarily a monday, tuesday, or wednesday. you definitely don't want distractions and disturbances for this one.as a footnote, i was reading other reviews, and i couldn't help but notice how so many people (predominately male, from the looks of it) initially said this movie was boring and slow... is anyone else reminded of max headroom? you can't condense a good story into ninety minutes of brainless chases, screaming, shooting, stabbing, or the like. i once saw "terminatory 2" on tv, condensed to just an hour. it was absolutely horrid. good storytelling takes time and good characters take time to develop. it's good to see i'm not the only person fed up with gangly teenaged actresses running around with their arms flailing and braless tops flying everywhere in productions that amount to little better than tommy hilfiger ads.</fullReview>

The director/writer of THE OTHERS has answered the call and created a mental masterpiece. This movie provides all the hair raising thrills that a true psychological artwork should. What are missing are the tiresome effects that have dulled the viewers' senses and their wits. Nicole Kidman outdoes herself and shows everyone not only what a great beauty she is (an uncanny resemblance to Grace Kelly in this flick) but also what a truly great actress she is. The art and mood in this film are superb. Each moment is filled with a cerebral nibble. Don't miss this one! Regards, Jeneria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first person to comment used the word 'slow' a few times to describe this film. Yes, it was slow and deliberate. But you have to remember that our attention spans are growing ever shorter with the quick cuts and fast action of other films and TV. I appreciated the meandering style of this movie as a pleasant change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since seeing the creepy commercials I've really been looking forward to this. Too many so-called "scary" movies are really just poor excuses for interesting special effects, but this one delivers on its promise of ghost-story chills. Not quite as good as the likes of "The Sixth Sense", but maybe it signals renewed interest in supernatural thrillers like Rosemary's Baby and The Shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supernatural Thriller, worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers . . . ?)To liken this movie to _The Sixth Sense_ is almost to give too much of this away, but the similarities are all too obvious once you've seen it. In other words, if you liked _The Sixth Sense_, you may like this one even better.The only question is: what are you overlooking the entire time that would give away the secret? I was thinking that myself about halfway through, as I really KNEW something like that was coming, but what exactly that was, was pretty hard to tell. For the most part it's a mystery with a seemingly incongruous plot line, and if you haven't guessed already (and you'd already guess about 20 minutes in), there is something about likely interactions between living and dead -- only this does _The Sixth Sense_ one better, in that it really doesn't give you much in the way of clues (until the end) about just what is the nature of the interaction.As the movie develops, though, there is quite a chilling sense about it, given the way that the mother and her two children living in the mansion (the characters and location around which the movie centers) live their lives. A couple scenes are downright macabre, a term Nicole Kidman's character uses in just one of those very macabre scenes, without the need for the oft-used tactic of the instant scare to make you jump in your seat (though it's employed a couple times here). The movie builds up the suspense quite well as it progresses.All in all, I came out of the theater pretty satisfied, though -- like _The Sixth Sense_ -- once you've seen it, you've seen it as many times as you need to in order to get the suspense. One thing that counts against it for me is my aversion to heavy reliance on the supernatural in a film to make sense of the plot. (I don't believe in anything supernatural myself, but even if I did, I doubt I'd appreciate its use as a significant plot device.) Unlike Kubrick's _The Shining_ (my favorite horror film, and perhaps not incidentally, one that places little to no explicit reliance on any supernatural elements), it leaves little room for mystery/ambiguity/wonderment at the end, and becomes all too similar to the standard "ghost story."In any event, being that this is quite good overall (it might even get Oscar consideration, just as _The Sixth Sense_ did), but not profoundly great, I give this one a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film over the weekend which was prescribed by some close friends who promised a "chilly feeling" that would persist in the back region and the nape of the neck that would last for about 1 to 1 and a half hours.The Others is set on an island near post WWII England where a neurotic mother played by Nichole Kidman lives alone with her two kids in a huge dark house. She hires three strangers as housekeepers who soon learn that her children are afflicted with a rare disease that causes their skin to boil in the sunlight and thus must keep every door and curtain in the house closed at all times. Things start to get creepy when her daughter starts seeing ghosts and the strangers seem to know a secret about the house.While I found the film to be original, entertaining, and shot very well, I was also a little disappointed that every once in a while they would throw in these scenes that would basically telegraph to you what was really going on which made the whole "secret" very obvious early on in the film.Still, I WAS entertained and there were some genuine scary moments in the movie that made several people in the audience scream and jump. The plot is pretty basic although the filmmakers try to pretend that it's not. Catch this one for some genuine scares, but you won't feel like you have to sleep with the nightlight on.reviewed by Chris "Beyond"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh? *SPOILERS* The Others from a filmmaker/screenwriter's point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS AHEAD*As having been a Hollywood screenwriter for more than twenty years, the popularity of dreck like this confounds the mind. Nicloe Kidman, a very overrated actress, does her best with the material, but is left in the dark by a poor script.Character development? Never mind that. The emphasis is on atmosphere. The plot twist is EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE, both myself and my viewing partner caught it early on. This is no Sixth Sense. The film lays out too many clues; and when Kidman's dead, confused husband enters into the mix halfway through, it is all to predictable.The fact Kidman's children have a light deficiency disease never factors into the story at all, in fact, it has no relevance. The pacing moves backward and the overbearing music belongs in a darker, more suspenseful film, ala the Changeling. Granted, there are a few decent set pieces, but this is poor at best.Most comments on this film are very positive. To be truthful, none of the plot makes any sense. If they are dead, where does the food come from? How do they cook? How did they get the keys from the living? How do they wash clothes? Are they sleeping in beds with the living? AHHHHH!!!! It's confounding!!!! The Sixth Sense handled this masterfully by having Bruce Willis appear from nowhere, never opening a door, never moving a chair. In The Others, there is no explaination. Recycled idea, poorly executed.3/10Bottom line: Bring a pillow. The Others is a long, dull nap that is offensive due to it's egotistical "ha, ha, fooled the audience" attitude. I despised it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie for gothic drama lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler! Don't read unless you've seen this film.This movie won't please the same crowd that enjoys horror movies like Halloween and Scream. There is a feeling of tension and suspense throughout the film, and an interesting twist at the end, but no blood or gore. Although the movie is about dead people who don't realize they are dead, the story line is far different from the Sixth Sense.However, like the Sixth Sense it is fun to think back and remember various clues. Twice a character said, "Stop breathing like that, stop breathing like that. Stop breathing." Possibly what Grace said as she suffocated the children.Grace also refers to loud noises triggering her migraines. Later we find that she died of a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head.Her husband says, "Sometimes I still bleed." He probably died of blood loss on the battlefield.The three servants who died of tb appear in a death photograph. Not too unusual as there are documented cases at the Princeton tuberculosis web site of household members succumbing to tb within a day of each other. And the photo sure had scare impact.In one scene the daughter's eyes become weirdly opaque. (Other than the scene when she's wearing the communion dress and the medium channels her spirit). It appears the medium is watching through her.I have read the reviews by posters stating they were bored. All I can say is the dramatic tension easily sustained me, and I find myself replaying scenes of the film long after it's over. A terrific film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fine piece of moviemaking. If you want to get scared without gore or special effects, this is the movie for you.Nicole Kidman plays a devoted but shaky mother in post-WWII England whose husband is missing and whose children suffer from photosensitivity (allergy to bright light). Her giant, creepy house in the mists of England must be kept constantly dark, and doors kept closed because of her children's ailment. This is a wonderful device because it allows for several creepy door-opening moments.Is the house really haunted? What is with this strange housekeeping staff? These and other questions had us guessing (wrongly) throughout the movie.Kidman's performance is the best I've seen since "To Die For." She carries this movie beautifully. The supporting cast, especially the two young actors who portray her children, is also quite impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very clever, dark, moody little period piece (are the 1940's a 'period' yet?) that was scary, intense, and very, very well written. Well-directed, too, but most people don't notice that, especially not Hollywood.The characters were very well done, and that's where the focus was, as in "The Sixth Sense." The difference here is, that movie had more eye candy, and more frequently... most viewers might get bored with "The Others," although I certainly didn't. I was riveted, from start to finish. Well-acted, too, all around. Here's hoping Nicole Kidman keeps getting the good jobs. And those kids too, and let's not leave out Mrs. Mills. Great characters, great acting.I have to wonder if I'll enjoy it as much on second viewing, or third or fourth, like "The Sixth Sense." I can't really say for sure, but it was a great time at the theater, and it will be a great time at home on video, during a dark and/or stormy night. Bring a date. And eagerly await all the future films from the Spanish writer/director, already famous elsewhere in the world, and now, give him the change to make a dent on YOUR psyche.High on mood, and scare-factor. I don't remember a single bit of gore, which is a rarity in modern horror movies-- though this isn't horror, it's definitely more psychological. But psychological is tough to fit in movie ads, so we're left with... just a really entertaining film, on all levels. Also a rarity in Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well acted with an appropriate atmosphere for any one who really enjoys classic ghost stories from authors such as Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, and Edith Wharton (of course, I'm not saying that this film in any way measures up to their stories cause it does not). It's a period piece, and that's one of the most charming things about the film, that and the fact that most scenes are lit by candle light alone.All and all, I can't give this movie a great review. It was much to slow and too many scares were not where they should have been. The director teased the audience constantly, and not in a good way. While the many plot twists and turns were very engaging welcomed, the movie just didn't have enough "ommph" to be great. It would have been a great comeback for old fashioned ghost stories, if not for it's flaws.</fullReview>

Treat this movie like a good book - one written by a Henry James, not a Stephen King.The performances are all wonderful. The children act like real children, and Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan force you to question their every move while still retaining your sympathies.A couple of plot points didn't seem to have a satisfactory resolution, but leaving them unaccounted for ultimately adds to the experience.The Others will leave you thinking - especially since the ending is really a beginning.</fullReview>

This movie doesn't use over-the-top (stupid) CGI rather it uses the absence of light and noise to unsettle the viewer and we really start to inhabit that drafty old house. I also was intrigued to see Catholicism strictly portrayed by Nicole Kidman's character throughout the film as a disciplinary tool for her children.

		<shortDescription>Full of symbolism - spoilage included here DO NOT READ if haven't seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your kind of scary movie is "I know What you did Last Summer" or "The Haunting" where most of the suspense comes from special effects or blood-thirsty killers, this is not the movie for you. It's an old fashioned ghost story plain and simple. There are not many visual effects at all, it forces you to use your imagination. Kind of like the original JAWS when you knew there was a killer shark in the water, but until a good way into the movie you never saw it; it was left up to your imagination to ponder what lurked in the deep, blue abyss. What I found most intriguing about The Others, however, was the symbolism. I assume since the director is of Latin descent that he is most likely Catholic, which makes the mother's near-obsession with the faith quite intriguing. Her whole speech to the children about what limbo is and where you go when you die, makes the ending that much more powerful (in my opinion) because you begin to wonder: were they in limbo, or did they just enter limbo? The mother says Anne needs to learn to ask for forgiveness and then we hear her asking the same from the Lord when the truth is revealed, and also from her husband when he discovers her. I would like to go back and see the movie again to try and uncover some of these seemingly small clues and discover, hidden in the midst of a bone-chilling ghost story, a touch of religious commentary and certainly a fair amount of symbolism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this yesterday night, and wondered if only more advertising was done for this movie...It is so much better than the hoards of inane movies thronging the theatres. Many here have blamed this movie for being "too slow", but I always figured it was building towards something. How could you call it slow, when at every turn the plot cleverly, shifted the gaze of suspicion from one set of characters to others.HUUUUGGGGEE Spoilers Below:Yes, I said HUGEEE, so tread forward at the risk of ruining your own film experience :PPlot was full of these subtle twists and excellent exchanges. For instance, Initially my suspicions were about Mrs.Mills, Mr.Tuttle and Lydia being just ordinary humans who probably came in there to scare Grace and her family away. (Which was kinda reaffirmed by the fishy exchange of dialogues between Mr.Tuttle and Mrs.Mills (Mr.T and Mrs. M from here on..) Then towards the end when they figured that Mr.T, Mrs.M and Lydia(L) had been dead for so long, my hunch was that they want to get rid of Grace and her family, but the trio of L, Mr.T and Mrs. M are obviously not human. Then the scene towards the end when, those 3 are standing outside the door of the Mansion and they say that, we know what's to be done, right now you are in there with intruders and your kids. I thought the "intruders" must be ghosts and Grace and her kids are in danger.... but the climax was awesome...the whole scene where the realization sets in was as good as the SIxth Sense climax.MY QUESTIONS: 1. Movie didn't give and explanation as to why Grace killed the kids (with the pillows). Not that it is very relevant, but I Think the clue to this was when Anne said to Nicholas "remember the last time mom had gone mad"...Maybe she was depressed at the loss of her husband or felt cheated by his absence and missing love. Although all this perfectly explains, why she was overprotective of her kids and actually said that she was happy to see Ann still alive after pillow episode and was thankful to the lord for giving her aother chance.2.Also, although we could figure that Grace's husband was dead too (No image in the mirror,when they were talking on the bed), and also the fact that he didn't eat even once despite being so weak, or Slept with his eyes open. Then why did Grace and her family do the normal human things like eating and sleeping. My hunch is that because they still had not realized what they were and there are no obvious harms of doing those things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAJOR SPOILER!!!!!Anyone else notice who was sitting at the table at the climax of the movie? Looks an awful lot like a former X-files star!Check it out! You can see his face clearly during the "We're not dead!" scene. Once the rest of the family leaves the table, and the lights in the room are raised, you can only see his back.Overall, a great movie!! Saw it for the second time the other night and appreciated it in an entirely different way. Outstanding acting by Nicole Kidman - one of the most underrated actresses of our time.SEE IT!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, Boring, Not Scary, Slow Boring..You Get The Picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's really a shame about this movie is that it could (and should) have been a sleeper hit. But because of it's slow pace and lack of any scary jump-out-of-your-seat moments, the film falls to mediocre. The atmosphere was perfect for this film. Located on an abandoned island sits an old manor house with a cemetery next to it. It doesn't get much better then that for a ghostly atmosphere. We learn that Grace and her husband Charles are the owners of the house and live there with their 2 children Anna and Nicholas. The husband had left to fight in the England / German war and has not returned. There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. The daylight can actually injured her children and cause swores and burning if they stay in the light to long. Three strangers appear at the door looking for work. Grace had put in an ad for servants to cook and clean the old manor, or did she? Now, with all of this going for it you would expect at least 3-4 scary moments with the first hour, right? WRONG!! Besides some creaking doors and floors, a piano that plays by itself and won't stay locked and a paranoid Grace and her son, there wasn't a single scary moment in the first hour. There are only 2 scenes that will have you jumping out of your seats, and that just isn't enough. I was literally dozing off during this movie and my girlfriend was "sighing" wondering when something interesting was going to happen. As for the acting, Nicole Kidman did an admirable job, but little Alakina Mann who played the daughter Anna (in her very first movie), literally stole the show. This girl was brilliant. Not only was her dialogue spoken cleaning with precise timing, but her facial emotions were dead on. At times she looked very erie and subdued. Even the little boy who played Nicholas (James Bentley) did a wonderful job. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who did an outstanding job in Waking Ned Devine was perfect for this role and showed her acting talent very well. Nope..it wasn't the acting that killed this movie, it was the script.Everyone is calling this a Sixth Sense clone and in some ways, it is. Most people will figure out the twisted ending long before it gets there. I did! If the writer had let the cat out of the bag half way through the movie and then provided a new interaction between the characters, things could have been a bit different. Instead, the solution was told and the movie ended, just like that. Definitely wait for this to hit the video store. If this movie came out back in the 50's or 60's it might have been worth a look, but with everyone expecting a modern day ghost story, the film just doesn't live up to anyones expectation. Take a pass on this and wait for the next haunting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just seen "The Others", and let me say right off that i wasn't too impressed with the preview. But with the other choices of films that are out there now, this was one if the few films I was willing to have hope in. Unfortunately, "The Others" doesn't deliver at all. This film is extremely slow...for the simple fact that 2 hours are wasted with bare minimum movement in the storyline - to end up a cheesy, wasteful, tasteless finale blatantly comparable to "The Sixth Sense" is a total waste of $10, and a insult to intelligent film-goers. I wouldn't even spend the $4-$5 renting this movie when it gets on VHS/DVD. You plan on going to the movies soon? I suggest seeing some of the "other" films, just walk on by this one. A total waste of time. Grade = D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Ghost Story in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I went to see "The Others" starring Nicole Kidman and produced by her ex, Tom Cruise. Upfront I'll say that my wife has never seen the same movie twice. Once she's seen one, that's it, while I'm the type that watches my favorites over and over again when I have the time. SHE wants to go see "The Others" again next weekend. If you haven't seen it, please do. It is hands down the best ghost story we've ever seen. It was made, not in the hacker/slasher style, but in the best tradition of the spooky, suspenseful films of old, the ones that keep raising goosebumps and have people gasping and sitting right up on the edge of their seats. There is zero actual violence. Remember "Poltergeist"? It SEEMED like everyone was going to be killed all through it, but nobody ever was. There is no gore at all, no foul language that I can remember, but it's just plain SCARY with a twist ending that will knock your socks off. Nicole Kidman plays a young British mother of two, right near the end of WW2, whose husband had gone off to war and is missing and presumed dead. When her servants inexplicably disappear, she is left in this rather large house on one of the Channel Islands always shrouded in fog. Her children are afflicted with a condition that makes them allergic to the sun's rays, so she must keep the drapes always closed in any rooms that they are in. She tutors them herself in both academic and religious studies. After advertising for domestic help, three people show up to apply for the jobs. Then it starts to get weird. And I'm not gonna tell ya any more! If you appreciate a good ghost story, you'll love this one. Guaranteed. It's one of the few that is worth ponying up the $8 to see in the theater. GO NOW! *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!!!!! Although I am no Siskel and Ebert, I gave this movie an 8. The writing of this movie was brilliantly written and was undoubtedly portrayed from the opposite side and/or "Other" side. It was suspenseful, yet boring if you can understand that. The mom (mum) (Nicole Kidman) was one of most uptight, dead ghost I've ever seen in my life. I mean, get a grip, lay down already. I guess she was the ghost with the most! The daughter definitely had issues and the son, if not already dead, would have definitely needed therapy and a good psychiatrists couch for the rest of his life. I pretty much figured out what was going on during the first 15 minutes of the film and I really was not surprised. It was kind of stupid that the husband would come back and be sitting on the bed right across from the mirror and have no reflection, and in the same instance, in the attic, Nicole Kidman has a reflection and they are both dead. In any event, this movie left a lot to be desired. It was ok for what is was, but it was nothing like I expected. I think "The Book of the Dead" was the scariest part of the movie along with that extremely pale little boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so they do make 'em like they used to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using absolutely no CG imagery, nor even blood or gory make-up effects, director Alejandro Amenábar goes old school here, crafting something that is truly special in a year like 2001, filled with meaningless, thoughtless work from directors who have proved they know better. "The Others" is the kind of picture (what they used to call this form of entertainment) that won't really course through your veins until after the end credits roll. Along the way it provides such great imagery, the kind you only see if you're really paying attention. For instance, when Grace is going through the box full of old photo albums, there is briefly revealed a ghostly face in one of them, as if it's watching her. Likewise the opening shot of one scene showing another ghostly face lit in candlelight (you remember the shot), that at first cannot be distinguished as real or a painting. All of it contributes to a singular purpose: not a shot wasted, no line of dialogue that isn't giving you something meaningful."The Others" is beautiful, not just in the way it looks, but thematically as well. Like any ghost story, it explores the spiritual. It doesn't tell you what to believe, but forces you to question the nature of death and hell. I predict that this will be the most underrated film of the year. Audiences have been programmed for too long to expect certain things. Too many films don't trust the audience enough to let them collect information and draw conclusions themselves. Too many films have spoon-fed us. Many will get to the end of "The Others" and say, 'what, that's it?' It's such a subtle work, it'll leave many feeling like there should have been more. For these reasons, this film will probably be forgotten before too long. And yet, it's the kind of film that should be studied for years to come, particular for its writing, direction, and cinematography. "The Others" looks like it could have come from almost any decade. The 'aughts' should be proud to have this film as part of its cinema history.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best film of the summer, despite the naysayers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having looked at the last couple of comments, it seems that the viewers must come from the Michael Bay/Bruckheimer school of film studies-explosions, dumb characters and enough noise to deafen people. What makes The Others unique is that it is quiet. It isn't Scream or even Blair Witch, but rather a somber film that takes it's time to build up to the climax. The best horror films-Psycho, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, Halloween-take the same approach of building up the tension through characters and mood, not computer generated creatures. The Others also succeeds thanks to the characters not being cliched. They all have personality, unlike the nameless bimbos who populate Friday the 13th and other type of films. Sadly the naysayers seem to be winning, since such "is this trip necessary" sequels like American Pie 2 and Rush Hour 2 are ruling the box office. Let's hope that word of mouth spreads, because it would be a shame if a fine movie like this makes less money than such brain dead travesties like Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes and the aforementioned. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one creepy movie. I saw the preview for this movie before Scary Movie two and I knew I had to see it. Every thing about this movie was great. The acting is all done very well. The one thing that surprised me was that I didn't get bored. For the past couple months I have been getting bored and impatient towards the end of movies. But this one is paced very slowly and I didn't even get bored once. The Book of the Dead was one of the very creepy things about this movie. Those pictures were just scary. And one thing that I liked about this movie was the fact that special effects weren't used. I myself prefer special effects but I'm glad none were used here. They weren't needed. They just used creepy noises. The Haunting was all about special effects and I hated it. Now any one who says the ending was predictable was very wrong. I was very surprised. Unlike the Sixth Sense(5/10) I couldn't see it coming. This movie is way better! I am probably going to see it again. I'm surprised that this didn't make more at the box-office. 11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Scariest Movies I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perfectly directed, well written and well acted, "The Others" is an old-fashioned horror movie in the best sense. Clean and simple (it could almost be rated "G" if it weren't so scary), we don't get ambushed by special effects and excessive makeup. No, "The Others" plays with our heads, and it pays off beautifully.In a movie Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of, eerieness abounds, and we are left constantly wondering just what is up with this house. Photographs of dead men, women, and children tucked away in an album. Loud noises in empty rooms. A young girl strangely calm about all the supernatural events she claims to have witnessed. Servants with something to hide. And a heroine on the brink of madness.If you like scary movies, this is a must-see. My fourteen-year-old son was giddy with fright, sometimes even tempted to look away from the screen, but always drawn back to make sure he didn't miss a moment. Me, I never looked away--this movie is far too much fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Creepy Mood Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others absolutely stunned me as a genuinely scary film. I am not one to write spoilers, and I will not do that here. It is sufficient to say, very briefly, that it is well acted, the sets appear high quality, and the plot noteworthy. Although this has been said before, it is similar to The Sixth Sense in the effectiveness of its execution. Most notably, The Others possesses a brilliant, eerie mood that all the actors contribute to, and is carried off without a hitch. This is certainly the scariest, most suspenseful movie of the year. Though there is, admittedly, not much other than throw-away-Hollywood trash circulating through theaters at the moment (Jurassic Park III, Rush Hour 2, etc), this is probably the only flick that I would recommend to someone. It is reminiscent of early horror movies from the pre-gore days, and is definitely worth your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is a master piece. How many films have failed to put us in OTHERS' shoes. Just look at Planet of the Apes. Stinky human says one ape. The context is that in the movie, the human are the second class citizens and the apes are superior. But as the audience, do we believe that what has presented to us is true? If we do, we will not have problems with the scene in which the ape and human kiss...But The Others succeeds in putting us in a context that we can hardly comprehend. Not do we go through the experience of the others, we also come to understand psychologically about Nicole's character before all these things happened -- again the others. Such understanding is two layered, and it is convincing. I was in my shoes when I went in the theater but in others' shoes when I came out of the theater. The Others is a master piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics raved about The Sixth Sense -- Critics raved about What Lies Beneath -- Now critics are RAVING about "The Others". A dark tale of a religious fanatic during WWII, taking care of her two photosensitive children and a dark, isolated old house. Nicole Kidman spells the word ELEGANCE. Yet in this movie she is done up very plain. Her accent is FLAWLESS. Kidman has been BLESSED with a gift and is showing it well this year in particular. First with the blockbuster story/musical of "Moulin Rouge" where Nicole was able to show her SINGING talents as well as ACTING talents. The people are anxiously awaiting "The Hours" starring opposite Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. "The Others" is no normal ghost story -- but a psychological drama/thriller about a woman's fear and deterioration as she starts to fear her secluded house is haunted. The director is a visionary. Setting his scenes inside only by candlelight -- and the fog adds an amazing effect. The dark sound and haunting score make it the more eerie. I always try and imagine other actors or actresses in certain roles to see if their performances are worthy of awards or attention. Nicole Kidman has baffled me. I can't for the life of me see anyone portraying the role any better. The movie is better in all aspects than "The Sixth Sense" and "What Lies Beneath" (both of which tried to frighten with ARTIFICIAL scares). "The Others" never reverts to special effects for scares, only tense scenes, haunting music, amazing cinematography, stellar acting, breathtaking direction and ATMOSPHERE. Oscar Worthy performances by Kidman, director - Ammnebar, art direction, lighting, cinematography, among many other areas. Run don't walk to "The Others". *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definately going to contain spoilers....so read on at your own risk.Ok. Let me clear up an issue about the sixth sense thing I've been hearing. I LOVED the sixth sense. I did not know the ending until it happened, and was shocked...then it made me think back to say "Oh yeah. I saw this and this and this...why didn't I come to that conclusion earlier??" the kid was kind of creepy (Great actor!! Love this kid!!) My skin crawled, I was gripping the edge of my seat. I mean, even predictable things happening, like the little girl grabbing his foot from under the bed, was scarier than heck. I mean, this was a good movie. I love movies that not only shock you and keep you in suspense, but make you go back again to see what you missed and make you really think about the clues you didn't give second thought to, but should have because they told you what to expect in an off side way. It thrills you and makes you think a little.The "Others" almost exactly like it. Two kids who thought they saw a dead boy that turns out to be a boy who saw dead people. They thought they were alive through out the entire show...then ala Bruce Willis, they turn out to be the ones who were dead. Gee, and people are saying there is no connection between the two, and still insist this movie is original??And come on...how scary is it for a mother to punish her braty kids by making them read from the bible out loud? You think that's eerie and thrilling...go to church. You're in for a real thrill there!When the husband arrived the first thing I thought....He's dead. After the husband arrived, the first thing I thought....I bet they are all dead. When they talked about the graves...I got that wrong. I knew the housekeeper and her buddies were dead...But I thought the graves would have Kidman's character and her children's names instead.A few loud bangings upstairs from unseen feet, overdoing the banging noise if you ask me. Creeking and lighter stomping would have been kind of eerie, but to go all out and BANG BANG BANG. oh come on! a book of dead people, been done before in movies, not that gross and spooky anymore, and oh I love how people thought the piano playing was so eerie. Um...yeah. Its scary when potential ghosts play a riviting sonata.These were the most intense moments in the movie as they were the only time you thought there was "a ghost". and the old lady in her daughter's dress speaking with her daughter's voice...that would have been slightly weird, IF that wasn't part of the tv promo for the movie so we all knew it was coming.Trust me...if you are not easily entertained by a few halloween type bumps and bangs, and look for a more deeper, intellectual thrill that chills you and makes you think...this is not really for you. This is so predictable. I hate knowing how it ends minutes into the movie. And for as good as Nic Kidman is as an actress, she seemed just a tad stiff. But it must have been uncomfortable for her knowing she was playing Bruce Wilis. If she wins an award at the emmy's...it better not be for this movie. It should be for a REAL original like Mulan Rouge. THAT was a good original movie.And I can't believe the people who thought this was better than the sixth sense. For crying out loud it IS the sixth sense. The kid who sees dead people, the dead who thought they were the living ones but weren't, leaving that "twist" for the end. And the rest of the movie was just so long and dull because you knew every step, what would happen.My theory...this movie is a sleeper, not a creeper. Sorry guys. It stunk!! Rip off, Copy, Stolen, recycled with poor quality, re-done but poorly written. Bring your pillow. You'll need it. ( I forgot mine.)Normally I give every movie at least credit for originality... It can't even score a point for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid but predictable, especially if one has seen other recent ghost movies. The resolution left a number of loose ends which could have been more imaginatively brought together. The core of the film--the relationship between the living and the dead--could and should have produced something more than a not-very surprise ending. The historical background--the German occupation of the Channel Islands during WWII--was merely used as a prop, not at a part of the narrative. Similarly, the use of Catholic imagery and theology (which was often oddly misstated) seem to have little or no bearing on the story or its resolution. The Others has the ingredients of a classic, but fails to blend them into a satisfying whole.</fullReview>

There is a great twist at the end. It just does not take your breath away like it should have. I suppose that you could compare it to "The Sixth Sense," though it is not nearly of the same caliber as this movie. I'm not sure what this movie could have done differently to make it better.

		<fullReview>The reason Kubrick's THE SHINING is the one successful haunted-house movie of recent times is that Kubrick went at the yin through the yang. Shorn of Gothic effects, the movie situates Gothic horrors in the stark fluorescent lighting and stainproof rugs of a Radisson Hotel Luxury Suite. A beautiful woman deliquescing into a rotting hag is somehow all the more primally horrific under cold all-around white light. All the old-dark-house cliches Kubrick and his co-scenarist, Diane Johnson, swept off the table in THE SHINING have landed in the lap of this elegantly directed thriller. (Those Kubrickian crumbs piled up in abundance in the absurdly overpraised, and overpopular, SIXTH SENSE.)Nicole Kidman is a single mom in a big creaky house in the moors. She has two kids who, she tells the eyebrow-raising new nanny, are "allergic to light." This has the convenient side effect of making most of the movie Caravaggio-dark; it also gives the director the opportunity to exercise his fluffing-sheets-over-the-windows and sudden-shock-of-daylight muscles. The kids have a dad who may or may not be alive, and may or may not be a soldier at the front. And soon enough, Mom, Junior and Sis' creepy, claustral little home-schooling world is interrupted by banging noises upstairs, clangor on the piano, and mysteriously self-unlocking doors...Alejandro Amenabar, the writer-director-composer, swirls up a tasty, classy, early-Hammer-horror atmosphere--Hammer before the pandering to sex. The Catholic mania of the mom is very cleverly built into her possible madness, and Amenabar deftly juggles all the possible layers of irreality and illusion that may be taking place at any moment. He's also lucky to have Nicole Kidman as the mother: not yet really a great actress, she is a great star, and she brings to the role a quality surprisingly similar to that of Piper Laurie in CARRIE--a raging sex-mad succubus underneath the church-white linens. Unfortunately, the movie is a veritable encyclopedia of creaky-door cliches. (The only one missing is the jowly, friendly constable who stops by and notices that...something isn't right.) The ending, a little evocative of Lucio Fulci, is nicely joined, but also a little too evocative of another, recent popular horror movie. (This being Anti-Spoiler Central, I won't give it away, but...it shouldn't take too much imagination to figure out.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best "Ghost Stories" ever told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, The Others is a quiet &amp; powerful film about ghost that occupy a house. Unlike the dumb teen-slasher flicks of recent years, "The Others" is not your typical horror movie, but rather an intelligent film that never resorts to the cheap scares of most films within the genre. Nicole Kidman has never been better in her career as her performance here is powerful &amp; heartbreaking all at once. Though she probably won't, she is well deserving of an Oscar nomination. Her strongest scenes are with actors who play her children (Alakina Mann &amp; James Bentley) who in terms of acting are right there with Kidman. Alakina especially is fantastic as the daughter who's more astute than her mother gives her credit for. The relationship between brother &amp; sister is spot on as well. Director Alejandro Amenabar sets the tone of the movie immediately &amp; thankfully never wavers. Much like "The Shining", Amenabar gives the house its own personality &amp; feeling of danger that always remains just out of sight. In this 2001 summer of big budget FX popcorn movies, The Others reinforces yet again that a 200 million dollar studio film with 2-3 "Movie Stars" can never substitute for a fantastic script, great directing &amp; powerful acting. The Others is the best films I've seen this year &amp; is one of the best "Horror" films of all time. There are some movies that simply must be experienced to truly feel its impact...this is one of those rare treasures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who see "The Others" with the intent to be scared witless by figures leaping suddenly out of dark corners or by axe-wielding maniacs are in for a big disappointment. This film is much smarter than that. It is quietly moody--the anxiety level is almost subliminal, and for that reason all the more compelling. Nicole Kidman, looking eeriely like a reincarnated Grace Kelly, carries the film as the increasingly distraught mother of two precocious but mysteriously odd children, flanked by three kindly but equally unusual servants. The film opens with Kidman awakening early one morning with a blood-curdling scream--a primal scream that seems just barely sustained at the base of her throat for the rest of the film. She is at once icy and nurturing, in a bravura yet understated performance that I can only compare to (and I am honestly sorry to do this) Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense". Kidman proves, if nothing else, that she is an accomplished actor who is in complete control of her craft. The children are also excellent--the film wouldn't work if they were not. Nevermind if you guess the outcome of the film in advance, as did I--the ending is still fully satisfying and chillingly thought-provoking. Beautifully photographed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that proves MST3K should still be on the air.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The TV spots for this film make it look quite exciting; a film of suspense and great scare-tactics. When the beginning credits began to roll, I was delighted by the black-ink drawings depicted on old, yellowed pages. I felt this could be a fun movie. However, at 25 minutes into the film when the plot had yet to truly surface, it was evident that this movie was lacking in a lot of things. The plot did finally surface, however amidst in the middle of massive plotholes, poorly developed characters, and bad scripting. When we finally reach the climax of the film we are actually subjected to some scenes that, while meant to be frightning, the entire crowd in the theater I was in laughed like they were jokes. I will give the movie one bonus, however, The final 10 minutes of the film were actually well done. It was almost as if someone else wrote the final 10 minutes, or the writer had a good idea and used 2 hours of poorly-written filler. My main thought throughout this film was it seemed like it was something that one would expect to see on "Mystery Science Theater 3000" due to its gaping plot-holes and poor dialogue. If you plan to see this, be forwarned, BRING A PILLOW. Myself and the others I were with almost fell asleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been scarier ... but still good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Warning: Spoilers Ahead ***Since I saw the Sixth Sense first, I had an idea of how this movie would end around the time Grace (Kidman) mentioned the absence of the letter carrier. Having been a paperboy in my youth, I would definitely avoid a house like that. My idea about the ending suddenly changed during the middle of the film thanks to Kidman's great performance. She convinced me that Grace's sanity was in question. I started thinking that she might have been imagining everything ... even the children. I was preparing myself for an ending where the people who bought the house would barge in with several policemen, point at Grace, and say "She's the one. She's crazy. She talks to herself, locks herself in the house, and refuses to acknowledge we are the new owners. Officers, take her away!" For me, that would have been scarier because it shows that people are the ones who "see what they want to see". Especially true when they have lost loved ones. I must admit that I wanted to see the film just for the ending. The ending was just not as scary as I thought it would be.Overall, I really enjoyed the film because it was soo mysterious. The build-up was done really well. Setting and acting were all well done. Just a note about another post that commented on why we can't stop ghosts with guns but doors work. I believe that the gun Grace was using was not really there. A ghost gun perhaps? But the house and the locked doors are real. The director might also be putting a spin on the old myths about evil things being able to enter only if they are invited first. Something Grace does in the beginning, and possibly at the end after she discovers the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, but too slow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I had not even heard of this film until my wife mentioned it. We only went to see it because of the high IMDB rating. I have mixed emotions about this film. It was most obviously inspired by the Sixth Sense, although it does offer a different spin on that theme. The acting was fantastic. I did not know Kidman was that good. The supporting cast was also equally as excellent, as was the directing of the film.But, this movie is sooooooooooo slow! You are left constantly, constantly waiting for something to happen, but get nothing until the last 20 minutes of the film. I found myself frustrated, and just wanted the end to come so that the movie would make sense. Fortunately, the movie does explain itself, but the explanation did not totally make up for the time it took to get to the punch line. That said, I would still recommend this film. The acting is so good that it merits viewership. Besides, the Sixth Sense was so phenomenal that we have to expect people to copy from it. Imitation is, after all, the highest form of flattery.-- DP.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a good film in a summer of stale, stupid movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After most of this summer's films, I left the theater feeling like I had contributed money toward the intellectual decline of America. The Others was a refreshing change in this sad trend. Comparisons to the Sixth Sense will inevitably be made by folks who have had their sensibilities atrophied by too many lame thrillers, but -- except for the most obvious and shallow of plot points -- there really is no basis for comparison between The Others and The Sixth Sense. Both are fine films with entirely different agendas. The Others joins a very small list of authentic film ghost stories, descendants of the rarefied and poetic fiction of the late Victorian era. Wiser comparisons would be to the original version of the Haunting, The Changeling, or the obscure 1989 TV film The Woman in Black -- films about the places, dramatic and metaphoric, our world touches the world beyond death, but also about the philosophical implications of such contact. The Others will be too slow for viewers more accustomed to recent fare like the remakes of the Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, but for people who like their chills a bit more subtle, it is a rare and very fine treat. With superior performances, atmospheric sets, and an allegorical content that will be lost on many viewers, The Others may be the best film I have seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally amazing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely incredible. Nicole Kidman is amazing in it, but what else is new? Fionnula Flanagan ('Waking Ned Divine') also gave a chilling performance, as did Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy (Who, having virtually no lines, superbly managed to make you even jumpier throughout the movie just by looking at her frightened facial expressions) The two that surprised me the most were, of course, the children. According to the IMDB, this was a first movie for both Alakina Mann and James Bentley, but they seemed like Hollywood veterans up on the screen. Both are wonderful actors and adorable kids. This movie really brought back the feel of films as they were long ago, you know? I mean, yes, it takes place in 1945. But there was no gore, which I think made it about a billion times better than those movies that people think are so phenomenal because they show some dead people. Don't get me wrong, I liked The Sixth Sense. I've heard a lot of people compare The Others to it, but honestly- The Others is even better. Although, The Others is definitely the same as The Sixth Sense in that they both need to be seen a few times for you to really understand every detail. I've already seen it twice and am going back again this week. An utterly chilling movie. Probably the first to ever make me so frightened that I literally began to shake. I give it two very enthusiastic thumbs-up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, well-crafted psychological thriller - POSSIBLE SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see "The Sixth Sense," I had read MANY reviews referring to the "twist ending" so I went in looking for it, had it figured out in the first 10 minutes, and it ruined the experience for me. Thank goodness I hadn't read much on "The Others," and what I did made no intimations about the plot turns and surprises. It is so refreshing to see a film that actually left me guessing and wondering where it was heading. I've gotten so tired of the endless parade of formulaic movies in which you know EXACTLY what's about to happen. It is certainly also VERY refreshing to see a well-scripted, filmed, stylish "haunted house" film that doesn't rely on computer-generated demons and gore. As many reviewers and users have commented, it is much scarier NOT seeing what's behind the door...The only reason to compare "The Others" to "The Sixth Sense" is that it shares some significant plot elements. Other than that the two films, both wonderful in their own right, belong to two very different genres - "The Others" is a throwback to some of those wonderful old black-and-white gothic thrillers that relied on the door that closes on its own and odd noises upstairs. In fact it felt much like a classic novel - speaking of which, how many others found it remarkably similar to Henry James's novella "The Turn of the Screw"?If you love and miss classy, artful, and genuinely frightening old-style psychological thrillers, this is the one for you. If you've gotten brain-numbed by special effects, car chases, and gore and find these kind o f movies "slow" - I feel sorry for you. You're missing out on a whole lot of what movie-going used to be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better the The Sixth Sense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If (when) The Others becomes a fairly popular film, then many comparisons will be made to The Sixth Sense. The only real reason that it would even be compared to The Sixth Sense is the shear fact that The Sixth Sense was the last decent psycologial horror film to come out. The Others is a completley different film, except for the fact that the children can see ghosts (or can they...) The Others, who's only star is Nicole Kidman, is a tense, creepy, and sometimes just damn horrifying, expericence. I wont give away any of the plot, it's too complicated, but I will say that where The Sixth Sense relied on one big twist to pull everything together, The Others has several. The Others is a film that was thought out, well written, and then executed with perfection. In reading other user comments, I have noticed that some didn't like the end twist. I personaly thought it was more cleaver then The Sixth Sense. But that's just my two cents worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviews and comments liken "The Others" as a psychological horror film in the vein of "The Sixth Sense." While this is readily apparent, I noted that this film shares much of the ambiance and structure of Roger Corman and Vincent Price Poe adaptations such as "House of Usher" and "The Pit and the Pendulum." I sometimes expected Price himself to pop out from behind a door to deliver some trademark macabe lines. Like Price and Corman's films, "The Others" takes place in the clearly defined environment of a creepy old house and functions with a minimal cast. "The Others" also share a wonderfully rising tension that truly scares the viewer, instead of relying on cheap scares such as ghouls popping out. Perhaps the twists of "The Others" remind the viewer of "The Sixth Sense" and "Stir of Echoes," but in my mind "The Others" is a wonderful reconstruction of some classic horror.</fullReview>

The acting is good, even the children were good in this one. Don't expect some masked and deranged fellow pop out of nowhere and start jabbing people with a huge knife.

		<shortDescription>More than just "Scary Stuff"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To write my review I would like to rebuttal the comments that continually compare this film to that of the Sixth Sense. The major difference between The Others and The Sixth Sense is that The Sixth Sense is a psychological drama with supernatural elements. The Others is a psychological MYSTERY, with possible supernatural elements. Two different genre's of film-making, two different ways of telling a story. The surprise ending is usually a mandatory constituent of a mystery film. The surprise ending to The Sixth Sense was interesting but raised question to possible plot holes. The other remarkable device The Others presents is theory and conception. The Sixth Sense lays out exactly what is trying to be achieved and the "surprise" ending is not out of character of the whole plot. The Others ending may not have been a surprise to a select few audience members, but that's the point of a mystery, combining clues to theorize a climax ending; figure it out, congrats, to the rest of us who didn't, surprise! In the end what is important is how you leave the theater, and while my friends and I left the The Others talking about possible theories the ending presents and what parts made us jump completely out of our chair, leaving The Sixth Sense we were questioning the obvious plot holes that the ending left us with. Everything about The Others is chilling. Cliché? Perhaps, but what is more satisfying than an old English mansion, surrounded by fog, with child inhabitants who fear seeing the sun at the medical risk of death? Especially when telling a horror story. Not one drop of blood is shed in order to scare. No CGI monsters, no running through the house as the floorboards are lifted from beneath them. Noises, voices, mystery and psychological drama are the tricks to create fear. The performances were creepy and admirable. The sets were perfect. The story was masterful, is this really a haunted house or haunted minds? Who are the caretakers, whats up with the husband, what happened to Grace to make her children more afraid of her than the possible ghosts? So much mystery and all answered wonderfully. Bone chilling, thought provoking entertainment. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>( A- ) I was pleasantly surprised by this one. But I must say that the trailer was poorly done. I wasn't at all tempted to see this movie until I saw the high rating (8.3/10) on IMDb. That made me curious enough to go and see the movie. I'm glad I did. THE OTHERS is a great classic ghost story right up until the end when the viewer is shocked with an amazing twist. The acting is good, even the children were good in this one. Don't expect some masked and deranged fellow pop out of nowhere and start jabbing people with a huge knife. This is a good old fashioned ghost story, which means that there's no gore and no real violence. That DOES NOT mean that you will not be frightened; if you pay close attention, you most certainly will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a new and interesting different perspective of a ghost story. Some parts may have seemed a bit corny and overdone, but overall I found it thrilling. It's quite confusing up until the end, where the truths and mysteries unfold, and the viewer then finds a true appreciation for the story. I was a bit confused however as to what the message of the movie was. I know there had to be one, the story was very profound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A buddy and I were originally going to see American Pie 2, however, it was sold out. So we checked this movie out, and I'm pretty damned happy I did! I don't know where to start...EVERYTHING in the movie was gorgeous. From Nicole Kidman, to the kids, to the house...pretty much everything. This movie made me jump at least three times, and that's without ever showing and blood or deranged killers stalking people in the house. The ending had me in awe! While some people guessed it, I did not, and that made the movie that much more enjoyable. Be warned, though. Don't go if you are sleepy or tired, and the first 45 minutes or so are spent setting up the rest of the movie, and could be considered "slow". Didn't really bother me, though. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is a surprisingly effective supernatural thriller / ghost story from the Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar ("Open Your Eyes"). It is a type of film where the less you know (about its plot), the more you will enjoy it--so, I will refrain from commenting on the actual plot of "The Others." However, I must remark that it is refreshing to see a horror film that taps into, and makes effective use of, the fears that are naturally "hardwired" into all of us (e.g. the dark, creeking doors, unidentified noises), instead of trying to induce artificialshock and terror into us (the usual method is: something suddenly jumps into frame, accompanied by a loud "boom!" on the soundtrack). "The Others" manages to generate an enormousamount of claustrophobic eeriness and suspense (most of the story takes place inside a house which has its windows covered with curtains) which are occasionally punctured by real moments of surprise. Nicole Kidman is present virtually in every scene and her natural and believable performance is a large part of what makes "The Others" so absorbing. This film should appeal to thoughtful horror fans who prefer suspense and mood over gore and blood. It is the best example of its genre since 1999's hit, "The Sixth Sense."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A haunting film that combines elements from the best of this genre (`The Innocents', `The Changeling', `The Sixth Sense') but also owes much to the literary ghost story. The lonely heroine, the wartime setting, and the prominent role of light are all reminiscent of some of the best supernatural tales of Elizabeth Bowen, such as `The Demon Lover' and `The Happy Autumn Fields.' This is an intensely psychological, character-driven drama that benefits from an outstanding performance by Kidman in the complex role of Grace. The opening narrative dialogue is a brilliant piece of thematic scene-setting; keep it in mind as this chilling tale of strange wonders unfolds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right up there with The Haunting (1963 version)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of GOOD horror movies, those that are suspenseful, not obvious, keep you guessing types. My absolute favorite was The Haunting (1963) because 1) it scared the begeezers out of me when I saw it at a theater, 2) it was filmed in black and white- much more ominous, 3) you never really saw anything that explained what was going on. I do have a precious VHS copy &amp; have been hoping it will be released on DVD. When I first saw the trailer for The Others I was quite excited; this looked like the first possible successor since Sixth Sense. I saw it today; I was definitely Not Disappointed. Nicole Kidman was luminous, reminded me so much of Grace Kelly; the entire premise of the children's disease was genius. The movie was in effect black and white. Nothing was really seen. The house itself was perfect. Possibly the difference in the pacing of the movie was because it was filmed by a European??? Don't know, doesn't matter- it's terrific!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have been more analytical. I consider myself somewhat of a legitimate critic. However, I never start taking the movie apart until after the fact. Perhaps that's beneficial, in that I always enjoy movies more while watching them. But then again, I feel like a fool when I totally love a movie and then it hits me as I walk out of the theater, "That was just like another movie I saw!" So was the case with me when I saw "The Others." It was a very nicely made and fun movie. I don't know if I can recall a movie where the audience was more into it than it was with this movie. Perhaps there was even more audience surprise and interaction than there was with "Sixth Sense." And that's where the comparison comes in. Though the "others" had that rather genius touch of the lighting to it, I can't escape how similar to "Sixth Sense" it was. Except for the difference in story line and the fact that the dead people could only SOMETIMES see the living, it was just another case of the leads actually being dead people the whole time, not realizing it until the end and "only seeing what they wanted to see" until that final realization. There was the brilliant(in my opinion) stroke of having Anne actually "possess" the old woman. The way they did that scene was great. However, in the grand scheme of things, I feel like "The Others" was more of an "other era" adaptation of Shyamalan's masterpiece than it was an original work. Though I will always enjoy "The Others", it will never be an equal with "Sixth Sense" in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who are the others?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, may contain spoilers.Although I can't say that The Others is as good a haunted house film as The Changeling and even something like Amityville Horror II, it is still a very atmospheric, dark and well done film that most horror films only wish they could emulate. This is a film that accentuates psychological terror and atmosphere over blood and machetes. It also takes its time getting to the point but along the way you are treated to a film that wants you to figure out what is going on, literally behind closed doors. I had heard from people that there is a great twist at the end of the film and that made me keep my horror senses open. I really tried to figure out what the catch was, but about a third of the way into the film, I ceased trying to figure it out and I was just enjoying the film for all of it's artistic merit and style. And what this film lacks in the area of genuine scares and chills, it more than makes up for in the aesthetic of the film and the make-up. I recommend this film to anyone that is tired of all the Scream rip-offs and films that have no idea what the difference is between gore and raw primal fear. I can, in a way, compare this film to a film like The Blair Witch Project. It's not what you can see that frightens you, it's what you can't. We are always afraid of those sounds that go bump in the night. But not necessarily what makes them. The Others never forgets that concept.When you make a film about a haunted house, the first thing you have to do is have a great setting and an ominous looking house. The Others accomplishes that by having it take place in the 40's, just after the war, in England. For some reason, English haunted houses just seem ripe with history and they create an atmosphere conducive to the chills and fears that haunted houses produce. This house is no exception. Nicole Kidman plays Grace and she and her two children live alone in this ominous house. Her two children are both photosensitive, which means that if sunlight, or any strong light touches their skin, they could break out in massive hives and die. This is a clever plot device because it means that the entire film has to be filmed with the lights off and only dim candles burning for light. Other film makers would kill for a premise like this because it actually gives the director a legitimate reason for the lighting to be the way it is. And lighting is one of the key components in any horror film. As the plot moves along, we find out that Grace's daughter, Anne, seems to be able to see and talk to ghosts in the house. Grace, being a devout religious believer, doesn't believe in ghosts and tells Anne that she is lying. She also tells her that when you lie, you don't go to Heaven, you remain stuck somewhere in purgatory. Harsh words to be telling a 12 year old no less.Suddenly, three servants come knocking on the door and tell Grace that they are there in response to the ad that she put in the paper (but what are their real motives for being there?). Grace hires them and they go about their business of making sure the shutters are closed and all the drapes are shut. It is also a strict rule that before one door is entered, the other has to be locked. This presents some problems for the caretakers as there is some 50 doors in the house.The Others plods along and drops hints every once in a while to assist us in trying to figure out what is happening and what the so called secret is. But not enough to make it obvious. The imbroglio just keeps getting stranger as the film prods forward. Director Alejandro Amenabar has a keen eye for detail and he does a good job of keeping us interested. Some eerie looking pictures show up and then are brought back later in the film and before you realize it, the conclusion is upon us. And when the twist comes, you are almost glad that it ends the way it does. This is similar to The Sixth Sense where you may want to see it again to see if you missed anything the first time around. I have only seen it once, and although it is a good film, I don't planning on seeing it again. I am satisfied that I picked up everything the first time around. And as I said at the beginning of the review, if you are more interested in a film like Urban Legend and I Still Know What You Did.... then perhaps this is not the film for you. The payoff is worth the wait, but you have to be patient.8 out 0f 10-- Much more in the style of Sixth Sense than Friday the 13th. And as much as I enjoy the Friday films, I will take a film like this any day over a film like Halloween 10 or Nightmare on Elm Street 9.</fullReview>

For instance the piano is played but one doesn't get to see the player, okay, so it's the ghost, but what was he trying to achieve ?

		<shortDescription>A Classic Haunted House story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it to be a fascinating and eerie haunted house story that actually made me afraid to sleep with the lights off for a night or two. The only other movies that ever accomplished that were Poltergeist and The Changeling. The more common teen slasher horror movies aren't all that scary or interesting to me. I do so hope that this movie does well enough at the box office, so that fans will be able to see more diversity in the horror movie genre in upcoming years. I honestly didn't see the ending as being cliche, as others have noted. Instead, I found it rather original in a roundabout way. The Others is still quite different from the movie that it is often compared to.</fullReview>

For example, that the family has had visits or a relationship with the clergy in town is false -- if you chose to blame it on the mother being delusional then why did the other ghost perpetrate that falsehood when she did everything else to show the mother reality....?The premise that there would be established roles of superior to working stiff in a ghost relationship is quite a stretch -- is it not? They are working because ... ??Finally, bullets go through these ghosts but they can't seem to go through closed doors and they feel the cold ... how convenient .. to making them seem human!!</fullReview>

Are people that hungry for a good film that they will pretend to like it, or do they scare too easily, especially at nothing but loud noises. I was so disappointed that I felt cheated.

		<fullReview>In a horror market filled with useless gore and pointless plots, it's a breath of fresh air to see a quality scary movie. Looking back on the film, there wasn't an abundance of frightening scenes. Instead of the usual "visible" ghost activity, the writer/director Alejandro Amenabar relied on an eerie atmosphere; you get the feeling something supernatural is occurring, without being shown what "it" is. There are no flashy special effects or CGI monsters. At times, the expressions on the faces of the characters, heightened by an eerie soundtrack, composed by Amenabar himself, are enough to chill the viewer.If you have read any review of this film, you know it has a surprise ending. Thus, you may spend the entire duration of the film trying to add things up and figure it out before they reveal it. I did this, and managed to only figure out part of the surprise. The rest shocked me.Fans of Polanski and Shyamalan will love this movie. Many critics have compared it to the "Sixth Sense", but I don't think the two come close to eachother, plotwise. They are related only in the use of atmosphere to scare the audience.This is probably not a movie for the "Hollywood Blockbuster" lover. It requires a lot of thought and imagination. Many will find it slow and laborious. Others will find it to be a breath of fresh air in a stale and formulaic genre.</fullReview>

You might like this film if you are bored with all of the gimmicky variations on slasher horror films. You might like this film if you liked The Innocents (1961). You might like the film if you like a slow well-structured plot rather than a thrill-a-minute ride.You might strongly dislike this film if you thought that any of the above or Unbreakable and 6th Sense were booring in comparison.

		<fullReview>Very few thrillers have kept my interest mostly due to the fact that the thrills and chills are so obviously done they are anything but. However that is not the case in "The Others," a well made thriller that combines a great atmosphere with excellent acting, that make this one of the best films of the year by far. Nicole Kidman plays a mother who lives in an old house with her two children, who are very sensitive to sunlight, so the house is always dark, except for the occasional candlelight lamp, which gives the film a very creepy feel that stays throughout the entire movie.  Not much more should be said, but I will wrap up by saying again that this is one of the best films this year and (even though I normally don't like her in movies) Kidman definitely deserves Oscar consideration for her great performance.  I give this movie, **** out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Others' is a movie that is extremely rich in atmosphere. Kidman's character, Grace, and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a mansion that is constantly surrounded by a thick fog. Plus, most of the movie is candle lit. The light, and lack there of, plays a huge role in much of the movie, and creates a thick sense of tension and sometimes dread.  However, no matter how good the atmosphere was, the pacing was a little awkward. It was generally slow, sometimes bordering on being to slow, all building towards a supposedly startling conclusion. I will admit that I thought it was decent, at least somewhat original and smart. In a lot of ways however, it just wasn't worth it.  You could probably talk to your friends afterwards about what made you jump, what didn't, and what you thought of the ending. All in all it was a movie that had great potential and lived up to most of it. It was good, but I wouldn't highly recommend it. 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others was a haunted house story that everyone will remember, it has a clever plot and outline,spooky music and props in the background and this house is just plain scary no electricity and no telephone, which the movie the haunting had electricity and a cell phone in the house.This movie is plain darkness and all they have is little candles to roam around the house. Nicole Kidman was excellent and so was the entire movie.The movie was a little slow in the beginning but it kept speeding up. Overall if u want to be spooked and liked the Sixth Sense you'll love this thrilling movie of the year. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved, loved, loved "The Others". Chilling and suspenseful and just plain fun. Nicole deserves an Oscar nomination. The kids were incredible, too. I was entranced throughout, not knowing WHAT to expect. A refreshing good-old-fashioned(made even better with modern cinematography)-creepy-ghost movie that deserves a 10/10!</fullReview>

The Others is a refreshing change from the usual special effects overloaded films that have become so popular today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I favor story lines featuring haunted houses. I've enjoyed THE HAUNTING and POLTERGEIST just to name two. I enjoyed them both. I had to see THE OTHERS. Nicole Kidman was superb as the mother as was the person playing the Nanny (name escapes me). The director took an unusual view of this story which I liked. The plot development however, was so excruciatingly slow that the movie failed to provide a satisfactory result. If this one hour and 54 minute story could have been reduced to one hour, this would have been a truly memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really waiting for a good "horror" film to come out, because I don't think I've seen a good one since the 80's (and even that's questionable.) It seems every attempt at the "horror" genre has been plagued with its slew on teenage fodder who scream &amp; yell and are snuffed off, one by one. Well... the only entertainment value in that is seeing these useless snots being mutilated in various ways... but it's fake... so who cares... they just bought a new car with the profit!So that brings me to my thoughts on "The Others."This was FABULOUS! I haven't seen anything this classy in the "horror" genre since Alfred Hitchcock was still making films! No blood, no gore, pure suspense... classic ghost story... and unique! Perfect twist in the end... I felt it had the same kind of "twist" that "The Sixth Sense", "Stir of Echoes", &amp; "Unbreakable" all had in common... one that throws you a total curveball. Thats the way a horror film should be! Suspenseful, &amp; mindblowing in the end. It doesnt have to be gory... if its gory... its not scary... if it stirs up your senses, and you get edgey... and you get embroiled in theplot... and the slighest noise makes you jump... THAT'S HORROR! That's what "The Others" did.I'm not even gonna say what happened... I dont want to spoil it... just go see it!This was by far the best film I ever seen Nicole Kidman in (of course I have yet to see Moulin Rouge!) 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "The Sixth Sense" - SPOILERS POSSIBLY!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked out of the movie theatre with my friends after seeing "The Others", they asked me why we didn't go to see American Pie 2, and I heard a woman behind me saying that the movie stunk. I couldn't understand how anyone could think the movie could have stunk. I heard many people complain about the ending, saying it copied too much on "The Sixth Sense". But I thought this movie was better than "The Sixth Sense" so I didn't care. I thought this film was much more innovative than "The Sixth Sense" and not to mention creepier. I think the problem was people were expecting another "Sixth Sense" type film with lots of jumpoutofyourseat thrills, which "The Others" did have but not as much as "The Sixth Sense". "The Others" was a slower film that had a few thrills and in the end succeeds in giving the viewer a feeling of dread, which is good. "The Sixth Sense" has a happy ending while "The Others" has a much more darker ending. With great performances from all of the actors, magnificent cinematography, art direction, and costume design, "The Others is a smooth flowing, carefully paced, and innovative ghost story. Like I said, I liked it better than "The Sixth Sense" but this won't get nominated for best picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought The others was a great movie overall. Nicole Kidman was great and so were the kids. The movie might have been a little slow in the beginning, but it just built up the suspense of the movie. Although these days everyone considers a movie is slow if there's not a hot sex scene, or if someone isn't getting shot. This movie is just like a classic thriller movie about a haunted house. The ending might be a little similiar to the Sixth Sense, but I think the Sixth Sense had a whole different plot to it. I thought the ending for the Others was very surprising, I was just suspecting them to move out or something, but it had a very interesting twist to it, which made the movie more suspenseful. I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that big a surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to the advertising for this movie, the ending is not as big a surprise as they would have you believe. I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that with the plethora of "misleading" movies out there today it isn't hard to figure out what is going on.The whole of the movie is dimly lit and overly spooky. The movie is set in a large manor house with curtains on all the windows to protect the children from the sunlight (they are photo-sensitive). A constant supply of fog, austere costumes and actors who could sit for American Gothic complete the setting. Frankly, by the time the real intense part of the movie started I was already inured to the setting. And that was one of the great failures of the movie. Trying to keep the audience on the edge of their seats the entire movie is a losing proposition. Although there were a few jump scenes that broke through and caused a few yells in the audience.Overall the movie was fair, nothing too memorable, but probably worth seeing if you are into the suspense genre, or are a fan of Nicole Kidman. Somehow she seems way too at home in these period pieces. I gave it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So you thought "The Sixth Sense" was good! This movie will put you in a coma!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is an extraordinary psychological thriller, full of suspense, frightening scenes and surprises that are guaranteed to blow your mind. Honestly, I never thought that they could make a better ghost movie than the "The Sixth Sense". I was thinking, "why bother making another ghost movie while there isn't much left you could possibly add? It has been done already!" I couldn't possibly be more wrong. It begins like an ordinary ghost movie but it develops into something purely unimaginable to the point of making "The Sixth Sense" look like "Sound Of Music"! I assure you that "The others" will become a classic in a short time and be a HUGE SUCCESS. This is an extraordinary movie, a magnificent cinematic achievement. Its suspense excels any other movie I have seen (except maybe "Alien" and "Silence Of The Lambs"). This movie is EVEN better than "Jacob's Ladder" and "The Sixth Sense"Why is it better than "The Sixth Sense"? 1) It has a better plot that keeps you at the edge of your seat -at times while it doesn't make you jump out of it. 2) There are more suspenseful scenes and they are MUCH scarier than the ones in "The Sixth Sense". In fact, the scenes are so scary that they make audience LITERALLY jump out of their seats! 3) It also has more surprises (In "The Sixth Sense", there was only one big surprise at the end). 4) It also has more characters that make the plot more sophisticated whereas "The Sixth Sense" had only two main characters (or maybe three, including the mother). 5) It keeps you guessing right to the end and the pay off is quite magnificent. 6) The camera and sound effects are used in much superior and advanced ways. The scenes are shot from a perfect angle in such a masterful way; they actually add more tension to the already suspenseful situation. You could almost hear the whispers of ghosts as if they were whispering in your ear. Even when those ghostly sounds overlap with the sounds made by the characters in the movie, there is a sensible distinction that creeps you out. 7) The location of the story is also much more perfect for such a story than in "The Sixth Sense". The whole house itself, its interior designs, and its massiveness gives you the creeps. What I didn't like about the movie: You may find some inconsistencies if you think how the elements of the material world can share the same platform with the otherworldly, but there is no infallible way to overcome this in a ghost theme anyway. I loved the movie in its entirety. The Best Scene Of The Movie: The scene where Nicole Kidman faces The Others at the end of the movie. Line of the movie: "Sometimes the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living." spoken by the nanny, Mrs Mills. Possible Academy Awards Nominations: 1) Best Screenplay, 2) Best Sound, 3) Best Sound Effects, 4) Best Performance by a leading Actress (Nicole Kidman) and in my opinion, 5) The Best Picture. You will like this movie if you like: The Sixth Sense, Jacob's Ladder, and other movies with ghost theme.My Vote: 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see dead people? Yes, I did; No, I didn't! Indeed, this movie is incredibly spooky. Two thumbs up for Alejandro Amenabar. He has crafted a great script to direct on screen. This is a great thriller that combines intelligence with fear in an incredible cinematic style. Everything about this movie has a haunting, yet elegant, quality. No cheap shocker, insulting joke, or crudity to make this thriller a success. Neither a male doppelganger nor a chick flick! Simply a schematic flick filled with eeriness! And I love it. And it's confronting the very dark side of human nature in the midst of frustration and insecurities. The cast of talented actors allows each of their roles to intertwine perfectly with each other to build up the suspense and creeps. Refreshing! In a sense, this is `The Haunting' cradled with the Hitchcockian terror and apparitions? and it has the usual cool, icy blonde! No kidding! Nicole Kidman has performed well to sustain the viewer's mind consistently on a wild goose chase! She wrangles up beauty, charm and spirit and angst. But her hoity-toity and condescending Grace character sends chill right down my spine. Fionnula Flanagan's performance is equally phenomenal. Troubled relationships, anger, mistrust, deceit, spirituality and mood-swings to add to the intense drama within the confinement of an isolated and austere mansion! It's simply impossible to allow any of the characters to slip out of one's sight. Watch them carefully and they become very part of your being! Even the Vals Opus background score supports a sense of mystery and hidden violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of some of the others I have seen in the past. I remember being scared by movies like The Tingler that was made back in the 1950's. That was really hokey though. This was really spooky and no one would have known that those people in there were not even living. This movie was more in the line of a Poltergeist movie. The only difference is that no corpses came out of the ground. I would recommend this movie to anyone who just likes to be scared and thrilled. It is worth the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice filmmaking, but not quite all there...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This thriller is very Hitchcockian - the comparisons are too numerous to mention, from the bird noises to the ankle camera shots (Kidman even looks like Hitchcock's favorite actress, Grace Kelly from certain angles!). But The Others would have been a mediocre Hitchcock, and is above average modern American flick. A lot here is taken from the Sixth Sense school, but not done as well. Surprisingly, it's the story that's a bit weak and predictable here, bogging down excellent cinematography, directing, acting, etc. The mechanics are wonderful. Way too many scenes of Kidman in a gloomy hallway with an oil lamp... Enough already. There are no secondary plots here of any interest - the main one may be enough to carry the movie, but not make it great. As for the amazing surprise / plot twist at end --- I honestly had it pegged in the first 1/2 hour, and I normally am pretty darn dumb when it comes to "figuring out" surprise endings.... Maybe I was lucky on this one, or maybe there was just so much dead time during the film that I had the chance to think about it too much...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TRULY Beyond the Door</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard it said that the scariest thing you can show in a film is a closed door.I've never fully appreciated the incipient dread suggested by that premise until I saw this film today. Imagine an entire haunted house movie filled with closed doors -and they make a grand show of telling you that all the doors are closed!Why? Why close the doors? What's behind them, hmmm?And THAT's where the real fear factor in this film comes from; there's always something on the other side of that door...or that one...or upstairs...Never since the chillingly atmospheric -and now utterly forgotten- ghost stories of the 1940's and Val Lewton have I seen a film which relied so much on characters and settings and ACTING to create its terror. Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast as the "modern" 1940's woman battling unseen agents of malice directed against her and her children.No cheap monsters, no digital wraiths, no dismembered corpses or dripping pools of blood. Just lots of fog, strange noises, closed doors, hallways, empty rooms, candles, darkness and the inexorable terror of what you CAN'T see, what you DON'T see ---and all the horrors which your imagination can create.An excellent return to what ghost stories should be!

The plot was complex and thoughtful and included a twist at the end that rivals that of The Sixth Sense. Music and light was also used really well-the candlelight which lit most of the movie added a softer glow. Overall this was a clever, intelligent film worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by this film that still proves that what you don't see is scarier than what you do. it is very difficult to say anything about this film without giving away plot points. Suffice to say, I will be seeing this more than once and will be a future DVD purchase. (Now if only Alejandro Amenabar would release the excellent "Open Your Eyes" on DVD)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always wondered if anyone would get a suspense/horror movie done right because lately its all been crap.I loved this movie from beginning to end.I was creeped out even in the first half hour when nothing was going on. The movie takes some time to pick up the pace but every little second gives some details and explanations.This movie had everything it was well written, the actors were perfect not to mention the british accents alone creeped me out.I'm sick and tired of cheap scares in almost every horror movie out there.THE OTHERS builds up a mood which is something most movies don't even take the time to do and of course the ending is excellent. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have probably disliked this movie, if it weren't for the absolutely shocking and wonderful ending! The movie seemed to move very slowly up until the last 30 minutes when everything finally fell into place and made this movie a unique masterpiece. I loved how the whole movie was in the dark, which was of course due to Grace's children, however, it was an effect that made the movie truly horrifying. I also enjoyed the occasional moments that made you jump. There was just the right amount in this film, unlike "What Lies Beneath", which made me jump at almost every moment. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants a smart, scary surprise! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie-But Had A-lot Of Unused Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I found this movie to be a very enjoyable ghost story. It was basically well written and well acted unlike other so-called horror movies, but I won't mention any names (Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3). Nicole Kidman was especially good. It was also intelligent, without unnecessary gore, violence, or vulgar language unlike other so-called horror movies, but I won't mention any names (Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3). The scares are good, but there are not as many as there should be. Overall, I rate it somewhere between a B- and a B. However it had the potential to be an A or A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TRULY Beyond the Door</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard it said that the scariest thing you can show in a film is a closed door.I've never fully appreciated the incipient dread suggested by that premise until I saw this film today. Imagine an entire haunted house movie filled with closed doors -and they make a grand show of telling you that all the doors are closed!Why? Why close the doors? What's behind them, hmmm?And THAT's where the real fear factor in this film comes from; there's always something on the other side of that door...or that one...or upstairs...Never since the chillingly atmospheric -and now utterly forgotten- ghost stories of the 1940's and Val Lewton have I seen a film which relied so much on characters and settings and ACTING to create its terror. Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast as the "modern" 1940's woman battling unseen agents of malice directed against her and her children.No cheap monsters, no digital wraiths, no dismembered corpses or dripping pools of blood. Just lots of fog, strange noises, closed doors, hallways, empty rooms, candles, darkness and the inexorable terror of what you CAN'T see, what you DON'T see ---and all the horrors which your imagination can create.An excellent return to what ghost stories should be! BRAVO</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I really enjoyed this film. I am a big fan of films that follow the "less is more" school of thought ... no flashy effects ... just a great story and a lot of well crafted suspense. Unlike some others who have commented on this film, I have an attention span that lasts more than two minutes and did not feel that this movie was slow paced at all.The Others is a suspence film ... not a horror film and is better labeled as "Haunting" or "Spooky" and not "Scary". The ending had me by complete surprise and I thought it was a wonderful twist to the story.I definitely recommend viewing this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am giving a different kind of Review for this movie. I will not write on plot. But in this way, for those of you who are aware of explanations that psychics and metaphysical people put out as to the reason why some spirits may stay around earthbound and not choose to go "..to the Light" so-to-speak,.....for those of you interested in that aspect of life and spirituality, this is a well-crafted entertainment.I like being both entertained and in trying to figure what is going on in a movie. But in hindsight, I always like being entertained first. Thus in this movie I found my 'figuring out'what was going on, changing several times through out the movie. With an Oh! and a smile. That's the well-craftedness of the movie. Along with thoughtfulness, I was both touched and entertained by how the writers put it together.I say it does no service to read in detail what the movie is about, for it would take away from the entertainment. I will say that it would not take away to say that the movie at first gives no evidence that it is a ghost story, evidence more at first is like that it is a psychological thriller.The people who made this movie did it much justice. One of the more entertaining movies of the Year, 2001.Regards, Rhodes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Crafted Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much that can be said about this film that won't give away the "surprise" ending. I figured it out about fifteen minutes in, but this didn't detract in any way from the enjoyability of the rest. If you figure things out, you gain a different perspective on how to watch the movie that makes it all the more enjoyable. I enjoyed the music (and often the silence), which added to the creepy mood of the film. The lighting was very strictly controlled, which also gave a feel of something otherworldly. This isn't as fast-paced as most of what Hollywood considers horror films (things jumping out of closets and chasing you with knives), but this is no great loss. True horror can only come when it's built up slowly and believably. The Others achieves this in several places. If you liked the Sixth Sense, you will probably enjoy this film a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in a creepy old house on a British island, "The Others" is great fun to watch! Nicole Kidman portrays a mother who is raising her two sickly children alone, while her husband is away at war. It becomes very obvious that they are not in the house alone. Not till the very end do you find out who the "intruders" are, in a wonderful ending that will certainly take you by surprise. While the ghostly chills were not as intense as I was hoping, the overall suspense and gloomy cinematography were gripping. If you're looking for a fun, somewhat scary, suspenseful movie, I heartily recommend "The Others"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the most stunning ghost film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from a sneak screening of this, and I have to say I am absolutely breathless. My heart was pounding in my ears toward the end, and that hasn't happened since "The Gift", coincidentally another ghost film. But "The Others" is riveting in the classic sense that absolutely no special effects were involved, except for a few papers in the air briefly, which worked. I sensed no studio intervention. The brilliant writer/director was able to make his film the way he wanted, which comes across clearly in the remarkable, original, and stunning way this film is written, shot, acted and directed. A truly terrifying ghost story. All of the details are there that make it perfect: the children are dependent for their lives on the curtains; they can't bear the sunlight or they die. The mother gets migraines easily at any loud noises; one of the houskeepers is a mute. Every day is thick with fog, shrouding the house in even more of a sense of forebodness and confusion. While I knew early on what the twist was, this is not to say that it was predictable at all, only that I have read plenty, and I do mean plenty, of ghost stories, so I pick up early on a lot of the time. But that doesn't change the fact that this film is sheer and utter brilliance. Perfect camera angles involving the ghosts, which I, of course, will NOT be revealing here. Dark figures walking through fog to dark, spiraling gates, with rotted trees next to graveyards, postmortem pictures of the dead in the house. Absolutely PERFECT. I tip my hat to the director, who was talented enough and lucky enough to make his film with practically zero intervention of any outside force. Do you realize how little that happens nowadays? But then again, I can almost be sure that everyone who read this spectacular script knew it had to be made the way it was. It just had to be. And it was. And I will watch this film and love it for the rest of my life. It was simply the most stunning ghost film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sure disturbing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not yet seen the film, "The Others", but from what I have read and heard about it sounds like a new disturbing thriller that most definitely deserves attention. I've also heard nothing but praises for the director of this film and I myself have taken a look at some of Alejandro Amenabar and think that he is very talented.There is also a downside of the film for me. I read in the plot summary that the children of Nicole Kiddman in this film have a desease which prohibits them from letting sunlight hit them directly. This is not a downside to the film, because I think this is a very unique idea. This is a downside for me because I am a filmmaker and have been working on a project for quite some time which contains a man with a similar desease. The film I'm working on is set in the present and is more independant and film noirish so I hope people can over look that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost in a fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" sets with the right intentions, to make a classic horror flick, but gets lost in a fog somewhere along the way. This film had the potential to be of a quality and scare caliber not seen since Kubrick's "The Shining" but it veered way off target. The scares were few and far between and it took entirely too long to build up to the few scares that were in the film. In fact the audience was visibly restless, waiting for something substantial to occur until well into the film. The fact that the film looses its grip on the audience is the only reason more people didn't get the poorly hidden surprises before they were explicitly spelled out. The overall concept is an extremely good one, its just not translated well into the script. The direction was a high point, brilliantly contrasting light and dark and harkening back to an older era of film-makers. If you're going to see this film make sure to drink lot's of caffeine, and lower the bar on your expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is directed by Alejandro Amenábar and it stars Nicole Kidman as an extremely loving catholic mother.The movie is marketed as a horror film and it does get creepy at times, but the movie moves too slow and lacks suspense to be a really great film. Obviously takes inspiration from the Sixth Sense, which was released 3 years before this movie came out and I can really tell what they were going for with the twist and it kind of worked, but I don't think it was as climactic as it was intended to be.Let's talk about performances: Nicole Kidman does a pretty good job in the movie, you can actually buy into her despair and going crazy. Like I said the performance is great, but the character really got on my nerves. I don't hear enough people talking about Alakina Mann's performance in this movie, especially for a kid actress, she is spectacular. I really wonder what happened to her, she hasn't really been in anything major since this.In the end The Others is entertaining and the twist is pretty good, although it is a film that is 100% style over substance, and it should have packed a meaner punch.</fullReview>

Unable to explain... Will chill you.. So, I wanna share some bits here.Nicole Kidman pours down her best acting skills in this movie. Alejandro Amenabar's direction will force you to bite nails (if you have them grown :P)Even though the scary sounds and music doesn't play a major role here (as it does in many movies), the variation in the expressions shown by Nicole and scenes will surely amuse. What? Wait! Will amuse you until the CLIMAX part.The relationship between Nicole and her children are beautifully portrayed. It shows how one should and shouldn't take care of their children. They are extremely cute and you will love them throughout. And the servants, of course, somehow they get involved in this Mother-Children religious life.Oh yeah! The climax. Well, you won't expect this kind of climax. You can't digest this final sequence. Perfect ending. Finally, this movie is a good one to watch. A perfect nail-biting Thriller. It's not like THE OTHERS. Must watch for all SUSPENSE LOVERS. You wont get disappointed! For sure!!I would give 9/10 :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ghost film is incredibly well made. It is truly scary at only a few points, but even when you aren't screaming, this film has a very eerie and creepy feel throughout. There are also lots of things that can be interpreted in different ways. It seems as if the mother is mentally unstable, but there's no proof, causing you to question everything else. Is any of it actually happening, or is it just a grief stricken woman having a nightmare? You can't and don't know, which makes it a brilliant piece of psychological horror. It's been months since I watched it, and I still wonder what the true story was. A must see for fans of ghost films, twist endings, or anyone looking for a psychological horror film, as opposed to the cliché gore films that we see all the time. Suspense is built well, the acting is great, and the ending is absolutely insane! Truly unique and very well-made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE OTHERS gave me chills...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear of dark is typical in horror flicks, but here its fear of light for Anne &amp; Nicholas. In fact there is a peculiar condition for children in this film (Anne &amp; Nicholas), that they are photosensitive. This is one of those movies which the viewers must never know the suspense/spoilers for thrills. So before you watch this, don't read any reviews with spoilers. The movie is a horror/thriller so its meant to be scary but didn't scare me. The sounds (sound effects) gave me jerk for I've watched it with surround sounds late at night. Just like a typical suspense movie, it can be watched once as the second time you wouldn't. Except for frightening scenes the movie has no sexuality nor profanity nor violence. The bottom line : Another good film to watch on a stormy night all alone with good sound effects and big screen (without reading spoilers and unless you have a weak heart to withstand horror)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly Underrated Gem Of Horror Filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shrouded with a thick layer of mystery that cleverly unfolds over the course of its runtime, making excellent use of horror elements to encapsulate the whole film with a tense mood, and further enhancing its dark ambiance by capturing its low-light surroundings in a truly fascinating manner, The Others is one of the most underrated gems of modern horror.Set in Jersey during the aftermath of the Second World War, the story of The Others follows Grace, a religious mother of two children who have a rare disease that makes them allergic to sunlight. When three new servants arrive at their mansion, a series of inexplicable events are set in motion which convinces Grace that there is a mystical presence in the house.Written &amp; directed by Alejandro Amenábar, The Others packs in a highly gripping story that is smartly narrated from start to finish and is able to keep its mystery alive till the very end where it surprises its audience with a shocking revelation. The screenplay is no slouch for the characters &amp; their arcs are elegantly handled and each added element only works out in favour of the story.The old mansion on a seemingly isolated island brings a creepiness of its own. The camera employs minimal use of light, sometimes relying solely on candles &amp; its effervescent glow to capture the drama, and it is effectively carried out. Editing steadily unfolds its narrative. And the performances by its cast is thoroughly convincing, with Nicole Kidman &amp; Alakina Mann impressing the most in their respective role of Grace &amp; her daughter.On an overall scale, The Others is an outstanding piece of horror filmmaking that's patiently crafted, deftly scripted, elegantly shot, brilliantly paced, calmly scored &amp; strongly performed and exhibits a wonderful balance in all aspects to deliver a genuinely chilling experience to its audience. And on the strength of its interesting premise &amp; proper attention to characters, The Others is a welcome entry in the genre of horror that's absolutely worth your time &amp; money. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Rosemary baby" this movie to me ranks second in the excellence of storytelling, acting, directing, mood, suspense and terrific twist at the end. As a lover of horrors I know how difficult it is to do a good thriller, and as a matter of fact despite my love of the genre, there are only a few good ones I had actually seen in my long life. It shows you how difficult it is to do it well. Therefore I am still on the quest for masterpieces such as above movie. I was absolutely impressed and just wish that Alejandro Amenabar would do another horror as sophisticated as this one. And acting should also be mentioned as superb. Nicole Kidman of whom I am not a special fan,is to my surprise excellent in her portrayal of deeply depressed, psychotic wife; Fionnula Flanagan - fantastic actress with amazing voice and presence, and two other actors also splendid - the producers couldn't choose better players. And children were also great compared with typical Hollywood annoying kids who speak like adults and behave in the most artificial, phony manner. Please, watch this movie. It is not just your plain horror taking place in a spooky house but psychological drama about religion, motherhood and mortality. And dear Mr. Amemabar - make another horror. There are excellent stories written in Victorian times. Take one and show young viewers something besides vampires and zombies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The mark (for me at least) of a truly great movie is a well written story. Developing characters slowly, letting the story flow from their personalities. But the very best is that Amenabar does not rely on CG or gore or violence to create a chill down to your bones scary movie. They kicked it old school with this one and it is a real gem. Another rarity is the truly original story line. Full of twists and turns that despite your best efforts you absolutely do not see coming. I've also found I enjoy this movie better and better with each subsequent viewing. It simply begs to be watched again to pick up on all the nuances you miss the first time around because you are just simply too scared to pick up on them. Kidman is at the top of her game in The Others. Fionnula Flanigan is terrifying as the - well you don't exactly know what she is up until the end. It leaves you guessing as to the true nature of the supporting characters who play the new staff. Amenabar does a superb job with lighting and location. Isolated and utterly creepy the old house itself is almost a character unto itself in The Others. Mann and Bentley also deserve nods for their performances at such a tender age. If you can manage to hold off for a wonderfully blustery, stormy evening alone, it will only add to the thrill of The Others. I just had my 5th viewing of this excellent movie again tonight and it was every bit as entertaining as the first. This one is a true DO NOT MISS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Others: A Return to Classical Supernatural Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays in horror, it isn't enough to simply hint at a ghost. The audience is going to want to see the specter in the flesh. But that takes away the true fright of supernatural terror. The feeling of an otherworldly presence is much scarier than seeing it. After such classics as 1961's "The Innocents" and 1963's "The Haunting," a film like Alejandro Amenabar's "The Others" is a warm love letter to horror.The film is set in 1940's New England. While her husband is away at war, Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, watches over her dark, foreboding mansion, as well as her children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a disturbing allergy to sunlight. Once Grace calls upon new housekeepers to tend to the mansion and the kids, things begin to go wrong. There is something the new guests aren't telling her, Anne is "lying" about seeing a little boy named Victor, and strange noises occur. But Victor isn't the only problem. There are others, uninvited guests that can't be seen. Is the house haunted or is Grace's sanity string beginning to loosen? "The Others" is, without a doubt, an extremely frightening horror film in a repetitious world of serial killers and nude blonds. It got attention when it was released, but today, I feel like its popularity has unfairly faded.The film has an ominous feel right from the start. There is nothing happy about this setting. You can already tell that Grace is unhappy, and since her husband is gone and her children's lives are at stake, she is always on edge. The mansion is completely darkened, and leaving a single door open can bring in sunlight and trigger an effect on the kids. But in such a case when a door is left open and nobody has touched it, we, as an audience member, develop paranoia and fear of the characters' surroundings.Back in the day, not seeing a ghost was, and still is, more terrifying. Masters like Jack Clayton and Robert Wise knew that, and so does Alejandro Amenabar. We don't see a single apparition. Amenabar favors implication over shock, something Hitchcock would be proud of. It is an old formula brought back to fantastic life.Although atmosphere is a highlight of "The Others," the casting of Nicole Kidman is equally powerful. She is beautiful as well as talented. Her performance sponsors a realistic fear, which is a mother's loss of a child's love or even the loss of a child. Bring ghosts into the mix, and you have a perfect recipe for psychological horror, thanks to her performance.The ending is definitely a more common cliché currently than it was in 2001, but it still brings chills. And so does the rest of the movie. Paying homage to the classical horror films of the 1940's, "The Others" knows what truly scares you, and I hope one day, that it won't be a film just for older audiences, but for newcomers who have been raised on slasher movies, also.</fullReview>

I am a big horror/scary movie fan and even though I didn't think this movie was very scary it was very suspenseful and very well made. The reason it was refreshing is it's not like most modern "lets scare them" type movies. The storyline was well done along with all other elements that go into making a movie. It didn't rely on sex/blood/gore/cursing or any of the other things that film making rely on to get people to watch. It was a VERY VERY clean movie and was a nice step back from most of the modern movies. It also wasn't corny. Many horror/scary movies are very corny but this one was well done and doesn't leave you saying, "I saw that coming an hour ago." It's plot and twists aren't obvious so it leaves you curious and keeps your attention. It is a slow build up till the climactic end and well worth waiting for.All in all this movie will leave you very satisfied...I'm sure of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, mysterious, chilling and amazing!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I possibly say about this movie other than it's one of the most exceptional films ever made. The cinematography is wonderful, the score is pitch perfect, the acting is stellar, and the script is just chilling and fascinating. The Others is in a word: AMAZING!! The premise is simple. A woman (Nicole Kidman) lives in a secluded house with her two young children and is waiting on her husband (Christopher Eccleston) to return from the war. She hires three caretakers to come live with them and at that point, things begin to happen. I won't go into any major details here as to not ruin anything but suffice it to say, this movie will give you a genuine feeling of fright and will make you question many things after you have finished watching it. The movie is superb and I believe this film is one of the greatest of all time. I still can't quite understand how it got no Oscar consideration at all. This is one of Nicole Kidman's finest performances and Fionnula Flanagan is wonderful as the mysterious Mrs. Mills. The ending is quite simply brilliant and will leave you in such a profound place of shock for a few minutes afterward. If you have not yet seen this movie, trust me. You need to. It's too good to pass up.I give this movie a 9.5/10 and the only reason it doesn't get a 10 is due to a few minor details. It's not quite perfect but it's dang near close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ingenious Adaptation of James' Novella - If That's What It Was ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the comparison between this movie and M. Night Shyamalan's "ghost" piece is inevitable because both of them are based on pretty much the same idea allow me to start with saying that while the latter works out perfectly (its predictable but still formidable resolution included), the second implementation of this idea provided by Alejandro Amenabar seems to be a little less effective.In the case of "The Sixth Sense" the viewer - even if equipped with five basic ones only - can start to suspect something at the very beginning of the movie. Somewhere halfway into it it's simply impossible not to know what's going on there. But due to the inventive way in which the feature is structured nothing happens to be ruined through it. And despite our possible foreknowledge both the first and second part of the movie can be described as equally fascinating."The Others" is another story. Here it's also possible to figure out what's going on somewhere in the middle of the feature - it must be admitted not without a little help of your being acquainted with "The Sixth Sense". But - albeit the movie is very well made in terms of its atmosphere - nothing particularly holds your attention neither prior to nor after that moment. Besides, if Night Shyamalan manages to implement the original idea in question with great consistency and without a single instance of cheating, Amenabar's flick does not seem to be completely impeccable in this respect - for example, I might be missing something but should we presume that before the curtains happen to be altogether removed the "real" family never tried to open them? Nevertheless I believe "The Others" can be considered a minor masterpiece. All you need to do to let this miraculous transformation happen to the movie is to perceive it not as a somewhat epigonic attempt at exploiting an idea which has already been properly utilized once, but rather as a quite ingenious screen adaptation of Henry James' "The Turn Of The Screw". Indeed, parallels between the two pieces would be multiple.In the case of James' magnificent novella what we have on the surface is a "ghost" story about two children being haunted by apparitions of servants and their governess who is in a desperate attempt to protect them. However, according to more recent interpretations - which seem much more plausible than earlier readings - the story that had really been written by James and skilfully hidden behind the first one is a horrid drama of children betrayed by their protectress - not out of malicious impulse, but on simple and unfortunate grounds of being mad. Which would be the core structure and meaning of "The Others" exactly.If we go into details we find numerous other correspondences: two children (but in James' story one of them survives the ordeal), a totally isolated abode where events take place, apparitions of servants who supposedly pose a threat, occasional attempts of the children to rebel against imposed "protection". Even the reason for madness is probably one and the same in both cases - the passionate love turned by circumstances into an impossible one. But the main thing is connection between the structural frames of these pieces with exactly the same pattern transpiring in both of them: we follow the story of children haunted by ghosts and come to a shocking revelation - there is no ghosts, but the tragedy is deeper than we could ever imagine. So if this movie was, in fact, inspired by James' work, what we have here is a perfectly accurate rendition of the original idea into the language of film. And, probably, one of the most brilliant screen adaptations of a literary work among all ever undertaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glad I Never Bothered....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film came out...I thought it might be good..worth seeing at some point..in the theater. I am glad I never wasted my time and money to do so then. It starts off boring..stays boring..and does little to make you want to watch it until the end. It did not take long to realize the main characters were dead..and did not understand what had happened to them. The kids...the boy..is wimpy..and the girl is rather mean and hateful. No wonder..with a mother who seems to have major mood swings at the drop of a hat. The husband...a war hero of sorts..comes home..suddenly..out of the fog...unsure of how he got there...and with the idea the war is still being fought...so he must go back and leave his family again. To live in that gloomy house..surrounded by fog..no wonder he wants to leave. The caretakers of the place...they all seem to know SOMETHING...but none say a word...why? The housekeeper simply does the bidding of the woman..with a grim look on her face..as if she doesn't approve. Why doesn't she speak up? The kids are supposedly sensitive to light...so everything is kept dark..windows covered...she thinks the sunlight will kill them...how does she know that? Who told her? A doctor..? Or is it part of her delusions? She seems very uptight and almost manic at times..ranting and raving...which would have been the perfect time for someone to tell her the truth. Apparently..her husband was killed in the war...and she lost her mind because of it...killed her children and the people who worked for her...and then herself....or she was loony all along and that sent her over the edge? The mansion sits far from anything...it seems...no one comes...no one we see anyway...but when the curtains disappear...we know someone or something has taken them down...ghosts we are thinking..? Someone trying to kill her children...the woman is thinking. I never did get the idea of why the woman kept all the keys to everything. Every room had to be kept locked...another of her delusions? If she was so fearful of the place...why didn't she gather her children and leave? Fog or no fog? Any good mother would have gone for help or something of the sort. She gets a gun and attempts to shoot...another hint at what she might have done at one time to the living? I wanted to like this film...and I am not a big Nicole Kidman fan at all..but after I figured out the plot..it was no longer interesting. They called the unseen people "The intruders"...and it scares the children. Who would scare children like that? If they have to spend eternity being afraid because of things their mother did..it seems wrong. The séance scene finally lets you in on what is going on...duh...we knew that already. What people would hold a séance to find out of the place was truly haunted before they decided to buy it? Weird. The place will continue to stay empty..because as Nicole Kidman says in the end "no one can make us leave this house". It reminded me of another haunted house type story.."Rose Red" by Stephen King...which made a much better movie. Watch that instead...I think you will enjoy it a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very intense and moody thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looks and feels as if it could have been directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and thats really saying something. I saw this movie for the first time in theater when it first came out and I must say I'm really glad I did, because its one of the finest thrillers I've seen. The movie has a thick atmosphere, especially because of the foggy surroundings and the mysterious mansion. The cast is small, but they sure give their full 100% because the acting never fails to deliver the great script that gets more intelligent as the movie progresses.Some people have been comparing this movie to The Sixth Sense, but they are not exactly the same. Yes they are both suspenseful thrillers and have a similar story-twist but I think The Others is better in terms of atmosphere. But overall if you love movies that get you on the edge of your seat the whole time, then this movie is definitely for you.I just saw this movie recently again and I am just as impressed as I was 8 years ago when I first saw this film in theater. The Others is a rare type of movie and very refreshing in a age where movies are filled with CGI acid-trip effects most of the time. This movie shows that big special effects do not win over a well-written story, a clever script and great acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a twist in the tale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday on the television and was so surprised by it. The Sixth Sense is one hell of a movie but this movie to gives it good competition. Even though the twist end in Sixth sense is shocking, the one over her, which slightly resembles the former movie, still manages to leave one flabbergasted.The beginning of the movie looked a bit fairy-tale-ish because of the old and dilapidated building, weird characters. I thought that some creature would pop out all of a sudden, judging by the title of the movie. But, as the story progressed, I was so hooked to it that every time I had to go and attend to something, I sighed and paused the DVD angrily.The characters are one of a kind with Nicole playing an over protective, stringent mother beautifully. The children too play their parts well even though they are not so likable as Malcolm. Out of the three servants, the old lady covers more scenes and plays her role effectively. There are double twists in the end, the second one which no one would have thought of. The atmosphere is chilly, the scenes are intense and the movie is great. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of life and death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's life? What's death? And who are the others after all? The living or the dead? You will not find the answers to these questions in the movie though it deals with them somehow. This a very original movie in its kind I mean the ghost story movies kind. It has a few contact points with other movies involving ghosts and children like for instance "The Innocents" or "Shining" though maybe not so scary like the latter(nevertheless of course a bit scary anyway like any ghost story worth of its title). But it has the advantage of having a very surprising end that will leave you almost breathless though not exactly horrified since it's even somewhat poetical. The acting is great not only by Nicole Kidman as the main character but above all by the two children that do extraordinary performances. The interior scenery of the old mansion where the story takes place is quite convincing and very much fit to the general atmosphere of the plot. A good movie indeed though not exactly a masterpiece because the story doesn't give great occasion to that classification in all its details since in these stories that mix natural with supernatural it's always difficult to make things logical and illogical at same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is directed, written and has music by Alejandro Amenabar The film stars Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, James Bentley, Alakina Mann, Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy and Christopher Eccleston.A creepy and mysterious mansion,lots of fog,ghosts and mysterious servants are the classic ingredients for a good horror film and they are all used to good effect in this film. The Others is set during the Second World War on The Channel Islands. Grace Stewart(Nicole Kidman)is a young mother alone in her house with her two children Nicholas(James Bentley)and Anne(Alakina Mann)after their servants mysteriously vanish.Grace's husband Charles Stewart(Christopher Eccleston)is away fighting and she hires more servants,the three that arrive Mrs Bertha Mills(Fionnula Flanagan),Lydia(Elaine Cassidy)and Mr Tuttle(Eric Sykes)are more than creepy and Mrs Mills claims to have worked at the house before.Grace and the children start hearing things and are soon convinced they are being haunted by the ghosts of the former owners, however the truth is even more frightening and emotionally devastating.This is one of the best ghost stories ever made with a spooky atmosphere,outstanding acting especially from Nicole and some genuine shocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atmospheric chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is nice that there are still horror films like this around, ones that rely on atmosphere and good acting rather than shocks and gore, not that there is anything wrong with that, it is just nice to have alternatives. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, the devout mother of two children, living in a large house on the island of Jersey shortly after the end of the German occupation. The film opens with three strangers coming to the door to work as servants, as Grace shows them around the house she explains certain strange rules the must keep, all doors must be locked after use and all the curtains must be kept closed, this is because her two children are so photosensitive that any sunlight would make them very ill or possibly kill them. Not long after this Grace's daughter Anne claims she has seen a boy called Victor in the house along with his family, Grace doesn't believe her initially but after a while grows to believe that the house may in fact be haunted.There are few shocks in the film but an oppressive atmosphere is maintained by the darkened rooms in the house and the ever present fog outside, as the film progresses Grace seems to get more and more paranoid and irrational to the point where we are led to believe she might even harm the children. All the main actors perform well, especially Alakina Mann and James Bentley as the two young children. While I didn't find it as scary as some reviewers I'd still recommend it... just try to avoid spoilers before watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOOD movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is one of two films I've seen in the past year that actually made me afraid to fall asleep. The film is a stylish thriller/horror with a well developed dramatic back story that is actually very powerful. One of the great things about this film is its lack of effects. Much like The Changeling (1980), it delivers subtle chills without using a drop of blood. The writer backed it up with a mysterious and sad story about the family, and he spends much of the movie developing this - making the ghostly moments all the more frightening.This film is proof that the film-making industry still makes subtle horror movies without blood, gore, teenagers getting mutilated, and without sex! Let us hope more films like this can be made.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great thing about the others is that you can see it again and again. I know loads of people say this but now days All you get in horrors is blood, guts and madmen with lots of spare cash. I mean come on, 5 saw films: all they are is people getting cut up. The others was good solid suspense. The ending was surprising unless you had seen the sixth sense previously and there arn't bucket loads of effects in it unless you count the blue screen used for the fog. The only bit I didn't get was when Grace finds her husband and he goes "Sometimes I bleed." was that just for dramatic effect? Anyway defiantly worth seeing. If you like this film you'll like The Woman in Black. Same sort of thing but a bit darker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others (2001, Dir. Alejandro Amenábar) It's nearing the end of the Second World War and Grace Stewart (Kidman) lives with her photosensitive children (Mann and Bentley) in a large and silent house. After her previous servants went missing, Grace accepted the offers of work from three new servants. But since these three have entered the home, strange events occur, and Grace begins to wonder if it's her sanity getting the better of her or if there is something much more in the house with them.Intense physiological thriller with a fantastic performance from Nicole Kidman. This is how horror really works, as you literally sit in awe of what it could possibly be. Both the emotions from the central character can be felt within the audience, as the horror isn't thrown in your face.I think I've finished here, ma'am. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go and see if Mr Tuttle needs a hand. - Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan)</fullReview>

Is this really happening? Or is this women simply mad? Is the little girl seeing things or is she just trying to get attention? By far, the 'little girl wedding dress' scene is absolutely the most chilling scene in the whole film.

		<shortDescription>A scary, freaky and shocking horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no way in hell "The Sixth Sense" will ever gain my approval as a modern horror movie since he forgot to mention people that he based it on a kid's show called "Are you afraid of the dark?" with the episode being "The Tale of the Dream Girl." A month later in 1999, more ghost movies followed where there was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon proving to be more of an effective and original thriller. Other ghost movies followed but none will ever come close than "The Others." Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a widow to a soldier during the events of World War II who shelters two of her children, Anna and Nichols, in a mansion all by herself. Not only is she a fanatical Christian where she gives lectures and wants the children to remember certain things, but she doesn't allow the children to leave the house due to a skin disease they have. She hires help from Fionnula Flanagan who plays Bertha Mills, along with Eric Sykes (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) and Elaine Cassidy to assist her. Grace soon discovers weird things going around in her mansion before asking the children if they been horse playing and the housekeepers if they've been touching things and moving objects around that weren't suppose to move.Suspicion turns to threats, threats lead to clues, and everything will be unravel sooner or later with a shocking ending.I'm not familiar with Alejandro Amenábar's work, but as soon as I say "The Others," all I have to say is that it's one hell of a movie beating the hell out of "The Sixth Sense" with its amazing cast and its edge of your seat/heart pounding moments making it one of my favorite horror movies of all time.Like "Alien," don't you dare see this film alone or in the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusually Thoughtful and Affecting Ghost Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason Amenabar's work on The Others is so above the fare of a given ghost film is because it turns out to be a beautifully philosophical musing on death, how death is something even the dead are not prepared for, because the psychological fear assumed on earth overpowers the physical seamlessness the real thing may have. There is also an honest undercurrent of perspective on how religion may effect the mental state of afterlife, complemented by another concept that may or may not be hopeful or comforting to people, which is the idea that spiritual and materialistic connections in this life may carry over into the next.The film flows gently like the English countryside it portrays, patiently executing a brilliant build-up of seemingly purposeless events and phantom motives that serve as exterior for the perfectly coinciding ones that later reveal themselves.The multi-talented Alejandro Amenabar, who wrote, directed, and also scored the film, has crafted an unusually thoughtful and affecting ghost film. Nicole Kidman's nerve-shattered, heart-ravaged performance as the strict Catholic war widow who spends her life protecting her two photosensitive children gives just the right conservative, classical yet realistically drawn upon approach. Christopher Eccleston, playing Kidman's husband, may be quite dull, but Alakin Mann and James Bentley, playing Kidman's children, are either not from the assembly line of cryptic horror movie children or they're from a fresh batch.</fullReview>

It is full of whispering in thick British accents, not a good combo for me even with the volume full blast, and there is still a couple spots where I'm still not clear what was said. Other than that, is it a brilliant story that offers subtle hints to point to the ending but you'll still be surprised. IMO, Alakina Mann, the little girl who played Anne, upstaged the rest, though Kidman was plenty good.

		<shortDescription>Excellent first class ghost film, a rarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much time to write, but wanted to say that this is a first class ghost film, for people who like genuine suspense/chills, and a clever twist and interesting storyline. Most importantly for me, it is realistic and fulfills my belief in ghosts without overdoing the connection between 'living' and 'dead' worlds i.e. the whole thing is believable if you believe in ghosts unlike many so-called horror films which rely on silly sudden 'shocks' or effects or people with half their face hanging off but forget the underlying realism that is needed; you could probably find faults with it if you wanted to but if you want a creepy ghost film which has a sinister undertone throughout, and a few, although I would say enough, real shocks, then this is highly recommended. Yes there is a similarity between the endings when compared to The Sixth Sense, but that does not detract from the originality of this story; the ending in my opinion is absolutely superbly done, not a let-down at all. Also, well-directed and acted. The maid has a wonderful ambiguity about her, she is warm and understanding while also distant and a bit spooky - fantastically done. Sorry, need to expand more on this but gotta go. Simon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has not been a decent horror movie like this one done in years. Today, horror movies have been replaced with splatter, blood and gore, redundant scenes of sex and nudity and million dollar special effects. This movie goes back to when you hid behind the comfort of your fingers over your eyes. It's done practically in the style of M. Night Shyamalan; it's taut, dark, riveting and has a thick atmospheric style with a touch of the macabre. Nicole Kidman gives an Academy Award performance as does Fionnula Flanagan who I have not seen since the "Legend of Lizzie Borden." I was expecting a simple end, but then it went one step further than my expectations. The excellent flawless score enhances the emotional state of the characters. All I can say is it's about time a horror movie was made that reflected the intelligence of its actors and creators and not the idiocy of tarnishing the intelligence of the audience.</fullReview>

I enjoy a movie that does not need to be done up in special effects or filled with cursing and nudity. You will not find any of this in this particular movie. Grace lives in a secluded mansion with her two children. Her husband went off to war and never returned. One day, three strangers appear at the doorstep of Grace's house. She hires them as servants and then strange things start to happen. The movie has some great scenes which scared the pants off of me! There are many twists in the movie which add a nice flavor to it. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, nope! Another surprise. If you enjoy a good suspense flick and if you are into guessing "what's going to happen next", definitely watch this film. I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea for this movie was very well thought out and very imaginative. Although I don't think ideas about religions or theology came to play when the "screen writer" came up with "his" idea. I wonder where he got it from? Ummmmm, it's a mystery.Well Alexandro Amenajabar seemed to have made a lot of successful?, movies in Spain and then hit gold with "his" one American horror/suspense movie. Wow if only the rest of us could be so lucky. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror/suspense movie ideas and although Alexandro it appears wrote and directed this movie. It is my opinion that the ending could and probably would have been a little better if a little more thought had gone into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From time to time strange things happen to you. A strange desire, an urgent passion, or, who knows what else! One of the strangest and most macabre urges I've got is watching scary movies. Yes, you know it. That chill running down your spine, your heart pounding so loud the person next to you can hear it, eye lids closed, screams of terror, quickly followed by a shamefully amused giggle. That's the ride a good scary movie delivers for you. That's what "The Others" keeps you through.It doesn't have a brilliant plot, the twists aren't "dementially" cool as in The Sixth Sense, but it's got a feel of terror embroidered on its frames. Yes, it gets that horrific in the best of ways! A mother and her children live in a huge house, alone, until a some new servants pop up in front of their door and commit to their housekeeping tasks. But there's something wrong about the whole thing from the very beginning. The fog, the house, the children, the words...it's a feeling that takes hold of you and doesn't really let you go until near the end. It's authentic psychological horror, brilliant in all regards, not showing any truly obnoxious images. And I've never seen anything like it. Even "The Sixth Sense" relies more on imagery and as I well recall, it wasn't all imagery there either. But - if I did start comparing it to The Sixth Sense - there's one more thing I need to add. There is a reasonable difference between the movies, especially regarding the emphasis. Shayamalan's movie relies on the ending and the ending is more than just the Cherry on top. Some will make the mistake to criticize "The Others" for a sloppy conclusion, but this simply can not be regarded as the movie's strong point. It's the inner force that thrives through its intense tale. The movie itself forces you to admire it, not a simple gimmick.Nicole, I hate to admit it, is pretty damned good and the kids go just marvelous together. However, there will be those saying it's not "that fresh" and not "all that original". Even if there is some truth behind those statements, it's still the best film of its genre in years...and years to come, probably. A definite must for fans and a scrupulous ride for those weak of heart. Great Amenabar!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is on my all-time, top ten best scary movies list. Nicole Kidman is incredible as a stressed- out mother trying to deal with two children who have a deadly light-sensitivity condition. In addition to having to live in a neverending existence of locking and unlocking doors and in no more light than lantern light, she has to deal with the possibility that her big English Gothic mansion is haunted by 'the others'. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The creepy-but you don't know why daughter-the housekeeper who seems aware of something but doesn't give it away-the poor mute maid and Kidman's perfect teetering on the edge performance all adds to the tension. What is beautiful and brilliant about this movie is they way it unfolds without allowing the audience to 'figure' out what's really happening. Why Kidman did not win an Oscar for this performance is beyond me. An absolutely brilliantly made movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE OTHERS (Los Otros) Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS1945: While awaiting her husband's return from the war, a lonely young woman (Nicole Kidman) locks herself into their remote, fog-bound mansion to protect their children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) from a condition which renders them ultra-sensitive to natural light. But a number of strange occurrences lead her to believe the house may be haunted...Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, THE OTHERS marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenábar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as THESIS (1996) and OPEN YOUR EYES (1997). Amenábar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.Like THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) before it, THE OTHERS prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amenábar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed). Beautiful, atmospheric sets by Benjamín Fernández, photographed with exquisite grace by Javier Aguirresarobe.(English version)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, starring Nicole Kidman as Grace, a deeply religious mother with two photosensitive children (Alakina Mann as Anne, James Bentley as Nicholas), starts with a mysterious trio of new servants (Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy and Fionnula Flanagan) being employed to look after the house, the garden, and to look after the children. The house is only lit by candles and the curtains must always be drawn in daylight, adding to the creepy feel of the piece.The music is minimal and help the effect when strange things happen. The twists - first we find that the servants died fifty years earlier of TB and are buried in the garden, then (twist on twist) we find that Grace killed her children and then herself and their spirits live on. The intruders are not the people we think they are! There are several hints to point to this when you reflect on the film - Grace's husband Charles, who was at war, appearing out of the fog in the garden and then disappearing; the curtains being taken down by persons unknown; the boy Victor squabbling with the ghost children over the light; and the photographic 'book of the dead' (the one photo missing being the one of the three servants).Does all this work? I'm not sure. There is certainly atmosphere throughout, and some shocks - but the ending felt like a cop-out in many ways. An interesting idea that just misses the mark.</fullReview>

I did guess Mrs Mills Mr Tuttle and Lydia though mostly due to their clothes especially Lydia's as she wore very old fashioned clothes for an 18? year old. I thought that Mrs Mills etc were in collaboration with Victor and his family while Grace and the children were still alive and being haunted. The old lady's eyes scared me even now when I watch it at home I close my eyes when she opens the wardrobe door. I would like to see a sequel of this made from the point of view of Victor's family.

Andrews would write...Nicole Kidman plays a devoutly catholic, neurotic, troubled mother of two frightened photosensitive children. When three visitors arrive, to apply for the jobs she's offering (nanny, housekeeper, and gardener) strange things seem to happen...I was perceiving Mrs. Mills and her two cohorts as the villains, when in truth...they were there to help... they knew the truth before &lt;I&gt; I, as a viewer&lt;/I&gt; did... I actually had to review to notice what a spectacular performance Fionnula Flanagan (Mrs. Mills)was giving us...the Empathy she had for Grace (Kidman) and her two children... THe secret she was hiding...Kidman is frantic, throughout the film...suspicious of the "intruders"...suspicious, that their house is being haunted by these intruders... In truth, it is kidman and her children that are doing the haunting...Leaving the viewers with a bittersweet empathy for the souls of Grace and her children...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Psychological Horror Of The Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before deciding to right this review, i read the reviews on Amazon and on the IMDb. After reading these, I got so wound up about people saying that this film is not scary or is boring that i wrote this. This IS a horror film, granted not an obviously scary film or a slasher film. If you like films like Friday 13th then the chances are you won't like this. This is a very intelligent film and granted very slow, however this enhances the tension and the ambiance of the film.The acting is near perfect with Kidman putting on a fantastic performance. However for me Flanagan is the stand out star. She is both genuine yet creepy at the same time. Another reason why this film is so clever is that it is completely unreliant on special effects which is a very pleasing to see, and the isolation the character feels is emphasized by the location on a Gothic country house on Jersey.There are only a handful of characters which is another pleasing sight so you are not always trying to remember names. The children are very well acted although the boy has a tendency to be rather annoying especially in the last two scenes. You genuinely felt empathy for the characters and you cared about them unlike in recent films.As for the twist at the end, anyone who says they predicted the twist in the first twenty minutes, is lying. The ending is truly surprising and appropriate.I love this film and the DVD is one of my favourite in my collection. The film has replay value but is best watched when its dark. Happy Viewing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, slow and overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why this movie is rated so high on this site will remain one of the misteries of the Universe to me. The only reason I can think of is because of the people's obssession with the twists at the end. But even so, the ending of this movie is not that good either. But even if it was excellent, it still couldn't have been able to make up for the boring hour and twenty minutes before that. Possible SPOILERS:I would also have to make the comparison with "The Sixth Sense" which had very similar plot twist and story. But the difference is that "The sixth Sense " was still interesting and engrossing movie even though I knew the ending before i started watching it(a stupid newspaper review spoiled it for me). It had characters who were very well developed, smart dialogue, great acting, superb directing. All those those things were sorely missing in "The others". And for me, "The others" had a lot more plotholes. I figured out most of the famous twist about 15 minutes into the movie, although it took me much longer to guess the other part, and it still surprised me a little bit in some details. But really it's not that good and when you think more about it, doesn't really make sense. END SPOILERS Leaving the twist aside, it should also be said that for supposedly horror movie this one wasn't scary at all for me. It had all the classic elements(the haunted house, ghosts, the constant fog, the suddenly booming music) but couldn't make it work. The mediocre camera work also didn't help. The only times I got scared a little bit was because of the sudden sound "explosion", which combined with the constant whispering in the dialogue created some scary, but in the most boring and non-creative way, moments. I don't like being scared by such cheap tricks, and it was more of a surprise than a real scare. The acting wasn't that good too. I love Nicole Kidman, she's a great actress which gave some stunning performances in "The hours", "Moulin Rouge" and "Dogville", but here she's far from her best, whispering and shouting all the time, looking too rigid and wooden and didn't gave me the impression of being really scared when she was supposed to be(you can hardly blame her for the last bit though, those "scary" scenes were pretty lame). The children were good, but nothing special. I must say that this film was moving extremely slowly, even though it's only an hour and a half long. Too many repetitive scenes, too much repetitive dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, this movie had one of the worst I have seen of late. One example of that is the fact how many times the characters said to each other "Stop breathing" or "Don't Breathe". Overall, a big disappointment for me. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another disappointing "twist" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another movie that seems to believe a good twist at the end can make up for a multitude of sins. This one is little more than poor man's Shyamalan, though it takes for its inspiration `classy' horror movies like `The Innocents,' `The Haunting,' and `The Changeling' instead of the pulp that fuels M.N.S.'s celluloid nightmares. And certainly `The Others' can't be faulted for poor taste. On the contrary, it approaches its Gothic subject matter with great sobriety--it has whispers in the dark, and mysterious footsteps upstairs, and a sinisterly knowing staff, and a fog so unvarying that you wonder why anybody's the least bit worried about sunlight. Unfortunately, because this straightfaced approach doesn't coincide with any particular directorial style or verve, it only serves to make the creaky haunted-house subgenre feel even creakier. None of the characters are particularly well developed (Alakina Mann at least gives a performance that's convincing, bratty, and fun, but Nicole Kidman, whose two modes of line delivery here are Severe Hiss and Severe Shout, has been almost as overrated for this as she was for `Moulin Rouge'). When the twist comes, it's certainly a good idea, but then the script has to go and explain it and explain it and explain it. And the biggest problem is the same with this as it often is with Shyamalan--it's all too obvious the twist came first, and then all the rest of it was just shoveled in more or less haphazardly. To be fair, `The Others' is never laughable or unbearable, exactly, but it never gets all that scary either, and it's disappointing to think what a good creepy movie might have been built (even working backwards) from this particular twist premise. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances are all marvelous -- most especially the young girl and Fionnula Flanagan. Kidman was just a tad too flamboyant for me in spots, one scene in particular conjuring up images of Nancy Kelly in the Bad Seed -- but overall, she was more than up to the task at hand. The suspense is real, and the visuals are quite well done. The sound track, sound effects, make-up, and costumes are all first-rate. But, for me, the flimsiness (these days called delicacy and cheered by critics -- all things run in cycles) of the storyline and transparency of the twists make this an unmemorable time-killer. If you're into this kind of movie, it's probably worth an 8/10 -- for me 6/10 was the right number.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say that I'm not the kind of guy who throws high score everywhere, and that from the hundreds of movies I rated, only 5 got a perfect 10, "The Others" is one of them.Not sure how other reviewers describe the start as a slow one? Just five minutes from the beginning you get the full image, why they are alone in the house, why the curtains, where is the father... you even get the feeling that the servants know more than they are telling.Not to get into spoiling details, I'll just say that its one of those horror movies that will give you shiverings and send chills to your spine! all with NO blood and NO special effects (those stupid modern effects which turned a movie with a good story "The Haunting" into a hilarious casper-like cartoon).The twist at the end is fantastic, and will take you by full surprise, even if you've seen the other movie which some say has a similar end twist (believe me, it doesn't).Add to the unique story, dense atmosphere and great directing a first class performance from a beautiful lady and an Oscar winner Nicole Kidman -if you're reading this Nicole: will you marry me? ;-) , and you'll have a movie you won't forget for a long time.Or in one word: Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE OTHERS (2001) possible Spoilers((( Nicole Kidman, an actress who made a lot of excitement with her husband Tom Cruise, but then there was a divorce, but Kidman didn't stop making movies, or working with Cruise. Cause her Cruise has been co-working in production and Kidman plays the main character in this creepy movie. It isn't a pure horror movie, it is more like a twist between horror, drama and thriller. And it works well, no doubt about it. The movie is more like an old - fashioned horror movie made by, like, shell I say Alfred Hitchcock. The movie is packed with small creepy scenes that is mostly scary cause of the nasty blackness.The story is about Grace, a woman who is maybe a bit psychological harmed after her husband was killed in the war and that she always has to take care off her two children, Nicholas and Anne who has a sichness that they can't be in daylight. They're living in a big, cold house and soon they hire three persons to work for them; a gardner, a housekeeper and another young girl. Soon, creepy things starts happening in the house....Anne starts complaining about a boy named Victor...STARS: **** 4/5 (it's a coming classic horror movie)</fullReview>

This movie makes full use of the back channels, so if you're just watching it on a regular TV, you're going to miss the full surround experience of hearing things go bump behind you. The plot twists and music reminded both my wife and myself of Alfred Hitchcock. I thought it was slow at first, but it just pulled us in a little more at a time.

		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan were both excellent in this movie. The story was quite good, but the interaction between their characters made the movie for me. I never paid much attention to Nichole Kidman until just recently. I guess it was because she was married to Tom Cruise who, for the most part, I consider to be just an awful actor. I was wrong to discount her acting ability because of their association. Still, I can't see what she ever saw in him and I'm not surprised that it's over between them.As far as other people's comments about the story being a rip-off of the Sixth Sense, I feel that kind of thinking is ridiculous. Both movies where very good and I enjoyed them equally (maybe the Sixth Sense a bit more.) It never even crossed my mind until I read some of the other IMDB comments. Why can't people just allow themselves to be entertained without being so negative and looking for fault with everything? They remind me of the people that used to write letters to the editors of the Superman and Batman comic books when I was a kid, that were always trying to point out errors. They just can't allow themselves to be happy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War World II has finished, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a huge foreboding mansion. Grace sadly, and perhaps naively, awaits the return of her husband, who went off to fight. Currently Grace has no home help, but she doesn't have to worry for too long. One day three people knock on the door and offer to be her servants. Grace not only needs help for the garden and cleaning but also for her children, who are photosensitive, which essentially means they are allergic to light. Keeping the children away from all light, except for dim candle-light, is a hard job, and this has taken it's toll on poor Grace. But soon Grace will have something else to worry about.A weird noise here, a bizarre occurrence there. Strange things are happening in the house. Is it ghosts? Is it Grace's imagination? Or is she going mad? And do the three servants have anything to do with this, or are they innocent bystanders?When the credits started rolling, I didn't know what to make of this film. I had enjoyed it for the most part, but near the end I started to wonder whether the film really was as smart as it thought it was. I had heard the film contained a nice twist, and when I watched what I thought was supposed to be the twist I was greatly disappointed. But I was wrong, and the film had a little bit more to go. I enjoyed the twist, but I don't think it's of jaw-dropping quality. Which is quite like the whole movie, very understated. If you only like big action movies, this isn't for you. I enjoyed the slow pace of the film, and the score is very nice, along with the cinematography. I enjoyed all the performances, with the children being stand-outs, and Nicole Kidman as good as ever. One complaint is that I would have liked more scenes with Lydia.In the first half of the film there were several scenes, that while not boring, I thought weren't as amazing as the movie seemed to make of them. However, upon finding out of the twist I feel these scenes would have a bigger impact on me. So I certainly will be going back for a second viewing.I have seen the other film by writer/director Alejandro Amenabar, Abre los ojos, and enjoyed it greatly, and I look forward to seeing more films from him.Whether this is a good or great film doesn't really matter, have no doubt, this is a very fine film. I just didn't know how good it was. I couldn't decide whether to give it an 8 or 9. If I could, I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10. But I can't, so...8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is a film with an excellent performance from Nicole Kidman, and as far as the distribution also. But the performance is not the unique thing that to you will maintain catched, each scene of the film causes increase of pulsations as it is developed with the spontaneous appearances, the suspense condition, and some shocking moments that I will not count so that you want to see it. I recommend it. It´s impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent ghost story set at the close of the Second World War about a widowed mother, and her 2 children living on a huge, classically creepy estate. Things begin to go astray when a mysterious trio of servants moves in. Wow, pleasantly surprised at the reaction on the board to this, I expected people to hate it. Thought I was one of the few who still appreciated gothic horror. Of the spawn of The Sixth Sense, you have the abysmal Dragonfly on the one end, this, The Others, at the opposite. Might even be better than The Sixth Sense for sheer creepiness. It lacks the gore, and obsequious visual shock of TSS, but more so than TSS, sticks to the original game plan; to frighten us. I have found, the fright element in TSS by the end of the film is all but beaten out of it, as it becomes more of a human drama piece. Not so here. The Others is a more narrow ranged, and I mean that positively, exercise in good old-fashioned atmospheric horror. It builds slowly and brings you closer and closer to a very effective, and frightening climax. It relies heavily upon scenery, weather, lighting, costume...all of the old forgotten tools. Most if not all of the fear is implied, and left for your imagination to fill in the blanks. I like that. This honestly could have been rated G, and the only reason, I'm sure it wasn't simply an attempt to spare it doom at the box office, is that film is just too frightening for kids. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!! FLAWLESS!!! AN EASY 10/10!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I can positively say that this is easily the best movie of 2001! Definitely one of the best ever made! Where do I begin?ACTING: The acting in this film is absolutely amazing! Kidman puts on an extremely convincing performance as Grace. By far the best she has ever done. Fionulla Flanagan (is that what it is) is also exceptional and Ed Sykes is great and adds some humour to the movie without being stupid or ridiculous. But the absolute stars of the show were Alakina Mann and James Bentley as Graces two children! The acting these youngsters put on is absolutely MINDBLOWING!!! Mann (who plays Anne) is unspeakably brilliant as Anne and is totally convincing. It is very difficult to describe her performance. It is brilliant beyond words. Bentley, who plays Nicholas, is absolutely jawdroppingly brilliant also. He looks genuinely terrified in the suspense scenes. These two actors deserve a future in acting. But as we all know, most of the best kid actors end up going nowhere (see Danny Loydd from The Shining or Linda Blair from The Excorcist.) But enough of that now.DIRECTING: Alejandro Amenabar does outstanding direction in this film. The angles are all appropriate and add to the atmosphere. Not one is out of place. The lighting is in my opinion the best ever in a film. The atmosphere of this film is truly intense.SCREENPLAY/SCORE: As well as directing the film, Alejandro Amenabar also wrote all of the screenplay and the score. These are both outstanding. The music adds to the creepy atmosphere and fits together perfectly.OTHER: One of the things I admire most about this film is the fact that it doesn't rely on Gore or visual effects of any sort to scare. There is not an ounce of violence in the entire film. Suspense is what scares the most, and this has it in bucketloads! There are a couple of shocks, but that doesn't make it at all less scary!MATTERS OF THE SIXTH SENSE: One thing about this fim I can't understand is the fact that people can possibly compare it to THE SIXTH SENSE, let alone call it a RIPOFF!!! The only thing that they have in common is the (!***SPOILER***!!!)twist at the end. Its like saying Apocalypse Now is a rippoff of The Deer Hunter because they were both set in the Vietnam war! I read a review on here saying it failed to capture the spirit of the 6th Sense. This is ridiculous! Its not even trying to catch that spirit! It is unique and IMHO is FAAAR superior to that movie!Another thing I fail to understand is that people say it is long, boring and slow. This is completely insane!!! The movie is only 100 minutes! I found every moment completely engrossing and entertaining! The people who thing it is slow must have a serious case of A.D.D!!! If you want slow and boring, watch the English Patient, because THE OTHERS is NOT SLOW!!!So if you havent seen this movie, I don't know what you could possibly be waiting for. Because in my heart, it is beyond classic status!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strong performance and good cinematography are the only real redeeming values in this film. The plot really goes nowhere, trying to rely on only moderately creepy atmosphere. A final plot twist attempts to save it, but instead just feels very gimmicky. Not a bad effort, but really nothing to distinguish it from the standard horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it twice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this film.In "unbiased observer" mode first of all, the things that most stood out for me were the performances of the two children; I felt that they were given great lines (credit to the writer, of course) and, most importantly, they delivered them so well. The relationship between the children was very real, teasing and loving by turns. Haley J Osment, look and learn !Kidman did a great job on the accent. I had the misfortune to watch Jodie Foster try her posh English accent out in "Anna &amp; The King" the night before, and I can tell you now, being a great actress (as Jodie is) does not automatically endow one with the gift of tongues.A lot of things didn't sit right with me when first I saw this film. I couldn't work out the reason for the animosity between Kidman's character and her daughter Anne, and between Kidman and the "sinister" servants. This is why I say watch this film twice. Although the ending resolves all issues, there are so many subtle nuances in the interactions between the characters prior to this that are very easy to miss the first time around. And make so much sense on a second viewing.-SPOILERS (if you haven't seen this film yet - shame on you !)-I know there are people who have posted here who have said they worked out all the plot within five minutes. I find this hard to believe. I am a fairly intelligent person, I watch a lot of films, and I must say that I was taken in.I can't accept the verdict of other posters that this film was a rip-off of Sixth Sesne either. Yes, SS was a very good film too, but not nearly in the same league as Others. Sure, you have the same base ingredient - people who are unaware they are dead - but I would always have put SS into the same league as "Ghost". The Others is much deeper, in that Kidmans character is an infanticide, and unaware of this horror; she plays the role perfectly, so protective of the children she herself killed. The sinister servants turn out to be helpers, subtly guiding her and the children to a realisation of their state; this latter strand put me in mind of the chiropodist/angel from "Jacobs Ladder".I could go on and on, but won't.I think that how one was brought up plays a great role in how one views a story like this. Some people go to see a horror film hoping to see CGI ghosts leaping from cellars. What these people are really after is gore, and would be much more satisfied with Russ Meyers' movies.What really got me about this film (and this is where the "biased" observer part comes in) is the memories I retain from my own childhood. When I was in my very early teens, my parents took me to stay in a house which was very similar to the one featured in this film. It was an old Manor House, in the grandest of Anglo-Irish traditions, with few guests, and few servants. One evening, I went to the top of the house, and found a small doorway just adjacent to what would, I think, have been the servant's quarters at the turn of the last Century. Going in, I found before me an attic corridor stretching ahead for some distance - this was a big house ! Being in the eaves, the roof was just above my head, and all was painted pure white. There were four rooms to the left, and four to the right. The place was clean, and tidy, but obviously hadn't been occupied for a long time. Each room was tiny, and painted white, and contained nothing but small mementoes of the past, untouched and unarranged; a doll's house in one room, a rocking horse in another etc. And in each tiny room, a cat, sometimes two or three, peering out from behind these artifacts. As a child, these images were disturbing, but I couldn't for many years figure out why. It was only as I got older that I began to appreciate that the disquieting thing about these abandoned rooms was the lack of children, and, at the same time, the overwhelming sense that they were still there."The Others" struck a big chord with me, not least because it stirred memories buried for a long time, but also because it is full of great scenes, is brilliantly characterised, and the performances throughout ring as true as they possibly could in a "ghost story".But... watch it twice.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed at how highly people have ranked this film. While I agree it was very well-made and well-acted, it didn't have any real chills to offer and it was easy to guess the story right away. ********SPOILERS******* Maybe I've just seen too many movies and watched too much TV. Anyone who has seen HAUNTED with Aidan Quinn plus the episode "My So-Called Life and Death" of the short-lived TV anthology NIGHT VISIONS will not be surprised by THE OTHERS. And there are probably many other previous tellings of the same basic story. It all adds up quickly: No electricity, no telephone, the postman never comes, and the priest doesn't visit anymore. It's not too hard to figure out the "twist" and where Victor and his family fit into it. ********END SPOILERS******Despite finding the story predictable, I'd recommend this movie to people because the story is told well and with atmosphere. However, I was never scared nor startled once. This isn't that kind of ghost story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, there I was expecting a movie that was going to scare the ever-loving jiggity-jogs out of me, and "the Others" ends up being about as scary as the "Harry Potter" movie. Less, actually.It is worth watching, though. It's gothic atmosphere is very pretty, even though the scares don't quite deliver. I suppose it's because they're drawn out for too long. This would have been an excellent episode of "the Twilight Zone", had it been a little over twenty minutes.I want it on record that I was one of the first to "call" the twist at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie after hearing how great it was from others. My wife and I both like thrillers. I have a good sound system for my tv and for the first 30 min. it was very difficult to hear any of the dialog as everyone spoke in almost a whisper. I have never turned up my sound system so loud for a movie just to hear what they are saying. We couldn't see where all the tension was as there was nothing that was really scary. This movie is highly overated. What I did find more interesting was on the 2nd dvd that came in the set was that the disease that the children in the movie had was real and it was explained fully by doctors and vistims. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghost Story With An All Too Predictable Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is ranked in the top 250 on IMdB? Does it gain this ranking on the basis of Nicole Kidman's dull performance or because of the completely predictable plot twist that I had figured out well before the halfway point of the movie?Well, others are entitled to their opinions, of course, but I found it difficult to keep at this one. It was a pretty routine ghost story in many ways (except for the predictable plot twist that I won't describe because trying to figure it out might be the only thing that would make this worthwhile for some folks) which means that since the genre has been done to death (no pun intended) it wasn't particularly frightening, unless strange noises from upstairs, and piano playing when no one's at the piano and doors slamming into Nicole Kidman's face frighten you.Ho hum is the best way to describe this effort, which (I'm feeling generous) I'll give a 4/10.</fullReview>

The film started out nicely, then seemed to die about halfway through. I was very angry at the ending. I guess that is why I hadn't heard anything about this film before seeing it in the video store.

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie with more than a twist to lean on....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman has turned out to be an excellent actor, above most of the rest. Kidman plays the role of a single mother, trapped in a big mansion because of her two children's sensitive and allergic problems with sunlight. Suddenly ghosts are hunting the house. Kidman, her kids and the servants are disturbed by this and the movie shows us the fight on how they try to solve the problem. But the movie is deeper. It is about trust and believing. It is about what the past, present and maybe even the future can tell us. What is present anyway? It's all relative. &gt; Kidman's son in the movie is really convincing and makes your hair raise on your arms and your head. Really worth watching. Lightning, music and photo is excellent, so is also the directing. A movie not worth missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classy and Classic Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not one drop of blood shown in this film. Not one. Hopefully that will give some kind of indication of the breed of horror/suspense films this falls under - psychologically terrifying rather than visually gruesome. The acting is amazing by everyone involved no matter the size of the part. The entire cast manages to pull off a blend of unsettling and endearing.The ending to this film is not predictable. While this is being harsh, I'd say that anyone who said it was predictable simply wasn't thinking hard enough during the course of the movie. Yeah, I guessed (correctly) the ending to the film about one-half to three-quarters of the way through but it was just that - a guess. I saw this movie on DVD with two other people and we were interrupted several times, needing to pause the film to do other things. During those pauses we must have come up with at least ten theories about what was really happening.On a minor note, the illness that the two children suffer from in the movie (a photosensitivity to light) is a real disorder. That wasn't something that was created for the film.I was so pleased with this film - it managed to surpass my expectations on every level and I'd gladly recommend this film to anyone. I rank it as 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an elegant haunted house movie in its purest, most classic form. It relies solely on atmosphere, creepy music and sense of foreboding, without ever resorting to those cheap and overused "jolts" that pops up from the side of the frame to scare us. The script is well-written and in certain cases it makes you think. I recommend watching this movie without any preconceptions of any kind, otherwise it might ruin the experience and surprises.I must point out that after reading several of the critics' reviews, I cannot understand those who claim that the movie is too slow. Why? Have they been so desensitized by movies with big explosions and CGI graphics that they cannot envelope themselves in a movie's atmosphere without a guiding hand? The comparison of this movie with The Sixth Sense is well deserved, and this I believe says a lot about its quality. Every frame and moment are filled with a thick atmosphere that never lets up, and the answer always seems out of reach until the very end. Interesting and hard questions are also being raised about our perceptions of the supernatural as well as religion, and the movie handled these issues very well with overlaying subtleness. I have to say that the movie is also nicely cast, the two kids are great and convincing without any hint of cliched sentimentalism about them. Nicole Kidman did a good job, she got better throughout the movie and in one scene looked positively ravishing.After seeing several of those special effects-laden haunted house flicks such as the remakes of the Haunting and House on the Haunted Hill, I was so sure that nobody understands how to do this particular genre justice anymore, and that we'll just have to resort to its teen-lite version such as Scream. Well thankfully The Others proved that with the right approach and thought, substance and style always go well hand-in-hand. If you enjoyed rewarding and intelligent thrillers like The Sixth Sense, then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this and recommend it to anyone. It is the best ghost film since Sixth Sense. Nicole Kidman gives a brilliant performance as a protective mother of two photosensitive children, as does Fionnula Flannagen as Mrs Mills, the housekeeper. The film is brilliantly shot and the old house in which the story takes place makes for a dark (because of the children's sensitivity to light), almost gothic setting, complimented by Ms Kidman's gorgeous porcelain appearance. The Spanish director, whose name eludes me, creates a beautifully chilling environment and employs some gloriously creative cinematography.Final kudos must also go to the veteran British actor, Eric Sykes, who despite his well-known deafness gives a well timed and classically executed performance as the rather dead-pan gardener. However, my biggest round of applause belong, unquestionably, to the two child actors. Both of them will go far. They were both brilliant, but particularly the little girl who played Anne (she was hilarious).The only criticism would be Christopher Eccleston's short little cameo. Getting such a big actor for such a tiny bit-part, for me, just seemed to distract from the story.8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Others' may be Alejandro Amenabar's most conventional film to date, but it is an effective and creepy old fashioned supernatural thriller, and continues the promise shown by his first two (highly recommended) movies 'Tesis' and 'Abre Los Ojos'. While I can't stand Nicole Kidman at the best of times I must admit she convinces as a nervous and overly protective mother trying to figure out the increasingly unsettling situation she finds herself in. This is arguably her best performance since 'Dead Calm' all those years ago. She is supported by two talented child actors (Alakina Mann and James Bentley, both making their film debuts), and a solid cast of character actors - Fionnula Flanagan ('How The West Was One'), veteran British comedian Eric Sykes ('The Plank'), Elaine Cassidy ('Felicia's Journey'), and (briefly) Christopher Eccleston ('Shallow Grave'). Genre fans will no doubt swiftly guess what is really going on, especially if the name Herk Harvey means anything to you, but that won't spoil your enjoyment of this well made, atmospheric and genuinely scary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For this movie to be in the top 250 is a stretch! It made me feel uncomfortable just watching it! I'll agree, at times it could get spooky, creepy, and a little suspenseful - but C'MON!!!! This movie could have easily been done in a half hour and all the good scenes would not have to be edited out! I thought Nicole Kidman was playing the part of my aunt Ginny in this flick! I guess I feel uncomfortable watching a woman be over-bearing to her kids that she "claims" she loves and subjects them to cruel punishment.The ending to the movie explains basically what's happening during the rest of it. This is the kind of movie you need to watch a second time to get the whole picture, but let me ask you something - Why would you? Ghost or Human, after a thousand hints, I would believe SOMETHING was going on! But then again, when you see women like Nichole Philpot live in this world, you would believe Nicole Kidman would play a character THAT messed up to actually believe it was "just the wind". MAN!!!If I did not wake up in a cold sweat dreaming about my aunt at nights after watching this I may have given this a "4", but unfortunately I do, so I gave it a "2" not to only show my displeasure of this movie, but to get it out of the top 250!

N. Kidman (I hadn't still seen her as actress in a movie and I was doubtful about her real cleverness)is simply beautiful, she reminds me Grace Kelly in Hitchcock's, and very very clever, perfect in her part. The movie is very well made, good photography, peculiar care, dark serious atmosphere, original and surprising plot. I gave the vote 9 : it was really a fine surprise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best ghost stories in ages....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agree with other reviewers here that this was one of the best ghost stories to come out in a long time. Why Kidman did not at least get an Oscar nom for her performance is puzzling. The two young child actors were great too. Moreover, it's amazing Alejandro Amenabar not only wrote and directed the film, but wrote the score as well (with its heavy echoes of Bernard Hermann's VERTIGO score throughout -- most excellent!).While ostensibly a supernatural thriller ala THE SIXTH SENSE (which I also enjoy for different reasons), this story is really one big parable -- it's message is that organized religion does not hold all the answers for us in this life. It's a subtle theme but definitely there, illustrated by two scenes: when Kidman's character admonishes her son to pray with his crucifix and tells him that all will be well; and when she chastises her daughter during the school lesson for making the choice to deny Christ and that those who do end up in limbo -- these scenes are paid off brilliantly in the ending when Kidman's daughter asks, "Where are we?"For any of this to make sense, you'll have to rent it and keep an eye out for the above scenes.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oooooh, scary movie? Well, not in the vein of, say, "Carrie" or "Halloween". (Scary gore-fests are a bit passé, aren't they?) No, this is an intelligent ghost story. The premise is not an original idea, but it's extremely well presented. Nicole Kidman turns in another effortless excellent performance without outshining her fellow actors, so we also get the full benefit of the fine contributions from unknowns (at least to me) Fionnula Flanagan as the housekeeper and Alakina Mann and James Bentley as Kidman's character's children. After seeing the faithful -but-tedious "Potty Harry", it's very refreshing to see child actors doing their job really convincingly and movingly. Meanwhile Eric Sykes as the gardener brings just the right combination of gravitas and "Ho ho, I know what's going on and you don't".The direction is mostly subtly effective, and very occasionally not-so-subtly effective, in particular during the "Oh so *that's* what's going on" pharyngoedema[1]-inducing scene near the end.Most of the time this film rolls along nicely at 8/10, but it briefly hits 10/10 with the afore-mentioned revelatory scene so I'm prepared to overlook the utter implausiblity of the premise and give it 8.5/10. Not an absolute must-see but definitely a pleasure to have watched it.[1]: a made-up term meaning approximately "lump-in-the-throat"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing special, nothing new, with a suprise ending that you could see coming from the begining(not necessarily the exact ending but you knew there would be a suprise). The whole point of a suprise ending is that you don't expect it. It wasn't suspenseful so count that out. It was obvious through the whole movie that something didn't fit. Maybe that's what they were trying to accomplish: showing us how obvious it should have been but how hard it was for them to realize the truth. It wasn't a bad movie but it certianly wasn't a good movie. It copied Sixth Sense in so many ways but totally failed where Sixth Sense succeeded so dramatically. I just couldn't wait for this movie to be over and I'm shocked at how high the ratings are on IMDB.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mother and two children are living alone in a large Jersey house. Things seem a little strange. Very well crafted, moody haunted house thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who hasn't known ghosts? I grew up listening to a man breathing in various cupboards around my house as I went to sleep. Both my mother and I heard him clearly. We didn't consider him malevolent, he was just there. My wife and I have heard a very unhappy, spectral woman, in broad daylight, weeping loudly in a corridor of our former house, repeatedly, over two days. I certainly believe in ghosts! And I'm not particularly psychic. I've also known of a tall old cupboard that independently spooked certain guests to the house we were living in at the time. They'd back out of the room, uneasily. I'm sure that many of you can tell similar stories. The Others is a very neatly made, subtle, measured, haunted house thriller starring Nicole Kidman.  It doesn't rely on digital effects to scare or unsettle the viewer, rather putting emphasis on strangeness. The early cues are auditory. We know we're in ghost territory when those violins start screeching in that time honoured spooky way. There aren't many sudden bangs or shakes in this strange house, not extravagantly anyway, but we're led to expect that something nasty and frightening will happen. That's understood, hinted by the mood of this beautifully crafted film. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, an overly protective mother looking after her children Anne and Nicholas in a large rural house on the island of Jersey just after WW2.  She's waiting for her husband to come home from the war. The children are apparently photosensitive and can't be allowed to come into contact with sunlight so all of the curtains are closed in the house and the doors are sequentially locked as Grace, the children and the staff move through the house. The staff headed by Mrs Mills (fine Irish actress Fionnula Flanagan) get about their business within the rules set by their mistress.  Writer/director, Chilean born, Spain based, Alejandro Amenabar has created a moody, thriller. He also composed the music. Nicole Kidman gives a fine performance again emphasising her superior acting skills. Grace is forceful but fraught, elegant but severe. The tension rises. Fifty women screamed together while I was in the cinema. I jumped. I might have screamed too.4 Grey Flys Out Of Five</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suffered this over-rated film last night, so now you don't have to. The plot is thin, shabby and largely second hand. Plot points are delivered with granite-slab subtlety, and things happen that defy even the story's own fragile, self-contained reality. Why does the husband appear at all? How unlikely and contrived are the McGuffins buried under the leaves? People seem to have confused lack of pace and creakingly dull storytelling with "atmosphere". All reviews mention "the twist", so you're going to spend a good minute and a half trying to work it out - and you'll be right! And while I admit one scene did actually make me jump, if you lock me in a dark room in front of something this dull almost any loud noise will startle me awake. Despite the hymns of praise to the contary, Nicole Kidman is also quite weak in the lead role.</fullReview>

In the tradition of Radio 4's Christmas ghost story.Kidman is believable as the mother and holds the film well (as usual). The daughter is very good, especially in the pair's intense scenes.

		<fullReview>THE OTHERS (2001) Rating: 9/10One word aptly describes this movie: horrifying. The Others is a splendid film, and a horrifying one. I am absolutely sure this movie will be the scariest experience on film for the year, and it beats of such scare-fests as What Lies Beneath and The Exorcist in the spook factor. This movie would certainly earn a 10/10 in that area! The movie earned a 9/10 in the overall quality and enjoyable area because of its ending. This movie was getting a 10/10, but when the ending came, however clever it was, ruined that score. I just thought the style of the movie completely disappeared when the final reel came. However, the rest of the movie is ingenious, mysterious, scary and extremely clever. Nicole Kidman gives a stunner of a performance as the isolated mother Grace. She acts scared brilliantly! I haven't been a fan of hers really but after Moulin Rouge I was intrigued to see if she could continue choosing good movies and giving much better performances than she was in the early 1990's. Well, Nicole, 2001 is your year! In this movie, Nicole is able to pull of plenty of emotions and be completely realistic and endlessly stay in character. Nicole, you've earned one more fan! The director uses his dreamy ideas and things we know we're all scared of but never admit to believing to make this movie a complete pleasure and always an eerie and dark one to watch. Overall, I thought this movie was absolutely 10/10 material, but after the ending, I put it down a point for almost copying The Sixth Sense's idea. But I still love the movie and look forward to a second viewing. This is one heck of a scary ride, so be prepared!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie last night, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance throughout; she is really quite remarkable. While the movie does sag in many places, losing its flow and opening the door to boredom, it more than makes up for it with the twists towards the end. Obviously the film-makers were quite aware that many people are familiar with "The Sixth Sense"'s twist ending - and the movie hence plays on this, introducing one twist, only to find out that that twist descends into another one. The acting throughout is flawless, particularly Kidman - who gives an air of dignity and class to her character. Comparisons to Henry James's "Turn of the Screw" are inevitable.

Floor-creakings, curtain-openings, classic ghost story stuff. And all with none of this fancy-schmancy electronic imaging, etc. There's only one scene where that kind of thing comes into play, and it's pretty short. I didn't exactly like Nicole Kidman's character for a few quibbling reasons, one thing being that she shifted beliefs way too quickly and way too often, but I suppose some people do that, just because.Either way, though, a low-budget, uber-creepy ghost story.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what can I say. The best movie I've seen all year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was with some trepidation that I went to see the Others. Although I'd heard a lot of good things about it, I've just recently seen Jeepers Creepers, and had begun to fear that all of this years hallowe'en movies were going to suck. Over the first 45mins, I really thought I had made a mistake, little did I know that the film was slowly and cunningly drawing me deeper and deeper into the story. Although it is very slow to build, without this, it would have fallen flat on its face very quickly. You can't help but begin to feel for the characters and you also find yourself terrified of the house.Not only does this film encourage you to second guess the events as they unfold, it is constantly revealing tiny snippets of plot which throw you straight off the scent. In fact, it is so clever that any more mention of the plot will spoil the entire film. Suffice to say that the Sixth Sense'll never know what hit it when this film opens.Nicole Kidman was excellent. She really is a good actress, the nuances of her performance, and her interaction with her children and the servants is superb. Mrs Mills (can't remember the actresses name) was also great. The real revelation of the movies was the two young children. They gave great performances laced with terror, but with a humourous touch. Their childhood naivety conflicting with the things they have read and seen.Recently, I've noticed a trend for the studios to reveal far too much of the story in the trailers for their films. For example, all of the funny parts of American Pie 2 were in the trailer, slightly dulling their impact in the film. Those of you who have seen the trailer for The Others may think that you've seen most of the plot and that it will have been spoiled. Don't be fooled, the trailer hardly scratches the surface of this wonderful piece of film-making.Overall, I can hardly fault it. The acting is fantastic, the direction is superb. The lighting was uniformly excellent. But most of all, the plot and story were thrilling. Go see this film. But if anyone tries to talk to you about it, cover your ears and run away. You really want to enjoy it in all its glory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is always thrilling to join a controversy, although I don't see much of it here: the nay sayers are up in arms, screaming (why?) "outrage" at this quiet little gothic gem,claiming it is as it were, a blatant rip-off of an equally succesful and glorified (to the point of estultice, according to several) film starring Mr. Bruce Willis and a child prodigy that since has proven to be a three-days' wonder.I think it is totally unnecessary to compare both. After all, it's not a matter of "who predates what" -- if so, then both lose to Agnes Moorehead in "The Twilight Zone", hands down.Well, once the chicken and egg dilemma is laid aside, let us dig into the really juicy stuff: "The Others" is one of the Top 10 films so far this year and it is this (Horrid) Summer's sleeper after loads and loads of "El Bloato" overproduced letdowns of abysmal proportions, that cause a plunge on the national IQ rate (yet another slice of that... uh... pie, anyone?).Finally, a film done with class, with a memorable leading lady and an eerie atmosphere that develops in slow paces leading to a climax that is effective, even for those that foresaw it. Its gothic flavor gives it a lineage shared with other classics -- and this is on the way to become one, and rightly so!- such as "Rebecca", "The Innocents", "The haunting" (1963), Bergman's "Vargtimmen" and "Rosemary's Baby", all helmed by strong performances by beautiful, talented actresses -- Joan Fontaine, Deborah Kerr, Julie Harris, Liv Ullmann and Mia Farrow - all directed by visionary directors who took risks to do their angst-ridden, dark films the way they wanted to, giving to audiences boundless chills and pleasure."The Others" stands out in a proud heritage within the so very much vilified horror genre, and Nicole has earned her bars among those aforementioned screen legends. Amenábar, at age 29, has achieved what other filmmakers takes a lifetime to do, and even, in hindsight, manages to place some serious questions about our nature.So here's to this season's toast; just add to the mix already on the cocktail blender the regal and understated presence of Fionnula Flanagan, the finding of the two children (Alakina Mann is a standout and James Bentley is heartbreakingly good), plus the ever-loved controversy that helps root a film into pop culture firmly, shake, do not stir, and enjoy.Oh, and as an afterthought: The unraveling of Grace belies the unraveling of her embodiment a few months later. Therefore, Kidman has my absolute respect not only as a gifted performer (she got that with her unjustly overseen "To Die For") but also as a human being.Do yourself a favor (if only for arguments' sake) and go watch it more than once... and then, pleasant dreams. -- if any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. It wasn't great, and falls far short of the Sixth Sense, to which it is often compared, but it was still a good movie. The scene is England, 1945, and revolves around a woman (Kidman) who has lost her husband to the war and is isolated in this mansion with her two children afflicted with a condition which makes them vulnerable to light. The children must spend their lives in candlelight.The movie has a few surprises, and there will be no spoilers here. I will just comment that the movie moves rather slowly for the first two-thirds or so, but does pick up at the end and did provide me with some jumps. You are rewarded in the end for allowing the movie some character and plot development.The acting is excellent, and I was impressed by the two children's performances. Kidman was fine, as was whoever played the old lady servant (OK, I'm too lazy to look it up now). The movie was more spooky than scary for the most part. The scary parts are due more to timing and development than gratuitous violence (there is none of that here). My warning is that the movie is not for those with short attention spans, or for those who need a shock every two minutes to keep their attention. This movie unfolds like a good book, introducing the characters and slowly giving you the stories behind the people and withholding most of the action until the end when you better understand who the events are happening to. I gave it a 6/10, which, to me, says it is better than average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is testament to the power of dramatic tension in horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only once in a very long while does an excellent horror flick happen to be playing in that cinema that you swore was offering a horror flick when you paid that ticket price. More often that not, what you are offered is a special-effecstravagansa that's like that cold spaghetti you stuck your hand into at the carnival when you were a kid. It's sensuous, definitely horrible, but not really all that scary.Then again, once in a while, someone like Amenabar demonstrates what we all knew as kids: Nothing bites in the dark like your own imagination! The atmosphere of "The Others" is, as you might expect, dark and cold, set upon the classic Lovecraftian tale of a tragically broken family trying to live in the past. The tone of the movie is established *very* quickly (there is no time wasted!) but allowed to mature more slowly as bit by bit we discover more about Grace, her family, and the mysterious servants. The tension rises slowly; "The Others" teases you with whispers and creaking doors, relying on the marvelous use of consecutively dark and bright rooms to generate a kind of confusion between the reality and nightmare that permeate the house. Don't worry though, when "The Others" wants you to jump, you'll jump. My housemate was airborne, while I'd much more sensibly taken cover behind the seat in front of me. I haven't done that since my Dad took me to see "Misery" when I was twelve! The beauty is that it isn't usually the events themselves that are scary; Chainsaws, Baseball bats, and/or men hanging from the ceiling are notably absent. When you walk out of the theatre, you're not talking about inconsistencies, or how original the story was. You're just trying to convince your friends that you weren't just ducking under the seats to cower with the spilt popcorn!Verdict: CGI gore and freak-a-minute junkies stay away. This film is testament to the power of dramatic tension in horror. 9/10(I will admit that biblical tirades are getting tiring though)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amenabar is called to be the genius who takes the art of cinema to where it belongs: excellent writing, perfect direction and great performances. I hope he goes one in his way of originallity, lack of unnecessary effects and having the best of the actors and the characters. The film is not so long or boring as many people say. I think the people who say this is because they went to the cinema alone and they were simply greedy of the couples that were scared and holding each others hands and arms very tight because of the fear. For those who say that its a copy of the sixth sense, let's remind them that the story was written long time before the release of this film (just check out). NIcole Kidman is the actual "woman on top" (of her career). She's at her best in this film, as the rest of the cast. The name of the character (Grace) and her style is a clear homage to the late Grace Kelly, Hitchcock's muse. The whole film looks like an all time classic, like Rebecca or Vertigo. Its photography is near perfection, the music and the timing make your heart nearly stop, the story is really well thought and it makes you suspect of somebody, then of somebody else, then think one thing, then another, and at the end everything make sense...I can't tell yo more than that you have to go to see this great movie... Anyway, time will tell, but I wouldn't be surprised if Amenabar will be considered, in a few years, like a new Hitchcock or Welles. He has the talent, the genius and he's very intelligent to get caught in the star system of hollywood... Good Luck Amenabar, you are the savior of the "old-style" cinema (the only one that can be considered art).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This seems to have been a surprise box office hit, holding in the top 4 of the late summer returns for weeks. If you are a fan of Nicole Kidman, which I am, you will love this movie, which I did. Saw it twice, and may do so again before it leaves. And unlike "Moulin Rouge" Kidman's other triumph of the season, it will translate well to the small screen.There is one moment toward the end of the movie where a frightful person appears. Several people in the audience screamed when it happened--they were quite shocked and had been drawn into its emotionally claustrophobic atmosphereThe absence of violence, gore and murder is welcome in this genre. The hysteria that is always just below the surface (and occasionally breaking through the surface) builds throughout the film.Kidman is in almost every scene--actually in almost every shot. She has never looked better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scary Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so Hollywood type. After "The Sixth Sense" became the big hit, they have successfully throwing us with another supernatural thriller-drama. "What Lies Beneath", "Stir Of Echoes", "The Gift",etc, you name it....But, as the part of the trend, I guarantee this one will be different.Of course, as many ghost story film, it have it own absurdness, but it won't be our focus here.I promise, "The Others" is both chilling and touching drama, that will keep you on the edge of your seat, especially the very surprising ending, that in my opinion is even better than The Sixth Sense.The Story is about a woman, Grace (Nicole Kidman), who moves with her sick children into a mansion on an isolated island while her husband is off at war. Unable to withstand sunlight, Grace's children must live in total darkness. In their isolation, they discover that they are not alone. There's a ghostly presence in their house......I know you will think it's just another haunted house flick, but trust me, do not trust the plot ! Just come to the theater near you, seat thight and enjoy this frightening drama....Even it's not so original, but it's one step ahead from another supernatural flick, so I give 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1945 Jersey. A woman (Nicole Kidman--who's excellent) keeps her two children barricaded in their big, gloomy, fog-shrouded house. It seems if the children are exposed to sunlight it will kill them. Then three mysterious servants show up to help...or are they? Strange noises are heard and the little girl starts seeing ghosts. What's going on?The movie is VERY dark, very creepy and very quiet...and that's the problem. It's too much. There's a constant air of dread and danger and it really wore me down. Also the film moves at a (purposefully) slow pace--too slow for me. It's all well-done and there are a few scenes guaranteed to make you jump (or scream) but it was too depressing. But there is a nice twist at the ending that I didn't see coming. So, it's somewhat worth seeing--just very slow-moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a disappointment than a fright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yo After reading the viewer comments here, I expected a lot more than I got. Its filmed beautifully and the children were wonderful, so was the older maid (I won't mangle her name by trying to spell it). If you know the story at all, don't bother to see the movie. This version relied too much on slamming doors to frighten or startle its audience. It was too long, or it seemed too long. Rent the 60s film "The Innocents" its much better. As far as comparing it to "The Sixth Sense", it doesn't even come close. Denise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the most tedious film of the summer. Nicole Kidman walks through the same eight rooms 33 times. To mix it up she sometimes holds a candle, sometimes not! Useful only for its superb referencing of the Caravaggist candle-lit paintings of Georges de La Tour and Joseph Wright of Derby, and some evocative interiors influenced by Wilhelm Hammershoi's fin-de-siecle art. I guessed the ending. There it is. Instead of buying into this muck, go see "Ghost World" again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER IN THIS REVIEW!! If you haven't seen it, don't read on to hear how it ends.The sad thing is they made this movie out to be origional, thrilling and chilling. I say its kind of copied, very predictable, and I found the scariest thing was that people jumped when the most predictable thing happens. (IE if you go in the closet and the scary music starts to swell, expect someone to open the bloody door. Its not that hard to predict people, thus not scary! Give me a break already!) This movie was very "Sixth Sense" (Which was very original, had suspenseful moments, and made you jump out of your seat the whole time. Which I give a 10 out of a possible 10) In the "Sixth Sense" you had a man who thought he was the living- living among the dead, but was actually dead living amongst the living. Same concept here. They thought the "Others" possessed their house, when they were actually the possessors. I knew that less than 10 minutes into the movie it was so obvious.I'm a Kidman fan believe it or not, but this work was beneath her. She can do so much better than what the writers gave her to work with. Kudos to her and the kids for trying to do the best job they could with a stolen, but poorly copied, script. This version was rather dull. The scariest thing was actually paying $8. a ticket to see it. Sorry, but this is a wait till video movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the best movie of the year. First of all, the acting was great. Nicole Kidman gave a stellar performance. You could see the fear in her eyes. Second, the plot was excellent. It had so many twists and turns in it. And the ending..wow. If you thought The Sixth Sense had a suprise ending, you should see this movie. Basically, its about Grace (Kidman) and her two children, Ann and Nicholas, who live in a supposedly haunted house. Ann keeps seeing this boy named Victor who nobody else sees and other ghosts, and the mother does not believe her. Third, it relies on atmosphere, not special effects, to create scares, and believe me, this movie has a whole lotta of em.If you liked the Sixth Sense, you will love this movie. In fact, The Others was far superior to The Sixth Sense. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feh. (to quote another critic) *MINOR SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILERS*Ahh... a mansion surrounded by fog. "Eerie" characters and events that the director holds back from us, like we care, to create suspense. And many cliches later, you have the ultimate cliche, which would, yes, be that funny little cute little twist that smacks of The Sixth Sense. I liked it with Bruce Willis. I was ready to walk out after enduring an hour and a half of Nicole Kidman in one of the worst-scripted roles I've seen in a while. (She chases ghosts with a rifle - yes, it's true - and I was trying hard not to laugh out loud and disrupt the theater.)Not that she can act very well, either, but that's beside the point; i'll give her the benefit of the doubt here and put Eyes Wide Shut, and this bomb of a script, out of mind.What's good? Atmosphere. Kids.What's the worst? Waiting for nothing. I mean really, nothing. I knew it would come out why the girl is mute, i knew they would tell us the big deal with all the ghosts, it was just a matter of time. It's usually the responsibility of the director (and writer; in this case, the same unfortunate soul) to make sure we care why the girl is mute. In this case, feh. You know, I liked the candles but I didn't like Kidman drawing out the explanation, like it's some big mystery, like maybe we won't find out. Of course we find out. So tell us up front. Waiting on something like that does not make a movie. And that waiting WAS the entire movie. The entire 100 minutes that felt like 200, easy.two stars out of five, for Nicole Kidman being easy to look at, for the kids, and for that glassy look on the husband's face...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that in a long line of stinkers this summer, there was no hope for any movie to wow us, like 1999's The Sixth Sense, or last year's Gladiator, but this year we have a winner. The Others is a tense, carefully crafted ghost story,similar to the Sixth Sense, but different in so many other ways as well. The slow build up only adds to the suspense, and when finally you get to experience "the others" as I guess they are called, the whole audience burst into screams ofpure terror. The dimly lit scenes give you an odd sense, where dark is morecomforting than light (due to a disease that can kill the children if they are exposed to bright light). Nicole Kidman really knows how to act, and she shows it. It wasn't until this year's Moulin Rouge that I realized what an talented person she is, and with two incredible movies in the same year, her career looks to be going up, even without her hubby. This review is sparce, simply because there is too much that could be revealed that shouldn't. The less said is always more for the unsuspecting viewer. Go see this movie for a good scare and a great time. It doesn't disappoint.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a return to an old tradition in the horror genre: the haunted house film. Many would argue that this particular subgenre has already been revived by such films as _The Sixth Sense_ and _What Lies Beneath_, but I would reply that this movie, with its excellent writing, acting, and mise-en-scene, shows just how silly and amateur those other films really are.One of the main attraction of this film is Nicole Kidman, and that is rightfully so. She is as brilliant in the film as she was in _Eyes Wide Shut_ (perhaps more so) as a mother who is at once religiously fanatic and deeply compassionate towards her children. It is this sort of moral ambiguity that makes this film so delightful and fulfilling throughout.The visual effects in the movie, although subtle, are nothing short of amazing. The foggy landscape around the house and the dark, moody tone of the entire film set a tone in which the scares seem perfectly in step with the rest of the movie, as well as the emotions of the central characters.Last but not least, the script is one of the best I've seen in a long time. It maintains a careful pace (neither too slow or fast- a pitfall that claims many haunted house films) while slowly building to an unforgettable and logically sound conclusion (which seems to be less and less valued in big studio films these days, although it is an element with importance that cannot be estimated.)All in all, this is terrific filmmaking. Here's hoping we see more horror films of this caliber soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this movie both because of Nicole Kidman's brilliant acting and also the storyline, I had see a preview at a movie a week ago. For the first 30 minutes or more I was worried I built it up in my mind too much and would be disappointed but I was NOT! I really only want to tell you that it was a terrific story and fabulous acting by all......I do want to say more than that because anything I say could spoil it for you. The only thing I found which was remotely close to being a fault with this movie was the darkness it seemed to be shot in through out. It made sense that it appeared that way but as a movie viewer, I am just not accustomed to that.I would suggest that you do NOT drink before or during this movie because you really dont want to miss a second! But popcorn is a great idea, just hold on tight to the bag! :-)I think that Nicole may take home an Oscar for this film!! I will applaud her if she does :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kidman kudos. Borrowed theme but still worthy of theater viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a Nicole Kidman fan, but found her disturbingly authentic here as a prim and proper widow on the edge of her coping skills. Her neurotic orthodoxy and nunnery-brand discipline are simply crutches to carry her character through what would be a ghastly existence of having to raise children in a large, necessarily dark and gloomy mansion... while silently grieving the loss of husband and father killed the war. Who wouldn't go a little nutty under such circumstances?The Others does borrow from the plot of another recent hit movie, but is different enough in style and execution that it certainly warrants a movie theater viewing. I don't hold myself out to be a professional critic, so take it for what it's worth when I say that The Others is intricate, occasionally plodding, but certainly chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its sterling reputation as one of the best cinematic ghost stories since 1963's "The Haunting," Alejandro Amenabar's 2001 film "The Others" was one that this latecomer plopped into his DVD player with great anticipation. And I am happy to report that all the positive word of mouth is right on the money, and that this really is some kind of great work. As most folks seem to have already discovered, "The Others" takes place on the isle of Jersey in 1945, where Grace (superbly played by Nicole Kidman) awaits the homecoming of her soldier husband, whilst caring for her "photosensitive" children and breaking in some new domestic help. Soon, though, Grace's worries are greatly added to by strange noises upstairs, the sound of a sobbing child, and the tinkling of a piano in an empty room. It would seem that her lavish mansion has been invaded by...spirits? Featuring an endlessly fascinating story line, interesting characters, fine production values, a creeping sense of dread and a good number of jolts, "The Others" really does make for a top-notch, classy horror movie. Amenabar not only wrote the screenplay for and directed this great picture, but also provided the film's lovely/creepy score. (The man must be some kind of a friggin' genius!) Fionnula Flanagan (who, incidentally, impresses me no end by dint of her having appeared on three "Star Trek" series!) is marvelous here as the housekeeper, Mrs. Mills; how wonderful to see her and Kidman giving two very Oscar-worthy performances in their many shared scenes. The picture features an absolutely brilliant ending that I was not prepared for (those who have read E.F. Benson's 1923 story "Mr. Tilley's Seance" will perhaps appreciate this ending even more), and that final shot of Kidman and her children in an upstairs window is just...haunting. I found this film even better and deeper on a repeat viewing. More than highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an amazing movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is full of plot twists that just keeps you thinking. There was a movie in the 60s that was similar to this movie called "The Innocents". Its about a governess who comes to take care of a young girl and insists the house is haunted but can't prove it. It was a very chilling movie for its time so it should be worth the time to find it and/or watch it. You might want to consider it if you can find it anywhere.

		<fullReview>Who are you Alejandro Amenábar and where have you been? Your filmography consists of all foreign films save this one, so give us more.This movie was spectacular and I'll tell you why. After the mega successful movie "The Sixth Sense" was done, no way would you figure a movie regarding ghosts and a plot twist would be done. Or, if someone was as bold as to make a movie along the lines of "The Sixth Sense", then you would not figure it to be nearly as good. In steps "The Others" with a very similar story and plot twist, but oh so wonderfully different and uniquely brilliant. This movie didn't hardly get the accolades it deserves, but I am here to sing its praises. This movie was eerie, spooky, and suspenseful. Nicole Kidman, albeit not my favorite actress, did an excellent job. What made the movie even more amazing was the complete misdirection. I honestly thought the movie was headed towards a final showdown with a confrontation between humans and ghosts and the subsequent exorcism of those ghosts. Yes, there was a final confrontation, but the ghosts were not what or who you expected. This was just a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lovely Genuine Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm afraid that telling a slightest hint of the plot will already give away what's coming when you watch the film, so I'll just give you the set up: A woman named Grace retires with her two children to a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second World War, where she's waiting for her husband to come back from battle. The children have a disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight without being hurt in some way. She then hires 3 servants to help around the house, or mansion.Okay, that really doesn't give the plot, but as soon as you watch it, you'll know it's a ghost story, but this time, it's not mainstream! Well, isn't that original? I'm so glad they don't have those usual horror movie clichés and those huge amounts of gore. In fact, this movie doesn't even need special effects to make us scared because this movie is really creepy.If this can't be one of the best movies in 2001, it should at least be the best or one of the best movies ever made in 2001, if not one of the best horror movies. If you're tied of those PG-13 horror movies, this won't disappoint. It's like The Ring (in as good PG-13 rated horror films).I love this movie because it's like Lost, in which subtle clues are given away little by little until it reaches the twist ending. Believe me, the pay off is great, if you think this movie's pacing is too slow. I'm sure it's slow, if someone figured the twist ending already. If not, don't try to think some up or you'll get mad at the graceful pace the film is moving.Nicole Kidman gives a really great performance in here, as well as many other characters. The cinematography, the score, and the production, they're all great! This film really doesn't follow many mainstream movie rules. This movie doesn't need blood, special effects, scary make-up, etc. to even scare you. This film is creepy and is one of the best horror films these days have to offer. Sadly, there are only few of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The others" is other masterpiece of Alejandro Amenábar. Why "Other masterpiece"? Just watch "Open your eyes". "The others" is a really good horror movie."The others" is a terrifying but philosophical trip through the questions of the man. I want to compare it first with the character of the beautiful book "Rayuela". This character reminds me a lot this movie. Because he is in a difficult situation. He doesn't know if he exist. Of that it is "The others". Is a Gothic tale with a message that makes us meditate.With great performances, "The others" is a good horror movie, maybe is the best that have made lately.Alhough it has been very welcome, many also criticize it because it seems like a copy of "The sixth sense". Nothing more far of the truth. Because, "The sixth sense" talks about simply the story of death people living with alive people. But with a different message."The Others" is a good horror movie.

		<shortDescription>A great horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie surprised me a lot along with The Sixth Sense as their twists are rather similar to each other. What I liked about this movie is that it does not rely on blood, gore and explicit violence that most horror movies today show us as an attempt to frighten the hearts of us viewers. Instead most of the frights comes from the eerie atmosphere of the setting and scenario. Most of the time the film is shot quietly which some viewers might find boring but this only adds to the suspense and tension if continued watching. The director was able to include the most basic and necessary methods of a standard classic horror movie to ensure a frightening sensation. Such method includes the use of creepy sound effects. When I say this I mean footsteps being heard, floorboards creaking, voices of little children echoing down the hallway, heavy breathing sound etc. The film is mainly shot with the curtains drawn as well. This is because Grace's children suffer from a disease which does not allow them to stay in front of the sun for too long otherwise they will shrivel up and die. This is a great excuse for having dark settings most of the time and it provides a great deal of tension. If you look at the house from the outside, you would think that this family is non existence. I particularly like how Grace's personality is portrayed. Nicole Kidman did a very good job at being the strict and over protective mother who follows and impose certain rules around the house. For example closing and locking every door behind them. Grace is very strict about this particular rule and its frightening, as the viewer to see her being very sensitive about it and it makes you feel the same shock and insecurity as she feels when a door is left open.Also the arrival of the 3 servants serves a purpose in creating tension as well. These 3 strange servants which one of them includes Mrs. Bertha Mills played brilliantly by Fionnula Flanagan makes us doubt their existence and that they have something to do with the 'intruders'. Set during the WW2 period its to no one surprise to see Grace being paranoid at thinking that there is a German soldier in the house. Mrs. Bertha Mills constantly tries to reassure Grace that there are nobody else other than themselves in the house. She gives the impression that she is a loyal harmless servant which everybody buys until the point where she and Mr. Tuttle end up covering the gravestones. She plays a frightening character indeed and this what makes it more intense and scary.The use of camera angles is well placed showing the pivotal angles of a scene. The angles which some would say shows off the most intense and frightening aspect of that scene. The close up shot of the door knob, the low down angle of the staircase all adds to the tension and suspense. The use of lighting also plays a vital role as the whole film is set around dark areas of the mansion. Since they don't have electricity they resort to using candles and oil lamps. The flicker of the flame casting shadows around the house actually provides a great deal of tension. Its almost as if these moving shadows are representing the 'others'. Overall this is a great horror movie, even today it still stands out as one of the best. Its far better than recent horror releases because it actually provides you with frights and scares rather than the usual gross out sickening and disgusted look when you see a man's arm being chopped off or an eye ball being cut off. This film does not need any of those disturbing scenes to create a frightening sensation. It prefers to use old classical methods in creating tension and this is something which Alfred Hitchcock might be proud of. Top marks for Nicole Kidman in her portrayal of Grace but the star of the show to me really goes to Fionnula Flanagan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of movies I've watched lately, have all involved Australian actors. Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain, Hugh Jackman in X-Men, Guy Pearce and Nicole Kidman. I completely forgot she was an Aussie. Her portrayal of an overprotective British mother is incredibly good that when I played the DVD extras, that Australian accent came back on. Kidman, Flanagan as the lead housekeeper, the two young children especially give great acting performances. And like Ledger in Brokeback, when the acting is superb, and the story well told, repeated viewings are a must. I don't know why some people call it "slow". From the opening scream to the surprise ending, The Others kept me involved, not knowing if the housekeepers were diabolical or "Grace" was really mad, as her daughter suggested. Director Amenabar wrote, directed and composed the score for the film, which greatly enhanced the mood at certain scenes. The music gave a clue of what was happening but it was still effective. A really enjoyable nighttime flick, one that will make you shudder, and very well made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock influenced suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since his first feature, Amenábar has been characterized for liking the plots with suspense and a great commercial success. For this film, he fronted a minimalistic story but with lots of suspense.Highly influenced by Hitchcok imagery and visual style, this film suggests more than it really shows. The atmosphere is extremely well created, the international actors are very well selected and the fit very well to their characters, Amenábar was able to create a very suggestive atmosphere with the soundtrack and the script do not have any fissure.This film is clearly influenced by several masterpieces such as Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING or Hitchcock's REBECCA.In my opinion, THE OTHERS should be considered as the best Amenábar film (up to date).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut, ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest, Alejandro Amenabar's The Others really brings absolutely nothing new to the ghost story genre. In fact, everything about the film has been done before. so why did I like it so much? Simple. The Others is still a very stylish and atmospheric film. It hearkens back to the days when a film had an actual story to tell and did so at its own pace. Not ruled by hyper fast cutscenes. In this way, the film slowly builds its tension as it gives the viewer piece by piece the clues to its puzzle. And all the while it keeps doling on the atmosphere until the film almost chokes from it. In short, The Others is a better film for how it goes about its business than for what its business actually is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this was a good movie. Great story, somehow there is a strong truth to all of that but hey it is great. Atmosphere, characters, not too over the top. I was funny cause I was trying to figure out the story but its so good that I never figured it out till the end, I wanted to watch. Now thats the way a scary movie should be. Most of the time I know the whole story before it even starts. heh. Ending was great, I was like whoa nice. All in all it gets my recommendation. Still Its one of those stories that I doubt they could make a sequel to. It loses its surprise that I first had. But hey you never know. Never the less ya it was great.

		<shortDescription>Accommodating the afterlife.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in England after WW2, Grace and her two children, Anne and Nicholas live in a rather isolated mansion waiting for their husband/father to return from the war, but I they haven't heard from him since leaving. To make matters even more worst their housekeepers have just got up and left without any notice and the kids suffer from an illness were sunlight could cause them to badly, blister up. But suddenly three mysterious servants show up to work there and that's when strange occurrences start happening with the kids claiming that they're not alone in the house, but the uneasy Grace doesn't want to hear about it, that's until she becomes aware of the strange forces at work.The sudden interest in subtle, supernatural horror flicks can be attributed a lot to M. Night Shyamalan's film; 'The Sixth Sense (1999)'. This is my second viewing of it and I might be going against the grain, but I say this film is more emotionally engaging with such penetrating atmosphere and flawless performances compared with M. Night's mixed bag. 'The Others' is an intelligently stylish, sophisticated slow burner that plays on the little things to work up the increasing intensity that slowly strangles you with its grinding atmospheric air. Director Alejandro Amenabar manages to create a rich atmosphere from the shadowy grand exterior of the house to the blanket of mist that smothers the lush surroundings of the estate. But what impressed me most was the confident and sensitively in depth performances he got out of the small cast. Nicole Kidman raises the bar with an extraordinary performance as the rigidly, fearful mother. The two kids Alakina Mann and James Bentley are convincingly good. Then you got remarkable supporting roles from Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy. Christopher Eccleston makes a small appearance too. The story sticks close to the traditional, Gothic haunted house tale with the usual set-up with dead silence making way for sudden noises, poorly lit rooms, things going bump, fake scares and so on. But what made these things such a breath of fresh air is how director Amenabar had total control of his vision with precise timing to milk out its bold, suggestive thrills, which will totally put you on the edge just like that of Kidman's brittle character. The atmosphere ventures into a dreamlike realm but still keeping a steady foot in reality. While, in the imposing Gothic mansion the darkness fills every space with it creaking with isolation and tightly knitted quarters. These striking visuals and set-pieces are gorgeously shot with such skill and a good eye for detail. A powerfully streamlined score is generally enchantingly and when it strives for creepy scares it does so in an exhaustingly tense tone. The elegant plot illustrates an very intriguing mystery tale that's psychologically demanding with secrets crossing your path and many cryptic hints to what may happen. The film's major revelation might not be a huge surprise for some, but I for one didn't think it was that easy to pick up on.A chillingly subtle, but astoundingly effective suspense drama that pushes you to the brink with assured direction and very first-rate performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chillingly irresistible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why isn't Nicole Kidman cast as a lead in more supernatural thrillers? She is perfect for this role and could be for many others. She excellently portrays a lonely mother of two photosensitive children in a large and gloomy house on a cut off island in Britain. However disturbing events occur involving her children, as their suspicion grows of a supernatural presence, with back up from the new mysterious housekeepers. However she persistently won't believe in any of the rumours or strange noises even if it means punishing her daughter, leading their relationship to a stand still. Thinking she has gone mad, she becomes determined to explore and root out the mysteries in the house, leading to a shocking and chilling view of life after death. The sets are excellent as well as the fabulous acting, which keeps you addicted to the screen. The mysterious events and shocks are amazingly put together in a terrifying web of fear and not knowing what to expect. The Others takes a while to understand but it is definitely worth watching besides your tastes. I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for any awards. An instant psychological classic which I think will be hard to beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole Kidman Gave a Great Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thought that this film was going to go down the garden path like most thriller films. However, I was greatly surprised and enjoyed an entirely different experience. Nicole Kidman,(Grace Stewart),"Birth",'04, showed her great acting talents and charming beauty. Grace opened doors and locked them constantly and never let any sunlight into this huge dwelling of a home where she lived with her two children. They used candle and oil lamps for lighting and the children seemed to drive their mother crazy. Grace was waiting for her husband to come home from WW II since the war was over in 1945. There is some very brief romance, but the film does keep you on the edge of your seats and the ending will keep you in Suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and inspiring, with Nicole Kidman at her best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar serves up a deliciously spooky ghost story with "The Others", an original and haunting tale about an English woman and her two children in a remote, dark mansion during World War II. Grace (Kidman in a superb performance) and her creepy children, who are sensitive to sunlight, have to stay inside. When her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann, who holds her own strongly, playing off Kidman well) starts telling her she can see "intruders" in the house, Grace disregards it until she begins having terrifying experiences of her own. After the arrival of mysterious "servants", who aid Grace in her paranoia, it becomes clear that something is very wrong within the walls of her home, and she must take matters into her own hands or something far worse could come of it. Shot in the dark and played well by all, "The Others" is a treat of a scary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ghost Story With A Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Impossible to discuss this movie at length without putting a spoiler warning. Even saying it is a ghost story from the ghosts' point of view might warrant it. It begins with Grace (Kidman) waking up screaming from a nightmare - and the tone is set. With a patient, meticulous script both the mood of the story and the story itself are carefully and almost lovingly built up until the catch is sprung on you. Viewing it a second time - like Sixth Sense - it hangs together nicely. That's really all I can say except that I was impressed by Kidman's versatility here and also by the children's' performances. Alakina Mann was particularly unsettling at times as Anne, the mysterious, mistrustful daughter who first sees the 'Intruders'. A fine yarn and a fine film.</fullReview>

A space within the main house that was set us as if you were to sympathized with the house and its characters. The house has a scary heartbeat and breathes on the back of the necks of its residence. The atmosphere itself is one that plays to its own script and the director Aleandro Amenabar feeds on that but camera shot that can show the life of the house. Nicole Kidman's intonation and eye can speak and play off of each other. Since The Others is not the typical horror/drama film it was able to set up its own beat that it marches to very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading opinions in this forum concerning the movie "The Others" there's a few facts I feel obligated to correct. I guess most of the people who watched this title don't know the movie IS NOT a Hollywood production. It was done before than "THE SIXTH SENSE" and therefore it's impossible that the movie would have copied the idea of "The SS".Maybe specially people used to watch typical Hollywood productions find this movie different because of lack of the over and over again repeated special effects and might consider this title disappointing. I really enjoyed it. I am not specially fan of Nicole Kidman but I must admit that her work was refined and beautiful. Amenabar did a perfect job as a director, the kids were believable, the secondary roles were done with good taste and professionalism. The photographic was excellent.If you like to watch a good movie with something different than the typical Hollywood crab, this is your choice!my points: 9/10</fullReview>

The acting is beautiful, especially the children, and the setting is great. The plot of this movie is also great. Recently this movie was on TNT almost every week and I watched it every time it was on."The Others" tells the story of a woman, named Grace(Nicole Kidman)who is waiting for her husband to come home from war. She lives with her two children who are allergic to sunlight and three servants. Throughout the story Grace's daughter Ann says she sees a ghost boy named Victor and his family moving into the house. Grace thinks Ann is making this up but soon Grace starts experiencing the ghosts, too.I am also a fan of the sixth sense and I don't think this movie is a rip off of it. I'm SURE these aren't the only two movies/stories where people find out their ghosts ever made.I really enjoyed this movie and I suggest everyone should see it. I give it 10/10 stars. This movie deserves to be on the top 250 films.(August 2004).</fullReview>

I went in thinking it would be like the sixth sense, and maybe that was a mistake, because that was a masterpiece and this, well, was not. The film isn't terrible, and I think its worth renting, and maybe it was just me, but I didn't really think it was scary or very interesting at that. I will say, however, that the ending is very well done and ALMOST makes up for the whole thing, but not quite. It just seems unbalanced, like the ending was awesome, but the rest of the film is a let down.

		<shortDescription>A Haunting Allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are fascinated by haunted houses on so many levels: For their paranormal factor, for their "scary" factor, and for the psychological symbolism with which they are filled, considering the house as the symbol of the individual persona, with its inhabitants representing the various parts of the psyche. (In Freudian terms, that would include the Id, the Ego, the Superego, etc. In Jungian terms, it would include the various "masks" we wear to accomplish our various conscious tasks, as well as our unconscious. In more generic terms, it would include the parts of our personas that are controlling, childlike, stewards, truthtellers, etc.) All of these levels are explored well in this film, which makes the film a very satisfying psychological thriller until the twist at the end. At that point, the allegory is stretched for the sake of a dramatic surprise, which for many veteran filmgoers was probably not all that surprising. I grant that it did provide a tidier, "Hollywood" ending to the film, but in allegorical terms, actually made the story sadder and creepier than it already was.For those comparing the story to *The Turn of the Screw* (or the film, "The Innocents"), the comparison to the psychological allegory is apt, although updated well from Henry James' Victorian sensibilities, which makes this a worthwhile film in and of itself. Actually any comparison to a well-done haunted-house story is bound to bear fruit, as all have the same basic psychological elements. (For example, Kubrick's version of *The Shining* can be compared also, although the gore factor was much higher in *The Shining*.)As for the comparison to *The Sixth Sense*, I see none, beyond the ability of children to see apparitions, and a twist at the end. And there are many movies that include these features, few done in such a particularly interesting and surprising way as done in *The Sixth Sense*. It stands on its own, it's an orange; this is an apple. I think some make the comparison because the films came out within a couple of years of each other, and had similar marketing campaigns. Had they come out 25 years apart, no one would think to compare them, beyond the fact that both are excellent paranormal/suspense films.As for filmmaking, other commenters have made the salient points well, I needn't repeat what has already been said about the excellent acting, lighting, cinematography, editing, and, of course, directing. For pure suspense, I recommend the fog scene. I'll say no more as I don't want to include spoilers.For those who want a mindless horror-suspense movie, look elsewhere, this ain't it. But if you enjoy a little brain candy with your entertainment, overall, this is an excellent suspense film. Just be prepared for the Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

In the middle, there was a VERY long patch where not much of anything was going on. Finally, an eight year old could have predicted the "big exciting TWIST" at the end.One good point: The creators didn't use a lot of gore to make up for the lack of imagination.

		<shortDescription>Amenabar Achieves the Impossible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films that deal with the supernatural, whether in direct or implied terms, are more often than not disappointing, in that they rarely manage to deliver on their promise. Moreover, films of that same school touted as being `scary,' as well, are usually even more of a let down; so a film that can truly bring a supernatural theme to fruition and be frightening-- joltingly scary even-- in the balance, is one to be celebrated. `The Others,' written and directed by Aleiandro Amenabar, is a film to be celebrated. Unlike most films of the genre, this is a true sojourn into regions beyond the known that actually takes you to that final destination. And when your mouth is so dry you can't swallow, and the palms of your hands have gone clammy cold with sweat, you'll know you've arrived; that Amenabar has succeeded in taking you to that place where few filmmakers dare to even attempt to go. By the end of the film, it's clear that when Amenabar makes a promise, he keeps it.The Channel Islands, 1945: World War II has ended, and in a picturesque country mansion, the mistress of the manor, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), is at the end of her tether; she has not heard from, nor about, her husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) since he went off to war, and all of her servants-- including her children's nanny-- have inexplicably disappeared without notice and without a trace. Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker. And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper. All experienced in service, they are the answer to Grace's immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately. But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping. Still, there's more: Anne insists that she has seen `others' in the house, including a young boy she calls `Victor.' And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him. The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him. Only Anne. And it's about to take Grace to the very edge of what's left of her sanity. If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of it's sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with it's own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with it's perfection. From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandora's Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here. In the quietude of the atmosphere he's so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses. He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category. Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds. Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in `Moulin Rouge' this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night. Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly. And her screen presence has never been more dynamic. She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed. A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one `in service,' and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire. It's a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film. The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor. Riveting entertainment that will slow your breathing and increase your heart rate, `The Others' is an inspired film that offers one of, if not `the' most satisfying endings ever produced in the realm of supernatural cinema. Amenabar is a magician who has performed the impossible: He's made the `Super' in supernatural viable and real, succeeding where almost all others who have tried failed. It's an awe-inspiring accomplishment from an accomplished filmmaker; and it's the magic of the movies. 10/10.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard good things about this movie and arrived full of expectation but unfortunately left thinking what a complete waste of 2 hours. The film is very slow and I was constantly waiting for something to happen but it just never does. Despite valiant efforts the film failed to create any sort of atmosphere, despite the fact it commences in almost total darkness I was very rarely on edge. To me the film appears to be a feeble attempt to recreate the affect of the sixth sense but it fails miserably. The 'twist' at the end is rather predictable and even if you do not see it coming it does not fill you with any shock, you will just be anxious to escape the cinema by that time. The only glimmer of light in this dismal production was the performance of Nicole Kidman who does carry the lead role very well, although talk of an Oscar may be a little optimistic. The film is entitled 'The Others' and I would recommend you see any of the other films available before this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very suspenseful, great performances, effective atmosphere--but the timing is way off. *** (out of fur)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OTHERS / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French: It must be difficult making a movie like "The Others," when the entire plot is based on one final twist. The filmmakers know what that twist is, and it's probably tough keeping it a secret. Take "The Sixth Sense," "The Game," or "Fight Club," for instance. The actors know they are playing character's with a special surprise in store for them, but their characters don't. The performances must stay true to the story after the final twist is revealed, but must not foreshadow what is in store for us in the final scenes.  "The Others" has another one of those endings that makes you want to see the movie again just to see if everything adds up correctly. Unfortunately, most people won't have the patience to sit through it for a second time. The film, directed, composed, and written by Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amendabar, contains a convincing atmosphere and knows how to build tension the audience can cut with a knife, but the timing is off. It makes us wait way too long for something to happen that will relieve the fog-thick suspense. The film takes place on the secluded Isle of Jersey in the final days of World War II, where a young woman awaits the return of her husband who went to war when his country needed him. Nicole Kidman plays this quiet, subtle woman, named Grace, who spends her days and night taking care of her children (James Bentley and Alakina Mann) in her gorgeous Victorian mansion. She hires a new trio of house servants to replace the crew who mysteriously disappeared. Then strange things begin to happen. Grace's daughter explains that she has been communicating with an unseen boy. At first, Grace does not believe her child, but when Grace herself starts to hear strange noises, and witness unusual events, she also questions the possibility of an intruder inside her home.  "The Others" lingers for a long time. It does get under our skin and create a strong, spooky mood, similar to that of the old-fashioned haunted house movies. The film makes us believe we are in a dark, lonely house, and that someone, or something, may be inside with us. Nicole Kidman's performance is contagious. She infects the audience with Grace's fear and suspicion. Easily one of the year's best performances, Kidman stirs the terror with a gripping, uneasy edge. The supporting actors do not steal the scenes from Kidman, she deserves the focus, but they still give her enough material to react to.  It's too bad that more doesn't happen in the movie. "The Others" eventually becomes redundant-it's scene after scene of Grace walking through dark rooms and closing the blinds to her house-her children are allergic to the light (a plot element that doesn't contribute much to the story). The film also stumbles when a specific character enters the picture-the event is highly anticipated, but the movie doesn't know what to do when it happens. It's worth seeing because of the final revelation, the spookiness of the atmosphere, and the performance by Kidman. Alejandro Amendabar must think that with a story like this, the less you reveal, the more suspenseful it is. "The Others" proves a different theory: less is not more-more is more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>phew !!! OK, my breath is back to normal, i guess. This is the second movie next to "The Ring" to scare the hell out of me. The plot and the script are awesome. The cast is good too. Nicole Kidman did fairly well. Alakina Mann (Anne Stewart) did a wonderful job. Without any special effects, the director has given an excellent movie with creepy scary scenes. Usually, I don't get scared much. So far only 3 movies had scared the hell out of me and among then comes this one. The ending was shocking and it was a really good twist. I watched this movie alone at night around 12 with lights off. I almost screamed and jumped at certain places. I felt the shock and thrill rising in my chest to the top with much rapidity. It kept me completely glued to the movie.Horror fans, if you haven't watched this movie, rent this one and watch it. You won't regret it. It's a movie worth watching. I don't want to reveal anything here. Just watch it. Get scared.And, if you get easily scared don't watch it alone at night and particularly with lights off. But, that's where the fun lies, if you dare. Beware...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre movie, overacting and an awful ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to point out how annoying it is to watch a movie where the main actress is either whispering or screaming, and hardly never talks with a normal voice. We get that she likes it quiet in the house, but it gets pretty exhausting after a while. The plot is not that complicated, but it tries to seem mystical by not uncovering any details until the end. A very annoying tendency that this director has, just like in Abre los Ojos / Vanilla Sky, which started out good, but was ruined by an ending that explained everything, and simplified the movie extremely. The movie was instantly changed from being a fairly good metaphoric movie, to a simple sci-fi flick. I felt that nothing really happened in the movie, other than when there was some dialogue, and the characters revealed a bit of their story to each other. Very disappointing, as I felt like 2/3 of the movie had been a total waste of time, as it had no influence on the story whatsoever. Why this director is so overrated, I don't understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand all the hoopla over this film being so wonderful. It is a slow moving picture, in a lot of scenes it is very obvious to me that Nicole Kidman is acting, i.e., she was not convincing, and the film didn't frighten me at all! One good thing is the fact that the film maker didn't use gory scenes throughout the picture which is a plus, even though a weak one! The stars that stand out the most in this film are Fionnula Flanagan, playing the housekeeper/nanny, in a very good performance, and the daughter played by Alakina Mann. The set designs, costumes, and cinematography were good too, but the story didn't do much for me until the ending, and even that wasn't that much of a surprise to me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that surprising or clever but still an enjoyable and effectively chilling ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are 50 doors in Grace Stewart's house and she insists each one must be locked before another is unlocked. Her two children (Anne and Nicholas) are photosensitive and the curtains must always be drawn before they enter the room. Together Grace and her two children live in constant pray that husband and father Charles will somehow return safely from the war. Into the house comes new staff ? Mr Tuttle who tends the garden, the mute Lydia and housekeeper Mrs Mills. With her mother's strict teachings and religious slant, Anne confides in Mrs Mills about her sightings of other people, where Grace would punish her for such stories. However it is not long before Grace struggles to understand the noises she hears and things she sees.This review contains no spoilers but I would question why anyone would want to know more about this film before watching it; you know the genre and knowing more can only spoil it for you albeit slightly. I'm not sure why I never got around to seeing this film in the cinema but somehow it slipped my mind and I was surprised to find it on the television recently as it only seemed that it was out recently. Anyway, needless to say I watched it and at the start was a little put out by plot points which seemed to have been a little bit obviously forced in to provide the director with devices to play with (eg the darkness, the locked doors, the silence etc) but very quickly the film made me forget any reservations I may have had. The plot is a simple ghost story that is told with confidence throughout, with a consistently subtle touch from Amenabar; to me he marked himself out as being worth watching with Abre Los Ojos and this film has only made me sure that he can produce the goods. I didn't think the conclusion was as obvious (although it isn't as shocking as it should be) as others have said and, although it hardly shocked me, it was still satisfying to me ? partly because it matched the quiet tone of the film.He plays well with the tools he has written for himself and also includes nice "fake builds" with the music and plays with our expectations to good effect. The lack of gore is a good thing and, as Japan continues to show us, sometimes unsettling juxtapositioning images can be even more effective without just sudden gore etc. I was effectively creeped out by the whole thing. Kidman is very well cast and she plays very well indeed ? bring the sense of fear to the screen and encouraging the audience to feel the same as her. The child actors avoid being too cute and cloying and are part of making the film rather chilling. Support is very good from Flanagan and Sykes, but you do have to wonder why Eccleston bothered in a role that is pointless for the vast majority of the film.Overall this is an enjoyable film that is quite chilling and is basically just a simple ghost story. There are no major scares and none of it will take you by surprise even if you don't see things coming but it does what it does well and without fuss. Some viewers will have issues with elements of it ? and rightly so, but generally it is a very effective little film that you will enjoy the less you know about it.</fullReview>

But I must say the ending was surprisingly good. The only problem is that you have to watch 90 minutes first. And for people that don't like Nicole Kidman too, that could be too much.

Now, I sit down with the remote in my hand while watching a video, volume up for dialouge, volume down for special effects.

If you can't figure out the "surprise" ending which has been done a trillion times before ('Carnival of Souls' 1962, 'Voices' 1973, an episode of 'The Twilight Zone' 1959, 'the Sixth Sense'1999, etc....) then you mustn't watch many movies. This movie is long and boring if you don't know the ending and if you are like most people and see it coming in the very beginning of the film then it is excruciating to sit through. It has been called "spooky" and "eerie" and "atmospheric" by other reviewers - but in my opinion it is over produced and in your face and at no time let me forget I was watching a movie. All I could think of was how much my ass hurt in the theater for 2 hours. Anyway - hopefully someone will read this review and dodge this bullet - or bomb I should say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>to rank among the 5 best movies made in 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"And all the other voices said: change your mind, you're always wrong" (the Cure, Other Voices, Faith, 1981).A few years ago, Alejandro Amenabar's third movie was prominent in the top 250 of IMDb. But today, it isn't there any more. That's really unfair. It largely deserved its place and to occupy it as long as possible.After, "Tesis" (1996) and "Abre Los Ojos" (1997), Amenabar goes up a notch and signs with "the Others" (2001) a masterful masterpiece which refreshes fantastic cinema and breathes new life into the theme of the haunted house. He largely deserves his nickname of "new young prodigy of Spanish cinema". With Tom Cruise, partly responsible for the production, one could fear a strong Hollywood influence in Amenabar's opus. But fortunately, it's nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, just like the great M Night Shyamalan, Alejandro Amenabar appears as a real author, on the fringe of the Hollywood industry and he's got enough character to let his style nurture. Let's hope he won't be crushed by the Hollywood machine. The movie was shot in Spain, with eventually a modest budget (17 millions of dollars) and it was a surprise to see it doing brilliantly a little everywhere in the world.Amenabar had already ventured in the dreadful world of the snuff-movies with his debut movie "Tesis" and had succeeded in mixing several films genres in one cohesive narrative line with "Abre Los Ojos". But with "the Others", one didn't suspect a real ease in the "In Camera". It's a quite dramatic change of style and in the end a successful translation in the fantastic.Amenabar's references are easy to guess. They're three cornerstones in fantastic cinema: "the Innocents" (1961), "the Haunting" (1963) and "the Sixth Sense" (1999). "The Others" can be considered as the meeting of these three opus. All the elements of the fantastic movie with Gothic nature are gathered and perfectly used. There's no shortage of examples: an austere mansion with a sinister architecture which hides a dark secret, big rooms half obscured, a mist which tends to thicken throughout the days, characters with sinister-looking faces. All these features blend themselves to create a nearly stifling universe. Moreover, Amenabar favors a calm and quite slow rhythm to play with the spectator's nerves as much as possible and we are entitled to real moments of fear. It is also interesting to write that a minimum of special effects is just enough for the director to maintain anxiety. He also weaves a more and more threatening atmosphere marked out by the progressive reversal of situation (in the beginning of the film, Nicole Kidman dominated Fionnula Flanagan but in the middle of the film, it's the contrary which happens). And, of course, like in a successful suspense movie, virtually all the obscure or ambiguous points are clarified making the story incredibly coherent and after the final conclusion (which of course, I won't reveal), the very last sequences have a strong emotional power and it would take a heart of stone to resist them. On another extent, let's also take down the omnipresence of religion, supposed to be a sort of protection for Nicole Kidman but which, in the end turns out to be useless. One can put forward that Amenabar had surely a strong catholic education and he must have lost his faith...But the qualities of "the Others" don't stop here. It is visually and technically an appealing movie with a gorgeous photography (certain images are breathtaking) and there's also a careful work on sound and the original soundtrack. On of the most important characteristics from Alejandro Amenabar is that he composes the music of his own films and her, very simply, he excels himself. The delicate and disturbing sounds we can hear contribute to reinforce the threatening atmosphere of the film and makes us feel a little more ill-at-ease again."The Others" was released when Nicole Kidman had just divorced Tom Cruise and I had thought that she gave the image of a more mature and ambitious actress. Amenabar's flick confirms it. One is really under the impression that she gives the best that she can. There's nothing to say about her role she takes with consummate skill. Her role of haughty middle-class housewife with a cold and penetrating look is sufficient to make one shudder. What is strange is that her name in the film is Grace and her hairstyle is reminiscent of Grace Kelly's. Is it a nod to the actress? Be that as it may, it would be unfair to forget the rest of the cast, especially Fionnula Flanagan who under a docile and frail appearance can easily become disturbing. At last, Amenabar made quite a creditable job of the directing of children who are, in general difficult actors to direct.A chilling and great movie from start to finish. To fully savor all lights turned off. Highly recommended. Hats off to Mr Amenabar: he is one of the main leaders of Spanish cinema and his career is starting well as the triumph of "Mar Adentro" (2004) testifies.</fullReview>

Alejandro Amenábar has done a great job as a director. The acting of the entire crew is awesome. Nicole Kidman has given her best performance till date.

		<fullReview>The Others (2001): Dir: Alejandro Amenabar / Cast: Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Elaine Cassidy, Eric Sykes: Not the great spiritual thriller that The Sixth Sense is yet it is somewhat compelling in its view of the afterlife. Nicole Kidman plays a mother whose two children are allergic to sunlight to the point where drapes are drawn at all times. She brings them up on strict Biblical teachings and hires three servants to work in the house. Two of them are elderly while the other is mute. Suddenly strange things are happening that has Kidman questioning the behaviour of her children. Intriguing with numerous twists but a climax that leaves more questions than answers. Director Alejandro Amenabar sets up suspense with a fine technique that involves lighting and shadows. Kidman holds strong as a mother questioning everything around her and set on protecting her children. Unfortunately she carries the film by herself because supporting roles aren't so lucky. Fionnula Flanagan and Elaine Cassidy plays two of the house keepers. Cassidy in particular is the mute. Christopher Eccleston plays Kidman's deceased husband who decides that appearing as a spirit is the best way to reunite. Yeah, right. Perhaps he should have fired her a written message first. Whatever. Although it doesn't always work it is a chilling ghost story about the haunting past and those who played a part in it. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The OthersThe main difference between British and American ghosts is that the English ones say Boo with the letter U.But no matter how you pronounce the exclamation in this horror movie, the end result is the same.In the wake of WWII, new servants (Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy) are hired on at the country estate of Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) to mind after her light-sensitive children (Alakina Mann, James Bentley).It's not long before the staff learns of their mistresses' mysterious migraines and her children's belief in spirits.Not until a clairvoyant comes to the manor is the truth behind the hauntings revealed.Suffused in candlelight and foreboding atmosphere, The Others is a true Gothic horror with a wholly original script and a twist ending that'll shock and depress.Parenthetically, the best way to get rid of ethereal English occupiers is with the ghosts of deceased IRA members.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

While the actors weren't terrible, or even bad, it was obvious from the start that they were just actors there to play a role. You don't get attached to any of them. Also, if an actor is going to have to fake an accent, then that actor needs to be able to pull it off. The mother was obviously trying very hard to mimic what she thought was "old south".As for scares there really were none. Everything was rather predictable.

		<fullReview>I saw The Others several years ago in the theater. It was so packed that me and my two friends had to sit separately from one another because there simply were not enough seats. The movie did not disappoint. The Others was just subtle enough to lure you into a sense of security before it through another jump at you. The music was perfect because, in most mystery/thriller types the music gives it away but in The Others you keep thinking that you know what you're getting and just when you're ready to call it a false alarm, something else comes out of the shadows. The kids are deliciously creepy and the servants make you wonder what secret the house and its occupants truly hold. I was particularly intrigued by the mute servant. Throughout the entire film I could not wait to hear what dreadful secret she possessed that would compel her to give up speech. Then the end came and I was so disappointed. Not only did the Sixth Sense literally just come out a few years before so the twist was completely played out, but the way they did it was so damn cheesy! Nicole Kidman is ripping up a piece of paper and then it cuts to a piece of paper ripping in midair in front of a séance group. The effect was lame and lazy. The whole thing was lazy. Cool, I'm glad you realized you killed your kids (which was creepy, I'll give them that) but she probably still should have been alive. Or something, I don't know. All I know is that I was let down. The rest of the movie was brilliant and the ending felt like a wrap up from a scooby doo episode. Boo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A career highlight for Kidman - but still not a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I yammer on about The Others, let's first discuss the career of one Nicole Kidman, who I consider the most over-rated actress on the planet. Sure she is attractive in a "Womanly" way, as opposed to the million "girl" actresses that burst on the scene and vanish seemingly weeks later, but her decision making when saying yes to a movie is obviously abysmal.Thanks to IMDb I can say that these are Kidman's career "highlights": - Dead Calm (My initial typo said "Dead Clam", which I hope to option and sell to Hollywood for a million bucks.) - The Others That's it. I've seen at least a dozen of her other flicks and have been underwhelmed every time. Kidman is good-looking without having that one "thing" that you remember, a good actress without ever being the most interesting character in any movie that she is in, yet she is critically lauded and extremely well paid.Another thing: I am Australian and realise this is almost slanderous that I am fully bagging a fellow Australian success story, but it needs to be said that NICOLE KIDMAN IS INCREDIBLY OVERRATED.Late addition: I subsequently checked out Rotten Tomatoes and found that Dead Calm and The Others are 2 of her higher ranked flicks, followed by Eyes Wide Shut, which I have seen but thought was nowhere near as good as it was made out to be.So back to The Others, which after my rant is actually pretty good, more thanks to the simplicity of the story than anything Kidman does though.Set in post-WW2 on a British island, Kidman plays a mother of 2 young kids named Grace living in a massive isolated manor that is seemingly eternally surrounded by fog. Her husband Charlie, was a soldier in the war and hasn't been heard from for some time - perhaps already dead. Her 2 kids are around 4 and 7, the younger a boy named Nicholas and the older a sister named Ann.Grace is understandably very protective of her two children, who apparently have an allergy to natural light (read sunshine), and must remain indoors during the day and behind thick drawn curtains. In fact Grace locks every room behind her to make sure they don't wander out, something that is a bit of a contrived plot device in retrospect.So one day three strangers roll up unannounced at the front door, Grace assumes that they have answered an ad offering work and employs them all instantly.They are: Mr Tuttle ? Gardener/Handyman, perhaps 60. Mrs Mills ? Nanny/Cook, also about 60. And Lydia ? Maid, around 30 ish and a mute.Grace explains that her previous help vanished, and she takes great pains going through the rules regarding her children to Lydia and Mrs Mills.So one day Grace hears a crying child and immediately assumes it is one of hers. Nuh-huh, they are both OK. Ann blames some other kid named Victor who Grace has never heard of so she punishes Ann for the perceived lie. After mutterings, random noises and scuttling upstairs, it seems evident that someone else is in the house, and after questioning Ann matter of factly explains that there are in fact 4 others including the afore-mentioned Victor.Of course Grace being proper and rational initially doesn't embrace this idea, only as the usual evidence of self closing and opening doors, footsteps, unmanned pianos that play and random voices sorta changes her tune somewhat. She demands that the three servants search the home and grounds for evidence.A bit of an odd turn of events happens about half way through that I won't ruin (though it makes little if any sense), Grace decides to go for help through the fog, but eds up becoming disoriented and lost, until she finds?..Again I can't say, but it does seem that the hired help know more than they are letting on, and that again someone else is in the house. Aside from Mrs Mills, the help seem to be around more to give the audience and Grace someone to be suspicious of, as elsewise she would be largely jumping at shadows.The Others finishes with a decent turn of events that makes sense given what precedes it, but unlike The Sixth Sense it does not reward repeat viewings for some reason. I had far fonder memories of this film from when I initially saw it in the early part of the decade than after watching it the other night. In essence I realised that it was a film with one scare, that wasn't really scary anyway, and two revelations that are both OK, but once you know 'em you know 'em. There is little joy in revisiting this flick.However? It does contain one of the (inadvertently I think) funniest lines in film history. Grace is once again seriously discussing things with her kids and in an attempt to comfort Nicholas says: "You'll never go to war.", to which Nicholas in typical 4 year old fashion replies "We never go anywhere." Dunno why, but it cracked me up enough to rewind it twice.Final Rating ? 6.5 / 10. This is worth seeing the first time, but if you've seen it before don't ruin any positive memories by watching it again.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

Nothing much happens through most of the film and the pacing is excruciatingly slow. One can sense a twist coming at the end, but the end can't come soon enough. When it comes, the twist turns out to be fairly clever, but the payoff is not worth the time spent getting there. Kidman's performance is very mannered initially and over the top later. Flanagan is quite striking as the old maid. Basically, the film has a good premise but the execution leaves much to be desired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A marvelously atmospheric ghost story starring Nicole Kidman as a mother of two children who becomes convinced that her house is haunted.The film is part "The Innocents," the wonderful and overlooked Deborah Kerr film from 1961, and part "The Sixth Sense," the film that pretty much set the standard for twist endings, but it's fresh and original enough to stand on its own without having to bear comparison to other films. It boasts an impressive twist ending of its own, which I maybe should have seen coming but didn't. But it also knows that a twist ending is only as good as the movie around it, and it's used to enhance the film's story, not as a crutch.Nicole Kidman gives a terrific performance, one of two that got her attention in 2001 (the other being "Moulin Rouge!").Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal favorite. Supernatural drama/horror done right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We must all learn to live together...the living and the dead."I remember first seeing this back in high school, and I'm still almost as impressed with it today as I was back then. It came out at a time when there hadn't been many other movies quite like it, and it goes way beyond the average horror movie in both concept and polish. The Others doesn't rely on constant jump scares, buckets of gore, or violence. Its originality, understated performances, and focus on atmosphere are the reasons why I enjoy it so much. Every character is ominous and unsettling in their own way, and every event has a hidden meaning. Those are also the reasons why it still holds up so well, when many other supernatural movies lose their luster after the first viewing. &nbsp;The plot is as novel as modern ghost stories come. There's several very creepy moments, and they're thankfully explained by the revelations of the movie, instead of eliminated by them. This is my favorite Nicole Kidman movie, and one of my favorite supernatural movies, period. It makes me wish that period ghost movies were made more often, they're a nice change of pace from those set in modern times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman stars in the supernatural thriller, The Others. The others succeeds in everything it tires in: It's creepy, smart, incredibly entertaining, and at the end of the day it actually makes sense.Kidman is terrific as Grace, a mother living in the 30's. She lives in a mansion with her two children, who have a skin disorder, and is single do to her husband being in the war. Things start to get pretty wild when three servants arrive at their house. Things involving the paranormal. and they begin to make Grace look crazy. But as it turns out, nothing and nobody is what it seems.The Others is a extremely creepy and engaging thriller. It's a thriller that delivers what it's supposed to: the thrills, the scares. Nicole Kidman's performance is terrific. One of her best. I can't believe it took me this long to see this movie. The statement just about to be used is going to be used: It had the same effect on me that The Strangers had.This film is a breath of fresh air. It like lots of thrillers has a great twist. For once, a twist that you won't see coming. M Night Shamalyn used to have the thrilling touch. But not anymore. This seems like his kind of movie. But he hasn't done a good film in about eight years, so I don't think he's good enough for this movie.Recently i've been reviewing movies that i've missed out on. I don't know how I missed out on this one. The Others is a brilliant film.If you haven't seen it, you got to. It's almost better than M. Night Shamalyn's Unbreakable and Signs. Though most people won't agree with those. They'd choose The Sixth sense. I think that movie is overrated, but it's more similar to this one, Thumbs way up.The Others: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Movie, However Not As Good As Said In Some Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The others was a good movie, showed fantastic settings, methods and story line towards the beginning however failed to impress with the ending. It was a decent twist however reading certain reviews and seeing in books and researching the movie online i expected so much more. The whole atmosphere of the film was terrific and it was perfectly set, Nicole Kidman was awesome as per usual and most acting was impressive, and saying this you may wonder how in my right mind could i say this movie wasn't living up to expectations when i am giving it so many compliments. But for me it just did not deliver, and i am sad to say so, i was looking forward to it, however for it to be named one of the best horror movies ever on several sites it unbelievable and ridiculous. However it is a decent movie and i would recommend people to see it, however if you are going to do so, watch the movie open minded and forget the opinions of critics who live this movie to be one of the greatest because you maybe, like myself, disappointed.</fullReview>

All the characters in this movie have done great from the gardener, his wife and daughter, to the kids and the husband who shows up in two scenes only. Nicole Kidman , there is nothing to say about her flawless performance in this one and I believe she already matured in her works starting Hours, playing virginia woolf and moulin rouge and others but she is really at her best in The Others.The movie has a very catching atmosphere and the house decoration is just brilliant. The movie tells you in many scenes that you are watching the work of a good director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar is among the brightest young filmmakers today. Though he has ridiculously been labeled, by some, as the next Pedro Almodovar, Amenábar surpasses Almodovar because he gives his all to a film and always stays true to the story rather than succumbing to meet studio standards. Amenábar is a passionate filmmaker. He really seems to believe in his work. His talents are not limited to directing as he is a successful screenwriter and music director too.'The Others' is his first Hollywood movie and yet there is treated in a non-Hollywood way. In this day and age when special effects like CGI are used in every film, Amenábar goes the old fashioned way and perhaps the only bit of 'contemporary special effects' he uses is the green-screening. In an interview, he once mentioned that the expressions he has drawn from Nicole Kidman's eyes are much better than what any special effects could have done and this is actually quite true.'The Others' is an atmospheric film. The director is clearly influenced by the likes of Kubrick. He succeeds wonderfully in creating a gloomy and chilling atmosphere using lots of subtlety. Lighting plays a key role both metaphorically and literally. Most of the scenes are either set in full daylight or sheer darkness. The noteworthy cinematography brings out the claustrophobia and loneliness and the breathtaking score adds to the spookiness.Often compared to 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Others' goes steps further with its subtle multilayered storytelling. It is much more than just a horror film because there is plenty of psychology and philosophy included in the story. Amenábar has written a solid screenplay with intriguing and thought-provoking dialogue.'The Others' is further blessed with remarkable performances. Fionnula Flanagan is terrific as the suspiciously creepy servant with a hidden agenda. Eric Sykes brings some humour to lighten up the very intense atmosphere. Elaine Cassidy too impresses with a subtle performance. Alakina Mann and James Bentley are awesome as the bratty mean sister and the scared little brother respectively. Christopher Eccleston too is very effective in a small role. However, it goes without saying, that top honour goes to Nicole Kidman. Kidman is sublime. The intensity with which she displays Grace's despair, fragility, anguish and maternal dedication is astonishing. It is a marvelous performance.'The Others' may arguably be the best in 'horror' movies but it will be wrong to classify it in a specific genre because it works on so many levels. It is an absorbing film experience and something that has worked for me even after multiple viewings. I have lost count of how many times I have seen this amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really much horror or mystery in this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It entertained for the most part, granted it was rather easy to figure out the twist to this one. That may have more to do with the movie "The Sixth Sense", because thanks to that movie one tends to be looking for a possible twist especially when reviews talk about the shocking ending or what not. This movie has a lady and her two children living in a very big house where one day a group of three mysterious strangers comes and offers their services. Well the mother accepts and so starts the spooky going ons and such that accompany all such films as these. For the most part they are minor stuff here and there. Apparently the daughter suffers from some disease and must stay out of the sunlight, yet the shades set up keep coming down. There are other strange happenings and a strange visit by the father who for some reason comes and goes in very strange and mysterious fashion. Then there are scenes where the girl is seemingly possessed which are quite nice. Still the movie was somewhat disappointing, it is one of those horror/suspense films that is a bit to talky for my tastes and one of the films to start the current trend of PG-13 rated horror films. It also has Nicole Kidman in the lead and I have never been a big fan of hers, as she was one of the worst lead actresses in a Batman movie besides nearly everyone involved in part four. However, I will say this is one of the better roles I have seen her in. I may have found this movie entertaining if we can go back to a day where the surprise ending is not advertised in the trailers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appropriately gloomy...still, somewhat unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director Alejandro Amenábar has visual imagination and panache to spare, yet his screenplay about a woman and her two sick children living in a gloomy mansion in the Channel Islands in 1945 doesn't offer many new tricks in the haunted house genre (even the colorless title tells you that). Nicole Kidman is initially imposing and impenetrable as the proprietress of the manor who can't seem to explain the absence of her husband, and who keeps her precocious kids out of the sun because they're allergic to ultra-violet light. Kidman is one of the best actresses we have working today; her film selections continue to be intriguing, she isn't afraid to take risks (which is clear with her work here), and she's at times very lovely to watch. Fionnula Flanagan is also flawless as the new housekeeper who has arrived mysteriously (with a mute assistant and a gardener in tow) after the previous staff has vanished into the night. All the performers excel with this material, however the shuddery scenario is stuffed with red herrings that only serve to weigh down the ultimate explanation. Amenábar stages a spooky scene near the end in a graveyard, but he's less successful at paring down the dross and giving the viewer a really good fright (instead, a piano playing at night drives Kidman into hysterics, and her taunting daughter teases her endlessly with facetious comments). The picture may work well on a first viewing, but it isn't a story that holds up a second time, despite first-rate work from everyone involved. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly predictable but well produced classic ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is a predictable (I guessed the dénouement from the basic premise) ghost story which is saved by top-notch performances from the cast and solid production values.Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a very cold and unsympathetic character. It's a brave choice for Kidman and she's excellent in the part. She's joined by a great cast including Christopher Eccleston, Eric Sykes and Fionnula Flanagan.There are a few tame scares but this is a classic-style ghost story and more traditional fare than Asian offerings such as "Ringu".7 out of 10. Good but not great, this is a somewhat drawn-out affair with something of an unsurprising outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully Spooky, Old-Fashioned Ghost Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is an excellent blend of suspense, horror, and mystery. It has a great story, some great acting, and I thought it was pretty scary. But you have to like ghost stories to enjoy this. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a mother who lives in a dark, old island mansion in the 1940's, with her two children, Anne and Nicholas, who are allergic to the sunlight. After some servants arrive to their darkened home, strange events begin to plague Grace and her children. As things get stranger and stranger, Grace becomes convinced that her home is haunted, and she begins to suspect something strange about the servants. Is the house really haunted? Or is there something even more disturbing going on? Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar brings this delightfully eerie ghost picture to the screen, in the vein of Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller, "The Innocents", and Robert Wise's "The Haunting". The story is nicely crafted here, and while the similarities between this and "The Innocents" are obvious, "The Others" is definitely it's own movie. Fans of slow-going, old-fashioned horror films will love this, because of the steady pacing that still manages to send chills up the spine. It's a bit of a slow film in the beginning, but things do pick up, and there is plenty going on in the meantime to keep the audience intrigued. The entire movie is done in the style of those classic haunted house stories we know. A very dark and Gothic atmosphere is prevalent as well, and director Amenabar captures some very eerie images and some excellently-constructed scare sequences. As for the twist-ending, I have to give some major credit for it. I never saw it coming, and it fit the story perfectly, completely reversing whatever ideas you had about the film. The acting is also great, Nicole Kidman plays her role as the eccentric mother perfectly, and Fionnula Flanagan plays one of the kindly new servants to the household nicely, as do the rest of them. And the children playing Kidman's son and daughter were also very remarkable in their roles.Overall, "The Others" is a classy and Gothic ghost story, reminiscent of those haunted-house classics we all remember. This film sets up an intense atmosphere - very dark, subtle, and old-fashioned. I enjoyed it. If you like this kind of movie, surely see it, you won't be disappointed. "The Others" is a great example of what a genuinely good ghost story should be like. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works hard, but worth it in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar's film 'The Others' is in some senses a straightforward copy of 'The Sixth Sense' (with a nod to 'The Shining' added in for good measure). We are introduced to characters who bear witness to ghosts but whose own life is strangely disconnected from the world around them: the punchline is that they themselves are among the dead, only they have not yet acknowledged it. The formal structure of this revelation is more satisfying in 'The Others', it's still well signposted but there's a symmetry in the relationship between the ghosts and the living that is shocking and pleasing at the same time. The film also lacks the pompousness of M. Night Shyalaman's film, and works as a genuinely creepy horror movie despite almost the complete absence of special effects. What doesn't quite work is Nicole Kidman's central character, the woman who is dead but doesn't know it: her behaviour when she (and we) believe she is still living is apparently so batty that it's hard to relate to the story; while the eventual role reversal is handled with great skill, the earlier form of the tale (an apparently conventional ghost story) works far less well (for reasons that we eventually understand when the tables are turned). In consequence, I would say this is a genuinely spine-tingling movie with a great ending; but not a great movie overall, one that seems less silly in retrospect than it does when you're actually watching it. Both it and 'The Sixth Sense' demonstrate that this sort of trickery can work if handled with sufficient skill, but neither film completely succeeds in hiding the forcing of the plot needed to make it happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kidman gives a good performance as do all the other cast. It is a change to see a spooky movie without loads of Digital Effects and just with good acting and music. It confirms the old saying that the most frightening things are the things we can't see. I won't say what the ending was but there was a ghost story on ITV television about 25 years ago with the same title and the same basic story, though with less actors. I can't find it on the IMDb but it was very highly praised at the time. I doubt if any recording exists of it now so it must be coincidence that this movies has the same plot and title. I recall the same can be said of Topsy Turvy which was almost exactly the same as a TV play about G&amp;S about thirty years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who on earth is Alejandro Amena'bar? A distant Spanish relative of M.Knight's? Anyway you slice it, this guy can make one creepy movie. I'll admit, I'm a sucker for ghost stories, but good ones are few and far between. The Other's, is a period piece set in world war one England, filmed in a very quiet, dark setting with more bumps in the night then you can shake a creepy kid at. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman)is a soldier's wife, taking care of their tranquil castle and even more tranquil kids, while hubby is off at war. Add a creepy group of servants and what you have is some spooky (Good Lord, don't go in there) kind of fun. One of the best features that I learned about the film after viewing it a few times is that almost all the dialog is spoken very soft, a whisper in some scenes, this forces you to turn up the volume, and in turn, when something scary happens (see where I'm going with this?), your t.v. is cranked and jump straight out of your chair (cool stuff). I certainly hope that Amena'bar does another English film, because I was never very good in Spanish class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I spent the first half of "The Others" ticking off how it was similar to Hitchcock's "Rebecca" -- yeah, another isolated foggy Gothic mansion with secrets, another spooky, possibly crazy housekeeper, another high-strung lady of the house, and that this movie could also have been made in the late '40's.I got intrigued that first Nicole Kidman's character is sympathetic, then she's annoying, then a martinet, then sympathetic again (and looking great in close-fitting 1940's styles such that we should all have personal tailors like that, whew), in a fine performance as she carries the whole beautiful-looking movie.Then I tried to figure out what was really going on, started to pick up hints, got annoyed that some characters weren't giving us enough tips, tried to guess, got fooled by some things and appreciated what my friend spotted, and then just let myself go to the love-to-get-scared in all of us. The ending completely won me over. Much post-viewing discussion with my friend on the clues, if and how they added up, and what was significant.Like with "The Sixth Sense," don't read any spoilers!

		<fullReview>Though we see the family of three is very knowledgeable in the bible, by the end of the film we see that the mother loses faith in what she has devoted her entire life to. After taking the life of her children and her own, she believes that God has given her another chance when she pulls the trigger and she is still standing there. In the end, when she comes to the realization with the fact that she is a ghost, she is confused about the existence of God. It is our opinion that she loses the belief that there ever was a supreme being. There is no explanation as to why this has happened to them. One of the last lines in the story is the housekeeper saying that the mute girl's last lines were "What now?" We feel that Grace came to realize that there is no God. She has come to the finalized thought that she is to live in that house, their house.This is why we recommend this story. It is a story that could appeal to any type of audience that like suspense, mystery, question of beliefs or just have some time to spare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw that film, I was thrilled to see a motion picture that did not require much special effects to be captivating. The ensemble of the cast is quite convincing, especially for Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan as the mother and maid servant.What I especially liked was the feeling of unsettlement caused by the fact the story took place in a mansion in Europe during WWII, the style of photography, the sound effects, the eeriness of the two maid servants and the gardener. The fact that the children suffer from a skin disease that prohibits them from strong light exposure darkens the essence of the film.That film carries a flaw though. For those of you who have seen The Changeling, you will probably find the séance in both films are quite alike. The catch is The Changeling was released sometime around 1979 - 1980. When I watched The Others, it felt like watching The Changeling... only this time... seen from the "other side".I must admit that, on the whole, I liked that movie enough to buy the two-disk DVD edition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Others", starring Nicole Kidman, sustains its classic horror setting without being super formulatic (though at times it is). It has a brilliant surprise ending, but some people may not understand it the first time watching.Grace Stewart (Kidman) is a stressed-out and enormously religious English housewife whose husband has gone off to fight in the war (I think it's World War 1). Her children are allergic to sunlight, and can only live by candlelight. The family lives in an enormous, evil-looking mansion on an English island, where it's always foggy and huge black gates protect the sizable estate. The house looms over the grounds, and - huge surprise! - there's a small cemetery in the back. Now who would guessed - a horror movie? With a cemetery?!!!! Anyways, Grace hires a crew to tutor the kids and be general servants. It's an odd crew, featuring a witch-like elderly lady, an equally wicked-seeming gardener, and a timid servant girl who never speaks a word (this part is awkwardly played by the actress). Once the crew is hired, strange things start to happen - including a stupendously filmed scene involving a forbidden piano playing in the night. Grace connects the bizarre happenings with the ever-odd crew, whose eccentricity seems to be growing with the surreality.Despite some awkward acting and horror movie deja vu, this is an amazing movie that will scare you long after you finish watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Other's" is an entertaining yet somewhat misleading movie; billing it as a horror movie is just wrong. That isn't to say that the movie didn't possess elements of the genre, just that enough of them simply weren't present. The movie's setting is very moody, and the fact that it takes place entirely in a relatively dark area makes the suspense level rise incredibly, and the direction is enough to keep you on your toes. The cast isn't one filled with big names - save Nicole Kidman - but the characters don't exactly need to be deep to fit the part. Kidman's performance was good, but seemed a little eccentric and dragged out during most of the scenes.All in all, the movie is more of a suspense thriller; it does deal with ghosts, but not in a conventional sense by any means. The story is the kind that takes a few unexpected twists, which does help to make the movie what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ghost Story of the Old School</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the success of The Exorcist and similar films in the seventies, serious horror films (as opposed to the tongue-in-cheek variety) have normally been overstated. By this I mean that such films have been dominated by special effects, with plenty of blood and gore and everything shown explicitly. Before that, however,there was a tradition of making more subtle, understated horror films, where the horror is implied rather than shown directly. Examples that come to mind are The Spiral Staircase and the original versions of Cat People and The Haunting.Although it is a recent film, The Others falls within this earlier tradition. It is set on Jersey in 1945, shortly after the liberation of the island from Nazi occupation. Grace Stewart lives in an old manor house with her young son and daughter. The two children suffer from a rare allergy to sunlight, which means that they cannot go outside but must stay indoors in darkened rooms. Grace's husband, who was fighting with the British Army, is missing, presumed killed. The children begin to believe that the house is haunted by the ghosts of an old woman, a married couple and a boy named Victor. At first Grace does not believe them; she is a devout and strict Roman Catholic, who dismisses belief in ghosts as superstitious. The strain of living in such a lonely, gloomy house and her worries about her missing husband and her children's health, however, are beginning to tell on Grace's mind. The strange behaviour of the three servants she has engaged is another source of worry for her, and she starts to wonder whether there might be something behind the children's stories.The film ends with a sudden, shocking twist (which I will not reveal). I have read in other comments on this board, and elsewhere, that the twist is an obvious one which anyone can see coming. I suppose that it might be obvious to real horror film buffs; all I can say is that it certainly took me by surprise. Too often a surprise ending merely serves to show off the scriptwriter's cleverness, without any thought being give to the film's internal coherence, but in the case of The Others, although the twist was unexpected, I found the film had a satisfying ending that made sense in the context of what had gone before.Establishing a suitably eerie atmosphere is an important factor in the success of a horror film, and The Others is extremely atmospheric. The film was shot in a rambling old house (actually in Spain, although it looks very English). For most of the time we see the house shrouded in dense mist. The children's rare illness, as well as being relevant to the plot, also serves as a device which enables the director to ensure that most of the interior scenes, even daytime ones, are suitably gloomy. Light only enters the house at the end, when the mysterious housekeeper opens the blinds against Grace's strict instructions. This development leads straight into the surprise denouement; the physical light of day and the metaphorical light of truth enter the house at the same time.There are some effective performances, especially from Nicole Kidman as Grace. Grace, who starts off as a strict, authoritarian parent and gradually becomes more and more disturbed, is portrayed as that very dangerous type of individual, the control freak who is losing control. There are a number of holes in the plot; it is never, for example, explained how Grace's husband managed to escape from the German-ruled island to join the British forces. The sudden reappearance of the husband halfway through does not really add much to the film. Overall, however, I found this an impressive and genuinely frightening ghost story; proof that, even in the twenty-first century, one can still make an effective horror film without resorting to explicit violence or stomach-churning special effects. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great, ghost flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first learned of The Others when I saw a trailer for this movie when I went to the theater to see Scary Movie 2 in summer 2001. I have long been interested in the supernatural and ghosts/haunted places so I was pumped up for the release of The Others.However, I must say that the trailer for the others gives the false impression that the film is much scarier than it actually is. I asked two females to go to the theater with me to see it, and both declined on the grounds that the movie just seemed to scary for them. I watched it alone in the theater, and overall I think it was a pretty good movie - it just didn't deliver the bone-chilling terror that the trailer leads you into believing.The positives about The Others include Nicole Kidman, who gives a good performance as a strong-willed and over-bearing, religious mother, the setting (a Gothic mansion in the dense fog of the English countryside), and the ending - which caught me off guard and really made me think about this life and the afterlife for several days afterwards. All in all, I think this movie was designed to critique religious doctrine or to make people question their own beliefs about religion and the afterlife.There are a few decent scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat. One in particular made me jump out my seat in the theater - when Ann and Nicholas open the closet door and...well, if you've seen the movie you know exactly which scene I am referring to.Overall it's not a bad film to watch if you are interested in gaining a new perspective on the afterlife, ghosts, or spirits. It's a good film, but not great - not enough scares or terror is present. I would give it 7.5 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a hard movie to make, because there are not lots of characters, and it all happened in the same place.Nicole Kidman did a great job of showing fear, catching my attention. and the end result is totally unexpected. Even though it has the essence of many previous films, such as the Sixth sense, this one is also different in the storyline and in the way it elicits fears in me.Unlike some other movies, this movie provides clues that you can only understand after the end of the movie. it was a suspense movie well done. I simply can't tell who is the ghost, and who is not.But I have to say that one time watching is enough for this film. Unlike some other big dramas, it probably lacks the emotional value that can lure you to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt scared through most of the film, I loved the film for many reasons, and don't feel relevance in deciding whether it's Drama, horror, suspense, whatever. I feel it's all of these and will depend on what you get from a film. The Others had chilling acting, but not once did I imagine anything of how it would end, I just felt completely gripped throughout. The children, I thought were fantastic and I also loved Mrs Mills, she did give me an uneasy feeling, but now I know why. It had the same impact that these films usually have on me, where I'm terrified to leave the room or walk into a room without the light on. The way you feel when you are a child, but that still stays with me watching a film like "The Others".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been a while since I saw a good ghost story when I saw the preview of this film. Unfortunately,I never got a chance to see this in a theater. When I saw it(in a hotel room with pay per view on vacation),I was so thrilled. I just loved the way it just moves along..a deep dread that you can't see. Something is just not right..is there possibly a ghost lurking somewhere in Kidman's villa. Are her kids safe? The film has a good creepy story and great atmosphere. Kidman is excellent as a woman who doesn't appear to be over the disappearance of her husband to a war and how her children are possibly seeing ghosts. The film is like "The Blair Witch Project" in the way it doesn't show you the haunting predator..you know something is not right and your kept guessing all the way to the end. In most films of this genre, as well as the horror genre in general,seem to have the ending that collapses the entire story. This film has one of those marvelous endings that you can't seem to get over. When I saw it,I thought about it for the next couple days. It has a special way that moved me and kept me on the edge the entire time. The story is always unpredictable and the acting is excellent. A rewarding viewing experience. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Haunted House movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haunted house movies usually come in two categories: really good or really bad. In the latter are films like The Amityville Horror, and in the former I would add this movie along side classics such as The Haunting (the original).This is not a film for those with a nervous disposition. Hailed as the next Sixth Sense, a comparison that that is perhaps a little unfair, this movie will have you trembling in your seats and spilling your popcorn.Nicole Kidman stars as a mother trying to cope with bringing up two children in a large house on Jersey in 1945, still waiting for news of her long absent husband. Soon after the arrival of three new staff, strange things start to occur... If I told you any more of the plot it would spoil it. This is definitely one film where the least you know before hand the better. All I will say that it represents everything that is good about film; there is no swearing, gratuitous violence or nudity. Instead there is suspense and a great deal left to the imagination. I would certainly say it was suitable for anyone 12 or over that doesn't mind being frightened out of their wits!This film deserves to become a classic, and hopefully it will be allowed to shine on its own merits, and not draw too many comparisons with Sixth Sense or Others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well acted movie with an intriguing plot but too slow moving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a reasonably good movie that did not remind me of Sixth Sense as it did others but had it's own unique premise. I found the cinematography to be absolutely breathtaking, the atmosphere mysterious, and the Ghost Story intriguing. Also Nicole Kidman was every bit as good if not better in this then she was in Moulon Rouge so I don't know why she did not get an Oscar nomination. Anyway....In spite of all the positives-I didn't LIKE the movie all that much-oh it was all right, it was I suppose a 6, maybe a 6.5 but not much more. The movie had 2 major flaws in my mind and kept the film from being truly great.1)WAY TOO slow going-after awhile you stop being interested and become simply impatient-as interesting as the central plot is, how many times can children gasp and Nicole Kidman look scared until the audience loses their patience? Which brings me to:2)The type of scare tactics used. SPOILER ALERT: Oh me Oh my-WAY TOO MUCH-doors that open by themselves,scary music, cliché cliché Cliché-it's to bad-watching this all I could think at times was how Redundant they were making it-there should have been more Truly frightening scenes like The daughter changing shape and when Nicole and the kids realize their dead and the table starts shaking and the camera shows them yelling and....their is NOBODY there! Awesome! Scary too! Alas, too much time was wasted on creaky noises and people saying "who's there?"So I'd have to say The Others is an OK movie but not a classic. I feel Sixth Sense was actually a much better movie. But this performance from Nicole was outstanding and up there as one of her best.</fullReview>

The acting here is impeccable, the storyline at first highly original and unpredictable.The first sign of this being a clunker is when we are telegraphed with a sledgehammer that THERE IS SOMETHING 'WRONG' OR EVIL ABOUT THE HIRED HELP....mimicking to many episodes of the Twilight Zone... The film then loses it center of gravity, as it degenerates, literally into BEETLEJUICE meets THE SIXTH SENSE.What I suspect(or hope) is that the director had a little gem of a film here, but that wasnt good enuff for the WEINSTEIN brothers, who saw a way to cash in on the "twist-ending" horror phase, so in order to get the film made-it had to be 'tinkered' with-something they are notorious at doing to small, art or foreign films in order to "Hollywood-ize" them for American consumption...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been an excellent horror film. The premise is good and the performances are good and the house is right. But the way the whole thing is played out simply does not work. Everything is delivered in a kind of heap at the end. What is worse is that despite a sudden insight into our characters, we don't see any motivation in their earlier behavior. What should have been the scariest part of the movie just lets you down. During the movie, there are many scenes that tended to plod along. Looking back it seemed as though these were to be places where characters were supposed to create some tension for the final moment. But we don't see it and the whole thing sags over the finish line. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be brief with this one. First of all, I thing that one is pretty much over rated. To me "The Ring" is a better horror, creepy, scary movie than "The Others." I will not compare the latter one with "The Sixth Sense" for the unquestionable superiority of the Shyamalan's masterpiece. Secondly, if you remove the whole screaming and crying there will be nothing much left to scary you. Thirdly, everything was unfolding toooo slow. Endless dialogues and needless scenes in order to extend the running time.Nevertheless, taking into consideration that even though done with virtually no special effects (which is not what you'd expect hearing about a movie dealing with a creepy house and ghosts) it managed to keep the tension; together with the very good performance from the entire cast and especially the little girl (Alakina Mann), kind of save the film. The twisted end also worked for me - I didn't see it coming (probably, I was too bored with the slow pace to expect anything). I guess I would recommend this movie to all those who like creepy suspense films with twisted endings-well, not recommend but more like suggest to try to see. I hope you won't be disappointed. 6.5 stars out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely overrated by the critics. This movie may be a masterpiece in comparison with most gore movies with liters on blood shed on every plan, but apart from that, it is quite dull and finally not so thrilling. Remove the "sudden noise" effects that make us jump a little, and you'll discover that there is nothing left to scare us. In what the plot itself is concerned, it has a taste of "déj? vu" (the sixth sense, abre los ojos - from the same director -, el arte de morir - another spanish movie -....). So, how long will this kind of plots surprise us, really ?. If you really want to be stuck to your chair with thrill and atmosphere, watch "Gaslight", a movie which is considered as a reference for this one. It was shot by George Cukor in 1944 and this is a masterpiece ! And you'll find by watching this old stuff that Ingrid Bergmann is far better than the "continually half-opened mouth" Nicole Kidman.</fullReview>

Kudos to the supporting cast for crafting strong performances out of paper-thin material, particularly the underrated Fionnula Flanagan. Their fine work, however, will not alleviate the viewer's growing frustration and boredom with this piece. Its director shamelessly rips off every suspense classic from "The Uninvited" and "The Haunting" to "The Innocents" and "The Sixth Sense", but does so without skill or coherence. By the time the "surprise ending" rolls around, you'll be groaning louder than a house full of restless spirits--over your wasted time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't into to too much detail because there isn't really a plot as such. Basically we have a 30 minutes Twilight Zone episode dragged out into one full-length motion picture.That is not to say that it's badly made, it's not. The acting all round is very good, the atmosphere and direction are fine. It's just the story is really just 10 minutes at the end of the film. All the rest of the film is rather pointless and boring.The film was made even more uninteresting by me predicting the twist in about the first 10 minutes of the film. I'm actually surprised more people didn't. After seeing Sixth Sense and any sci-fi film I always question everything. Are they really there, have they gone back/forward in time, etc. When they showed the first scene with Victor, immediately the thought that they actually might be the ghosts, popped into my head. Of course when she meets the husband, the game is up. He's dead, so she must be dead, plus the fog of course. Then I was just waiting for the end.Well acted and well made, but ultimately boring and dull. ? 3/10.BTW ? There weren't living in England, they were living in the Channel Islands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over Hyped but interesting - the "Fifth Sense and a half"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very much looking forward to viewing this film, but whereas, I was completely duped by the "Sixth Sense", I could more or less guess the ending of this one ........ once you've got used to this sort of thing. The "Sixth Sense", on a second viewing turns out to be absolutely flawless from beginning to end, in "The Others", there are several illogicalities. I am not comparing the two films because their stories are the same, but the have one important common point, and that is quite simply, the plots in both case are seen from the point of view, if you like of departed souls ( Willis and Kidman ). If you've seen the Sixth Sense and been taken in by it, you can, if you have a minimum of intelligence, guess that the "prémice de départ" so to speak is that of someone who has passed on and so won't be taken in by this one. If you have not seen " Sixth Sense, then the world's your oyster. Cinematographically beautiful, and Kidman delivers a magnificent performance, but all that continuous fog and gloom does get on your nerves after a while - and the costumes and accents of the three servants more or less give the game away that they are from another time. Now why does the husband suddenly turn up and then depart again the next day - there's a good question for you !! The so called surprise ending is perhaps a little sudden and late in the film to have a maximum effect one feels almost "this has got to come to an end so let's get on with it and finish the thing off" so to speak. In the Sixth Sense, I was totally taken aback when cat was let out of bag. If I'd been a mouse watching the film, I'd have been eaten up quicker than a lump of cheese ! As far as the DVD goes, what a shame the packing we have, on the version we have in France at least is so pathetic, when you take off the plastic wrapping, the whole thing falls apart in your hands and the discs fly everywhere !! Hopefully it's better in other countries ! Anyway I'll view the film in a couple of months again and maybe revise my opinion !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There is something in this house... something diabolique... something... that is not at rest."With these words, you know you've run into a good, elegant thriller/drama, starring Nicole Kidman. Yes... you've run into "The Others." Although the total effect this movie has, I think the particular standout in the movie would be the main star: Nicole Kidman as Grace.Amazing. That's the word I'd use while describing Nicole Kidman. Absolutely fantastic... amazing. She is the single most talented actress of the 20th and 21st century, besides the beautiful Grace Kelly.No. Even better: Nicole Kidman is the Grace Kelly of today's Hollywood world. She is truly unforgettable in any role that she portrays, at all. Whether it be the spooky teacher in "To Die For", or as an 'whore' in "Moulin Rouge" (which she was nominated for an Oscar this year), or as a Russian 'spy' in "Birthday Girl." She is truly a "wow" of our time.But now to "The Others." This movie really hit me as one of the most wonderfully ever produced thrillers ever seen on the silver screen. It really, is truly, awesome. And what makes it awesome? Nicole Kidman. Flat out, she should've at LEAST been nominated for the Oscar this year for her flawless performance as Grace, the spine-tingling mother who is on the edge, every moment she's on the screen.It's the aftermath of World War II. The Nazis have been beaten and controlled. Grace is haunted from the fact that her husband went off to war and never returned.To top it off, she has two children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a serious, deathly allergy to light. Because of this allergy (known now in modern day as "XP"), the house must always be kept in the dark, no daylight must shine in.The movie starts off with Grace, just having woken up from a terrible nightmare, screaming in her bed. As soon as it's over, we start to unravel the mysteries of the new, mysterious housekeepers right away. We meet Mrs. Bertha Mills, Mr. Edmund Tuttle, and a girl named Lydia, who've come to the mansion in hopes that there would be an opening fit for them as housekeepers and gardener of the estate, which rests on the Jersey Islands in England.Grace already knows what the 3 have come for, and invites them in, showing them around the house. As she gets to explaining things, she mentions that the last servants disappeared "into thin air" almost a week previous that day.And then she introduces them to the children. Almost immediately, they take a particular liking to Mrs. Mills, the kind and gentle "grand-mother figure", who will be their Nanny.Soon after, strange things start happening. And this is where "The Others" gets to the top point of the film. The portrayal and mystery of the lighting that Alejandro Amenabar played with is more than fascinating. It's a "cinematographers dream" as Nicole Kidman states in the documentary on the special edition DVD, come out in May.The performances in the movie are both moving and worthy of any award you can find and offer. Nicole Kidman as the edgy Grace; Alakina Mann and James Bentley as the scared and curious children, with the allergy to light; Fionnula Flanagan as the mysterious, yet sweet Mrs. Mills; Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes as the two quiet, humble, mysterious companions of Mrs. Mills; Christopher Eccleston as the grief and war striken husband Charles; and last, but certainly not least, Renee Asherson as the "old woman" or "witch" who's calm and soothing voice makes you want to fall into a deep sleep.The overall effect this movie produces is a scary and moving, touching one. There are those moments where you can be on the edge of your seat and those other times where you feel yourself tearing up at the destruction the war has caused.Sets and costumes were perfect for that era, and the lighting especially sticks out when chase scenes within and outside of the dark, creepy house begin. The lighting was crucial to the overall effect, because you are put in that view that the children have had their entire lives: a dim, eerie light.Alejandro Amenabar is a true genius. Writing a flawless screenplay is something you rarely fine these days... it is a true work of literature. Although their are the occasional goofs and obvious flaws in the film once or twice, the direction Amenabar put out was truly amazing.You must rent "The Others" tonight... it will blow your mind!Kudos, Blake</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances, retread storyline, slightly dull, most predictable movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is very well acted, the performance by Nicole Kidman is I assume is the reason people glow about this mildly entertaining movie. Also the supporting cast is very solid especially the daughter who with patience, training, and proper film selection really has a chance to have very successful career she can steal the scene scenes from the more veteran Kidman. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT****As far as the story goes it failed as a suspense thriller because of its utter predictability. I had without trying or thinking about it at all, figured out the "surprise" ending. I admit that even the best crafted thriller can be guessed or figured out but usually it is by actually trying to. 5min into this film literally I had already guessed every twist and turn that was to be offered. These kinds of films can be completely ruined for most by too many hints much less knowing the outcome so I won't say a word other than trust me you have probably seen this film at least a few times under different names and pulled off more successfully. Another problem The Others has is mediocre to poor pacing, it dragged and then rushed and back again. Mostly it had a slight drag which causes the movie to be just a little dull. The Others has many strengths in my opinion good acting, the direction is good but not great (the pacing), the script is solid, cinematography, and honestly a good twist on second hand concept. Still for all it has going for it The Others comes short of it's goal which is to keep me guessing and on the edge of my seat.****END POSSIBLE SPOILER****Great suspense for those who ALWAYS say "I could never have guessed", and those who pay little attention to the visual aspects of a film. Predictable middle of the road entertainment for everyone else. WARNING this film is no classic it does not bear multiple viewings, gets more flat each time you see it. DO NOT PURCHASE. Better uses of your time in this genre may be Psycho, The Shining, and Dead Again. Perhaps if The Others was released 10yrs ago I would have enjoyed it more but I am far from certain on that point.2 1/4 out of 5 for this overrated thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see this film you may consider it a thriller as any other one, but this is a mistake when you arrive at its end. This is an original thriller which could have better plot for its two first third parts, it is too boring to see Nicole Kidman always so hysterical and less smart than her daughter, crying any time for anything. Also the idea that a ghost will not recognize itself as such and that any other ghost will have to come to aid you in identifying yourself as a ghost is a bit illogic even for those who believe in a second life after death.</fullReview>

Very thin on plot and predictable to the end, this really did not get going at all.The parts were played well enough especially Kidman and the old woman, however there were too many negatives for me to be able to recommend this to anyone.Frankly I'm surprised that so many people gave this film a '10' - they are either very generous or haven't seen many films!Eric Sykes was cast well, he was certainly 'stiff' enough for the part.Sorry again, try not to die of boredom if you see this.Alternatively I'd recommend all 'The Others' first!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others was a like-it-or-hate-it movie: some of my friends believed it to be an ingenious masterpiece, and others -- no pun intended -- felt it was the worst thing to ever hit the big screen. Strangely enough, I neither liked it nor hated it! I really didn't know how to feel about it! There wasn't anything special about it and the ending wasn't surprising at all, but at the same time, it wasn't exactly awful. I've been skimming through some of the reviews here on IMDB, and I've noticed that a lot of you compared it to M. Night Shyamalan's superb supernatural drama, The Sixth Sense (and ONE of you was so irritated by this comparison that you wrote an entire review on how much you despised the people who felt that way): yes, the similarities are striking. I also noticed that it stole some scenes from Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining. But it still showed SOME hint of partially creative thinking. Oh, what am I saying! It was an ABSOLUTE rip-off of The Sixth Sense and The Shining! There was NOTHING unique about it! You watch and wait for something remotely exciting to take place, but NOTHING HAPPENS! The acting was rather flat (the two main servants are so incredibly predictable and trite that they are out-acted by a mute), and I didn't appreciate the fact that the director treated his audience like idiots: instead of letting us figure out the finale by ourselves -- which can be predicted VERY early on, in my case within the first ten minutes -- he actually has Nicole Kidman EXPLAIN it to us! I don't know: maybe I just expected too much out of The Others. Maybe I just expected to get a fright or a thrill out of watching it. Either way, though, my expectations were NOT met. But I'm in a fairly good mood today, so I'll give it a much higher score than it actually deserves.Overall rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "What lies beneath", "The Others" is a movie that probably work very well on the big screen, but on the TV (I rented it on video), it falls completely flat. I can easily understand that this movie is scary when you see it in a dark room on a big screen with stereo sound, but when you rent it at home and watch it...what a disappointment.The acting is great, the cinematography is great etc..but it's all so very boring. Hardly anything ever happens, and when something happens it usually doesn't make a lot of sense. You have no empathy at all for the characters: two whining little kids and an overly harsh mother. Plus, it's not even remotely scary (on TV). Granted, the ending is adequate and does clear things up, but it didn't shock me nearly as much as "the Sixth Sense", a movie with a similar theme, did. I'd even go as far as to call this a rip-off of the Sixth Sense.Well made, but very boring and derivative.** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman has to be congratulated for giving an excellent performance as a woman living on the Channel Islands in a deserted looking house with two small children who are always seeing ghosts. That's the thrust of the tale and the screenwriters have taken bits and pieces of other such suspenseful tales--"The Turn of the Screw" by Henry James about a governess and two children who communicate with spirits--and tossed in elements of "The Haunting" and "The Uninvited" to come up with a nice little ghost story.The picture could just as well have been filmed in black and white since it makes almost no use of color. The drapes have to be drawn because the children have an illness that makes them photosensitive to light. Fionnula Flannagan gives an appropriately eerie performance as a housekeeper who knows more than she's willing to tell and the children give expert performances. But it gives away its secret about halfway through (especially if you've been to the movies lately), so the ending comes as no great surprise.Biggest drawback is the pacing of the film--very slow in spots and bound to make you feel something should happen soon. And the dialogue, especially by Miss Kidman, is below a whisper--someone should have made sure the film got a good dubbing before release--the music often drowns out some key passages in the dialogue, hindered even further by Miss Kidman's attempt at a proper accent. Best watched with the remote in hand to adjust the volume for the soft spoken passages--and to turn it down for the screams!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Several people recommended this film to me, and I must say I was really anticipating it. Perhaps that anticipation helped fuel my dislike for this film. I am SO bored with the recent slew of films which seem to have this same basic premise... The only one which I thoroughly enjoyed was the subtitled French Film, "A Pure Formality". At least back in 1996 it made me interested.One friend told me that this film was very scary. In fact they had trouble sleeping afterward. I find that almost laughable now... Once you discover the stale theme (and sadly I was about 15 minutes into the movie and I almost turned it off), then the "scary" scenes (all three or four of them) become almost senseless.I also got rather bored with the plot apart from the overplayed "twist". How many times can the woman mistreat her children and complain about being trapped in the house in the first half of the movie? I felt like the makers of this movie made it more for the stumps in the audience instead of people with minds. At least "The Sixth Sense" didn't keep repeating itself...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Question life? Or this films existance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>okay so I'll be honest, i went into this hungry and i didn't really want to see that so I am already cranky and annoyed. The others starts out really plain. Horrific imagines shown as drawings to not tell you a damn thing about the plot and a setting of darkness. We open with a fog filled screen with a huge house and a tag Jersey, 1946, or something to that extent. Hmm so the scene is set and we start into the great journey that is this film. We meet the main charectors an overprotective woman that is forced to close and lock everydoor as she walks around and is rude to the hired help that has just arrived. The acting is okay if you totally try and ignore Nicole Kidman for certain scenes, such as the one were her and the children are sitting around a candle lit table with their books. "Bad little children go to limbo, and bad people go to hell"(or something similiar) begged the question Where do bad actresses go? Answer Jersey: 1946. I knew that opening would come in handy. I would not call this film scary. Dramatic, slightly suspenseful seeing as they don't tell you what the hell is going on and there are plenty of inexplicable events such as The husband just reappearing. Even the end doesn't explain how that happened. Your left with the only obvious answer to why it happened. To be 100% honest i was bored, but i wanted to know what was going on and had plenty of theories. As a whoile it is good. The ending packs enough punch to make somethigns come together and fulfill the whole movies premise. However gettting their is not half the fun. Sitting through countless scenes of Nicole Kidman's charector being rude to everyone in sight, whether it be the three hired help people that appeared out of nowhere or her own children gets really old. The movie runs at about 90 minutes I belive. It could have been a 45 minute television show and made as much sense. IT might have satisfied me more also. However, we all know that audiences don't pay to watch good quality 45 minute movie, they pay 8 dollars to see a good 45 minute movie with an additional 45 minutes of pointless filler. We found our selves waiting for the notoriuos "i am your daughter" scene, and getting so exited once she was in the dress that we knew that took place in. Watch it, it's not a complete waste of time but it is a little boring. I rated it a 5, apparently most people liked it more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Amenabar's stunning "Open Your Eyes," I greatlyanticipated his follow-up, "The Others." Unfortunately, hisEnglish-language sophomore effort is a terrible let-down. It had alot of potential, and it was actually a film that I wanted to like - if itweren't for some unfortunate plot contrivances.Instead of weaving an intricate web of subjective psychology,horror and supernatural ambiance, in an homage to "TheInnocents" (and "The Turn of the Screw" on which it was based),the director gives us a shallow, contrived "twist-ending" thriller,which doesn't have a whole lot to say or offer. In this sense, itwould seem that Amenabar shares a lot in common with hisAmerican counterpart, M. Night Shymalan - the denouement-meister.To the film's credit, the cinematography is georgeously gothic. Thefirst half of the film generates a good deal of creepiness throughthe atmosphere alone. As well, the performances are stellar -from Nicole Kidman's hysterical mother, to her pale-faced children.But again, it's amazing how much one lazy stroke in a script - inthis case, the "things are not as they seem, but you saw it from amile away" plot twist - can sink a promising venture.Where's a script editor when you need one?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kidman is good, but overall I was mostly disappointed in this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon release this film, "The Others", received quite a bit of favorable press. Plus, the IMDb ratings today are pretty darned high. I rented the DVD upon release yesterday, watched it, and came away fairly disappointed. Kidman is good, but often the acting and dialog made me laugh, it often seemed to be more a borderline comedy than a horror or suspense movie. Nowhere near as good or suspenseful as recent films like "The Sixth Sense" or "Unbreakable."SPOILERS - DO NOT READ IF YOU'VE YET TO SEE THE FILM -- As the movie unfolds, and fairly deliberately at that, we come to see that Kidman is a fairly normal, if overly cautious, mother in 1945 England. Her children suffer a strange illness and must not be exposed to any strong light, especially not direct sunlight. She needs domestic workers and three show up, formerly worked there. Mom starts to hear noises that can't be explained. Or someone playing the piano. Then, all the curtains disappear. Turns out she and the kids are dead, as well as the three workers. The sounds they occasionally hear are the real people coming to view the property which is for sale. She loves her children, but had suffocated them with pillows. Her death was not explained. A very "atmospheric" film, but to me not very suspenseful or frightening. And in the end, the story was not a particularly interesting one. I am at a loss for all the 8s, 9s, and 10s this film has been given. A rating of 6 or 7 seems about right to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along the vein of previous ghost films such as "Tales From the Crypt," "Jacob's Ladder" and "The Sixth Sense." "The Others" is simple, yet brilliant ghost story filmmaking and storytelling.The Plot concerns Lady Grace and her two children (both suffering from an extreme sensitivity to sunlight) and their secluded life on an English island. The family waits for the return of missing Husband/Father from WW2. The film is based on an original script by the Spanish director himself, but shamelessly borrows from Henry James' epitomal ghost novelette, "The Turn of the Screw" and Thomas Tryon's psychological horror novel, "The Other." Whatever the case, you'll no doubt enjoy this chilling entry (filmed in mainland Spain, not the English island). I found it very entertaining, and Kidman is extremely convincing as the bitchy and 'wound-too-tight' Lady of the Mansion. The child actors and the supporting servant cast also do a winning job.</fullReview>

It's beautifully crafted, with excellent acting from the entire cast - especially Nicole Kidman, who should have received (at least!) a nomination for an Oscar for this role. I liked the fact that nothing is thrown in your face, that the tension builds gradually and that the story is very strong. Everything adds up just right, nothing is left to chance. The cinematography means a lot in this movie, but no detail is left at chance, from the beginning to the end. Maximum points for this movie, and I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love scary movies. The only problem is, it's been a long time since I've seen a film that really had me scared. Last night, I saw "The Others", and my waiting was finally over.The movie is set on the small channel island of Jersey right after the end of World War II. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a strongly religious woman who lives alone in a big mansion with her two young children. Her husband went fighting in the war and is missing, presumably dead. One night, something terrible happened in the mansion, and the servants all ran away. About one week later, three servants knocks on Graces door and offers their services. She takes them in and gives them their instructions. Because of a severe light allergy, the children must be kept out of the daylight. Every curtain in front of every window must be drawn, and every door in the house must be locked. To begin with, everything seems to progress as usual. But then, slowly, inexplicable things start to happen. Doors are left open. Whispering voices are heard. The piano starts playing itself. Graces daughter is "seeing" people all over the house. At first, Grace refuses to believe her. But as the events continue, she is faced with the fact that there are indeed "intruders" in the house - and she has to deal with them.This movie had my complete attention from the very beginning. There is an ominous, eerie atmosphere creeping out from the screen and into you as you are watching. The bleak mansion covered in perpetual fog; the pale children with their mysterious condition; the three servants who may or may not be who they really say they are; and - in the middle of it all - Grace, a truly complex character - deeply religious, a control freak, and at the same time a loving, caring mother. Nicole Kidman gives a tremendous performance as Grace, and really brings out all the different aspects of her personality - especially her mounting insanity and despair. Fionnuala Flanagan excels as Mrs. Mills, the trustworthy nanny who ever so slowly seems to be changing into a menacing threat. And the two young children are the surprise of the movie, playing their parts to perfection. They have some of the scariest scenes in the film - one when they are in bed trying to sleep, and the daughter suddenly starts talking to one of the "intruders" only she can see (a boy named Victor), and one when they are hiding in a closet with danger looming outside. Other spooky scenes involve Grace in a storage room filled with objects covered in white sheets, Grace dressing up her daughter in a white communion dress, and Grace investigating sounds from a piano in a locked music room.But single scenes aside, it's the movie's whole, intense atmosphere that really gets your adrenaline going. This is not a movie for those who love blood, gore and special effects. It relies on its magnificent plot, being slow and deliberate, and building up tension throughout until you are on the edge of your seat, biting your nails and holding your breath in anticipation. The cinematography, the camera angles, the subdued, menacing score - it all blends together into one wonderful movie. The only objection I have is the middle part of the movie, where the plot centers around Grace's lost husband and seem to lose focus for a while. But then it picks up the pace again, and the ending is both so terrifying and so wonderfully ingenious that you are left completely astounded. All the pieces fit together, all the loose ends are tied up and all your questions are answered - but in a way I certainly didn't see coming. "The Others" is a successful mix of several genres - the traditional ghost story, a thriller, a family drama - all in one. I'll rate it 6 out of 6 on my dice, and give it my highest recommendations.</fullReview>

This is too slow narrated.If it was a parody on Hitchcock of the 40s it would be rather splendid, because it is played in a 40s manner, especially by Nicole Kidman, who is doing one of her best performances. This also goes for Fionnula Flanagan and the actors must have had lots of fun during the making of this film.The plot doesn't hold together however. Definitely not. Nothing should be said about the ending, more than it's cheating and disappointing. Besides it's too much fog outside the house, it's too much spooky victorianism all around, it's too much walking in corridors, which would be all right in an parody, but this isn't. You are not that frightened you're supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is director Alejandro Amenábar's first feature film in English,having previously worked in Spanish, and certainly the film doeshave a European quality to it, making a welcome change from therecent crop of Hollywood thrillers such as What Lies Beneath andUnbreakable. However, this is not to say that The Others is anoutright success. Nicole Kidman deserves credit for taking achance on a relatively unknown director, but despite when of herbest performances to date, her character is too neurotic and herreligious fervour which she inflicts upon the children, prevents herfrom gaining our full sympathy. However, the main reason that The Others disappoints is that itsimply isn't scary enough. The children lack any kind of creepy oreerie qualities, so we never believe they are malicious, whichwould have added an extra dimension to the suspense. Likewise, the servants are too homely to ever really be scary and inparticular for a British audience, Eric Sykes as the gardener isnever going to be spooky. The children's allergy to light wasintended to subvert the horror convention of dark bringing fear andlight bringing salvation. Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work andinstead just seems like a convenient device to allow most of thefilm's action to take place in the dark. Nazi occupation of Jersey is mentioned, but doesn't form a majorpart of the plot, which is certainly a missed opportunity to exploremore interesting themes than the straightforward supernatural linethe film chooses to follow.</fullReview>

I tend to watch a lot of films as do most of my friends, when they came to me and said "See the others" i accepted and went along ready to experience the 'mindblowing twists' and 'the best psychological thiller since Sixth Sence' and 'the scaryist moments ever'To be met with this poor excuse for a film.The "twists" were so bloody obvious i felt that i should scream it out at the top of my voice. IT was soo painfully obvious that i almost killed the couple next to me when they saw the...'twist'. NIcole Kidman should recieve no kind of award as he performance was flat and here english acent flawed. This film doesnt even compare to the sixth sense!! The "shock" techniques, that seem to be dominent in films now over special effects since "Final Destination", were indicated long before by the sound track. My advice would be go and watch Moulin Rouge again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, if you haven't watched the movie "The Sixth sense", this might be a great movie for you (unexpected ending), but if you already watched the sixth sense, I think the basic plot of this movie was copied from it and just made some new tweaks. The first hour was really really boring.. I almost fell asleep... THE ending: hmmm.. very similar to "the sixth sense..." nice try and nice music though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amenábar is the copy-paste master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We can begin with the best thing in The Others: Kidman, no doubt.And the film itself is not a bad movie, but something worse. You can wonder what's worse than a bad movie? The answer is a non-original movie. And talking about Alejandro Amenábar a non-original movie is something really serious, because this boy has no one single original idea in his brains.I mean, everything in his movies is copied from another film. In this case, even the idea and the lights are copied from another movies and not only the images, so this is something incredible. People who doesn't know much about cinema (or that are too young to have seen much movies) can see an obvious linking between The Others and The Sixth Sense (Night M. Shyamalan, 1999), but that is just one of the multiple copies of this film. And I write copies and not references or tributes, because I truly believe that Amenábar is a master in the copy-paste style. When you pay attention to The Others you can see images from The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973), Room at the top (Jack Clayton, 1959), The Haunting (Robert Wise, 1963), The Changeling (Peter Medak, 1980), La Chute de la Maison Usher (Jean Epstein, 1928), The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980), Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, 1975, here the use of lights), and many others, including also Luis Bu?uel (Viridiana, 1961) or Federico Fellini (Amarcord, 1974). So, there is an absolute lack of new ideas in this movie, what is an incredible pity, but a cruel reality. So, why much people love Amenábar? Well, it's really easy. When you are young you have no idea about what is already filmed. So you can create something incredible out of modern style just going to your videoclub and copying every single scene you love. But there is also another question more difficult to answer? Why do experts love this movie? OK, there are different possible answers. First, they are also too young and they have to learn much more. Second, they are Amenábar's friends (in Spain there are a lot of them, but even here there are some critics that have seen much copies in this movie than in any other filmed by the director). Third, they are in love with Nicole Kidman (and that's really normal). Fourth, they haven't seen the movie (this is not so impossible. I am a journalist and I know people who do it). Fifth, a mystery I don't understand. Summing up, Alejandro Amenábar is not a genius neither a clever director. He is just a lucky boy who knows the best way to make a movie without wasting a single minute of thinking: to copy. And in that he is really a master, or at least, one of the best plagiarists of the world. Congratulations for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the trailer I expected a scare-a-minute creep fest. What you have is a slow , theatrical based story with good performances, nice lighting, no special effects, period costumes and one or two jumpy moments.The atmosphere started to build eerily enough, but as the red herrings started to fall unfortunately so did the number of story revelations. Combine that with a totally pointless appearance by Christopher Eccleston who does little more than mumble 3 or 4 lines and wear a blank expression I became bored. By the time the middle hour was over and the plot started to pick up speed I didn't care.SPOILERIf you've read or seen Haunted by James Herbert you can probably deduce the major twist a mile away. Some of the "surprises" are bookmarked by really obvious and out of place dialogue. Christopher Eccleston wandering out of the fog unexpectedly saying "sometimes I bleed"?? What??Even after the credits roll you will still be wondering just what the point of Christopher Eccleston's character was.However it was good to see British comedy veteran Eric Sykes is still alive and well. Sort of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for "The Others". "The Haunting"(1963) and "The Innocents"(1961) are my favorite ghost story/psychological horror movies, and this film was said to be in the same vein. But it was disappointing, after a good set-up. Simply put, the film was TOO restrained, and I like subtlety in movies. Not enough stuff happened to put the audience on edge, or justify the mounting panic Nicole Kidman was displaying. "The Others" seems to be holding back, trying to build to a final payoff that, frankly, was not that shocking. Beautifully photographed, good acting, and Nicole Kidman is gorgeous. But scary? No. Eerie? Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but this movie was a miss for me. I see a lot of nice reviews, but this is no horror movie. I was recommended this movie because I wanted a good, suspenseful movie with a plot twist (which is the only thing I got). Throughout the whole movie I remained bored. I was never once scared, although I did jump once. (But that does that really count?) This movie has a VERY predictable plot with two major plot twists, only one of which was good. The only scene I enjoyed contained the second plot twist. Which is why I was nice and rated this movie a 4. Nicole Kidman's performance was good, but the long, drawn-out and boring plot did not help her. As I feel as though I wasted two hours of my life, during which I could have watched a way better movie, I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good scare. Maybe, and I mean MAYBE, to a family looking for a suspense film to watch together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole Kidman finds out the truth about herself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Others" is a mystery story, actually three mysteries are involved. You may figure out two of them, but you are unlikely to figure out the third. Its resolution is saved until the end.The film is dark and atmospheric. It's not particularly scary but it is spooky. It seemed repetitious after awhile. Nicole Kidman's character is not really sympathetic, making it hard to get engrossed in her problem or in the story itself. She has two children, and they are quite sympathetic, especially the little boy. The supporting cast has one main character, Mrs. Mills, and she's played by Fionnula Flanagan. She was excellent in her part.The story has no theme. It's really pointless. The behavior of Kidman's character is never explained. It remains a mystery, a fourth mystery.Many reviewers love the film and praise it to the skies. I am not among them. I do not think it comes up to Rosemary's Baby or Eyes Wide Shut. It's a professionally-done movie, however, that is way above the typical schlocky horror story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is set on 'Jersey, The Channel Islands 1945' where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a large mansion with her two young children Anne (Alakina Mann) &amp; Nicholas (James Bentley) who suffer from an incredibly rare disease in which exposure to bright light could kill them. Three friends, the elderly Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) &amp; a young mute girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) turn up at Grace's home looking for work as servants &amp; luckily for them the previous servants left a week ago. Grace gives them all jobs &amp; tells them their duties. Grace warns them that her daughter Anne is prone to telling lies &amp; making stories up &amp; it's not long before she is telling Bertha about other people in the house although at first there is no evidence that there are, however as children's crying is heard, strange noises emanate from empty rooms &amp; doors open &amp; close by themselves it appears that Anne may be telling the truth...This Spanish, American &amp; French co-production was written &amp; directed by Chilean-born, Spanish based Alejandro Amenabar who also composed the music &amp; I liked it, I didn't think it was amazing &amp; I have one or two reservations about it but overall I thought it was an effective little ghost film. The script is pretty slow going even at the best of times &amp; tries to return to the days where horror relied on good storytelling instead of relying on special effects, violence &amp; bad language. It moves along at a sedate pace but the character's are decent &amp; it's sort of involving, it manages to draw the viewer in quite well &amp; all the careful build up helps the effective twist ending. A lot has been said about the twist &amp; I for one think it works extremely well although there simply is no denying that it's more or less exactly the same as The Sixth Sense (1999) which was made at least two years prior to The Others. I'm in two minds over The Others, I liked it for what it was but it was slow going &amp; sometimes I found it hard to maintain my interest in it &amp; the effectiveness of the entire film depends upon it's ending which is great if you haven't seen The Sixth Sense but if you have I'd imagine you'd feel a little de ja vu &amp; not be too impressed. There are a few holes in the plot &amp; logic but nothing too detrimental.Director Amenabar does a fantastic job of giving the film a creepy look &amp; atmosphere, the colours &amp; the the use of light &amp; shadow are excellent. There are some nice shots &amp; some eerie scenes although on the negative side it's a bit lifeless &amp; bland at times. The 40's period setting suits the film perfectly &amp; it's superbly realised throughout. There's no gore or violence &amp; I can't remember any rubbish CGI computer effects (yeah!).With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 The Others is well made &amp; has nice period production design, it shows that a lot of time went into the look of the film. While watching The Others I realised that because of the types of films that I like (horror, exploitation, low budget, sci-fi, etc.) I haven't actually seen a Nicole Kidman film before now. I was impressed &amp; I thought she was great, she's very pretty &amp; very good in this. Her ex Tom Cruise was an executive producer on The Others, presumably before they split. Everyone else does a fine job including ex Doctor Who (2005) Christopher Eccleston.The Others is a good solid ghost story that I found watchable &amp; effective, unfortunately it's a bit on the slow side &amp; the ending really isn't as original or groundbreaking as it could have been although it's still highly effective. Well worth a watch but I doubt many would want to see it more than once so perhaps wait for it to turn up on TV or cable.</fullReview>

She tries though,but the two kids are far better in their roles than Nic.The story is a mix of The Haunting and The Sixth Sense and unfortunately is pretty predictable,just as TSS was,but at least its not dumb and you get a certain satisfaction from predicting the ending-a sort of "I told you so"!Nice to see the great Eric Sykes on screen,albeit in a minor role.My view?

I got so tired of listening to Kidman constantly brow-beat her pathetic children I had to force myself to finish watching it( after I woke up that is)And what's the deal with her children being allergic to sunlight? As least make them albino or something so this foolish premise can be at least half believable..And why didn't the children find their own graves on the grounds? The ending was a good twist, but the idea simply wasn't developed to any degree in order to make it a truly good movie. someone could redo this disaster and actually make it much scarier, much more believable, and a much better developed flick..and was her husband alive or dead? Whatever..avoid this childish mess...by the way, Kidman's opening scream was extremely pleasant and necessary...NOT!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a wuss, I am the first person to admit it. The Supernatural terrifies me. I even have to watch "Buffy" from behind a cushion. However, I was lulled into a false sense of security by the fact that this film was only rated a 12.'Huh', I thought, 'How scary can this film be?' Ever use the expression "Famous last words"? Well, mine will go down in infamy."The Others" certainly gives proof to the fact that a film does not have to contain sharp weapons of any description, heavy breathing, or copious amounts of blood to scare the wits out of a person. This film definitely played on your subconscious, rather than conscious state of mind. But it was more than that...after all "The Blair Witch Project" was said to do the same, and to compare the two would not be dissimilar to a comparison made between double oscar winning Tom Hanks, and Tom "Well, I played the back-end of a horse in my high school pantomime" Joe Public. I can safely say that alongside "Scary Movie", "The Blair Witch Project" has got to be one of the most overrated, tedious pile of crap I have ever had to waste 2 hours of my life watching."The Others" is in an entirely different class. Atmospheric, tense, and very very scary. One of only two films I have embarrassed myself by screaming at in the cinema, (The other is "What Lies Beneath", by the way) the twist at the end even surpasses the climax of "The Sixth Sense".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others made me shiver. Indeed it was the old-fashioned fear that hides in every corner of a 19th century mansion surrounded by fog and such tension it's almost touchable. The Others could happen in any place or time but director Alejandro Amenabar has chosen the post WW II period to be the set of his two hour traffic. Grace(Nicole Kidman), a mother-of-two lives in rare conditions: her offspring has a disease which keeps them inside the house, curtains closed. The story begins to open after her new household helpers arrive. It is amazing how such little can sometimes turn out to be the best. Amenabar plays with our smallest fears which tend to get more frightening our minds twisting them. Everything in this movie is ment to be.The cast is troughoutly talented and wonderful. N. Kidman does another great part in a year which in it's diversity to Moulin Rouges Satine shows her changing capability. Grace does have the air of coolness surrounding her appearance and reminds Kidman's previous screen personas but this time it actually has a positive effect. The children, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, do have both innocense and confidence in their performances.The story is calmly revealed bit by bit but it manages to keep the viewer focused. Amenabar's directing is one hundred procent quality: He does not offer answers on a plate and visions and the story based on the 40's subtle atmospehere surprises -literally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThis has potential to be as big a hit as The Sixth Sense on account of its nature - it is clearly trying to copy its success and its formula (not to mention its release date - I think they both opened in the exact same week, two years apart). It is nowhere as good as that film, but, if you did like that, you're going to probably like this. I doubt anyone will like this one better, though.Technically, the film is superb. In this aspect, it probably surpasses The Sixth Sense. The editing and especially the cinematography are often breathtaking. The acting is decent. I don't particularly care for Nicole Kidman - she harmed Eyes Wide Shut significantly, in my opinion, but her bizarre style of acting worked fabulously in the purposely campy Moulin Rouge. Here, as a constantly paranoid, possessive, and protective mother, she is more than adequate, though not deserving of any award or special hurrah. The three servants are well played by Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes, and Elaine Cassidy - they have a certain air about them. The best performances come from the two children (another echo of The Sixth Sense, although the adults in that one were also marvelous) - James Bentley as the perpetually frightened Nicholas and Alakina Mann as the intelligent Anne. Mann is in fact wonderful and I hope to see her in other films in the future. There are just a few actors after these principals, and I commend the filmmakers very much. This saves a ton of money, and makes the film more intimate and frightening, which is exactly what this film calls for.Like always, almost all of the film's problems exist in the script. The screenwriter (who is also the director) realizes that his savvy audience will guess that this is a descendent of the immensely popular The Sixth Sense, so he is always attempting to trick us. What are these strange servants up to? A few times, we experience the narrative from their point of view, and what they say drives us wild with guessing. And what is wrong with the father, who had disappeared in WWII (this is set in the 1940s) and then mysteriously reappears in a frightening fog? We know that there are surprises, and these tricks work to confuse us and lead us away - good old McGuffins. I guessed right away, correctly, the father's situation, which kept me from seeing the forest for the trees. What the script forgets to do, or at least forgets to do well, is develop the characters. The children are well developed, but Amenabar relies too much on the inherent creepiness of the three servants for their effect - they almost become silly by the end; anyway, there were several moments when I laughed at their actions, although it might have been intentional. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is Amenabar's biggest failure. Her main character trait is a severe neurosis - her husband has been lost in battle and she has been left alone in an enormous mansion with only her two children. Those children have a severe light sensitivity - they break out in hives when they come into contact with light (no, they aren't Gremlins or magwies). For most of the film, Kidman's character is built up, but the revelations at the end don't ring true. One of the reasons that the ending of The Sixth Sense worked so well was because the final revelations revealed a lot of hidden facets about the characters and their actions in the events which happened beforehand. The revelations here, while very unexpected and clever, don't exactly follow what Amenabar was building.Amenabar also has a problem with suspense. He gives himself all these little peculiarities to deal with - the kids are allergic to light, for instance. But he never really uses that to create suspense. One morning, the children wake up to find that all the curtains in the house have been stolen. It would have been better, perhaps, if we were allowed to watch the curtains being slowly removed at night. The suspense nearer the beginning, when we don't know very much, is quite good. The first set piece is excellent. A lot of the other scary scenes are also quite good, including the climactic one, where the secrets are finally revealed. Still, the film uses too many stingers (sharp rises in the music). That may make us jump, but for a dishonest reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the '6th Sense' found success by slapping us in the face with the long lost 'shocking' ending, Hollywood big-shots have spent endless 'hours' (or at least minutes) trying to do it to us again.With that said, 'The Others' might be considered a clone (including opening up the same weekend as '6th Sense' did)--- However --- the movie is strong enough to remind us that a good film can actually be 'filmed' instead of 'generated' by a computer. No crazy graphics... No disgusting/flying creatures... and no tasteless and cheap Hollywood 'CGI' scares!Creative camera work, Clever integration of sound and music, a creepy cast in a creepy environment... and a version of Nicole Kidman that only Tom Cruise knows, all make for a chilling film.The movie traps you in an old fashioned way and probably should have been filmed in Black and White. It does everything a Physco-Drama/Horror/Ghost-story/what-ever-you-wanna-call-it should do... Makes you Think - Jump - Cheer - Bit your nails and walk away talking about it.It was one of the few movies worth the $7+ you pay for it.Soooooo.... Buy a large popcorn, a big soda (assuming you can afford a $25 day at the movies) and enjoy a great film.

		<fullReview>Hit chiller from the summer of 2001 is a terrifically twisted and beautifully made ghost flick that recalls the old-fashion spookiness of The Haunting (1963).Woman living in isolation with her two young children begins to believe that they are not alone in their huge, dark house.Alejandro Amenaber delivers an intriguing and compelling story, full of mystery, suspense, jolts, and capped with one mind-blowing twist. It's a fully gripping thriller with some likable and well-fleshed out characters. The direction of Amenaber is wonderfully atmospheric and done with a nice touch of subtly that builds tension even higher. The musical score is nicely moody too.Nicole Kidman does an excellent performance, as does young Alakina Mann and James Bentley as her children. Fionnula Flanagan is also good as a mysterious housekeeper.Over all, The Others is a superior supernatural thriller that is unforgettably good.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling well directed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie had a story that could have made it be your terrible, silly and gory horror flick but it wasn't. It was very cleverly directed and very well acted. It is in fact a beautiful period piece. The costumes and dialogue are excellent. Also what makes this such a good movie is that you think you are being led in one direction and then suddenly you realize everything is the opposite to what you expected. There were some scary moments but it was more chilling because every moment you were holding your breath because it felt like a scary moment was sure to happen. Nicole Kidman plays her role very well and deceptively to the point where we don't know if she is going mad or if there really are ghosts in her house. Highly recommend for fans of the old sort of horror flicks because of the way it is directed. You will understand when you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the best horror movie I've seen in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I'm not a big fan of horror movies. Not because I'm easily scared, but because I can't stop laughing (which, for as far as I know, isn't the meaning of the creators of such movies). This time however it was a completely different story ... I don't think I've ever been so on the edge of my seat with a horror movie than with this one. The main reason why I love this one so much is because it reminds me of a story that runs in our family. It is told that my great grandfather once had contact with his dead wife during a séance. Apparently, details were told which only he and his wife knew about, which scared the hell out of him of course... I don't know how much of this story is true, but the movie certainly reminded me of it. The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't need brain eating zombies, gigantic spiders or other weird creatures that are supposed to scare me, while they only make me laugh. No, "The Others" relies on nothing more but a good story and excellent acting in combination with a great decor. I kept focused until the end, also thanks to the great twist at the end. I can't tell too much about it of course, you'll have to see it for yourself. I loved it and I give it a 9/10. It's by far the best horror movie I've seen in years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gee, I never saw the end coming from a mile away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS HEREIN***This fog-bound film is about as entertaining as a wake. Remember those corny old English creep-shows from the sixties and seventies, and they always took place on an English estate, and they always starred Christopher Lee? This movie looks like it was made in 1973. Amenabar's choice to place the characters in the coldest setting imaginable, in spartan rooms, dressed in black, and with light so muted that we can't appreciate Kidman's natural beauty, all to emphasize the ultimate point about who the characters really are at the end of the film, is a dismal failure. Instead of enhancing the characters, this emphasized de-styling separates the viewer from the characters, keeping him from sympathizing with the story. I feel none of Grace's panic when the children are screaming, nor do I care the slightest about Grace's search for "intruders" in the house. For that matter, when hubby returns from abroad, the meeting is icy and distant, all for the ending's ultimate purpose of course, but to sacrifice what could have been a great film for the cheap gimmick that pops up at the end is a real shame. The mystery doesn't go deep enough, this film is all about appearances and surface details. Oh, and you won't see the ending coming from a mile away.</fullReview>

Slamming and creaking doors just didn't do it for me.Most people will figure out the ending long before the people in the back wake up from their nap.One scene has Nicole Kidman check out the upstairs piano room. She locks the piano cover so that no one can play it. After the door slams shut as she leaves, she returns to find the piano unlocked again. Ooooohh....spooky/scary.On a positive note, the acting was quite good...except for the husband who slept through the part like the three people next to me in the theatre.Scarier than the movie is that was two hours of my life that I will never get back....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but flawed supernatural effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arriving at an old Victorian home, new workers looking after a woman's two bed-ridden children experience a series of ghostly happenings that questions their religious upbringing and must figure out how to stop it from continuing.This one turned out to be an absolutely banal drama rather than a horror film, which has a lot of problems. One of the biggest issues is that nothing at all happens in here, with being just so slow and plodding that the scares hardly happen. Since nearly all the early scares or confrontations are off-camera with us coming upon their reactions or hearing about what happened, leaving this one to completely gloss over the potential main selling point by not showing anything to be afraid of and only telling us. This is compounded by all the times she keeps spouting off about their fates in Purgatory and such for failing to listen to her, her insistence on teaching and interpreting the Bible and all of the religious nonsense that permeates the film, as well as the rather ridiculous plot-point about the father coming home, which is dismissed quite suddenly and eats up several minutes of screen time going nowhere at all. Beyond the plot problems, the last act twist is just utterly confusing and makes no sense, rendering much of the film up until that point quite contradictory to what's been established and doesn't really serve a point at all. All of these issues aren't enough to save it from some rather nice points here, mainly a fine, suitably creepy Gothic mansion that serves as the perfect point for this effort, there's some generally freaky moments with the children's reactions to different events around the house and then there's the first revelation about the different workers' true past which prompts some fine action scenes for the first time and gets some chilling scenes involved. These make it worthwhile, but it's overall quite flawed.Rated PG-13: Violence and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

Yet it has come to my attention that at the time I write this review, one the popular horror plot is the twist where the main characters that the viewers assume as the ones being haunted, are truly the real haunters themselves. And Now, seeing this movie about fourteen years after its original release, I think now I have found the original movie that set the trend for such a plot. Of the small number of horror movies I've seen, I can appreciate the surprise that the plot brings, especially in the part where the twist comes in. In my opinion, the twist served n this movie has the surprise level comparable to the one I saw in The Skeleton Key, even in the original Shutter, that Thai movie. Nicole Kidman played an stable role, successfully portraying an insecure mother with the burden of a lost husband and photosensitive children. Yet I don't think this was the best performance from her.</fullReview>

Simply amazing! 90% of the entire movie is happening in the house and i don't know how, but it's never boring. You're always expecting something that never happens. Brilliant! And i really liked how Alejandro Amenabar has tried and succeeded in adding a lot of drama to the movie. That really made the mood a lot better.I also really liked his directing. Almost the entire movie's been shot on dark places around the house with no light to it than the one of some candle or something. That candle or candles is what's, actually, giving you the chills when you hear voices or something in the movie. You always wonder what if the candle goes out.Nicole Kidman was brilliant. Ever since she started pumping her face with botox or whatever, even though she is a great actress, i just can't find any sort of emotion in her performances. But that's not the case with this one. This role demanded Nicole Kidman. She was just amazing. Sad, angry, calm, scary - all at once. This role really fits her. She freaked me out in this movie.I almost forgot to mention, the music is excellent! It really gives a lot to the movie! And the ending! The ending is perfect! More than perfect!!! It's what, in my eyes, made this movie one of the best horror's ever!!! Do not miss this movie! It's brilliant!!! This movie is the best that you can get out of a horror movie!!!! It's got everything! It's just great! Watch it and see for your self!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good ending twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a mother trying to bring up two young children with photo-sensitivity after the Second World War. Sinister things happen in her house that makes them question their sanity."The Others" has a good script. The ending twist is sudden and unexpected, it would have been so original if it was released before "The Sixth Sense". As for the delivery of the plot, there is just enough thrill and suspense to keep me interested, but not enough to keep me on edge. I find most of the film quite depressing and dull due to the lack of light and sound in the film. Imagine the lives of the children, living in darkness, loneliness and fear must have been tough and traumatising. It would have been great if the plot could have touched more on that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film may start off a little on the slow side, but essentially it is a truly chilling and effective period horror film, with just the right chills and thrills. Superbly directed and brilliantly written, "The Others" hits all the right boxes. Then there is an atmospheric music score and truly stunning cinematography and period detail(the house especially was fantastic). The story is an original one, very rarely gets confusing and goes along at a good pace. And the performances are wonderful, Nicole Kidman without a doubt gives one of the best performances I have seen her give in years, it was a performance of true intensity. Alakina Mann and James Bentley are outstanding as her children, and Christopher Ecceleston is effective in a small role. Asides from Kidman, Fionnula Flannagan is truly sinister and chilling as the housekeeper. Like Mrs Danvers in the Hitchcock film "Rebecca" while she is merely a secondary character, she does so much to enhance the story. All in all, this is a great film, and I recommend it highly. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly old-fashioned, character-driven haunted house story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the isolation of the Jersey isles in the days directly following the conclusion of World War 2, Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, an upright Catholic mother coping with the absence of her husband who has yet to return from the front and the burden of raising two precocious children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) whose deadly allergy to sunlight requires her to keep their immense home shrouded in darkness. Into their strange home arrive an eccentric trio of servants, headed by the seemingly benevolent housekeeper Mrs. Mills. Shortly thereafter, Grace finds their lives turned inside-out as it becomes increasingly apparent that they are not alone in the house and in fact may be the targets of a malevolent haunting. Alejandro Amenabar's lush haunted house story is moody, atmospheric and plays far more like a richly textured old-fashioned film from the 1940s than the garish gross-outs and rock-'em/sock-'em visuals that cater to the attention deficit audiences of today. He has been blessed with a stellar cast, spooky settings and a solid screenplay, which keep the audience guessing as to what is going on. Sharp-eyed viewers might guess some of the elements, but it is doubtful that they will guess all of them as Amenabar has a tendency to consistently provide new twists to muddy the waters. Bentley and, particularly, Mann are credible, sympathetic youngsters, who may be victims to their physical health, but are often more astute as to what may be happening than their mother. Fionnula Flanagan is an inspired choice as the motherly housekeeper, whose unflappable demeanor masks a bit of the sinister. Much of the film rests on Kidman and her interpretation of the not always likable Grace. At the start of the film, Kidman presents Grace as rigid and unwavering ? a woman to whom no obstacle cannot be overcome by sheer will and a reading of scripture. She honestly seems to love her children, but seems torn between the resentment of constantly living in darkness and isolation on their behalf and embracing the inherent martyrdom of such an existence. There is a certain bit of viewer satisfaction in watching her world shaken up a bit and seeing her iron façade start to slip. Kidman does a marvelous job of walking the line between making Grace a force to be reckoned without turning her into a hateful tyrant and then slowly transitioning her into a far more complicated woman, whose emotions slowly start bubbling to the surface. I actually find this a far more difficult and intriguing performance than the one for which she would win the Oscar the following year in The Hours. A truly worthwhile and haunting film that actually grows on the viewer even moreso over time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece that could sit with Horror classics like The Exorcist and Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others is without a doubt one of the few epic classic-feel Ghost Stories of the decade, and perhaps the only great ghost story in recent years. Alejandro Amenábar's direction is superb. He directs with great confidence, majestically structures every scene, and thanks to the cinematographer, creates a truly suspenseful thriller. His screenplay is also brilliant, captivating in all of those classic mansion stories, and giving a lot to play with. But he also does what none of the new thrillers do- give his characters passion and feel. Nicole Kidman gives a brilliant performance here, her best work of the new century. She gives her character sophistication, but her character is also flawed and sometimes not too likable, and she plays it brilliantly. The two child performances are also captivating, especially James Bentley. The whole cast is superb, making this film grander and more epic than I would have thought. The music is amazing. Kind of like the classic music from old horror films. The ending actually surprised me, which is rare, and because I was not sure how many ways it could have ended. The Others could easily have been done in the 70's, and I actually preferred it to the classic The Exorcist (which I really do not like all that much). Bravo to The Others, for that rare thriller, but again, it was made in 2001, which was actually quite some time ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Good Film, But I Think It Loses Something Along the Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman and her two children live in a large house, waiting for the father to return. A maid, a gardener and a nanny arrive to help take care of the large house. But some others arrive, too -- a group that believe the house if rightfully theirs. This house is haunted! Nicole Kidman stars. Tom Cruise produces. It's tough to say how much of this film is due to their involvement and how much is due to just being a good movie. Certainly the success and nominations came from Kidman appearing (any other actress and this film would have faded into quick obscurity). But it's still artsy and I like that about the movie.I really can't talk about this film because there's twists and I want to mention them to really give a good overview. I knew about the twists when I sat down to watch this, which I think took something out of the film for me. Which leads me to think this film would not be half as good on a second or third viewing. My colleague in the movie review business, The Butcher, listed this as a must-see horror film. And it ranks at the bottom of the Internet Movie Database's Top 50 horror films, which is still respectable. I guess I don't think it's as good as they make it out to be.The "horror" elements are pretty much just thumps, bumps and people who might be ghosts that we don't really ever see (they always leave the room before the camera enters). So, it's not a scary film. The house and costumes are beautiful, for what that's worth... but not scary.Go ahead and watch this one. I think it's more a drama than horror, but that's not a reason not to watch it, I suppose. Strong acting everywhere, and the kids are fun if for no other reason than they have interesting accents. I suspect they'll never get another acting job again (especially the boy). Not one of my favorites, but good nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, and almost sublime... a masterful work within the genre of psychological horror-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this moments after the second viewing of the film, I can say without a doubt that this is one of those rare films that benefit greatly from being watched more than once by any viewer. Having been very interested in the work of director/writer/composer Alejandro Amenábar basically since I first knew of Abre Los Ojos, after watching the Americanized remake with Cameron Crowe at the helm(and much, much more upon actually watching some of his work), I made sure to watch this as soon as I could. I remember being gripped and never really looking away... and astoundingly, I had much the same reaction this time, as well. This time, I noticed all the little hints along the way... all leading towards the shocking and intelligent twist. Anyone who hasn't seen this, I urge you to avoid hearing what it is, and make sure not to read neither the quotes nor the keywords for the film. And yes, it is somewhat similar to another popular movie(which I haven't and don't intend to see), but a movie doesn't have to be 100% original to be excellent. The plot is incredibly well-written, and it develops exactly as it should. The pacing is perfect. You're never bored and the film never hurries to get where it's going. The acting is flawless, quite simply. As far as Kidman and the other adults go, this is no major surprise, but the children... they are quite simply among a far too small group of extraordinarily talented young actors. The cinematography is breathtaking. The editing is masterful. Something that simply must be mentioned is the lighting... the way it almost becomes a character itself, the way it affects everything else, the way it is played with throughout the film. Explaining the lighting as well as the general isolation is the fact that the two children suffer from a tragic illness... they cannot survive sunlight. What is amazing that throughout the course of the film, you get used to this... the darkness, the thick atmosphere; it becomes every-day life. Near the end, you find yourself fearing the sun... the bright light. Featuring no real gore, blood or violence, the horror is all psychological. The atmosphere and the light(or lack thereof) creates a lot of tension and suspense... and all of it pays off so well. There are no false scares, nothing gratuitous and the whole film is very close to being sublime. Now, to the real problem with this film, at least my problem with it... it's simply not as open as the other works of Alejandro. It's more Hollywood, easier to take in. Instead of challenging you to think, of providing food for thought, questions as opposed to answers(as Amenábar himself has commented that his films are about)... it reveals everything at the end. It leaves little, if anything, up to the viewer to decide or debate. All is explained... the very thing that ruined what potential the remake of his film, Abre Los Ojos. I understand trying to open up to a wider audience, but it's a little sad that he has to make a compromise with his integrity and goals in doing so. With that said, however, this is still not the average Hollywood flick; there is still nothing in the film that is entirely superfluous, and almost every frame of it is perfection, pure and simple. I recommend this to any fan of Alejandro Amenábar, any of the actors and psychological horror/mystery-thrillers. 8/10</fullReview>

I felt so similarly when I found out that Bruce Willis' character had been dead all along in The Sixth Sense, except that this movie started out kind of slow and dragging and didn't really make me jump out of my seat that much. That's not necessarily a bad thing, however, since The Others did not need terribly shocking, gory scenes to deliver in the eeriness department.

It is suspenseful, creepy and has a relatively unique twist at the ending, which I refuse to give here.The slow moving plot builds up a little at a time, and reveals itself in little bits. It's as if someone has taken a jigsaw puzzle and scattered the pieces for us to find along the way. When we finally get the pieces together, the picture shows us...no...wait...I won't tell you what it shows.You need to gather the pieces yourself to find out. With a wonderful score, and scenery that makes you want to pack up and move to the UK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Gothic Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War 2 has just ended, but Charles Stewart has yet to return home to the island estate where his family await him. His wife, Grace, is a highly stressed woman. All of the servants have recently quit without notice, leaving Grace alone to care for the two children, Nicholas and Anne. To Grace's relief, three new servants arrive and offer their services; Mr. Tuttle tends the grounds, the mute Lydia takes care of the housework and the wise old Mrs. Mills becomes the children's new nanny. Nicholas and Anne are both highly photosensitive children and can never be exposed to sunlight, or else they will die within minutes. Therefore, the curtains are kept tightly closed and the gloomy mansion is lit only by weak candlelight. But although Grace seems to be getting her life back under control at last, something sinister seems to have invaded the mansion. Anne swears she has seen "others" in the house: an old, blind woman and a little boy. Grace suspects Anne of making up stories but soon, she too is hearing odd noises. Footsteps can be heard upstairs in rooms locked and empty. A grand piano plays by itself. Voices and whispers echo throughout the house. As the emotionally fragile Grace begins to fall apart, the terrible truth becomes unavoidable: the house is haunted. But who, exactly, are the ghosts?This is such a great, classy ghost story, genuinely frightening without a drop of blood anywhere in sight. Nicole Kidman delivers a knockout performance as Grace, who is so tightly wound up that you keep waiting for her to explode at any given moment. The entire cast is awesome, if you want to know the truth. Fionnula Flanagan is kindly and sweet, but also scary as hell when she wants to be. Alakina Mann is seriously creepy as Anne, the somewhat sadistic older sister. The mansion and its surrounding grounds drip with Gothic horror, shrouded in mist, silence, neglected gravestones and fallen leaves. I suppose I ought to have seen the great twist ending coming, but I honestly never suspected a thing and was exhilarated by the revelation. Highlights include a scary voice in an empty storage room, a music room door that slams shut in Kidman's face, some eerie photographs of the dead and, of course, the great scene between Grace and an old, blind woman wearing her daughter's dress. Truly creepy stuff! Fans of films like The Changeling and The Eye will really love The Others. This is one of the best ghost stories I have ever seen, boasting an intelligent script, an awesome cast and a well thought out story filled with twists and turns and true horror. 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really a great masterpiece where a Spanish director shows there can be quality out of the Dream Factory that Hollywood actually is (I don't only say that because we share nationality). This movie shows how really great movies should be, and it has a hard to confuse classic taste. The way things are treated, the lack of explicits, and especially the lack of blood and/or gore makes this movie become a real classic since the first theatrical release. It's obvious that Mr. Amenábar just drank from the best sources (especially Hitchcock). Since "Poltergeist" I didn't see less killings in a whole movie, and, however, it's still chilling. Take example of these, you new filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film and although being a film buff experienced to the point of callousness (I watched the Exorcist a few weeks ago and was mildly amused), it touched a vein. I noticed at one point I was bent forward on the couch..The film has few if any flaws and is certainly one of the best I've seen this year. It's a delight to watch, with its attention to detail and the absence of any blatant anachronisms or plot holes.When I watched The Sixth Sense, I was disappointed. A spectacular plot twist was packaged in a very average film with average performances. The Others is so much more. It explores the human questions raised in a far better way and succeeds in creating a believable, living environment for the plot.It's predecessor remains a pale shadow, almost obliterated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this picture is just wonderful. It shows that you don't need special effects to scare the crap out of someone. I must say that without Nicholes and those kids (whoever they are) this film would have just been another 40 mil. grossing pic. Because of Nichole this film was so scary, the only other that has scared me like this was "The Eye" a terrifying film from over in Asia, directed by (I think the Pang brothers)- and the original "Candyman" (of course I was 12 then, and did the whole Candyman thing in the mirror more than once) I just know that even after I had seen it a couple times, I still got freaked out even though I knew the result. Maybe it is just me, but I know how very rare it is to get shocked and/or surprised by a PG-13 film, especially these days. Bravo to all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am still shocked and angry that this film was ignored by the Academy. It works with a precision and daring that are virtually nonexistent these days, lost as they are to sloppy filmmakers who justify any number of moronic choices in the interest of "keepin' it real," or some such nonsense. This film has been created with exceeding care and astonishing craft, and the strongest evidence of this is the difficulty in choosing any one area as superior. Everything is in balance, everything works. This is a gift to the world of fantasy films; or, if you prefer, simply a gift to the world. As good as "Moulin Rouge" was - and it was - this was Nicole Kidman's best performance. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Will Never Leave This House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To a certain extent, one's enjoyment of THE OTHERS will depend on how quickly you recognize the major plot device on which the entire film turns. Once recognition sets in, how much you are able to further enjoy the film will then depend on how much you have become engaged by the characters--and it is here, really, that the film stumbles a bit, not so much through the way it is done but rather through the way the characters must be played in order for their behavior to make sense at the film's conclusion.The premise, which seems deeply influenced by both Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW and the 1960s film version known as THE INNOCENTS, concerns a woman who resides with her two children in an isolated mansion following World War II. Her situation is dire: her husband is missing in action and presumed dead; her children suffer from a rare genetic disease that makes sunlight dangerous to them; her servants have departed in the night without a word of warning. The latter problem seems remedied by the arrival of new servants--but no sooner are they installed than odd happenings begin to occur. Is the woman going mad? Are the servants involved? Have intruders secretly entered the house? Or could it be--something unearthly? The cast is exceptionally good here, with Fionnula Flanagan as the newly arrived servant Mrs. Mills and children Alakina Mann and James Bentley giving remarkable performances. But the focus is on Nicole Kiddman as Grace, a role that Kiddman plays with a white-knuckled grip and considerable ferocity--so much so that it becomes extremely difficult to like, much less sympathize, with the character. In some respects, however, this is ultimately necessary for this extremely plot-driven film to have any significant impact, and in hindsight it is hard to imagine that the role could be played in any other way; still, hindsight does not allow you to engage fully with the character when you are in the midst of the film. It is a flaw, but it is an unavoidable one--and the film is so remarkably stylish that it largely overcomes both the anticipated plot-twist and Kiddman's necessarily ferocious performance.The production values are first rate all the way down the line. Everything looks right, sounds right, feels right. But two items deserve special mention: the exceptional soundtrack, which was composed by director Alejandro Amenabar himself, and the stunning cinematography, which has tremendous visual texture and which neatly blends a fluidity of movement with a remarkably claustrophobic feel. If your tastes run to special effects and blood-spatter horror films, you are likely to disappointed, for there are none in THE OTHERS; Amenabar craftily creates tension more via what is suggested rather than shown, and doors left ajar and half-heard sounds are his devices of choice; it is all very subtle and yet remarkably chilling.The DVD package is a double-disk set, with the film on one disk and bonuses on the other. Although the bonuses are often quite interesting--particularly a documentary on individuals who actually suffer from hyper-sensitively to sunlight--they actually contribute little to the film itself, and it is a bit surprising that such a small bonus package would require a second disk. The sound for the feature is also problematic re home viewing, and I recommend that viewers play it at top volume, for there is no middle ground--everything is very quiet or very loud, and the contrast adds tremendously to the film's effect.It is extremely difficult to know how to rate this film, for as I've noted the very nature of the story has two embedded flaws: the almost inevitable recognition of the major plot device and the necessity of Kiddman's over-the-top performance. But even though I recognized the nature of the plot device very early in the film, and even though I found "Grace" an unlikeable woman, this did not actually prevent me from feeling the icy breath with which director Amenabar endows THE OTHERS.

		<fullReview>I reluctantly sat down last night and watched this movie. I'm no fan of horror movie, since it's mostly stuff like "boo!" and the only purpose is to make you jump, but this film is different. It's subtle and it builds up the tension all the way to the surprising ending. There's hardly any special effects and the film relies a lot on the actors, whom all are excellent (especially Kidman and the children). This movie is made in a simple way, but it's so much better and effective then the big budget, CGI filled ones.A break down of the plot then: A women (Kidman) lives alone with her two children on the Channel Islands just after World War II. Her two children are allergic to strong light which means that the house must be in semi darkness all the time. When three new servants arrive, strange stuff starts to happen.Great, absolutely great. This movie feels so realistic. I highly recommend it for someone that wants to see a smart, well done, well written, effective horror movie8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome change to the usual Hollywood shock-horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did enjoy this film. I felt it was cleverly thought out and, despite the many comparisons to the Sixth Sense (released 1999, two years before), I would emphasise that it is a completely different film. True, in concept, the "surprise" ending is the same, but the way the film reaches that conclusion is very different. In fact there is less of an attempt to hide the "truth" as numerous clues to the final outcome are indicated all the way through The Others, whereas The Sixth Sense is more subtle and subliminal requiring a second viewing. With The Others you think "ah yes, of course" whilst The Sixth Sense was "wait a minute, that's not right".Also, this film is a refreshing change from the recent Hollywood approach, that would have no doubt sprinkled the film with high-speed camera views rushing through the house, numerous special effects, a full compliment of glamorous nubile (american) teenagers, a few gory murders and a more conclusive ending. No, like the Blair Witch Project, The Changling and The Haunting the horror is often in what you don't see - allowing the viewer's imagination to do all the work.As for Nicole Kidman, I'm not so sure, but Fionnula Flanagan probably carries the film anyway. Nice to see Eric Sykes as well.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was quite a good movie, although not a top 250. It's more creepy than scary, in a very traditional way-huge, old house, constant darkness and fog, and servants who aren't quite what they appear to be. The whole film takes place either in the house or on the grounds, which makes it somewhat visually tiring but also pretty effective. There are some loose ends which don't exactly get tied up-where is her husband? Clearly he knows what happened even if his wife does not yet("I asked them about that day..." or words to that effect). You don't get as many clues along the way as you do in "The Sixth Sense" and you get the feeling that they're all just going to stay there until infinitely, forever a young mother and two small children. It held my interest and I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best mainstream supernatural thriller of the decade!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a while, everything is a fad in Hollywood. It happened to slashers (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween), it happened to dumbed down, gross-out teen flicks (American Pie, Not Another Teen Movie, Scary Movie) and the supernatural thriller is no exception. Once Hollywood witnessed reactions to The Blair Witch Project, all sorts of mainstream actors and actresses jumped on board the horror film's prettier sister, the supernatural thriller. The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, and The Others were all mainstream hits.That is often a bad thing, but not in this film, which is a good old, classic Gothic film, reminiscent of some of hammer's best work, at least in terms of style.The film takes you on a suspenseful and sometimes frightening roller-coaster (I even screamed)! Nicole Kidman is as wonderful as ever and very convincing as the mother, and so is the rest of the cast.A brilliant mainstream film, and definitely worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman (in a spellbinding performance) plays Grace, the WW2-era mother of two. She was left behind to live in a rather huge chateau while her husband went off to war. However, after the war is over, Grace doubts that her husband will ever return. In the meanwhile, she takes care of her two light-sensitive children with the help of a few servants. But, strange events begin to occur in Grace's home. In a matter of time, Grace begins to fear that there are other spirits or ghosts haunting her home.To reveal too many details of the plot would ruin the magic that 'The Others' works on you at the end. It's a twist ending that grabs you and makes you see the entire film in a different way. The same way that 'The Sixth Sense' did. But comparing to 'The Others' to Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' could translate into disappointment. The trouble spot is in the pacing of the film. Like in Shyamalan's film, 'The Others' creates its suspension through the tension felt by its characters. However, Shyamalan was a mastermind when it came to keeping its audience riveted. In 'The Others', there are numerous scenes that go on way too long for their own good. Thus, at times the film feels unwatchable. No matter, despite its flaws, 'The Others' works a spell on you.Rating: 7/10 or (3 stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very skeptical about this one. The trailer looked like this was another boring movie the likes of "The Haunting", and boy did I not want to see something like that again. But somehow my friend convinced me to go see it and I'm really glad I did.It was the perfect movie for a rainy Friday night in April.To begin with, this movie probably contains the best performance delivered by Nicole Kidman. She is very believable and was a perfect choice. The two young actors were even better. Is it these magical and brilliant thrillers("Sixth sense", "Unbreakable") that bring the best out of children actors, or is it just my imagination. Anyway, a brilliant movie that can easily be compared to Shyamalan's "Sixth sense", especially the ending part, but in my opinion a very different movie. I consider the comparison to be flattering, since "Sixth sense" is well, an amazing and unprecedented movie experience, and "The others" produces a similar atmosphere, but it ends there. This movie takes its own path, and it does so very successfully. To make a horror movie without any blood, simply by playing with sound and light is extraordinary, and I realized it only after I read a review by a great Slovene film critic. Great, great acting, a thrilling and exciting story and of course a brilliant ending make this one of the best movie of 2001 and Alejandro Amenábar passed his first Hollywood movie making experience with flying colors. Almost. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high hopes, having read nothing but praise for a horror movie going back to the basic belief that the true scares come from something that you don't see rather than something you do. And to an extent, this movie delivers.However, the premise is let down by terrible acting (especially the children), and a script that seems to be setting you up for a surprise ending which never arrives. It contains many of what I thought were red herrings, leading you away from its true finale, but they were simply pointers to where the movie was taking you.Another recent movie to do this was The Sixth Sense. Where that movie differs was the fact even if you did guess the ending, the characters, acting and story were all top notch, so the entire movie didn't just rely on one twist.And the worst crime of all for a horror movie: the characters were all so unlikeable and annoying that you really did want to see them suffer. You can't be scared for someone if you don't identify with them.This sort of movie has been done a number of times, and usually with more success. At least it wasn't a special effects extravaganza like The Haunting. That's the only thing it has going for it.3 / 10 - I have seen worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems overly simple to classify "The Others" as a cross between classic Hitchcock and "The Sixth Sense" . . . mostly, because that implies "The Others" is a film of that highest caliber. It's certainly not. However, it's not awful, either; instead "The Others" unfortunately falls into the film limbo of being just plain mediocre. "The Others" is a suspense/horror film owing a lot to its predecessors from the 1940s -- it relies on mood, atmosphere, and the casts to create the eerie mood that permeates the film, and never falls back on gratuitous gore to create its horrors. The look and feel of "The Others" is very much that of a vintage Universal film; in fact, if this film had been made in black &amp; white, and if a digital CGI version of Lana Turner could be inserted in Nicole Kidman's place, you would probably swear that this was a forgotten suspense/horror film from that era. It's definitely not a classic -- there's a number of significant issues that add up together to keep "The Others" far, far short of greatness -- but it's an interesting film nonetheless."The Others" is, at its heart, a vintage ghost story -- on a small island off the shores of England, there is a forlorn manor house located far away from the trappings of civilization. Living in this isolated house are the elegant Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. While odd, these rules are vital, Grace explains, because Anne and Nicholas are so allergic to the sunlight that they might die if exposed to it. The servants, led by the wise Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), accede to these rules . . . but they begin to hears voices. And things going bump in the night. So do Anne and Nicholas. Grace doesn't hear these things, or at least she claims not to, which slowly but surely leads to the questions: Are these new servants creating the disturbances for some sinister purpose? Is troubled Anne creating them? Is Grace? Or does something really lurk within the walls of the manor house, something long-dead, something evil . . ."The Others" relies on its pacing and direction to create its ominous mood. This reliance is both the film's strength and ultimate downfall. Director Alejandro Amenabar lets the viewer savor each moment of the film, building suspense from scene to scene at a slow and steady pace, dropping subtle hints about what has happened and what's going to happen with a very deft touch . . . he really lets things build slowly. In fact, too slowly. "The Sixth Sense" also moved along at an unhurried pace, but at least that film had the good sense to know that in order to maintain the slow pace, some sort of payoff -- or at least a good scare -- has to be tossed out the audience once in awhile, if only to keep some interest and to prevent the film from spiraling into mind-numbing boredom. "The Others" has no sense of this. An hour into the film, the luxurious pace of "The Others" has become little more than self-indulgent tedium. The process of building tension degenerates into pure impatience. There's only two moments in "The Others" that can genuinely be considered "jump-out-of-your-seat" moments; if there had been three or four more of these moments, the film might've averted its slow, steady crash into monotony. Yes, some of the scenes are extremely impressive, and I was particularly impressed with a lot of the cinematography, as well as the richness of the dialogue . . . but these things only can carry a film so far. They have to lead to some kind of ultimate payoff in order to truly mean anything, and in the case of "The Others", that payoff never comes. It's a nice film with some wicked little touches, a few of which border on pure genius . . . and then the film ends. No build-up to a dramatic resolution -- or, for that matter, a satisfying resolution. For that reason, "The Others" can be appreciated for what it is trying to accomplish, and for the techniques it uses . . . but in no way, shape, or form can the end result be called a success. It's a shame, because it seems as though it wouldn't have taken much to turn "The Others" from a bland film into one that was grippingly tense.Though billed as the star of this film, Nicole Kidman falls just short of providing the strength that "The Others" needed from its central character -- the film revolves mostly around her character's beliefs and perceptions, and she's simply not up to the task of making those beliefs and perceptions one thousand percent convincing. Personally, I've always found Ms. Kidman to be somewhat of an acting enigma -- she's undeniably talented, but apart from her tour de force performance in "To Die For", she always appears to be struggling to find the right outlet for her talent. There's flashes of brilliance from Ms Kidman in "The Others", but that's it, only flashes -- overall, the performance is uneven. I found myself wondering what the film would've been like had it featured either Julianne Moore or Helena Bonham Carter as its star. Fortunately, there's a "sleeper" star in this film, one I would hope to see in many films in the years to come: Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's young daughter Anne. As Anne, this young actress shows both strength and vulnerability with a powerful range, one rarely seen in young actors and actresses today. She's asked to go head-to-head with Ms. Kidman on a number of occasions in the film, and not only does Ms. Mann hold her own, she shines through like a champion. If nothing else, "The Others" might be worth watching simply to see Alakina Mann's superb performance."The Others" probably could never have been made without the success of the equally low-key "Sixth Sense". "The Others", though, while possessing an undeniable sense of style and grace, is a film ultimately without a lot to say . . . or a lot to give to its audience. As such, "The Others" is a film with some interesting qualities, some more enjoyable than others -- but it's ultimately little more than an okay film that goes on way longer than it should. "Interesting" doesn't always mean "good" -- and with "The Others", this is certainly the case. Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others (originally titled The Darkness when I saw it 3 months ago in a private screening) tells the story of a widow, Nicole Kidman plays her with scritness and is actually fitted well for it, and her children. Now these kids aren't like other ones, as they have to stay in the dark all the time, or else something bad will happen to them. Things seem OK, and they're are new housekeepers hired, but then things of a supernatural nature begin to occur.The film is in the bloodline of such films as The Sixth Sense and on that level I can say this movie is fairly decent enough. It gives fine scares here and there and it has a really crackerjack ending that will have some people talking, but in the end of the movie, do we care about the lot of the characters? Director Amenabar gives good detail to the period and to the shocks, but the plot could've used some work. B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is way too slow and relies way to much on atmosphere to be involving. The story is thin and the ending is trite. Nicole Kidman is her usual limited self. The production design and cinematography are very nice but not good enough to save this film (or its audience) from the doldrums.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Others isn't your typical ghost story; there isn't the quantity of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills you'd expect to find in a film like this. In fact, The Others is virtually chill-free for the first hour. But what The Others lacks in quantity, it makes up in quality. Instead of a roller coaster of cheap chills and thrills, The Others takes a much denser and darker approach to the ghost story.The Others takes a considerable amount of time to set everything up - almost too much. Halfway through the movie I wondered if there was going to be a pay off. Ultimately there is quite a pay off, but it takes so long to get there you might not feel it's 'worth it'. Despite the fact that I found The Others to be quite slow, I did enjoy it. Nicole Kidman does a great job as the neurotic and tortured lead, and she's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar lights almost the entire movie by candle light, something I haven't seen since Barry Lyndon. This gives The Others a soft and warm look that is uncommon to the genre. Amenabar also makes light a character in the film, where daylight becomes much scarier than the warmth and comfort of the dark. If you're planning on seeing The Others, I'd advise you to avoid reading any reviews which talk about the plot. The film takes a number of twists and turns which can easily be spoiled. This might be a good film to wait for DVD, except for the risk of the plot getting spoiled before you get a chance to see it.</fullReview>

What even..no words for how bored I was. Seriously.. yeah I know, total spoiler but you were going to find out anyway, might as well let you know before you get even more disappointed.Appearing as 'your typical ghost story' is complete rubbish.

		<shortDescription>A ghost story guaranteed to scare the pants off you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great ghost story; genuinely scary, particularly if you are seeing it for the first time. It's a haunted house movie and the less you know about it the better. It's also something of a chamber piece. It has a small, compact cast and only once does it leave the house or its grounds, (and then only for a chilly walk in the foggy woods). Nicole Kidman is the mother protective of her children to the point where we wonder about her sanity and she's magnificent. It's the best thing she's done so far, (leaving her Oscar-winning turn in "The Hours" in the shade). Fionnula Flanagan is the matronly Irish servant who arrives at her door looking for work with a mute Elaine Cassidy and gardener Eric Sykes in tow.The young Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar both wrote and directed the film with great skill as well as composing the haunting score. He also gets great performances from the children. Indeed, this is the kind of movie that will appeal to children while scaring the pants off them. They may identify with the children in the film although that probably won't be to their advantage. Comparisons with "The Innocents" will, of course, be drawn and rightly so; this is just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice movie with a good atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a story about a woman living in a big house with her two kids and servants. Her husband is in war and the kids have an extraordinary allergy with sunlight, so the rooms must be darkened at all times the kids are around. Suddenly strange things start to happen in the house and the family is starting to figure out that everything isn't completely normal. Normally i hate horror movies and Hollywood thrillers, especially psychological thrillers (meaning the main character is a schizophrenic)but this movie made an exception. If you like to keep up a good tight tension while watching a movie i really recommend this one! Nicole Kidman played her role convincingly and the plot was interesting throughout the movie. It kept in few sudden scary moments which made my heart stop but mainly it was a interesting film that kept me hooked all the time. |!!This part may contain a small spoiler!!| The only thing i didn't like about the film was that the ending was totally the same as in Sixth Sense: All the main characters were actually dead and the dead ones were the ones living. I mostly enjoyed this movie more than the Sixth Sense but the final catch was the one thing i think they shouldn't have copied. After all the Others was a really enjoyable movie that you shouldn't miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that entices our interest in ghost stories.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the second time on British TV last night and enjoyed it immensely - isn't hindsight a great thing? When I saw it originally, Nicole Kidman was in Moulon Rouge around on DVD at the same time so it was interesting to see just how very different the two roles were. As Grace in THE OTHERS she plays the proverbial, religious up tight woman who is clearly suffering from mental illness due to the absence of her husband who has not returned from the war. It's '1945 so where is he?Jersey was occupied by the Nazis for some five years , well of course he died . AS the film moves along very slowly and Grace becomes more and more highly strung by the 'supernatural happenings'she rejects, it is clear to the viewer that all is not what we are meant to believe and it is true that if you are familiar with Amenabar's work, you will start to figure out where the film is heading but not how, however I don't believe all those who said they guessed the ending in the first half hour because the action and the plot is handled too well. To keep comparing it to the Sixth Sense is a spoiler in itself and unfair to audiences who have not seen the movie. For those who could not understand why the husband returned only to go away again think I have grasped it. He returned in the fog looking suitably haunted, he is already dead but as a ghost has come back to the house to confront Grace as to why she killed his children. I think we have to assume that she has not been a ghost that long when he returned or indeed when the film starts and that the main reason for her despair was the loss of her husband, she probably killed the children towards the end of the WW11 and killed herself when she realised he would not return. He had to leave her because he did not die there with her but in the War somewhere else, and therefore returned probably only in her imagination. Her existence as a ghost who cannot rest is guilt driven by the violence of her own death and that is why we are seeing her(not realising at the time that she is a ghost),as a mirror image and she is a dysfunctional, not very kind woman driven so strongly by religion and by a sort of paranoid protectiveness towards her two children who are both excellent in their roles. Other viewers may interpret this aspect of the film differently but I think it does answer the plothole regarding Christopher Eccleston's character.THE OTHERS is a highly enjoyable, extremely watchable old fashioned ghost story that is reminiscent of what is best from the genre - no swearing, no violence and no blood. It is a well told and well directed movie which will keep those who have not seen it guessing until the end, and it is explained at the end which often fails with other films of its type. Kidman surpasses herself and Amenabar should be proud of such a absorbing piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, incomplete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie would have profited by being much shorter. Nicole Kidman spent so much time running around, opening and closing doors that any interest I had in the story had pretty well faded by the time things started happening. It struggled to find its genre - is it a horror story, a mystery, a thriller - I certainly can't work out?Everything - the setting - the fog - the mystery servants promised excitement - instead it only delivered a few tingles. And so many unanswered questions. Why did the husband return? Was he alive or dead? Why were there only the graves of the three servants on the property - surely someone else was buried there? If all the "other people" were in the house - why did the children only see the little boy? No - if you are going to do something similar to this,you have to satisfactorily tie off the ends - and at least make an effort to give reasons for things that occur.Nicole Kidman was frenetic and annoying (I suppose she was meant to be that way, but it didn't make for empathy with her and her plight!). The 2 children were excellent, particularly the girl - they at least were believable. The husband looked like the walking dead (maybe that was the point - did I miss it?). What a disappointment this movie was to me - I had heard so much about it and expected more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others is a brilliant thriller with excellent performances by all involved. Nicole Kidman brought us into her tormented world very quickly as did her children. The three members of the house staff were the icing on the cake, keeping us guessing as to their real intentions. The presence of the intruders in the house was pure 'Hitchcock' suspense. This movie was well presented, without the need for huge amounts of blood and gore allowing us to let our imaginations run free.

		<fullReview>The tag line basically tells you all you need to know. I guess properly about the new house keepers. but it wasn't until Grace Stewart's(Nichole Kidman) husband Charles(Christopher Eccleston) showed up that I knew absolutely where the story was going and I could have turned it off at that point ("Sometimes I bleed"). One of the old horror techniques is to place the dead individual in a place where they couldn't leave, hence fog. Charles steps out of the fog and tells his wife he has come to say goodbye because he has to go back to the front. If you have time and want just a light, predictable, but fairly decent movie, this is good for that. I haven't purchased it, I rented it. It is probably worth a rental fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film let down by poor acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading good reviews i thought i would watch 'The Others' alone on at night for a bit of a fright. The atmosphere was chilling and the actual plot was a very well written and quite a scary ghost story. Its a shame the movie was let down completely by acting. What could have been a great psychological horror ruined by a cast that seem to think they are in a comedy film. The accents, the facial expressions and some of the dialogue (more how it was expressed) made parts of what could have been one of the best horror films of the 2000's unwatchable. I gave this movie a 3/10 but i can understand why it is rated highly down to the plot. Id say if you have plenty of spare time watch this movie anyway if you can see past the terrible acting, if not i recommend 'the orphanage' a similar but much better acted Spanish film that will genuinely creep you out</fullReview>

Nicole Kidman, although playing the role well, played the role of an annoying neurotic. Sorry, hard to have much sympathy with her character. And as it went on, things often did not make sense. Some plot elements contributed nothing to the story and seemed to be no more than distractions. I just did not like the way it played out, waiting for the tension to build but it never really did. And worst of all, when the surprise ending arrived, I felt cheated. Of course, I can't explain why without revealing the whole plot. Pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can one add to a masterpiece?The cast is superb, the dialogues are perfect, the house is both creepy and engaging, and the rhythm is just as it must be.I had my quibbles about Kidman, but she surely shows why she could act so well in "The Hours". She's just great. Such a pent up neurotic would steer one inch and she would become a caricature. Instead, every gesture is perfect, every fit of hysteria just has to be there. Like every note in a Bach sonata. Her icy, statuesque beauty, allure and hairdo (!) make it all "come together". The scene in an unexpected sexy white night gown asking for love from his estranged husband is a small, very small gem :).Cinematography is BEAUTIFUL, I want to live in this house! (Unocuppied if possible :)). To all of us who have read "The castle of Otranto" in loony early teens, this was what Walpole was talking about :)!Horror is the contrary to gore. It's atmosphere, not ketchup. This is more of a psychological study (and a lesson in acting, let us not forget "Fionnula Flanagan" and Grace's bratty daughter. By the way, I LOVE everybody's English usage, and how it reveals class differences between "Master and servant". Body language too!This is a MENTAL drama, the plot wisely gives us SOME keys to keep us engaged, but never enough to foresee what's coming. At least not me! "kate_hartshorn" (Irvine, CA) is right: this could well be a practical case of a "psychology of perception" course. And I agree with Mr. Kleinman from Portland (also on Amazon) that one should better NOT read much before the film. I was lucky enough this time to only watch the pictures and a general look at the cast. Had I read even Amazon's "plot keywords" would have basically spoilt all the fun (as it has, many times before).I didn't really FEEL much for the characters, although I confess I suffered with poor troubled Grace. I give it a ten although, for I suspect it follows the "rules of the genre" that preclude any glorious and hefty monologue alla "Pacino" or something heroic, political or socially relevant. I can't see how this film could be improved, but I am not so sure it would stand a "second viewing". At least, not in the near future. And certainly NOT a third one!! I suspect this is what separates the films that you "carry to the grave" to other "mental exercises". Like some piano players like Perahia, with perfect technique, but somewhat lacking "soul".</fullReview>

Kidman has done some good movies, some mediocre movies, and even a few what we would call bad movies. This is not one of them. She is terrific. She plays the mother of two terribly sick children living on an island off of England during World War II who has just lost her husband. She hires three strangers who just happen to have worked in her home previously and begins to have strange occurrences happen soon afterward. The movie takes awhile to come full circle but it once it has you in it's grip it won't let you go. It is fiendishly scary and the buildup to the finale is filled with tension and suspense. Another great twist ending and a real barn burner at that. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

I hate those normally, but the boy is really good, with that embodied innocence. *** spoilers *** And I really like the part where the ex-husband returns home. Sad, cold romance at its best.

		<shortDescription>If Only M. Night Shyamalan Did This . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely chilling and suspenseful, and though I didn't get "scared," I was certainly surprised by the delicious twist ending.Nicole Kidman plays a mother of two, burdened by the responsibilities of caring for Anne and Nicholas, who both cannot be exposed to sunlight, imprisoning her in a world of darkness, as well as the mysterious whereabouts of her husband, fighting in the war. All of this is fraying her dwindling energy. And there are references throughout the movie about "the day Mummy went mad." I loved how the story was manipulated, how throughout the entire film we as the audience are suckered into the belief that the "others" are the phantoms trying to shoo them away. Instead, it's them, they are the dead and the "others" are the frightened living, as the day Mummy went mad refers to the day that woman killed her children and shot herself.That spooking performance of Mrs. Mills was just breathtaking. As she knew everything and withheld it gave her a sinister aura, until at the end, it turns out all she was doing was sincerely helping.However, there were a few scenes that I found a bit corny. The over-dramatic explanations of the "doors always being shut," the overwhelming music being played during the most, if I may, apathetic scenes, it all led me to wonder how much better it could've been if a grand master like Shyamalan created this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a lot to recommend it and yet I found it ultimately rather predictable and little more (in terms of plot) than a protracted tease.Having said that, it is beautifully shot - lots of shadow, fog and flickering lamps. The camera angles are intelligent and the screenplay is thoughtful and convincing.I rather feel that this film will appeal to those viewers who like ghost stories and do not expect any more than dramatic music and a sinister build-up to the denouement. It does not have the Gothic magic of Sleepy Hollow but the acting is impressive - especially from the two children Alakina Mann and James Bentley who were both fantastic. It was also wonderful to see Eric Sykes in his cameo role.Nicole Kidman does a good job with what she has to do but I feel she is too good an actress to spend ninety minutes looking wide-eyed and frightened.Worth seeing but not a truly great film.

		<shortDescription>Come up with an original idea ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I thought well where have I seen that precipice before. Oh yeah, The Sixth Sense!!!! Come on, you can at least come up with your own idea for a movie. If this was original, I would have been wowed (like when I saw the Sixth Sense for the first time), but it just stinks that this movie would be considered. It is typical Hollywood though where they will play an idea to death till America is sick of seeing it (ie still photography like in the Matrix).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first off I noticed this movie is insanely high, it's in the top 250 (I forget where) and I really did not like this movie. The acting was good, the premise was good, but the plot was utterly predictable and the dialogue was just awful. and this whole "secret ending/twist?" I think that anyone who saw the Sixth Sense could see it coming. This movie is overly hyped, and ranked way too high. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was supposed to be a horror film? Maybe it was meant to just make the audience dumber from watching it so that they would think that it was good. This movie rode on Nicole Kidman's coat tails, basically needing her fame to succeed with any type of movie-goer response. i really cannot believe that i made it past the first hour... but i have a thing against walking out on movies. the not-so-surprising twist at the end really leaves you with the feeling that you can never get the last two hours of your life back. i could have been sleeping!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is really a disappointment. The director must have thought: mix some ingredients like "old and lonely house with a lot of fog around" + "nervous mother" + "strange servants" + "darkness" and I'll get a blockbuster... But it doesn't work, because these are all stereotypes. The only stress I got from this movie was because of it's stupidity - there's no logic. Why don't they all leave the house if they are so afraid? Why is the mother not going to a doctor with their children who both have this strange disease? --- The only answer can be: because then there's no plot for a movie. The acting of Nicole Kidman fits the movie: overdone... All in all I must say that it's a waste of time to watch it. The best thing about it is the darkness, so you don't have to watch every ridiculous detail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pain, suffering, forever....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who perhaps do not know, "The Others" is a movie produced by Tom Cruise starring his estranged wife, Nicole Kidman.That is all that I can say good about this farce which through clever advertising would pass itself off as some sort of horror thriller. It is in due time about as thrilling as having chewing gum stuck to the sole of your shoe. Sitting through the whole movie is as pleasant as removing the afore-mentioned gum from your shoe.Early in the film while speaking about religeon, Ms Kidman mentions pain, suffering forever. That is what you will feel if you sit through the whole film.......If Ms. Kidman could act as well as, say, Sissy Spacek in "Carrie," if the children acted like accomplished child actors rather than like a couple of kids you picked up at the corner store, if someone (Tom?) cared about making a good flick rather than a fast buck then perhaps the screenplay could have been rewritten to have some redeeming moments. Perhaps the cast should have just improvised the whole thing; it could not have been any worse.It is a shame Hollywood can put out a movie as awful as this, and it will make money in spite of it's being a stinker. Everyone involved with this fiasco should be ashamed of themselves, but of course, the money will assuage their pain. Shame on you, Hollywood! Shame on you, Tom, Nicole! And shame on you, dear reader, if you should fall victim to this film and fail to tell your friends how very bad it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've frequently avoided seeing hyped films until they, well, sort of cool off a bit. I don't like being disappointed. Don't watch this film. OK, watch it, but don't rent it. And if you have seen The Sixth Sense, it doesn't take more than five minutes to realize the concept. And that, that is very disappointing indeed. It may not be very long, but it certainly feels like it. But I admit that Nicole Kidman's constant terror of every single object in the house, whether it's door-knobs, skillets or furniture, will make your skin crawl. Not out of terror, but because you desperately want the film to end so you can do more useful things, like washing windows or getting very, very drunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it is good that it is like old horror movies...but how can people classify it if they haven't SEEN the movies they're comparing it to?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I've seen The Others. I liked it. Really, I did. But does anyone else think it's being just a tad bit overrated? (C'mon it's in the top 250! It's not even close to being that good). The film is set in the 1940's, where Nicole Kidnan's character inherits a large house where she and her children live. i doesn't take long before three people show up, wanting the job to be "housekeepers" you may say. There are a few strange rules. Nicole Kidman states that no door must be opened without the previous one being closed. This is because her children can die if they are exposed to too much sunlight. This is as far as I'm gonna go regarding the basic story, or I may give away some stuff.And now, my complaints: First off, I've noticed that many people commonly remark how great this film is because it's not at all gory or bloody, and its slow paced, giving it time to move. Now, since WHEN has the idea going around that movies that are slow-paced are classics? You are wrong. I do not mind slow-paced movies, AS LONG AS THERE IS A REASON TO BE SLOW PACED! You can not just slap a movie together, and then pan it out to 2 and a half hours, and then think it's going to be good. It's not a gory or bloody movie. No problem...that's usually a good thing. However, that's cannot save a movie if it has no plot.Don't get me wrong, The Others DOES have a plot. In fact, it's one that has been used more than once. You may even notice many people compare this movie to The Sixth Sense. It's not THAT bad, like I said, I DON'T hate this movie. I just think it doesn't deserve near as credit as it's given. I even like the way Alejandro Amenábar directs, and I have high hopes for him in the future. I just think the movie could've been just as successful in a time span of an hour and a half.This movie is very much on the right track. And it could've been better if it was handled differently. If you think about it, ANY story can be made great when dealed with in the right way. I just can't help but think that there are so many great horror movies out there that people overlook.There is a recommendation from me of a great horror movie. The Other (1972). Ironic how close the names are.Final score: 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Others" is a solid horror film. It is different than most horror films in that it is restrained. The director doesn't rely on excessive violence or gore,in fact it is almost non existent. The movie works because of the atmosphere of the picture. It has an ominous feel throughout. The twist at the end is also very good. The acting is quite good and Nicole Kidman is as good in this as she ever has been. The two child actors are very impressive as well. Recommended.

There was absolutely nothing to this movie until the end. Half the time, me and my friend were laughing at the movie. Nicole is beautiful, but holding a shotgun was hilarious. I was tempted to shout "Hail to the king, baby!!" And then with the door, who didn't know that was going to happen? And the kids screaming because of light, reminded me so much of the part in Interview with the Vampire, where Kristen gets fried. Though, Nicole does play a good crazy person.

		<fullReview>The movie is awfully boring and i almost fell asleep while I watched it. The movie tells us about a few people who think they're alive 'till the end when they realize they're actually dead. BORING! Nothing really happens all the time, just a few screams. Not to mention that everything so chaotic you don't realize why things go that way you don't realize why the boring characters act that way. I'm not sure if the director realized what should be the next scene, so he just filmed everything in a chaotic manner. There are far better movies so don't waste your time on this one - you'll not feel satisfaction after it, not to mention how confused you'll be about whether you or the world has gone so wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started in a very unorganized and mysterious way.After seeing the house you can tell there is a big secret behind those walls. Kids allergic to sunlight doesn't seem right and real. The mother is just crazy and insecure, left by her husband who went to war (later on when he is coming back for a couple days and then he leaves again, even though he really doesn't have to) . We would recommend the movie to the people who like to analyze and solve problems which appear in the movie.It takes a person who is very interested in this kind of movie to be able to get it.If you are not interested you won't get the moral of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite an interesting idea for a story, some people move into a new house and the children suspected that the place is haunted. BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, she has two children who are apparently allergic to sunlight and will die if they get too much. Anyway, after a little while the children hear noises and see shadows, and they say the house is haunted. Only the maid believes them, but soon enough Grace starts to worry as well. Eventually they find out the terrifying secret, that the servants looking after the house are dead. But then the even spookier shock, they are dead too! Also starring Christopher Eccleston as Charles Stewart. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. It was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** SPOILERS **I'm must say sorry in advance to all the Nicole Kidman or The Others fans out there, but I think this is such an over rated that the only good thing about this film is the ending.Why do I think it's so bad, well for a start this has 6th Sense (for those who had not seen the others and seen the 6th Sense) written all over it, and the ending is more or less the same. Another thing that bugged me was Nicole Kidman, I have nothing against her, as I think she is a top draw actress, BUT in the scenes with Chris Eccelston (and why he is not a star I'll never know) Mr Eccelston dominates the screen when he is on. Eccelston made this more interesting for me to watch, and it's a shame he was not in more often.The whole film looks like it has been copied from 6th Sense (which is a much better film), but the people who made it, and made little changes in it, and marketed it to make it look a new idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can so many people be so sheltered?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm astounded by the hype.When The Others was first released on these shores, people were talking about it as if it represented a groundbreaking new genre. It was as if the critics had never seen a haunted house movie before - and despite the glowing recommendations and boundless praise, the 'highlights' that got screened on TV to promote the movie seemed cheap, obvious and just plain silly.So, in light of all the hype, I avoided the movie until it was screened on TV this evening.What a load of cobblers.For a start, The Others isn't creepy in the slightest. Robert Wise's original version of The Haunting was creepy. And some of the scenes in Peter Medak's The Changeling were unsettling in the extreme. The Uninvited got it right as far back as 1944, and yet The Others succeeds in doing little more than rattling chains and shouting BOO! Perhaps part of the problem is the lack of subtlety - I got the whole story at the end of the séance sequence. It said all that needed saying. But just in case you weren't paying attention we're treated to a painfully contrived monologue that renders many of the most effective sequences utterly redundant. It's this lack of regard for the viewer's intelligence that ultimately lets the movie down, as it degenerates into cheap cliché rather than genuine chills.Or maybe the problem is its lack of originality. I love horror movies. In particular, I love the really scary ones - which are usually very different to the really gory ones. In watching The Others, it seemed as if Amenábar were simply making a list of 'things a ghost story should have'. At times, I felt like I were being treated to selected scenes from The Haunting or The Changeling, but without the tension or elegance of either.And - spoilers ahoy - the moment I saw Eric Sykes cover those gravestone, I saw the ending coming a mile off. But let's not have any more comparisons with the Sixth Sense, as we'd already seen the same shock ending in movies like Dead and Buried or Blade Runner - and I'm sure they weren't the first to do it either.In all, The Others proved to be as engaging, frightening and unsettling as Jan De Bont's laughable remake of The Haunting.If you've never seen a haunted house movie before, please have fun and enjoy The Others. If, like me, you've been spoiled by all the really great stuff that came before, and genuinely enjoy a good cinematic scare, give it a very wide berth. Check out The Devil's Backbone instead - it's pure undiluted terror by comparison.</fullReview>
