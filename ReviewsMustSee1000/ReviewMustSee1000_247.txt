		<shortDescription>Fun and moving story about a teenager under pressure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Kind of a Funny Story" is based on the book of the same title in which Ned Vizzini tells of his experience checking himself into an adult psychiatric ward at the suggestion of a suicide hotline. The film by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck is lighter than their previous two films, "Half Nelson" and "Sugar", which deal with drug addiction and an immigrant's experience. Still the issue of teenage suicide is a serious one, even though Vizzini's book, and Boden/Fleck's screenplay, treat it with many comedic moments. Keir Gilchist from "The United States of Tara" is nuanced and convincing in the lead role, and is backed up by a strong supporting cast led by Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. If you can remember or relate to what it is to be a teenager under pressure from school, parents, friends, and life in general you will like this movie. It will make you laugh, cry, and be glad to be alive--isn't that what film is all about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of nice that Hollywood can still offer a non-commercial, very moving film like this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Craig (Keir Gilchrist) is depressed. Although his parents (Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan) are nice, they are a mildly over-achieving duo who try to gently push their teenage son in a certain direction. This means going to a competitive high school and following a specific curriculum. But, even though Craig is quite intelligent, his stress level is very high and he dreams of "jumping off a bridge". One morning, before sunrise, he sneaks out of the house to contemplate his own suicide but ends up going to a hospital emergency room. The teen insists they admit him. They do. However, the adolescent ward is undergoing renovations and doesn't have room for Craig. Instead, he is placed in the adult psych ward, with a nearly catatonic roommate, Muqtada (Bernard White). In short order, Craig wants to go home but his new shrink, Dr. Eden (Viola Davis) says that is impossible, he must remain for five days. Fortunately, he soon makes friends with an affable patient named Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) and casts his eye on a lovely young female Noelle (Emma Roberts), who bears telltale scars on her wrists. These three strike up a friendship, with Bobby schooling Craig on how to "dress up like an employee" and leave the ward, at least temporarily! It is quickly evident, however, that Bobby has some dark secrets, as does Noelle, and Muqtada seems to be going nowhere fast. Can Craig get the help he needs, even as he helps others? This is a lovely film which highlights the topic of mental illness in a sensitive, intelligent way. Yes, there are patients with more severe troubles than others but all remain part of the human race, as shown here. The cast is great, with Gilchrist doing a fantastic job as the film's main character. Galifianakis, Roberts, Davis, and especially White, do great work too, as do all of the lesser actors. The setting is fairly limited, as most of the action takes place in the hospital, and the costumes are suitably drab, although Roberts looks very pretty in whatever she wears. Then, too, the script is comically insightful while the direction and camera work are quite nice. All in all, if you are hoping to watch a great film that touches the heart, with depth, view this one kind of soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Script, and all around movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real treat about this movie is the performance from Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. Both of them do a superb job, and left me wanting even more. The entire script is actually funny, and I mean funny as in you will be giggling the entire movie. This movie just makes you feel good, it makes you want to experience life even more. It has a great message, and keeps to the plot of the book a lot better then most adapted screenplays. Going back to the acting performance though, it really is something. While Zach Galifianakis usually plays the oddball in blockbuster comedies, he does a FANTASTIC job being a psych ward patient who is absolutely hilarious. Emma Roberts shocked me, to be honest. I've only seen her in Nancy Drew and a small glimpse in her Tween TV show "Unfabulous" in which her acting was borderline on being downright awful. In this movie, she completely breaks out of that role, and jumps into one that the people who aren't the ages of 10-13 and female will actually like! Several times during the movie i honestly didn't believe it was the same girl. She really does a great job. The bottom line is that this movie is great. It's not the best, but it is a movie worth seeing that has a very good story and great acting to complement it. See. This. Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An important movie, and an original movie whose originality is not its reason for being. That is, "It's Kind of a Funny Story" has emotional chops. Musical chops as well, but that's another review.Yes, the shadow of a memory of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" came to me while watching, but I have to say this echo did not lessen "Kind of a Funny Story" by comparison. It's not an angry movie. It's not a star vehicle. It's not a plot-fest. It is not ego-driven. It is not desperate for laughs, though I laughed hard on several occasions. In fact I'll see it again to remember those lines.This movie gives you time with interesting people. Defenseless and ordinary, and beautiful people. Teens need to feel, we all need to feel compassion for ourselves and everyone around us pushed to depression. "Funny Story" while not grimly realistic is realistic in heart. Zach Galifianakis has transcendent scenes. Keir Gilchrist is just lost enough. Much to admire in the film-making. This one should not sink under the radar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Delightful and Indulgent Little Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most rewarding pictures I've seen in a long time. It's a breath of fresh air from the usual mainstream hokum, mixing black comedy and dry humor with genuine warmth and empathy. It's a movie you don't want to end, but when it does, you kinda want to give it a big hug.There are no cheap laughs or lame gags here - the humor bubbles along like an undercurrent, echoing real life. Life is a constant source of amusement - we just have to recognize the fact and tap into it sometimes. The storybook device, where the protagonist speaks directly to the audience, was perfectly weighted, cutting in at just the right moment to pace the movie and remind you of the pretext. All the characters were well-rounded and authentic - I was particularly impressed that Craig's psychiatrist was played totally straight. The temptation to have her do or be something slightly crazy or contrived must have been great, but it was thankfully resisted. Likewise, the inmates of the psychiatric ward - there's a charming and utterly believable sense that everyone's a bit off kilter, rather than jokingly deranged. The patients in the film aren't the butt of the joke - society and its proclivities are. That said, as a British viewer, I found it more difficult to appreciate how academia and peer pressure drive school-kids to anti-depressants and therapy - and for them to be impressed by the fact. I probably missed some of the main messages and in-jokes of the film, being from Yorkshire, rather than New York.Nevertheless, I don't think you can fail to love this film. Zach Galifianakis is adorable, Emma Roberts is gorgeous and Keir Gilchrist manages to combine confusion and teenage erudition superbly. If nothing else, you have to love the self-indulgent interludes, especially the 3D animation through Craig's fictional, line-drawn world and the wonderfully camp group performance of 'Under Pressure'. The soundtrack is spot on right to the last - who knew traditional Egyptian music could be the saving grace?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Kind of a Good Story Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See It Now! Critical Perspective: B+ Personal Perspective: AThis is a film about second chances and in particular giving yourself a second chance. We all get very overwhelmed and stressed out because of our very busy and hectic lives, however, sometimes you just need to step back and give yourself a break from all of the drama in the world and focus on what is really important to you in your life. After a little thought all of the things that stress us out on a daily basis become very petty and unimportant and the things with true meaning and value in our lives shines through. "It's Kind of a Funny Story" is a film based off of the 2006 novel by Ned Vizzini of the same name. The story follows a boy named Craig (Keir Gilchrist) on a five day self-discovery journey in a psychiatric hospital he checks himself into after dealing with depression in his stressful life. He is guided with the help of his doctor Eden Minerva (Viola Davis; Oscar Nomination for "Doubt") and fellow patient Bobby (Zach Galifianakis; "The Hangover"). These two relationships along with a very special girl named Noelle (Emma Roberts) change Craig's life.The Good: The film follows its genre as a dramatic comedy very well and isn't over sentimental or Hollywoodized at all. Instead it is everything you would want a film with the title "It's Kind of a Funny Story" to be. It really is kind of a funny story and a very good story with some very serious undertones. Overall, the acting in the film is very fulfilling and the variety of different character personas' of the patients mesh very well in a perfect comedic melody. However, Zach Galifianakis is the biggest name actor in the film and steals the spotlight whenever the camera is on him. He plays a character that is very hard to describe. He is both troubled and enlightened, dramatic and comedic, and optimistic and pessimistic. What ever he is, all of the other characters feed off of his energy and look up to him on screen. Galifianekis is joined by Keir Gilchrist (Craig) Lauren Grahm (Craig's Mother), Jim Gaffigan (Craig's Father), Emma Roberts (Noelle), Thomas Mann (Aaron) and Zoe Kravitz (Nia). The cast is supported by a very well written adapted screenplay by Anna Fleck and Anna Boden that will make you laugh and cry.The Bad: The actress, Zoe Kravitz, does not do a very good job playing Nia, Craig's love interest from before he meets Noelle in the psychiatric hospital. She is a very annoying, stereotypical, stuck up girl that just isn't very believable. It is very hard to believe that Craig would actually like her especially because she is his best friend, Aaron's girlfriend. It is also hard to believe that Aaron is his best friend because he does not seem to treat Craig very good and does not act as a very good friend towards him. This makes both of these relationships to be very unimportant to the overall story.Final Thought: We all could use a five day break from our lives so we can just enjoy the moment and relax without following a strict schedule that forces us to rush around. We all need contemplate the quotation that Craig's doctor Eden Minerva states at the beginning of the film, "Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference." Go to the theater and See It Now, the film that avoids the typical clichés of the psychiatric hospital comedy and it may just inspire you too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's kind of an awesome movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"See, that's the part I don't get, Craig. I mean, you're cool, you're smart, you're talented. You have a family that loves you. You know what I would do just to be you, for just a day?"Despite the fact that most critics were underwhelmed with It's Kind of a Funny Story, I found myself liking the movie. It's sort of a feel-good flick, despite being set in a mental hospital. Imagine a lighthearted version Girl, Interrupted with more teen angst (in a good way).The story's about a teenage boy who's burnt out on pressure from parents, school, and his peers, exhausted, and contemplating suicide. He checks himself into a mental health clinic hoping for some kind of a quick fix, but instead has to spend five days in the adult ward (the youth ward is temporarily closed). He meets the requisite cast of oddball patients (including Zach Galifianakis), he grows close to the requisite love interest triangle (Emma Roberts &amp; Zoe Kravitz), and he learns the requisite lessons about himself and life.&nbsp;So yeah, this isn't exactly a revolutionary movie. I enjoyed it, though. Keir Gilchrist is a likable young actor, and Galifianakis keeps thing from getting too serious with his quasi- mentor character. The young cast gives solid performances, as well (I've developed quite the massive crush on Zoe Kravitz, I hope she sticks around the movie biz for a long time to come).All in all, not a bad movie to spend a couple of hours with. It leaves you in a positive mood, and the soundtrack is pretty rockin', too.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 359th Review: Clearly one of the better films of 2010: Fleck / Boden do it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden are, in this reviewer's opinion, the best writer / director team working in film today. Both Half Nelson and Sugar (Which made my top 5 for 2008) were good and here they go more mainstream and produce a simple yet vibrant low-fi comedy. If you go expecting the Hangover, a full on comedy, then this might take some adjusting to - it is more than that. It reminded us most of the same vibe Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist had.Craig (Keir Gilchrist) is an angsty teen and checks himself into a psych ward for 5 days. He is excellent, like a cross between Justin Long and Michael Cera and should get good work off the back of this. Here Craig meets the wizened Bobby (Zack Galifianakis), who has a complete emotional range here, his hangdog is perfect and watched closely you'll see every thought and facial gesture with real pleasure, and a teenage girl his age, Noelle (Emma Roberts). The supporting cast have groupworked this really well and it all just gels nicely. The film is a journey of self- discovery.What lifts this is it doesn't have a mean bone in its body yet delivers beautifully - this film is firstly, optimistic about pessimism and abounds with humor, laughter, and originality, and secondly, Fleck again coxes the the actors to simply act, without excess. It does a wonderful balancing act of making us see the world afresh too. In addition to all this it is totally refreshing to see a teen movie that is about teens and their world and not just another slapstick sex comedy.I could only wish for 20 films a year like this, rather than the cookie cutter production values that govern Hollywood. The common trait in all three films are honesty, struggle, and eventually, something more. That's three in a row for Fleck / Boden - and I, for one, can't wait to see the fourth...</fullReview>

There's nothing sugar-coated about these characters, which is probably why I like them so much. Pluses for having them relate to our current society; these characters could be someone on your own street.With a narrative &amp; creative style similar to 500 Days of Summer, this is an oddly inspirational tale. Comic relief provided by the excellent Zack Galifianakis.Great music, great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a slightly fun movie, but do not expect laughing your guts out. It's a almost a teenage romantic comedy placed in a different environment than the regular college movies. It has good characters and decent casting,and they will grow on you easily. Also, I appreciate such characters that are very enjoyable even if they don;t have more than 2-3 lines, such as Muqtada or Solomon. You may not remember this movie next year, but you might be hearing a friend sayin to you "get up, Muqtada" if you don;t want to get up from your bed :). This is a good 2010 movie, with a low budget,low commercial expectations but with great feedback. Despite dealing with depression issues, the atmosphere is positive and delivers a good feel at the end. Nice to see this kind of movies from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly crafted script, crappy acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess i went into this movie with high expectations. As far as the storyline goes, this movie is about an upper-middle class "Emo" kid who is depressed because he couldn't get a girl, then he goes to a mental hospital helps people out, figure out his problems and then everything is fine. It's your classic feel good movie, but it lacks realness, I would guess that the writers only connection to psychology was a college course they were required to take. Not only did i detest the writing, I also felt the acting was horrendous, with the exceptions of Zach Galifianakis and Jeremy Davies. I think they spent too much money casting Zach and then "cheaped" out on casting for the characters Craig and Noelle. I also felt there was a lack of chemistry with Craig and Noelle, it's like the whole thing was phony. Overall, if you do decide this, go in with low expectations. You'll either find it more enjoying or you'll see where I'm coming from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It never seems to click.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film out of boredom one evening with high hopes considering my love for coming of age type films. Well after 40 minutes I found myself wondering, "When is something going to happen?" I was waiting for something to connect to me emotionally and make me feel for the characters. However, all I received was a boring story that leads to a predictable ending leaving me feeling nothing. Keir Gilchrist was boring in his role, although I don't believe he had a lot to work with. I kept expecting the story to dive more into Zach Galifianakis' character and give the actor a chance to show off his true acting abilities. The film never goes there. It addresses his condition and his relationship with his daughter very lightly, but not enough to make the audience care. In fact, the film fails to make the audience care for any of the characters. Emma Roberts does a fine acting job although the chemistry between her and Keir Gilchrist is non existent (which I don't blame on her). If you are ever looking for time to kill then perhaps you can give this movie a shot, but I wouldn't spend any money on it. I was very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There wasn't anything that happens in this movie that stands out. It's not really a comedy or drama and I didn't find it entertaining. Even Zack G. didn't do anything funny. It's about a teen, Craig, whom is depressed and dreams about suicide. So, he goes to a mental ward and gets checked in for 5 days with all the adults because the teen ward is closed. He meets one girl his age he sort of makes friends with. Then there is Bobby whom has a kid and is in there for suicide attempts also. Craig meets a few other "off" characters. The main thing he does is make life easier for all the patients because he gets along with everyone and throws a pizza party on his last day. So, now you see why it was boring.FINAL VERDICT: Skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is putting a picture to the story of when you hear about teens who find themselves in a bout with depression. Most people blow off this idea, wondering why a teenager would ever have any reason to be stressed out to the point of wanting to kill themselves. Well, this movie somewhat satirically makes fun of that idea, but also puts into perspective why a kid might feel this way and gives a legitimate tale of the funny story of life and its problems.As the film starts out, we meet our main character, Craig, played by Keir Gilchrist. He's a "depressed" teenager, in a dream where he's walking over the middle bypass of a bridge in New York City (pardon my lacking geography skills). Before he's about to jump, he's greeted with his family, including the hilarious Jim Gaffigan, standing on the side casually. The scene brings a great sense of humor, detracting from the seriousness of the situation and giving a funny side, while still giving a legitimately believable performance. This is something the film likes to do quite often, throwing you back and forth between serious moments and becoming light heartened. But the way the director does this is great, as he still shows the seriousness of the subject matter, but at the same time the title is applied throughout the scenes, reminding us how funny it all really is out of perspective.Eventually our main character finds himself convincing his doctor to allow him to be admitted into the psychiatric ward of the hospital, where he's greeted with more than he expected. Thinking he's took a wrong turn going here after seeing the other patients, he tries to leave, but to no avail. We then proceed to meet the larger cast of characters, including Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts, both of which are amazing actors in this film. The movie continues to show us the ups and downs of his life staying at the hospital, and lets us know that we're not the only ones who go through phases of depression. Not only does the ending admit that this isn't a tale of a teenager going through this once and coming out better forever, it acknowledges the truth of depression and that this is only the start, but life goes on. The final montage at the end of the film is amazingly well done, especially with how well the music fits in.Overall, I would give the film an 8 out of 10. It's certainly not one of the best films I've ever seen, but although not entirely original, it still gave off a vibe that it brought something new and unseen to the table. Either way, I'd recommend seeing it at least once by yourself. By the end, you'll want to go outside and hug someone close to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Kind of a Charming Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Kind of a Funny Story" is a refreshing antidote to the seemingly endless parade of movies and T.V. shows about teen angst.In it, Keir Gilchrist, in a winning performance, plays a young teen who's vaguely depressed for reasons he can't explain, is overwhelmed by the seriousness of the world in which he lives and even harbors the occasional thought of suicide. Thinking himself seriously messed up, he checks himself into a mental ward for a five-day stint, only to find out once there that he's nowhere nearly as screwed up as he thinks he is -- certainly not as screwed up as the other people on the ward who deserve to be there -- and that he's not suffering from anything that pretty much every other human being on the planet doesn't suffer from from time to time.The lessons he learns will sound pretty familiar and sound like a summary of lines spoken by Ruth Gordon in "Harold and Maude." They're all about living life instead of being afraid of it, doing what makes you happy, and not letting others life your life for you. But though the moral of the story is as ordinary as morals come, it's delivered in a charming way, and the movie overall is extremely easy to like.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit Cuckoo's-Nest Lite, but it's heart is in the right place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Kind of a Funny Story walks a very thin line.It takes the very real problems of teen depression and suicide, realistically relates their real gravitas and pathos, then holds a fun house mirror up to them, exposing their inherent absurdity. The cliché "if you don't laugh you cry" comes to mind, but this film doesn't take the easy way out, even though there are points where you say to yourself "Oh yeah, they're gonna pull THAT old trick again...." I have a litmus test for bad movies. If I observe a plot set-up early on (points off right there), and it pays off exactly the way I think it will, I downgrade my rating. This occurred recently when I saw "Love and Other Drugs," another of Edward Zwick's sappy pappy rom-coms: pharmacological sales rep throws away Prozac in dumpster, bum is nearby. Maybe ten minutes later, bum is now on way to job interview and I was on my way to the vomitorium. Next.It's Kind of a Funny Story seems to offer a million set-ups like this but then goes out of its way to defy your expectations. I expected Zach Galifinakis' character to go off the deep end at a climactic moment near the film's end. Didn't quite happen that way. I expected Keir Gilchrist's character to be a lot more moody and not so bright. Ditto.A good blast of this freshness comes from the performances which are not overly studied. Gilchrist's neurotic teen hero and Galifinakis' middle-age schlub seem spontaneous and improvisational at times. They're an unlikely, perfectly matched pair, drolly undercutting their own low confidence streaks without an overbearing father-son tone stifling it all. Emma Roberts brings no artifice to her portrayal of a teen cutter. There are a lot of "quirky" characters here but, as in Cuckoo's Nest, a film it somewhat resembles at least in set-up, none are too broadly drawn as to be mockable.Granted, it doesn't chart any truly subversive ground or go full on into high-drama mode, as Kesey and Foreman's landmark film did, but you can see that it cares about it's characters and their problems very much. That alone qualifies for accolades in these overcrowded days of commercial feel-good pablum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's better to forget, than to remember me and cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clichés abound in "It's Kind of a Funny Story", a film written and directed by the usually reliable Ryan Fleck. The plot? Keir Gilchrist plays Craig Gilner, a suicidal teenager who checks into a hospital's psychiatric ward. Here Gilner meets various quirky characters and learns various life-lessons.Like most films about depressed men or boys, "Story" features a cute, quirky and world-weary young woman (Emma Roberts) who exists only to coax our hero out of his existential rut. Thanks to a little sexual healing, our hero is thus miraculously cured of all anxieties. Superficial, clichéd and insulting to those it pretends to portray, "It's Kind of a Funny Story" co-stars Zach Galifianakis.5/10 ? Better films about suicide and self-harm: "Night Mother", Louis Malle's "The Fire Within", "Harold and Maude", "The Bridge", "The Seventh Continent", "Ordinary People", "Girl Interrupted", "A Taste of Cherry" and "Mouchette".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm actually glad to have not read the novel because I wouldn't waste my time reading something pointless. I thought the movie and the storyline had no meaning at all. Yes I know it's about a teenage boy admitting himself to a Mental Institution since he was unfortunately suicidal. I just think the actor who played him didn't seem interested in his role. He just didn't give that click to fall in love with the character enough. It made me think, why couldn't they have gotten an older actor playing the teenager? It would be totally different and a lot better since they would have more experience then a teenage actor. I don't think a love story would suit anything for this kind of movie, it just kinda holds me back on concentrating on the teen. He should've at least made a new friend and that would be more better then a love interest. I don't want to brag too much because it just didn't satisfy me at all. It is the worst adaption ever!</fullReview>

I watched it on a whim during a boring overnight shift and expected it to be something to make fun of later.It's difficult to describe just how badly it was advertised. This movie is not a laugh out loud comedy though it is very funny in some parts. At points it's very serious and very sad but it makes this all the more realistic considering it's plot line. This is probably the first and only movie I've seen that actually has a realistic depiction of people with depression. Masterful acting all around gives you a perfect example as well as the outside parties who simply do not understand how depression works. Zach Galifianakis actually uses his acting abilities and plays one of his best roles he's ever been in. He's not a comedic lead as was advertised he is much better.This movie is just really well done and very well rounded. It's light hearted and uplifting but really packs an emotional punch. You should ignore the reviews, previews or whatever else and go see it for yourself. It was not like anything I had heard or expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie would make a great movie for "Movies with a Message"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Movies with a Message" is a discussion class for youth groups, especially Unitarian Universalists, but other religious or non-religious organizations could discuss movies that impact on the lives of teenagers. This movie would be ideal for even a 45 min. Sunday school or religious education class. In the first 20 minutes enough happens to have 1/2 hr. conversation, depending on how many there are to discuss it and how open they feel about sharing. It's also a movie that adults can enjoy and relate to. This is the kind of movie with the kind of issues adults need to talk about with youth and youth need to talk about with each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its KIND of a funny story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The films title is , It's Kind of a Funny Story, and it is just that. Not overly comedic and not overly dramatic, but the perfect midpoint between them, with a high dose of reality. I was honestly not expecting much from this movie as there wasn't much hype about it, but it was well worth the watch. There is clear chemistry between Gilchrist and Galifanakis as well as Gilchrist and Roberts, which creates a pleasant flow throughout the movie. Galifanakis somewhat breaks out of his normal comedic shell and adds some drama too this role, and was surprisingly convincing and believable. A few chuckles are well spread within the film and the drama is not too heavy to overshadow the theme of the film. The main focus/theme is bringing forth all the stressing elements that are effecting the youth in America today. Many viewers can directly relate to Craig(Gilchrist) with the same problems within themselves and problems that aren't as controllable. It is very light hearted and leaves the viewer with a a smile on their face and a warm feeling inside. Everyone has to look for the good within themselves and live life the way the makes them happy. Remember, "if you're not being born, you're dying."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland emptiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keir Gilchrist is really good actor. His eyes have the mesmerizing ability to look deep and delude us into hanging on as an interesting story is about to develop very soon. The bland emptiness of this formulaic 'teen American movie' with a flotsam of black sink holes is exasperating. There is a phobic aversion from delving anywhere within the orbit of the characters troubled past. With no inkling into how they got committed to a mental hospital - never mind why - how can we ever care what happens to them. For example the Emma Roberts character is just flashed to have self harm issues and we are supposed to be satisfied with that. When the two main characters play a question game, it is just to tease; as no answers are provided. All the movie characters end up as a collection of discarded transparent balloon people going limp as soon as they are half halfheartedly inflated into shape. I never expect a romantic comedy to ask heavy questions about adolescent angst or mental hospitals. But the offhand way the problems and inmates were dismissed is pretty offensive. Yes it is a kind of funny story - 'funny' as in 'ludicrously absurd'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rare intricate look a life following the journey of depressed 'Craig' (Played by Keir Gilchrist). This movie will take any teenager on an emotional journey where the characters are engaging and realistic. 'It's Kind Of A Funny Story' is a quirky Drama with the right amount of romance and comedy, making this film extremely entertaining. A spectacular 'Zach Galifianakis' (playing Bobby) shows his diversity as an actor teaching Craig about life in an amusingly witty approach. His raw acting skills are exclusively evident in a particular scene. A special mention to Writers/Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck making this film a unique piece of art leaving the audience ultimately with a smirk of enjoyment. The movie explores relationships, self-belief and something that every teenager discerns; uncertainty in life. This makes the film exceptional and quite remarkable in a way reminding the audience that uncertainty can inspire us to live and not fall into a monotonous depressive routine just to live up to expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Galifianakis! Who knew?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What were your teen years like? Sleepovers, baseball and paper routes? For a startling many, the teen years are the exact opposite of that. But, when all that stress becomes too much to handle, what do you do?Craig Gilner (played by Keir Gilchrist) is a sixteen year-old who's contemplated suicide many times. One night, he dreams of riding his bike to the Brooklyn Bridge. In the dream, before he can jump, his mother (played by Lauren Graham), father (played by Jim Gaffigan) and little sister appear on the bridge. After a brief conversation, Craig loses his balance and falls to the water below. He wakes up after that and heads to the nearest emergency room. The admitting nurse, who was on the phone at the time of Craig's arrival, hears him state that he intends to kill himself and simply hands him a clipboard with attached admitting forms. While sitting in the waiting area, a man in scrubs in a lab coat (played by Zach Galifianakis) strikes up a conversation and then leaves abruptly. When he is actually examined, his doctor (played by Aasif Mandvi) does not believe that Craig is a threat to himself but Craig is adamant and, as such, is admitted for evaluation. The part of the hospital usually reserved for mentally ill teens is undergoing renovations so Craig is placed with the adults. His roommate, a middle-aged Egyptian named Muqtada (played by Bernard White) rarely leaves his bed and has not left his room in weeks. The initial shock provokes feelings of "buyer's remorse" in Craig but the hospital staff is not permitted to release him without evaluating him, which will take several days. In that time he becomes acquainted with other patients such as fellow teen, Noelle (played by Emma Roberts) and the man he encountered in the waiting room, Bobby (Galifianakis) who regularly leaves the ward, without permission, dressed in scrubs to avoid being escorted back.I love this movie. Gilchrist masterfully portrays, in my opinion, a young adult grappling with issues that are far beyond his comprehension who is trying desperately to conceal that at the same time. Graham as the caring, over-emotional mother is someone we feel great sympathy for. Zach Galifianakis, for the first time in his acting career, scales back on the eccentricities we usually see in him and, surprisingly enough, shows talent as an actor. It seems odd that the least eccentric character that he's ever portrayed would be a mental patient, but that doesn't make it any less true. To sum up, It's Kind of a Funny Story is a near-brilliant film and I would advise anyone who found my review intriguing in the slightest to see it at their earliest possible convenience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Kind of a Funny Story ? An angst teen finds refuge in a mental hospital</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Kind of a Funny Story is about what you do when you are served that one extra drop of water that makes your glass overflow. We don't have an instructional book to help us go through life, yet once we're born, we're expected to live. That can prove too difficult for some. This is for them.The story is simple. The acting is good. The subject matter has plenty of room to be explored and will make you think. This is the film where I think Zach Galifianakis has given his best performance.Now, the main flaw of the movie are the therapy sessions and how the main character evolves throughout his stay on the psychiatry floor. Those are common mistakes and easily overlooked. I've rarely seen a realistic psychotherapy session in a film, and few people can make sense of them.Beyond that, it's a quiet flick that aim at making you ponder life. It's not a depressing piece, or a high tension one, so it's an easy watch.If you're not looking for action or laughs, but still want something relatively positive, this might be for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a cute movie! - in a very smart way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a psychiatric nurse and I know how many movies portrait a psychiatric ward in a horror thriller psycho way. General population assume a psychiatric ward as a scary place and I am sure those movies out there contributed on that misunderstanding. I always felt bad when I watch those movies that mislead general public to have a 'stigma' toward mental illness.Just like what doctor said in the movie, 'depression is a medical illness, would you be embarrassed if you had a diabetes?' I was delightfully surprised to watch a movie that shows psychiatric ward as it is. (Every character reminds me of different patients of mine!) They are just people, like you and me, but with chronic or short term disorder!Apart from the view as a nurse, I could not stop smiling whole movie! It reminds of you how it is like being a teenager. all that pressure, parents, friends, girls and boys, study, university! And all these different patients just shows so many different aspects of life in such an adorable way! A-dorable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story about a funny story!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good: The film follows its genre as a dramatic comedy very well and isn't over sentimental or Hollywoodized at all. Instead it is everything you would want a film with the title "It's Kind of a Funny Story" to be. It really is kind of a funny story and a very good story with some very serious undertones. Overall, the acting in the film is very fulfilling and the variety of different character personas' of the patients mesh very well in a perfect comedic melody. However, Zach Galifianakis is the biggest name actor in the film and steals the spotlight whenever the camera is on him. He plays a character that is very hard to describe. He is both troubled and enlightened, dramatic and comedic, and optimistic and pessimistic. What ever he is, all of the other characters feed off of his energy and look up to him on screen. Galifianekis is joined by Keir Gilchrist (Craig) Lauren Grahm (Craig's Mother), Jim Gaffigan (Craig's Father), Emma Roberts (Noelle), Thomas Mann (Aaron) and Zoe Kravitz (Nia). The cast is supported by a very well written adapted screenplay by Anna Fleck and Anna Boden that will make you laugh and cry.The Bad: The actress, Zoe Kravitz, does not do a very good job playing Nia, Craig's love interest from before he meets Noelle in the psychiatric hospital. She is a very annoying, stereotypical, stuck up girl that just isn't very believable. It is very hard to believe that Craig would actually like her especially because she is his best friend, Aaron's girlfriend. It is also hard to believe that Aaron is his best friend because he does not seem to treat Craig very good and does not act as a very good friend towards him. This makes both of these relationships to be very unimportant to the overall story.Final Thought: We all could use a five day break from our lives so we can just enjoy the moment and relax without following a strict schedule that forces us to rush around. We all need contemplate the quotation that Craig's doctor Eden Minerva states at the beginning of the film, "Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference." Go to the theater and See It Now, the film that avoids the typical clichés of the psychiatric hospital comedy and it may just inspire you too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicidal in Brooklyn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having admired their previous work, we approached this film with interest. Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden are a good team whose "Sugar" and "Half Nelson" showed they had the potential to do excellent work. The present film shows that promise reflected on their last effort, which we caught the other night on cable.Craig, a teenager suffering from depression, has fantasies about committing suicide. His angst makes him visit a hospital near where he lives in Brooklyn. The Argeron has a place for people like Craig. After he is examined he is sent to a ward where people with psychiatric problems are treated. Once inside, Craig, who had no idea what he was getting into, has second thoughts. The Argeron is just the opposite of other hospitals of the past in which all kinds of insane things happen. For the most part, the inmates are well treated under the direction of a kind, and understanding Dr. Eden Minerva. Craig, who is initially turned off with his new reality wants to leave as soon as possible, but Dr. Minerva convinces him to stay for the required stay of a week.Craig meets Bobby, as he awaits his turn outside the emergency area. Bobby, who is dressed in hospital garb, is a patient himself. Bobby will be a big brother to Craig and takes him through the ropes, showing the newly arrived teen how to cope with the other inmates. Craig spots Noelle, a somewhat enigmatic young woman. Craig secretly aches for Nia, the girlfriend of his best pal, Aaron. "It's a Kind of a Funny Story" is based on a novel by Ned Vizzini, adapted for the screen by the creators, Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden. The team stays away from the usual antics that can be expected of a film dealing with mental health. The film is fun to watch and moves at a quick pace. It includes a wonderful sequence where the inmates of the ward make their own kind of music by imitating their singing idols.Keir Gilchrist surprises for his portrayal of Craig. This young actor makes a good impression who makes us believe he is none other than the suicidal teen reaching out for help. Zach Galifianakis is an added asset in every film he is asked to appear. His Bobby is an excellent example of the way this actor keeps getting better all the time. The beautiful Emma Roberts is seen as Noelle and Viola Davis makes her Dr. Minerva a really understanding doctor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the funniest and in general the second best psych ward film ever (cookoo's best)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched "it's kind of a funny story" from 2010 starring one of my favorite comedians Zach Galifianakis and some kid. So was it good, I say hell yeah this movie was great it's almost worthy of a non skewed 8 on IMDb. I say almost just because it is really really good but not like classic good. This film is truly of the indy variety and one of my favorite films that I have seen recently. It is imaginative, original, well written, well shot, well acted, you name it. This movie touches on some very sensitive subject matter as it does take place almost entirely in a psych ward in a hospital. This movie is the story of a teenager going through some tough times, not because he has a rough life, but because he is just feeling a lot of pressure and stress and doesn't know how to handle it. He has a good life by most anyone's account which is something he acknowledges. I grew up in a similar situation to this kid and could empathize and appreciate what he was going through. Zach plays a great supporting role opposite the kid, he is very funny at times and at other times we get a glimpse into what brought him to stay in the loony bin. This film has one of the funniest movie scenes I have seen of any movie ever and it involves a beaver (sort of). "It's" incorporates fantasy and animation beautifully on top of everything it has going for it. So now we ask is this movie for everyone, NO! This movie is esoteric and an independent film. Look if you like the pixies you will like this movie. If you just asked yourself "whats a pixies?" don't watch. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the only weak point about this movie is the title. Really, it gets tough to sell a movie that has such a misleading title. Sounds like they didn't know how to name it and it's weird, cause the message of the movie is so concise and solid. Anyway, the strongest feature of this movie is the edition. What a fantastic way of telling a story using many resources and combining them into a delicious piece of art, where nothing feels to be out of place. The script is great, the acting is pretty good, the story is touching, mature and has its takeaways. Direction is good as well, BUT EDITING, it really doesn't get much better than this. It's an 8+. And I'm an exigent guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Not-So-Funny Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Kind of a Funny Story (2010), directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, focuses around a teenage boy, Craig (Keir Gilchrist of United States of Tera) and his interactions with other patients after he checks himself into a psychiatric ward. The film is not horrible by any means, but it's not necessarily the most marvelous film I've seen either It's pretty safe to say It's Kind of a Funny Story stays fairly true to its title. Despite it being set in a psych ward, this film is cute and light-hearted. However, I wasn't blown away. The characters were genuine, but I couldn't find much depth to them. Zach Galifianakis, stepping outside his normal comedic roles, proves that he can successfully take on intellectual parts, but this choice may have been a miss for him. Not because he is not talented, just because of bad writing. It's an optimistic film, but highly forgettable. This film just felt out of place in this time. It's Kind of a Funny Story is "kind of" lots of things, but I just can't put my finger on something that it fully establishes itself as. If you need a dose of laughs and loonies I'd stick with Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well right from the start I was expecting a lovely Sunday afternoon movie which was supposed to take off all my pressure with funny acting and witty lines. After two hours, however, it didn't turn out what I thought but I was able to walk away with even greater pleasure. It's neither a momentary sensation as in movies like 'Inception', nor does it mean to overhaul your whole ontology like in 'Matrix'. To solve your 'stress' problem, the movie prescribes you just the right amount of pleasure, plus a tint of thought for you to have your own reflection on your life recently. With so many things covered in this movie, I believe each of us can just shop around and pick out our own.Here is the most important thing I learnt from this movie.Instead of being pushed along with commitments or 'what's supposed to be good for you', we'd be better off mastering our own life. And to achieve that, we ought to be truthful to ourselves what we want and what we like. We also need to have the courage to filter out things we don't have genuine interests in. With that mindset, we are ready to embrace our life with passion and live every moment.</fullReview>

The jokes are funny and the actors are well chosen for their parts. The story is brilliant. It is definitely one of my favorite movies. Reminds you that there is more to life, that it is OK to be afraid and to take the risk. You shouldn't compare yourself with others all the time and you shouldn't worry of what they might think. But the most important message was, that you shouldn't kill yourself, it, specially when your still young and full of life.

		<fullReview>Oh I don't know, I've been pretty short-spanned with movies lately and would have had no trouble switching this off if I hadn't felt at least a bit entertained by the light, ironic storytelling or somewhat interested in some of the characters. Or found some of the cast cute. But I had to suppress a pretty sad shiver of Oh, tacky, in the end. This is supposed to be based on a true story, a teenager's memoir from a mental ward that's aiming at a larger portrait of society, just like Girl, interrupted. I don't know what has happened to the story to make it so implausible. Or so lightweight. Sure a teenager might end up in a psychiatric hospital and it might change his life. But look at the therapeutic artwork: everyone instantly draws in the same unhesitating, even line and out comes a balanced composition, a picture of what is in the mind. Now it's out and life can begin. Now the Egyptian man's out of his room and dancing, I suppose no-one just ever tried old LP's with him before. What kind of person was the girl Noelle, where were the alleged fireworks? It's a mystery to a film layman like me where the 1,5 hours go with films that don't manage to develop their characters. And what about the music therapy session turned into fantasy: was Craig really a great singer and was everyone else great, too? What was so special about this one boy that he turned the hospital upside down? In spite of his superficial clumsiness he just seemed to be able to do anything and connect to anyone. While clearly aiming at promoting a sense of proportion and affirming life, this movie unfortunately seems to nurture some pretty narcissistic adolescent fantasies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about learning how to take the good with the bad but most importantly living each day to the fullest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Kind of a Funny Story" tells the story of Craig (Keir Gilchrist), a teenager whose life is just an utter disaster. His family drives him crazy with his mother being an over-emotional mess and his father wanting him to follow in his footsteps. To top of it off, his best friend is dating the girl that he has been obsessing over for 3 years. About ready to give up on life, Craig checks himself into an adult psychiatric ward, where he experiences a whole new way of thinking as well as a new appreciation of life. A well crafted dramedy ensues...I am officially marking "It's Kind of a Funny Story" as one of the most underrated films of 2010. This film had very little marketing and was in and out of theaters within a few weeks time. I don't even think the film got a major release. It's kind of funny (no pun intended) because with all the attention that Zach Galifianakis has gotten since the release of "The Hangover" one would think they would try to get this film off the ground as his first major dramatic role. With that being said, lets get into the real meat and potatoes of the film.First off, I wanted to see this movie as soon as I saw the trailer for it. It looked like a great mix of comedy and drama with an interesting premise. A film about a teenager checking himself into a psychiatric ward because he is depressed not only makes for an interesting story, but is also a topical subject with all the ongoing teenage depression talk going on in our society. Keir Gilchrist, who you may recognize from "The United States of Tara" plays the perfect candidate for the lead role in a movie of this topic. Not only because he fits the look and bill to play the role but because he is not a huge known actor. I don't know if I could see someone big in the lead role. I think that's what made the film feel so authentic. He seemed like an everyday teenager. He's not overly attractive, his problems seems believable, and his explanations about life seemed like something a regular teen would say. He was just a perfect fit for the role.Along with Gilchrist, the movie co-starred a few bigger names in showbiz including Emma Roberts and Zach Galifianakis, just to name a few. I have to give Zach Galifianakis some props with this film. We all know he can play the plucky comic relief but it was nice to see him play a character with some depth to it with a bit of comedy mixed in. There were some great scenes featuring Zach's character Bobby, including an emotional breakdown scene and a more comedic scene where Bobby gives Craig some advice on how to talk to a girl. Another great performance in the film was Emma Roberts, who played Noelle in the film. Roberts was very well suited for this film like Gilchrist because she just fit the overall look and fit of the character she was portraying. I also thought she had great chemistry with Gilchrist and definitely proved here that she deserves to do more stand out work like this rather than lackluster teen films like "Aquamarine" and "Nancy Drew." While the acting was solid across the board, I think the best part of this movie was the film was the overall story and message. It was nice to see a film about life and how sometimes it takes the weirdest scenarios to make you see life for what it was. A movie about people in a psychiatric ward doesn't seem like it would have a feel good message but this film does. It's not even overly sappy or anything like that. It's purely a film about learning how to live and appreciate what you have in life. I think almost everyone goes through a period in their life where they just feel depressed or want to toss in the towel. That's what this film is about and how you should always try to look past that feeling and see what good you have in your life. It has a funny way of showing it but "It's Kind of a Funny Story" makes you feel alive and makes it's audience really want to go out there and live everyday to the fullest.A the end of the day, I was actually very sad that I didn't get to catch this film in theaters and that it didn't get the kind of attention it deserved. "It's Kind of a Funny Story" was a well acted and well written film that featured a good mix of drama and comedy but also managed to stay realistic. I think that's probably the best part of the film that it felt like these were real people with real problems. I have to give the directors/writers Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden credit for picking who they picked for these characters and really knowing how to set up the scenes. I think more people should check out this film because not only will you enjoy the film as a whole but you will feel good about life after seeing it, at least that's how I felt when it ended. This film is without a doubt one of the most underrated and overlooked films of 2010! MovieManMenzel's final rating for "It's Kind of A Funny Story" is an 8 out of 10. This is oddly enough, the feel good film of 2010</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Cynicism Gotten The Best Of Us?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly believe that about ten or fifteen years ago, this movie would have garnered better reviews and better box office. But something has happened. We are a much more cynical world now. And rightfully so. But I'm just wondering when going to the movies became more about wanting only to see realistic, depressing stories than escapism...a two hour hiatus from the rest of the world. I'm not saying that every movie has to have a happy ending. I'm really not. Some movies require a sad ending, or an ending that really has no closure, and I'm o.k. with that. And if you read some of my other reviews then you'll know that I'm not bull crapping about that. But it's almost as if, nowadays, you come away from a film with a good feeling inside, then you must be some sort of a bumbling, shallow, anti-intellectual who just doesn't get "it" (whatever "it" is). Half the critic reviews I've read for It's Kind Of A Funny Story tout that very same philosophy. But you know what? Screw it. I liked this movie and I liked it because it made me feel better. I thought the story was entertaining and the characters were likable. They were the type of people who, despite some of their serious flaws, were worth rooting for. Was this one of the greatest scripts of all time? No. But it was still decent, and the acting more than made up for some of the questionable dialogue. For me, the standout performance was from none other than Zach Galifianakis. And although this was a more dramatic role for Galifianakis, he's still funny. It's just a toned down performance. All in all, this was a solid effort from all involved and I'm glad that I finally got a chance to see it. Do I get cynical from time to time? Yes. But when I went to see this film, I let my cynical guard down, and I let myself like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story begins with Craig(Keir Gilchrist) a smart teenager with a bright future. But to Craig the future does not seem to bright, feeling the pressure to well, feeling alienated from his parents. Starts having suicidal thoughts. When he goes to the doctors, and he wants to be cured quickly, feeling he might be a danger to himself. But Craig is gonna learn is that there is no such thing as a quick fix, when he is checked in to the mental ward at the hospital, and he has to stay there about a week. Craig does not like it, but makes the best out of it. During that he meets Bobby(Zach Galifiankis) and Noelle(Emma Roberts), but will Craig make it through the week? A great film, that has a lot of imagination to it. Keir Gilchrist was really good in this, he brings all sort of believability to his role. Zach Galifianakis was surprisingly good here, I hope he won't be missed by the Oscars. Emma Roberts is descent in her role. Jim Gaffigan and Lauren Graham are alright as Craigs parents. A great indie film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and feel good, makes you take life with a pinch of salt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well if you aren't really the type who lives life in the moment and take it too seriously, this is a must for you. The story is of a teen (Craig) in an psychiatric ward. The movie makes you happy and grateful for the things you have and the story is well written. The end is way too special. The movie is quite engaging even though the plot or the story isn't high on content and quite a bit predictable. Though at the start it manages to generate curiosity. The actors have done a fairly good job. Especially Zach Galifianakis who is seen in a something else character than his usual clichéd roles.Also Keir Gilchrist convincingly plays an nervous and talented teenager. I think overall it is worth watching. Good Short term effects: makes you want to do a lot of things being procrastinated by you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of those lovely ones that quietly sneak up on you and by the time you finish it you know that you'll watch it time and time again.Based on a book that has become a bible for teens going through hard times this film captures the messages of it perfectly, and a strong cast bring it to life.There is so much warmth and charm here. Never does the film get too dark, or too funny, never does it say that mental health issues are ever going to be easy to break free from. It's an honest film, and that's why I like it.Yes, it's a quiet film. It's never going to be one that people in fifty years are talking about. But it's certainly one I recommend you seek out and watch.</fullReview>

This is another in that same category.. the script holds no surprises and the ending is straightforward and totally expected. But the overall acting is solid and the majority of viewers should come away feeling positive. One of the real pluses (in addition to Emma) is the musical score.. it's very diverse and one of the best for a small indie film. I stopped several times to find out what was playing. It's a solid seven of ten production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love how this movie not only makes you think about how fortunate you are, but also shows you how to deal with minor issues that have the potential to depress you.Zach plays his role so well that you can tell he has been through it all. His facial expressions are perfectly in sync with his role. Also, when the Egyptian guy finally breaks free and starts dancing to the Egyptian song definitely put a smile on my face - Being Egyptian myself I admired the scene and character greatly. I would definitely recommend this movie to you if you are looking for a laugh and a lesson on how to enjoy life more often.Favorite Quote:"God please grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."</fullReview>

I think the extent to how much you enjoy this film depends on how you're feeling.When I first watched this film I was quite down, therefore this film really made me realise a lot of stuff. Whereas, now I'm watching this film with a completely different mindset.The main character, Craig... He represents a lot of people and a lot of people can relate to him in a lot of different ways. You can also relate to his friends and family throughout the film as well. It's a good film with a good meaning behind it.I wouldn't rate it higher because after seeing it again... I think it's good but not that good. I get what the film is trying to say and it all makes sense... But that's it. It's not exactly life changing, in saying that the first time I saw it I would have said the film was life changing...I'd recommend this film...

		<fullReview>From the opening scene of this movie I was enveloped in the story being told, I've had many high peaks and subsequently many low valleys during the years I've been alive and the self-doubting, socially awkward personality of the main character was in so many ways like looking in the mirror for me. The supporting characters were perfectly performed especially Zack Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. This movie is poorly categorized as a comedy in my opinion, it's more of an inspirational movie with occasional moments of light-hearted, almost cynical views of mental illness, the struggles people endure and the effects those struggles can have on people. So while I'm sure there's many people that completely disagree with this review for me personally this movie was everything I could've hoped for and so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like Radiohead a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I remember my Radiohead phase too. Oh, and she likes the Pixies too. Sure, both great bands and there's nothing wrong with liking them, but it's the sort of awkward and shallow dialogue between the two teenagers that keeps this film from actually being insightful. A lot of the time a screenplay might try and be realistic and inject a lot of this awkwardness and fumbling for words and silences into the conversation in order to seem genuine, but here it just reinforces the fact that these two characters are pretty plain. Keir Gilchrist plays Craig, a seemingly middle-class 16 year old who's stressing about all the usual things; his social life, college applications, school, his crush, father issues...but the thing is he's got depression. Gilchrist toes the line between authentic and wooden very closely throughout; he almost never smiles or emotes, and his voice is typically downtrodden and hopeless. The film opens with a sort of imagination scenario of him attempting to commit suicide, only his mind wanders and his family pops up next to him and urges him to consider the consequences. This sort of imaginative world is a repeated technique used by Boden and Fleck and it's the best bits of the film because of how ridiculous and high energy they are in comparison to his rather bleak outlook. His therapist asks him about what he's stressed about and his mind goes into high drive, foreseeing his entire career all the way up to the White House, being on MTV, being a socialite and so on, but all he can mumble is a few words. Quite accurate really; sometimes you just don't want to talk about it. An art class brings to life his humble pencil drawing into a 3D water-coloured world as Intro by The xx navigates us through this alternate brain world. He narrates his best friend's achievements from the bleachers, inside a film noir and from a laptop program. And best of all, when asked to sing during musictime, the entire ward become kitted out in costume as they rock on to Bowie and Queen's Under Pressure. These are all great because they demonstrate the latent imagination gone wild and creativity that Craig has, but cannot access at the moment. Zach Galifianakis is Bobby, another major character struggling to even hold onto custody of his daughter, too ashamed by his living conditions. Galifianakis, more prone to comedy roles, does surprisingly well, humorous enough to be a sort of buddy and life-coach to Craig, but also plays the roles with enough seriousness that it's believable when he admits he's attempted suicide 5 times, or when he freaks out and has a burst of aggression. The best moment is the altercation with the burrito, where the takes something trivial and escalates it on his own terms and demands. His arc doesn't really resolve itself in some neat way and that's perhaps why it feels a lot more meaningful or authentic than Craig's. "I don't have any friends," he laments about halfway into the film, right after Aaron dismisses his depression like the typical high school jerk would. But the problem is that Aaron isn't really fleshed out, and the next scene he's in he's now accepting of his friend's depression and problems and even admits to being depressed sometimes too! Why not let everyone get in on this sympathy train? Oh right, Nia is also in on it, and suddenly wants to jump Craig's bones because he was being a little insecure which is of course so mature (actually this is kinda high school so). Which all culminates to that horribly cliché scene where Craig yells out "I love you" to a leaving Nia only for Noelle to overhear this and run off herself. The worst crime however is the last montage which is so unbearably upbeat and optimistic for a character that has spend 5 days in rehab. Not only does it complete undo the film's day-by-day pacing structure, but it also undermines the entire philosophy of Craig's long challenge ahead of him. He says that spending a few days in hospital isn't going to cure all his problems, fair enough. The film then proceeds to to entirely ignore this and skip ahead in his life, mapping out each great encounter and feel-good moment. His therapist is played straight and sensible, and doesn't attempt to offer up some magic cure for his depression, so Craig just conjures it up himself. Well pack it up guys, I guess we've discovered the cure for depression, just star in your own low key movie. In saying that, it isn't bad, just very uneven. There are little moments of authenticity that point to somewhat having a grasps of this increasingly common mental illness rather than just using it as a framework for an awkwardly optimistic bildungsroman. The title says as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caution: teenager under pressure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck also adapted this screenplay from Ned Vizzini's novel about a teenager with suicidal thoughts who checks himself into a hospital ward for disturbed patients, hoping for a 24-hour cure; instead, he's held for observation and learns about institution life from on the inside. This hospital floor, overflowing as it is with colorful personalities, doubles-up the adult patients (some with apparently serious issues) with teens who can't cope with school problems or their parents. It's an even slicker version of the standard Hollywood version of the kind of mental asylum movies we usually get, one wherein the self-indulgent protagonist becomes aware he's been self-indulgent simply by relating to his mental patient companions (including one pretty girl his own age, natch). Zach Galifianakis gives this dishonest scenario some bounce in a co-starring role as a long-term patient with an emotional hair-trigger. Galifianakis' scenes, however (particularly a role-playing sequence geared for an easy laugh), stick out as small-scaled showcases for the actor. One is immediately drawn to Galifianakis because of his warmly-joshing personality, but there is nothing embraceable about young leading actor Keir Gilchrist, who begins nearly every line of dialogue with, "Well, it's like, I mean..." The picture has a quirky edge that passes for modern, but is really just a happy-ending-story for one individual character--and, arguably, the least-likable person in the group. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having myself been a sufferer of depression, this film struck a particular cord for me. It tells the story of a teenager named Craig (Keir Gilchrist) who has become depressed to the point of being suicidal, and checks himself into a hospital psych ward at the behest of a suicide hotline. He meets a few new people, including Bobby (Zack Galifianakis), and Noelle, played by the ever entrancing Emma Roberts. He almost immediately has second thoughts and wants to leave, but is told he must stay for at least 5 days for observation. Now before you get the wrong idea, this is not an unrealistic film where all the kid's problems are cured within the week, nor is it overly sad where it could potentially make you feel worse. The film does have a happy ending, but it is realistic, and I felt it was the perfect way to end things. This film not only helped me put my issues in perspective, but has helped me to feel better about the journey itself. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and ultimately made me feel better. If you yourself are suffering from depression, I would whole-heartedly recommend this film to help lift your spirits. All in all, I found this to be a very touching and emotionally cathartic film, and I give it a solid 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wanted to die or suicide ? Have you ever felt depression,Lonely,Lost when you are in teenage ? Well..I think almost everyone does felt like that at one point of our life. But how did you overcome that stage? it all depends on circumstances for young and old aged people.but it is difficult for teenagers to overcome.With the kind of busy money minded world we are living ,Teenagers are stressed out about the life so early.They think that they cant handle things in life. Let me give the review or reasons to this movie and i don't want to reveal or tell whole story because you must watch to experience it.Story and Plot : The basic story line is about a teenager Craig (Keir Gilchrist) who is depressed goes to adult psychiatric yard. This movie is based on novel by Ned Vizzini of the same name. The story follows a boy named Craig (Keir Gilchrist) on a five day self-discovery journey in a psychiatric hospital he checks himself into after dealing with depression in his stressful life. He is guided with the help of his doctor Eden Minerva (Viola Davis; Oscar Nomination for "Doubt") and fellow patient Bobby (Zach Galifianakis; "The Hangover"). These two relationships along with a very special girl named Noelle (Emma Roberts) change Craig's life.Overall The movie title may be It's kind of a funny story but it is sensible and sensitive story. " If you are not busy being born,you're busy dying." !1) The opening scene between Craig and his family.The whole conversation is great. 2) The movie and narration is Less Dramatic and more realistic. 3) Even though there are so many small characters in the film,but every character is unique and justified. 4) The romance between Craig and Noelle is great. 5) Characters like Bobby (Zach Galifinakis) ,Muqtada, Humble. 6) The practice interview scene between Bobby and Craig , A Cute Question game between Craig and Noelle , Painting Scene, The basket ball court scene , Muqtada dancing scene and etc. 7) The Music by Broken Social Scene is apt and great.

		<shortDescription>Exactly what my life needed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not that I've ever felt suicidal (like our hero does) but depression and isolation have always haunted me in every walks of life. In childhood, I had a lot of trouble hanging around with kids and my over-protective parents unknowingly added more to this. As a result, I had to face a lot of trouble mixing up with people of my own age. I still face the problem although at this point of life, I've come to accept that certain things about me can never be undone so I've given up the attempt to change them. I'm not as introvert now as I used to be although my twenty-one year being (about to turn twenty-two this October) has still inherited a lot of things from my tween self: I still don't like sports, I still hate Cricket (99% Indians adore it!) I still don't know how to strike a normal conversation with completely unknown people.Albeit, I'm grateful towards God that I have great parents, few but really caring friends, a roof over my head, a good job and a good future to look forward to. I've been depressed about my problems a lot but upon learning that there are many people out there with even bigger problems, I decided to not waste my time thinking over and over again about the same stuff and to just be grateful about the things we have. And that we should make the most of it all. My didactic conscience then taught me: just face life as it comes to you. Don't worry too much, and you'll learn to get by eventually. At one point in my life, I was almost like how Craig, the protagonist of the film, felt: I used to over think, I took everything too seriously, I used to wonder how the heck are people so smarter than me and I was lost in my own bubble. One day, Craig's inner bubble of trouble expanded to such an extent that he began to have weird suicidal thoughts. That's where our story begins: a kid walking into a mental ward thinking that they'll cure him with medication.Instead, the four walls of the ward showed him how big the world really is, how many beautiful things it has, what he is missing and how lucky he actually is to have things people only dream of. If Craig really had everything, why was he depressed? Was it his father, who always asked the wrong questions? His fragile mother? His sister who was more genius than him? His multi-talented best friend who seems to be perfect at everything? The ugly fact that he can never have the girl of his dreams? The biggest reason here lies in the fact that Craig was looking at his life from a wrong angle and he (and the society) was forcing himself to believe that his only aim in life was to reach point A and then go to point B. People around him mastered in Physics and whatnot. So does that mean he should do too? And if he doesn't, is he a stupid idiot?From what Craig observed, he developed the mentality that he HAS to master in Physics, he HAS to be brilliant in Subject C and master Sport D. Once Craig reached a mature age when he began to think for himself, his mind automatically began to detect that there's something wrong with life. He suddenly found himself in a place he doesn't belong to. And, Bam! A baby called Depression was born. The way Craig enters the ward and is introduced to a variety of characters is simply masterful. He is surrounded with schizophrenics (who unconsciously blurt out punches at perfect timing), transvestites, suicide-attempts and other unknown mental disturbances (some of which are kept in the dark deliberately for thrilling effect). Inevitably, they all play a small role in changing Craig in some way or the other, may it be for some thing to provoke serious thought or to simply offer some heart- warming comedic relief.Coming back to reality, Craig meets Muqtada: his depressed Egyptian roommate who never leaves his room. We certainly see a sign of total silence here. Craig gets to see the live example of what it means to completely cut off from the world. And is that really the best way to solve all our problems? Then there is Zach Galifianakis, which has to be his career best performance, playing Bobby: a strange bearded dude who with his own personal trauma makes Craig see how little his own troubles are. Although, Zach does this in a non-serious way by approaching Craig through a happy-go-lucky humor. He does make Craig see the importance of life in small doses but remains optimistic and supportive through-out the experience. And... who can forget Emma Roberts? Her charm and her smart moves are at times enigmatic yet something reassuring always delves in her eyes. Or may be it's simply because she's too beautiful? I'm so jealous of you, Craig.After seeing this film twice, I've come to observe how excellent the film-editing is. This element seems to improve the whole quality of the film, helping the narrative acquire a smooth and at times funny edge that jumps in from nowhere (but is not random). I'm quite fascinated by the concept of editing and this is definitely a great example of how it can affect the mood and pace of a film! The only thing that bothered me is how the last half-hour, despite being thought-provoking is too swift and lacks the rich narrative of Craig that has been so wonderfully guiding us through this journey. Although, it is a complain I can live with given the really wonderful cathartic note with which the film ends itself. This bit may come off as self-indulgent and clichéd for many but Craig's parting words are uttered simply for his own sake and not really to justify the fantastic conclusion.</fullReview>

I have to be honest, why would they title it "It's Kind of a Funny Story", when in all honesty, it really was not that much of a funny story? I was actually expecting something that would actually teach how to be funny. I would prefer watching something like Wedding Crashers. That movie was probably the funniest movie I have ever seen, and Im not sure I will ever find something better. The reason I like that movie so much is because of the raw material. The storyline and plot were above average in my opinion, and the acting was about the same.

		<fullReview>An easy to watch, not complex movie about a guy who has a good life, but is feeling stressed out and depressed by the simplest things. Craig has thoughts about ending his life only because of the stress caused by the school and parents.It may seem quite funny for some people, who have the ability to take everything easy and cruise too life easily. In Craig's case, he couldn't do anything easy, however he had some hidden talents, he didn't even know about. Unfortunately, many people nowadays are stressed out about some very basic things, like doing good in school, for example. When Craig discovered other passions and saw what other people are going through at the hospital, he really appreciated his own life and wanted to go out there and just live his life, of course, a big part of that was his new found love Noelle, who had her own problems too.Zach Galifianakis with some of his usual flicks, but this time he was in a role that was a little bit more serious than his usual movies, such as The Hangover or Due Date. Loved his performance here as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A coming-of-age story that reflects realistic teenage struggles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teen years are a confusing time, especially for this protagonist, who believes that everyone around him has their act together, and believes that nobody understands his inner turmoils. After turning himself into the hospital's psych ward, he slowly begins to realize how blessed he is, and how the emotions that he deals with are perfectly acceptable and normal. There is a great dynamic between Keir Gilchrist and Zack Galifianackis' characters, with Galifianackis helping the protagonist come to terms with who he is as a person.It's Kind of a Funny Story seamlessly delves into dramatic and comedic tones, while letting this relatable story unfold. It's relatable in the sense that teenagers feel misunderstood, a large theme in this film. This seems to be in the same vein as Short Term 12, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Garden State.The cinematic style consists of comedic jump cuts, at one point akin to the Mean Girls scene that introduces the cliques in the cafeteria, as they introduce all of the different schools in New York, and also for the array of amazing students at the protagonist's high school.The film score highlights the mood perfectly, and it includes great songs such as "The Hop" by Radio Citizen, "Intro" by The XX, "Pressure" by Queen, and an instrumental version of "Where Is My Mind" by The Pixies. I am in love with this soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly think this movie deserves a way better rating, I really enjoyed it. It's not too serious, neither is it just another stupid comedy. The movie brings out the message, how we can always focus on the negative of life, and how high expectations and working hard to live up to them, can actually make you depressed. Especially in the last bit of the movie, where Noelle and Craig are on the rooftop, Craig narrates and i quote "Here Noelle suggests that i screw the gates summer application if it makes me so unhappy" this part just got me. If something gets puts you under lots of pressure and gets you down so much, give it up! It's not worth sacrificing your happiness for. To me, this movie was very natural, it seems like a story which can actually happen in real life. It brings out a important message of taking it easy and how lucky we are to be where we are, and to make the most of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(originally posted on my blog: www.deadendfollies.com)Teenager movies make me freakin' cynical, because they're so profoundly meaningless. I used to watch them piled on a bed with a handful of my fellow adolescent friends and love interests, in a bedroom seeping with hormones, and they filled me with unexplainable existential sadness. I later found out that it's because they all say the same thing: ''everything is going to be all right. You're going to get the girl and everybody's admiration and you're awesome at the core of your being, it's just that everybody else is too immature to see it''.It's that kind of thinking that transformed Occidental society into an jerk factory. IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY is kind of a teenage movie, but only kind of. It's a movie with a beating heart, written by talented people, and yet it lacks the assertiveness and the commitment to make a powerful point about its theme, mental illness.Craig (Keir Gilchrist) is a kid suffering from clinical depression. One morning, he first the courage to check himself in the psychiatric ward, but immediately regrets when he's confronted to the suffering of others. You can't just walk away from that place once you're admitted though. There is a minimal 5 days evaluation you have to go through. So Craig is going to have to face himself, and he discovers that when you put your shoulders into it sometimes, things aren't so bad. People in the ward are used to be judged, so none of them are particularly keen on judging others. Ward veteran Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) takes Craig under his wing and shows him that there is a fine line between being crazy and ill.IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY had been destroyed by the critics and yet it's been a hit with the audiences. Why is that so? It's a well written movie about mental illness. If you've been anywhere around the issue yourself, you'll understand. For example, when Craig checks himself in at the E.R, he's trying to explain the doctor that he fears what he can do to himself. He doesn't have the precise words, but his latent fear is palpable.Another example is the absolute dissonance and incomprehension that goes in between what's happening inside and outside the ward. Mental illness is still a misunderstood issue and Craig gets into every layer of misunderstanding with the people in his life outside, from his friends who are intrigued to his family who has difficulty assessing the seriousness of the situation. IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY story does a good job at displaying that if it's not happening to you, it's extremely difficult to understand, and that the best thing you can do is not judge.Zoë Kravitz made me feel like a pervert scumbag in this movie, and she's like 25 years old!The best way I can possibly explain the viewing experience of IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY is watching a friend of yours draw something beautiful, only to tear it to shreds after your complimented him/her. It's a coming-of-age movie that ultimately trivializes the issue of mental illness and this angers me to no end. IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY takes all this time to depict mental illness in a proper light, only to conclude that MAYBE you just need a little love to get better, that MAYBE you just need the proper friends and to express yourself. Maybe you need to channel that negativity. Blah blah blah. I know IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY doesn't mean harm, but it's bound by the shackles of its genre and sends the wrong freaking message. Plenty of mentally ill people have all the love they can get and still choose oblivion over life because they have a problem with their brain, you condescending pricks.Mental health is a sensitive issue for me. If you want to know what it is to live with this affliction, I invite you to read this piece, by the talented Sam Hawken. I'm all for mainstream movie to discuss the issue, and I think it's fair to say that IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY does its part. Especially for a teenager movie that's supposed to make you feel cuddly. I suppose it's a movie with an interesting dual nature, but the laziness it showed in order to stay in the proper tone of its target audience angered me enough to make me shake my fist at my television screen. You cannot catch a mental illness like you catch the flu and clear yourself forever with 5 days of quarantine. You're not helping if you say everything will forever be OK again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming from a 15 year old who just saw her own life in a movie, basically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start by saying that my English may not be the best but this movie may as well be the best. I have been wanting to watch this movie for quite a while now, but I've just kept putting it off. So two days ago I stumbled across this movie in the store and just bought it. I said to myself "sit down and watch the goddamn movie for the love of pizza". And I did. And now I'm just very angry with myself for putting it off for all this time and never watched it. Because I can honestly say that this may be one of the best movies I have ever seen. And despite my young age I have seen A LOT of movies. The whole time I was watching the movie I kind of felt like I was watching my own life on the big screen. I can see myself so clear Craig. He is confused and depressed and suddenly ends up in an adult psychiatric ward. Now I'm not saying that I myself have even checked in to a psychiatric ward, that's not the point. I think I love the movie so much because it stays true to how most of us teenagers actually feel. Again, I'm not saying all of us feel exactly like Craig, because no one is the same. But I can definitely understand how Craig feels and why he does what he does. To be honest I haven't quite figured out what to write in this review, so I think I'll stop rambling now. All I need to say is that this movie is definitely worth watching. I especially think that all of you who are parents to teenagers should watch this. You might get a look into how they feel. All in all, I loved the movie and strongly recommend to anybody. It's unique and touching. All I have to do now is go buy the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to hate the cutesy plot and ideas of the film. I wanted to hate the overdone coming of age style of these types of films. But jeez, with that cast, and with those original ideas, I fell in love. I really had a pre-conceived notion about this picture, but the actor playing Craig, Zach Galifiankis, and Emma Roberts really changed my mind. AMAZING PERFORMANCES for a teen movie. Way, way more depth than you would expect. A very interesting quirky story that I believe will definitely benefit teens to hear. Emma Roberts is breathtaking and was, in my opinion, one of the highlights of the film. But then there's also Zach Galifiankis' performance. i would LOOOVE to see him take more serious roles like this. Sure, there's no denying that he is one of the most talented comedic actors working today(arguably the best), but he gave such a believable, honest, beautiful performance. It really took me by surprise. Highly Recommend this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adorable Keir Gilchrist in cute little rom-com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Craig (Keir Gilchrist) checks himself into the psych ward for his suicidal thought. At least he thinks that he's having suicidal thoughts. The children's ward is under renovation, and he's been put in with the adults for at least 5 days. He was hoping to just be given new meds. He's in love with his friend, but she's already with someone else. In the ward, he meets some real cases like Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), and quirky fellow patient Noelle (Emma Roberts).It's a very light and fluffy look at the psych ward. It's definitely not 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Keir Gilchrist is adorable. Zach Galifianakis is zany without his usual crazy wildness. Keir and Emma make for a cute couple. The movie is like the lead Craig. It thinks it's more serious than it actually is. But it works as an adorable rom-com for emotionally fragile kids. It's cute. It's likable. Sometimes, it's even funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie for teens who feel pressured to live up to standards expected by others - like parents and the peers that pass themselves off as being so 'mentally together'.Craig feels he can't cope and contemplates suicide but has better sense to seek help at a local hospital. He is so young he doesn't even understand his own problem because he thinks a pill will make everything better. Not so! After being admitted to the psychiatric ward he encounters patients with real problems and he wants out.But he cannot leave due to necessary evaluation and in the five days he's there he learns a big lesson - first he's not as crazy as he thought and that he means a lot more to his family and friends than he imagined.This is a nice fun movie but regrettably forgettable - especially the title!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon depicting depression, suicides and mental institutions, it is very easy to slip as they are delicate and personal issues for those having contacts with them, but the others can make silly jokes on "madhouses", "lunatics" etc. It's Kind of a Funny Story has chosen a distinguishing way - pleasant characters (in different manner, though; lots of colorful types), wit and fun combined with serious background and pondering, flashbacks and visualized dreams. And, of course, a strong and even cast: Keir Gilchrist (bearing role), Zach Galifianakis, Emma Roberts, Viola Davis, above all, but also other less supporting actors were at the high level. Plus, as hinted already, directing is unique and interesting. Highly recommended to all families, those with teens in particular. In my opinion, the movie in question should deserve more praise and attention it has obtained so far. Moreover, I am glad that there are more and more young actors in the English-speaking countries who are capable of profound performances, not just models becoming actors and getting involved in trivial college movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lighthearted coming of age flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sorta reminded me of the movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" nowhere near as great or dark but kinda reminded me of that movie. The story revolves around a 16yr old boy that is just paranoid about the small things in life and has intentions of suicide. So he is a young pansy that can't bear with the small things that just about everyone deals with. I mean it's understandable to be a bit afraid but this kid is in a whole another level. He is smart, has a loving family, has friends and yet he has suicidal intentions. Because he is scared he won't make it into a certain program and thinks that is basically his only future. So he wants to die and yet wants to live at the same time and ends up in a mental health click by accident. So most of this movie is about finding out that he is young and has many opportunities in life and that "He who is not busy being born is busy dying" -Bob Dylan And also bonds with the other people in the mental health clinic and find his love. This is a sweet and endearing, not all that deep or has a lot of intricate substance. Or even psychological or a lot of humanistic aspects to it. And in other areas it just doesn't seem developed enough to be believable. But has a good message that can impact some young teens or older. In fact I have a feeling this movie can change some students thoughts in Asian countries. This is a lighthearted coming of age movie, I wouldn't really say a comedy though. Zach Galifianakis is good in this, this is Zach Galifianakis as serious as he gets while trying to be slightly humorous. He usually plays roles where you can't really tell if he is being serious or not which adds to the humor. I didn't really laugh while watching this flick but smirked a few times.7.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's kind of a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anxious to watch it. 'It's kind of a funny story' is a coming to age comedy about an overstress teenager Craig (Keir Gilchrist) who feeling depression and suicidal because he is high-school junior in the gifted program trying finish his accelerated academics, get into a good college and job. He is also infatuated with his best friend's girl so he checks himself into a mental health clinic not knowing what's in store for him. I don't think a real mental health clinic would intermixed the teenagers with adults, just because the teenage ward is undergoing renovations, but we get Craig trying to connect with a somewhat mentor figure in Bobby (Zack Galifianakis), a crush on another patient Noelle (Emma Roberts) a known cutter, and a hospital full of secondary nearly cartoony characters such as Muqtada, a Sri Lanka man who never leaves his room, Solomon- a Jewish acid drug addict who always come out when somebody talk too loud, and others. The movie pretty has some amazing cutaway shots scenes, showing how stress out Craig really is with use of music, animation, lighting, and off the ball humor to the point it's an out of the world dream like. Throughout his stay, Craig forms close bonds with various patients, and hurt them in a way with the boy meet girl storyline that comes with his relationship with Noelle. The boy meet girl storyline doesn't really need to be there, in many ways, it's just typically Hollywood structure that doesn't seem realism in a hospital settling where patients can easily go amok anywhere in the hospital. The camera is bit shaken at time. While "it's kind of a funny story' isn't a 'One Flew over the Cuckoo Nest'. It's still a well -made movie, while kind of non-realism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Not very "deep", you won't discover cure for cancer with this - but the answers (yes, there are some answers)... are simple. Just it. There is no big philosophy in life, just live and enjoy, help others, smile, love - breathe. And live. But this is NOT a movie for people with serious mental problems, do not expect you will be cured out of true depression, not to mention more serious disorder. But on the other hand - this is not a movie only for teenagers with problems. There are millions of people out there with same kind of problems - lost hope, no sense in living, too much pressure and too high expectations from life, other people and from itself. There are no big jokes in this movie, no stupid aggressive jokes and ridiculous facial expressions a la J.Carrey (hate this kind of movies) but few scenes - guard bribed with some pills? Hahhaha... Awesome. Just watch this movie, whether you are in bad mood or not. Smile. Breathe. And Live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's kind of a funny story shows us into the life of a thoughtful, depressed 17 year old. He feels pressured into things he doesn't want, and is grabbing for things that he does want that seem out of his reach. He feels misunderstood by his parents; his father who seems not-quite- there and obsessed with his son achieving academic greatness, and an overreaching mother who just wants what's best for him. There are some funny satirical glimpses into what can seem like the overworked cynicism of health care professionals early in the film, but this movie really takes a heartfelt look into the psychiatric population, and the people who choose the profession. It reinforces the notion that everything you need is inside of you, and also places emphasis on the power of human connection- how others can be the catalyst for change. What I really enjoyed about the movie was it's imperfect characters, and the overall human feel of it. Zach Galifinakis shined in the first serious role I've ever seen him in. There were a few really heart wrenching moments with Zach, and I almost wondered where he drew that emotion from; maybe there was something real in his life that he focused on to play those few intense parts. The girl who played the main character's love interest was brilliant; she held such power in her eyes, facial expressions, and beauty in general. This movie is worth a watch; I've seen it three times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's kind of a funny story how I got myself into this movie. I've heard about it before, with all the advertisements and trailers promoting it. I passed it off as another teenage flick trying to provoke something out of us that actually never really does. And I also found it to be a cheap rip-off of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but all flowered up. That was back in 2010, when I was judging books by it's cover. In 2012, nowadays, I watched in HBO, not really expecting anything out of it. But things seemed to subside as the film deeply enriches us into it's story, that maybe some people really don't understand... The acting was actually really good. I mean, Zach Galifianakis is kind of the same person in all his films, but somehow his character was different. He was mysterious and kind of witty, different from his previous roles. The real star here is the protagonist Craig, played by Keir Gilchrist. It takes quite some time to understand and communicate with his character, but when you finally do you'll understand the film greater. The supporting cast also gave in to this film, supporting it with some warmhearted-ness.. Guess what? The film was actually really good. It was kind of strange in ways, and you have to kind of wait until you start to feel it, and then everything previously was all understandable. By the end, the movie gets to you and the movie's core somewhat as a profound balance. I recommend it. Should you see it? Watch it with no expectations, then walk yourself through the strangeness until you finally realize what your getting yourself into. It was actually well done and held some wit with it. It's Kind of a Funny Story how the critics didn't get along with it, maybe the movie wasn't complex enough for them? Didn't provide that certain depth they wanted? Nevertheless, see it for your own good. 8/10.</fullReview>

Seriously, the "i'm crazy and i'm gonna do crazy things" scene, the rebel "let's do this cause is not allowed" scene, the girl, the weird patients that do not recover... there's even a turntable (for some reason...21st century anyone? a teenager?) and an ethnic roommate with a final revelation. Cast is fine, not great, but fine. Even Viola Davis with just a few lines. And the main good thing i got from it is that it left me singing Queen's "Under pressure" for the rest of the day.

Not just because this is so common these days, but 'cos I think about it sometime. Just a thought. Besides, the movie is so beautiful! It's really weird that "It's Kind of a Funny Story" didn't get any nomination or award from any film festival. There are so many good films don't get credit. What a shame! Don't get it wrong. This is a comedy and feel good movie. Yet, it's heartfelt. I think we can see ourselves in some aspects of the characters. Like, I bet sometime we say "Why is this life so hard?", "Why is it so easy for her (or him)?", "Why are my parents always fighting each other?", "Why am I so depressed, tired and full of hatred?"Why? Why? Why? Wow, nonstop questioning and there is no answer. There are only struggling feelings inside, or worse, emptiness. That is what happens to those characters in the movie. It's really sympathized to see some people like you, see how cleverly and clumsily they deal with their lives. And you realize something so simple that you forgot. It's life. It's not for suffering. It's for living. Still, those gloomy feelings are there and waiting to swallow you anytime. But it's worth struggling with those feelings. It's worth that, because you only have one life to live. Don't waste it on suffering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Kind of a Funny Story"... It's kind of an amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck comes the 2010 comedy "It's Kind of a Funny Story", an incredible little film to say the least. As someone who really identifies with it, I loved this film and the portrayal of the characters, and found it very true-to-life.Keir Gilchrist ("United States of Tara") stars as Craig, a depressed teenager who apparently wants to kill himself. Wandering into a hospital, he finds himself admitted to the psych ward, where, over the next five days, he will meet an interesting (and very realistic) cast of characters, and go through some life-changing events.The film is very sweet, and has a good heart to it. Gilchrist, who I admired in his role on Showtime's "United States of Tara" proves to be a capable, likable actor who really knows how to appeal to you. Zach Galifiankis co-stars as Bobby, as fellow patient, in a role that really tests him and proves he has what it takes to be a good, dramatic actor. Another surprising shout-out is Emma Roberts (daughter of Eric, and niece of Julia), who portrays Noelle, a cute young woman that Craig falls for. She is a very real, fleshed out character, and Roberts does an amazing job with the role- you really feel for her. She's someone to watch for- it was already in her blood, and here, she lives up to her talented family name. I''m excited to see where her career and Gilchrists go, as they are some of the most talented young actors around today.I have read some complaints about how the film is supposedly "unrealistic", but as someone who stayed in a psych ward twice when I was a troubled teen, I can assure you, this is one of the most realistic portrayals of a psych-ward I have ever seen. Everything in this film (including the controversial "teen being put in the adult ward") is true to my own experiences, and I really applaud how life-like this film is.I also will say that Boden and Fleck do an incredible job with their direction. The film has a unique indie flair to it, and while maintaining the realism, is very stylish in its own way. I am not familiar with their other work, but am anticipating seeing it soon.The supporting characters are all played well, and all very realistic and charming. The patients at the hospital, while sometimes the fodder of jokes, are never mistreated or exploited in any way. We're not laughing at the characters, we're laughing at the circumstances, which is what any comedy should do.I honestly adore this film. It is a great, stand-out piece of work with a lot of charm and heart. I would recommend this to anyone- it will put a big smile on your face, and hope in your heart. I give it a perfect 10!</fullReview>

He meets a lot of patients in the clinic who all have their individual odd charms and interacts mainly with Bobby (Galifianakis) and Noelle (Roberts); i thought Galifianakis gave a pretty good performance because played serious and funny in the same role whereas we all know how he is in 'The Hangover' and Roberts was good as well but i thought at some points slightly stale.Gilchrist does carry this movie well and the quirky scenes where everyone dozes off into their fantasy world are priceless and imaginative.So if you want a funny movie with a subtle message in it, you should watch this movie. It gets you kinda depressed in the beginning but leaves you smiling at the end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discovering who you are and finding optimism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not "One Flew Over..." but it does achieve its aim of making an excellent comedy out of the dilemmas of one gifted high school boy Craig played by Keir Gilchrist. The opening sequence reveals how well crafted this whole work will be, slipping seamlessly from reality to a boy's mind and back again without letting us lose our way. There is a credit worthy sensitivity to the plight of the mentally ill without ever falling into the sickly sweet category or concentrating on overbearing behaviour, high drama, and continual banality. One thing this film plays over and over again is that what you remember about other people is so very important to how you find yourself.There is some lovely naivety on view here too and it is not reserved to those with growing pains either as we observe all the people playing the same game of life with each other as if testing out every hand hold every foothold on the long climb towards trusting themselves as they trust others.The pace of the film is very close to perfect and so we are swept along as if no time has past at all but a whole heap of stuff has happened, and the script has some real laugh out loud moments. But the comedy is for the main restricted to real human funniness, the little quirks that make each of us endearing in some small way to everybody else. And that is something this film has in buckets as it endears us to all that we witness because it all matters.The acting is first class throughout and it would be unfair to select out individuals because I loved them all. This is a very good film, very well written and directed by Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. It deserves to be on everybody's list of "must see movies".I have awarded it eight out of ten but it was so close to a nine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with the same title of a great book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this for all the people who read the book and are wondering if the movie will go along with it. Well the answer to that is no. The book and the movie are two completely different things. Zach Galifianakis' portrayal of Bobby is nothing like the one from the book. Actually I think they didn't even take anything of the book Bobby and put it in the movie.As for Noelle I think they might have actually improved her character. She actually seemed like a person and not some manic pixie dream girl. Craig's relationship with everyone besides those two characters is weak. He never really connects with anyone else unlike in the book. Everything is mostly different in the beginning but I think if the people who read the book stick through it they might enjoy the movie. Just Like I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite films of 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a while ago, and recently re-watched it. It is still great on re-watch. I found the premise to be very fresh, and I thought the dialogue throughout was excellent. The way the film presents what would normally be an entirely serious subject matter (depression, and other mental health issues in a psyche ward)in a comedic fashion, while still being a serious film was the strongest part of the film. The interactions between Keir Gilchrist and Zach Galifianakis were awesome, and there were many truly memorable scenes in this movie. Emma Roberts was good as well, though I think she is good in pretty much everything she does. I recommend it to almost anyone, because it crosses between dramatic and comedic elements seamlessly, so it has something to offer to just about everybody.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie Even Better Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie follows Craig Gilner(Gilchrist), a 15 year old who struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. This movie really touches on the pressures of being a teen and how everybody is a little crazy. I really enjoyed watching this movie. It touched on some very serious subjects, but was still light-hearted and enjoyable. If you liked the movie, you should defiantly consider reading the book. It gives you a better insight of Craig character and some of his issues. For example in the movie, Craig spends most of his time trying to figuring out the problems of Bobby(Galifianakis)and be there for him. However, in the book Craig is mostly focused on himself getting better. Also in the book,Noelle(Roberts)has more of a background that really helps shape Craig's character development. This was not added in the movie. All things consider, this movie was really impressive and enjoyed watching it. I hope you do too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting "indie" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Kind of a Funny Story is a light dramedy with intellectual claims and an ensemble of picturesque characters who are completely away from reality. As you might have already figured out, this is another "indie" which tries to illuminate our day with the likable adventures of various bizarre and occurring characters, with which we share our joys and unexpected sorrows, and which try to make us appreciate our lives as hollow and insipid they might be. And I think that It's Kind of a Funny Story achieves all that mainly thanks to a well balanced screenplay which does not use the comedy and the drama as opposites, but as efficient complements which allow the creation of characters with a sincere humanity behind their ridiculously picturesque "madness".Like we have seen in other movies about personal reflection and self-analysis, It's Kind of a Funyn Story employs the old strategy of assigning a different facet of the main character's nature to every other character. And I think that that works pretty well.It's Kind of a Funny Story could be described like a teenage version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, seasoned with the black humor from Girl, Interrupted and filtered with the sensibility from the modern "indie" cinema. According to the taste from every spectator, that combination might sound likable or absolutely repulsive. I belong to the first group, despite the presence of a few forced dialogs and artificial moments of visual "creativity". However, that did not avoid me from enjoying this film pretty much, mainly because of the generally well written screenplay and the competent performances. Keir Gilchrist feels honest and credible in the leading role, and I also liked the work from the rest of the actors, highlighting Zach Galifianakis, Jeremy Davies and Emma Roberts.In conclusion, It's Kind of a Funny Story is an interesting and very entertaining film, and I can recommend it because of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie to see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very pleasant surprise that I stumbled across on Cinemax.It's clever and hilarious! How very refreshing to see that there are still talented people out there who number one, can write! Number two, have imagination! Number three, aren't afraid to take chances and number four, can bring it all together with a great cast! I was becoming bored with the "same old, same old" and while taking in a new movie once a week, everything began to seem repetitive(with the exception of a few). I do not recall any advertisement for the movie at any theaters but perhaps I ignored them if I saw them. If that's the case then I'm glad I did because It was nice to find a good movie in between "movie night out". The acting in this movie was incredibly natural with good timing and imagination. There's a little something for everyone (age appropriate of course). It's one of those "you don't have to be in the mood for it" type of movies. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zach Galifianakis is taking the Robin Williams' career route doing something like this. Williams was a strict comedy actor until doing the acclaimed Good Will Hunting which gave him respectable recognition as a drama actor. Williams also does wonderful films such as One Hour Photo and World's Greatest Dad. Galifianakis made a name for himself in The Hangover, and now shows he is completely capable of carrying a steady drama role, without going over the top.It's odd how even though the poster, and some of the trailer, make this look like a romantic comedy that it failed to become a success at the box office. Even branded with such actors like Jim Gaffigan, Zach Galifianakis, and Emma Roberts didn't seem to help the film's case. This is the case of where a film is highly respected by people who read the book (written by Ned Vizzini, respectively), and people who just stumbled upon this blindly. Consider me blind.The plot: Craig (Gilchrist) checks himself into a psychiatric center after awakening from a dream where he was seconds away from killing himself. Craig doesn't appear to be depressed. He seems like the kind of adolescent who is indecisive and worried about his future. He doesn't seem confident in his life, and therefore, doesn't feel he should live it out. Craig quickly befriends Bobby (Galifianakis), an adult who is secretive about his past, and optimistic about his present.Craig also has a brewing crush on fellow patient Noelle (Roberts). Noelle is beautiful, and an absolute sweetheart, but has a dirty habit of cutting herself. Craig and Noelle take on an awkward relationship, but find out their interests aren't very far apart.It's Kind of a Funny Story sounds a little like another recent film called The Art of Getting By. It had mixed reactions at Sundance, when it was called Homework, and received little to no attendance when in limited release, but still managed to gross over a million dollars. The Art of Getting By, also starring Roberts, was about an adolescent, who in his Senoir year of high school, completely disregards his homework, and believes "if I'm going to die, why should I care." That film was brutally honest, and was one of the better features of 2011. Definitely one of the most overlooked.There are times in the film where it becomes a little too sweet, and tends to drag on with preachy, over-developed aspects. Take for example a lot of the teenager-on-therapist discussions. They're drawnout, and slow, and the film seems to want to finish them as quickly as possible, but they keep asking questions.I'm not sure how good the novel was, but from what it seems like, It's Kind of a Funny Story has rounded up a number of fans who enjoy the story. Even though the film wasn't perfect, I'm glad we got to see this great story be adapted to film. So many films come out that are either poorly constructed, or just convoluted stories. It's Kind of a Funny Story is an easy story to get into, and it just might be one of many colors.Starring: Keir Gilchrist, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Roberts, and Viola Davis. Directed by: Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Kind of a Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what can I say about this movie. I like the basic concept and yes there were some laughs throughout the movie. At some parts I felt bored but then that was quickly changed with a good laugh. The reasons I gave it seven stars are the reasons that follow.The plot definitely deserves probably about four of those stars. I think the maybe could have added more to the ending. But I was usually laughing. A little confused at times but usually laughing. I love how it isn't predictable. My friend and I sat there guessing what was going to happen the whole movie and every time we turned out to be wrong.The final four stars goes to the cast. They all worked really well together and overall made the movie great. Thei acting was amazing and it just made the movie seem almost real. Now I liked it and each part deserved some credit but I don't believe I will be watching it again. It was a good movie but I would not have it as a favorite.</fullReview>

I would not go into details but the movie just embodies several good moral lessons a person must have. I, myself admit that I was awakened by this movie. It isn't an extravagant movie but well worth the watch in my opinion. I liked how the plot was done and how the characters complement each other. This is a must watch for people who are stressed, burned out or fuzzy. Keir Gilchrist gave justice to the lead character and so was Zach Galifianakis.

So he decides to check himself into the psychiatric ward of a hospital. He thinks that they will help him and send him back home in time for school the next day. Instead he ends up spending a week on the ward. Because the younger persons ward is being renovated he must stay on the same ward as the older adults as well as a few younger people. A man called Bobby (Zac Galifianakis) from the Hangover helps to show him around. After being there for a while he begins to show interest in a girl on the same ward as him called Noelle (Emma Roberts) who happens to be about the same age. They soon become good friends. There were some situations in the film that i found very funny and could relate to. I would really recommend this movie as it is very enjoyable to watch!: My Rating 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows That We All Deserve Second Chances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Kind of a Funny Story" is an inspiring story that demonstrates the concept about rectifying from your mistakes and that everyone deserves a chance of redemption. With the world we live in, there comes a time when the stress factor gets so overwhelming, you just don't know what to do with yourself and that's understanding, we all go through that in some points in our lives. Sometimes the only solutions is to step back, take a breather from all the chaos surrounding you and try to concentrate on what matters to you over anything else. With every secondary needs and wants pushed aside, and the important stuff that matters more, we get the feeling that life doesn't have to be a constant struggle if you choose to live like that. Based on the 2006 novel by Ned Vizzini, the movie focuses on a young adolescent named Craig (Keir Gilchhist) embarks on a five-day journey to find himself as he voluntarily checks himself into a psychiatric hospital due to the overwhelming curve balls life is throwing at him. In his journey, Craig is accompanied by a kindred spirited psychiatrist Dr. Eden Minerva (Viola Davis) and a fellow patient Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) and along the way, a very special young lady named Noelle (Emma Roberts) are inspirations to get Craig back on his feet. The great qualities of "It's Kind of a Funny Story" stems from the fact that it keeps the genre in tact, without getting overly moody and balances the comedy and dramatic situations equally and doesn't depend on Hollywood to get too preachy about it. In fact the title of the movie is customized for the movie intends to be a "kind of funny story". It's a funny story that's supported with some very serious traits to go with it. The acting exhibited in this movie has a satisfying aftertaste and with the diverse character traits of the patients in the ward, it succeeds in adding dimension in the story. However I must give a hats off to Zach Galifianakis who just about throws in a dominating performance as Craig's buddy and fellow inmate, Bobby. His character is an enigmatic puzzlement. He is both a troubled soul with some positive vibes in him, he can be both humorous and touching he can be encouraging and cynical all at once. But no matter what he is, the characters and the camera feed off his antics flawlessly. Joining Galifianakis is a talent pool of relative young performers like Keir Gilchrist, Emma Roberts, Zoe Kravitz and veteran performers Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan are Craig's parents. The exciting dialogue is joy to listen to thanks mainly by the immaculate script by Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden will make you laugh out loud and drive you to tears. The main weak link in the story that feels out of place is Zoe Kravitz's portrayal of Craig's love interest Nia before he met Noelle in the psychiatric ward. I personally thought she was a mean, annoying badly clichéd soulless chick who didn't come across as anything remotely believable. I felt that Craig's friendship with her was rather awkward because she is his best friend and is in a relationship with his best friend Aaron (Thomas Mann). It's also peculiar that Craig hangs around with Aaron knowing that Aaron is not very supportive towards him. These shallow friendships have no significance to the story. In the end, we could all use a bit of a hiatus from the trails and tribulations of the constant rush of life. We should all take the advice from the Dr. Minerva that we all need to find ourselves and there is always a good chance to erase the things from our past in hopes to build a new future. We owe ourselves a second chance at life. Life is too short and we all need to make the most of our lives. It's all right to slow down at times in some ways as we slow down, you can truly find the meaning of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable, different take on "coming of age."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keir Gilchrist, really a teenager, is Craig Gilner. He is going through the normal teen issues and also happens to be a worrier. How seriously, probably not, he contemplates suicide so calls a 24-hour suicide line. As a fairly simply guy, he takes their advice to go to a clinic, where they promptly check him in as a suicidal patient. Thus begins his mini-odyssey.There he encounters an assortment of characters, most of them with legitimate mental issues. One of them is cute Emma Roberts as Noelle. She has scars, she cuts herself. But they quickly become attracted to each other. Craig is a bit surprised by this, but willing.The third key character is the funny Zach Galifianakis as Bobby, who at first appears to be working in the clinic, but he has been there so long he knows all the ways around security. He ends up becoming friends with Craig and helping him see some of his issues more clearly.It does turn out to be a kind of a funny story, Craig spends a few days in the clinic and soon is on his way. His friendship with Noelle helps her get on her own personal road to recovery.A very nice movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always said that a movie that makes you feel something is a movie worth watching. Whether it is hate, guilt, love, sadness, sympathy, or something entirely different, it is the connection with the story and the characters that makes a movie great. There are two main pieces of the puzzle. The casting and the story itself.This movie is no exception. The lead character, Craig (played by Keir Gilchrist), immediately connects with me from the first scene of the movie. Zach Galifianakis who plays Bobby, one of the patients in the psych ward, gave yet another great performance. Along with the other patients, doctors and nurses, I thought the casting of this movie was very well done. I immediately fell in love with Emma Roberts, who plays Noelle, a troubled teen who is also living in the psych ward when Craig arrives. For me their relationship was my central interest in this movie, followed by the development of Bobby's character.The plot is very simple, and not really the central focus of the story. This story is about personal interactions, and the growth of each character throughout the movie. I recommend this for anyone curled up on a couch who wants to get lost in a very well directed, heart-warming movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Kind of a Funny Story, yes it actually is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨The difference between today and last Saturday is that for the first time in a while, I can look forward to the things I want to do in my life. Bike, eat, drink, talk, ride the subway, read, run, travel, swim, skip.¨ They say that two heads think better than one, and that might be the case with directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck who have collaborated in the past with films such as Half Nelson (which gave Ryan Gosling his first Oscar nomination), and the surprise critical hit of 2009: Sugar, about a Dominican baseball player trying to make it in the major leagues and adapting to his new life in the United States. The Cohen brothers also prove this point so there is nothing wrong with teaming up as directors. Boden and Fleck have demonstrated their directorial talents before and do it once again with It's Kind of a Funny Story. The three films they have directed are all very different from each other, and this is more or less a dramatic comedy with probably more drama to it than comedy. This isn't one of those laugh out loud Galifianakis comedies, it is much more serious, but there are still plenty of laughs (or at least scenes that will make you smile). This movie has some heart to it as well; there is good chemistry between the two young characters played by Gilchrist and Roberts. The romantic story works, the drama works, and so does the comedy as long as you aren't expecting a film like The Hangover. Boden and Fleck adapted the screenplay themselves from the novel of the same name written by Ned Vizzini. This is not your typical Hollywood film, it is different and you probably would expect that if you've seen the rest of the films they have directed.Craig (Keir Gilchrist from the United States of Tara series) is a smart kid, who studies at a gifted school, and has a normal loving family, but who deals with depression and suicidal thoughts. He is obsessed with his best friend Aaron's (Thomas Mann) girlfriend Nia (Zoe Kravitz). Craig decides to check himself into a mental institution on Sunday expecting to spend the day there, but doctors decide he should stay a week and follow the program since he claims to be a danger to himself. His parents Lynn (Lauren Graham from Gilmore Girls) and George (Jim Gaffigan) are supportive of the doctor's decision and decide to let him stay at the mental hospital in the adult ward since the juvenile section is under renovation. Craig is really stressed out with his life and about getting the Gates Application for Summer school which would look great for his college resume. His father is always focused on his job, but is pushing Craig so that he can get the application. Craig seems to be obsessed and stressed out with all these little things, and forgotten therefore to enjoy life. In the ward he meets patients with much greater problems than his own. He befriends Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) who teaches him a couple things about life, but who seems to have a lot of issues of his own. Then there is his Egyptian roommate who never speaks to anyone or leaves the room, Muqtada (Bernard White). And finally he meets Noelle (Emma Roberts) a girl about his age who he begins falling for. Together the patients learn from each other and Craig begins to find help in his therapy sessions with Dr. Eden Minerva (Viola Davis), as well as with drawing and music sessions.It's Kind of a Funny Story might not be as funny as you expect, but it is kind of a sweet story. The film doesn't try to be preachy or anything like that at all, but it is kind of uplifting and one can find a way out of depression by watching this movie. Finding the things one enjoys in life and focusing on them instead of all the other issues can help live a less stressful life. The characters in the ward are much more interesting than the rest of the characters from the outside world. Craig's parents, his friend Aaron and his girlfriend all are left in the background since they are outshined by the patients who are way better developed in the film. Galifianakis shines in every scene he is in, Gilchrist and Roberts are really good together on screen and share some great chemistry, and the rest of the patients all share the most memorable moments of the movie. We are drawn into the world of the mental hospital and could care less about the outside world. One of the best scenes of the movie is when the patients get together for their musical therapy and they all play the song Under Pressure. It's Kind of a Funny Story reminds us that there is more to life than just study and work, it's the little things which can give us the most pleasure out of life. We can't change anything through worrying so why stress out so much. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it although be warned it's not your typical Hollywood film. It is kind of slowly paced, but once you meet the characters inside the ward it's worth it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenager stuck in a adults psych ward ultimately discovers life and love! Too good to be true but 'It's a kind of funny story' is all about that impossible feet. At the start I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and its unique plot along with the acting. So it's a good movie. All I'm trying to say is how good it is. Craig is a 16 year old kid who is under numerous pressures for his age. Not because he has an abusive family who doesn't support him but because of the total opposite. His parents wants to give him the best education out there and put him to a good school but for Craig all that makes him nervous and depressed. He doesn't seems to be having any one who really wants to listen to his side of the story and becomes clinically depressed and dream of suicide even though he never tries it. Thinking of finding a remedy he reaches to a nearby hospital and surprisingly find himself admitted for 5 days in an adult psych ward. There Craig meets different individuals who seems to be strange at first but later on becomes familiar and he start to share his issues, problems and views of life with. Among these people the 6 times suicide attempted Bobby who is waiting to go home and the sweet teen Noelle become much closer to him. Through these people Craig start to look at things differently and realizes that life that he knows is just a fraction of what he is yet to discover. Strangely finding comforting advice from Bobby and love and care and from Noelle, Craig becomes a different person. The plot sounds too serious when you read it. But believe me the movie is totally light weight and funny. Which is one strong reason that make you believe that something good will happen at the end and every things gonna be OK. This will give you a totally different perspective of life without making you miserable looking at some bunch of psychologically ill people. Even though it's funny still it strongly manages to keep the plot intact and deliver the message. The point of the whole movie is that understanding and appreciating the things what you already have than being depressed and negative towards what you don't have, can make you a better and a happy person. When it comes to acting the strange yet likable character of Bobby is prominent. It's played by Zach Galifianakis, in a unique way which immediately starts to provide and impact. From the scene where he appears as a doctor and to the scene where he finally get to leave the hospital this character is unique and memorable. Not that the lead character (Craig) played by Keir Gilchrist is poor or has less weight, Bobby is the steering of the whole movie which turns it where it should go. The movie is not boring or does it drag. It's the right length with right momentum from the start to end. Each character is given some prominence even how big or small there appearance is. (Good example is the Egyptian patient Muqtada). With little bit of creative story telling via Craig's mind and how he imagine it to roll 'It's a kind of funny story' will keep you entertained for sure. And just as the tagline states "Sometimes what's in your head isn't as crazy as you think"more of my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because of the pressures of being a teenager, Craig (Gilchrist) decides to end it all.Always looking for a funny story, I took this out, slipped it into the Player and was immediately shocked as to what teenager Craig (Gilchrist) wanted to do. He wanted to commit suicide (See? That is what I get for not reading the box). Nothing funny about that. Okay, so I said nervously, no review, just watch and see how it goes. However, Craig decides to give himself more time and checks into a mental health clinic to find out what is wrong with him, and maybe hoping to get a few pills and be on his way.So I stayed with it and found out that there seemed to be balance here. Onward. I thought all he needed was a viable girl friend and he'd be okay. Then there would be no movie, right? When asked about having a girl friend he replies, "working on it." He has a crush on his best friend's girl, Nia (Kravitz). During the Psychiatrist interview he cites pressures as the world economy, wars, school, grades, and living up to parents' expectations, and rejection among some other things too long to remember - didn't think I would have needed to remember all those things. Remember I said "no review." He has to stay in the clinic for 5-days and his parents bring him clothes and toiletries. Long story short, Craig does learn about himself and what he has to be appreciative of, and sees others in a worse condition than he thinks he was in and ends up helping them without realizing it. He also meets Noelle (Roberts) and, of course, falls for her in a "I'm not in any rush to get involved with you" kind of way. But, he is secretly happy that someone??. a real live girl, sees him in a good way. Of course, he falls for her anyway despite his warnings to himself. I wouldn't say this is a comedy, but perhaps light drama regarding a very serious subject. Because he is in the adult section of the clinic, he does hear and see some funny things that go on. Some I even had to laugh at. Remember, he is in a mental clinic. It is now that I remember I should have watched One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. One day?..Bobby (Galifianakis) becomes his friend and both confide in and learn from each other. I have heard that Zach Galifianakis is the new hot comedian, but in here I didn't see him that way, and if he made attempts at comedy, I was unaware of them although I did keep watch. He just played an inmate who was resigned to his fate and who couldn't find anything to help him snap out of it. I kept staring at his eyes because they reminded me so much of Robert Redford. He has Robert Redford eyes. That's it. Not sure how I know that, but there it is. I know it seems like I've told you a lot about the story, but not really. It's better if you watch because it's all in the telling and Craig does narration as well as speak as a character. Because of the subject matter I was afraid what might come next in the story, but as I mentioned above, there is balance in here and the suicide angle of the story is not dwelled upon except in the beginning when I said, "no review." And, this is turning out to be one of the longer ones. Go figure. The music in here is pretty good. The name of the group is called Broken Social Scene. I ordered the CD.This is a story perhaps every teenager should see and think about. A good life direction could be won. As for the title, if this was indeed a true story then the title fits. But, wait a minute: it probably is a true story for many who feel pressure from all sides, only they don't know it yet. What Craig learned could apply to them as well. Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, a couple F-bombs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I rarely comment or write reviews on movies here, only for specially under- or overrated movies, like Youth in Revolt (underrated) and Book of Eli (overrated).So, I know that my English is not very good and I know that I have no idea on how to give a good and critical review but I will give it my best shot here below. I'll start with my feelings about the movie and end with my thought on the acting, directing and writing.I like the movie very much (already not a good "critical" review since I used "I like") and I can see myself in almost the exact scenario three years ago, when I was sixteen. Good family (although divorced), friends, straight 10s at school (10 = A+, I think .. highest grade) and good social life. I was, and am, one of the lucky ones in this world, and I have always realized that. Nevertheless I came close to attempting suicide when I was 16 and lived almost the exact same scenario as the kid that this movie is about.I think this movie deserves more credit than 7.2 because it basically has no flaws. All the flaws mentioned in the comments here are only personal views from people who don't understand the point that several situations in the movie, or the whole movie, make. The point this movie makes is life. It's just life, there are several lessons taught in the movie, like the "grass is greener on the other side" or "being ungrateful for everything one has". It paints a very real image of modern society, the society we live in, the people who actually have the capability, time and resources to come to IMDb and write a review.The main character's relationship with other characters is believable and I think all the characters are well-built, the only scene I didn't like is when Nia freaks out after the "puke-in-crazy-egyptians-bed" thing, it seemed out of character, but it gave the plot a new romantic twist. I liked the acting, the directing was pretty easy since it's a slow-paced movie and is almost always in the same place.Basically, this movie is not a comedy but you get a very warm feeling when character's interact because the relationship developing is very good in the movie so you feel like you know the main character well and, in some cases, you can relate to him. It's a dramatic movie, but it becomes fun because of the teenager's humor, some kind of irony/sarcasm/what-the-hell-just-happened mixture of humor. I regard this movie as a 9, there are no real weak spots but it's not a divine or perfect movie, it's just a very good movie, it's only real problem is that the movie is forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something old, yet completely new.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Zach Galifianakis fan, so when my friend told me about this movie I went to see it right away. It's nothing new. A messed up kid deals with all the usual stuff - love, school, friends, loneliness. But the way they combine humour and compassion is really great. The acting there is really good, the jokes aren't tasteless and the clichés don't feel out of place. Towards the end of the movie, though, it felt a little like they're trying people to prevent from suicides.Overall, the movie was pretty good, and if I had to compare, I'd say it is a modern version of "One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest", with a little bit of "Little Miss Sunshine" and "Youth In Revolt" in it, which coincidentally are all movies I like very much.If you like movies about eccentric people - this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought i would see a funny and romantic comedy with lots of heart, an interesting story and lovable characters. While it does have some interesting characters it is still pretty disappointing. it is just too short. most of the time nothing really happens. there aren't a lot of jokes nor much drama. most characters are pretty flat, while others are just plain boring (Our main character). Emma Roberts is barely a supporting role, and she shares way too few scenes with the protagonist to make the love story believable. They have pretty much no chemistry whatsoever which kills most romantic comedies. Also in its best moments the movie is just kind of funny but never really. its not dark enough to be a drama about mental problems nor funny enough to be a comedy. it doesn't have enough plot and doesn't go deep enough into characters. The ending is cute, but there wasn't enough before to explain the change of the protagonists mental problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When "Kind of a Funny Story" came out, I didn't pay attention to it, I must be honest. I thought the plot line didn't have that much to drawn me onto theaters or whatever. The fact is I was wrong. Brilliantly thought-provoking, this film has so much to offer as a deep observation of normality and how people deal with common sense, which may not be as "common" as we think. I was sincerely moved by the movie. See.. we have this institution where the rejected interact with each other. By far, suicidal tendencies, anger management and dealing with modern stress and depression (the main pathology of our times) are the subjects which lock them up in this asylum. Those who have enough sensitivity to avoid our "normal" world's demands, are sent inside. They're too cracked up to make things work. Of course there are other kind of patients with real pathology, but it impressed me how some of them are simply as human as they can be. Teenagers, old people, caring needed people. As a consequence, it is not awkward that we find true love stories, false love stories, genius team work, wise advices, wiser thoughts and awesome discovering about life's purpose, all inside that institution. Maybe the place to learn to care about your fellows, more than any outside-world institution. Government, stores, universities, schools, whatever you think of. This movie shocked me with its message. And Zach G. is awesome, too. This is our modern "One Flew Over..", but less formal. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From zero to hundred - that's how the movie paces. The last fifteen minutes are the best parts of the rather melodramatic story.Talking chiefly about depression, psychosis &amp; relationships, the plot revolves around the inhabitants of a psych-home wherein the actors portray fathomable characters. Music, art &amp; psychology is discussed in ample amounts as the lead characters figure out what life is about.It does stun the audience to lose effect in the first half, but if you keep patience &amp; interpret what it tries to decipher, you won't be disappointed with the second half. It has hookups, humor &amp; deep stuffs. People who term this a kinda boring movie, I bet, had stopped midway watching it. From a satiated viewer, it is 7.0 out of 10.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended 'cause almost all the elements in here can be related in real-life of both an adolescent &amp; an adult. Good.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity/Vulgarity/Sex: No | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: No | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: No | Violence: Mild | Gore: No</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light but interesting and thought-provoking film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The start of the film, when Craig is on the bridge and imagined his family's reactions, really hooked me as these are thoughts I have discussed in various situations, such as the impact on siblings or parents of a suicide. For me, there was no part of the film that I thought could/should have been cut, and I felt that every scene was important. However, the classic plot device of the love-interest being mad at the protagonist for cheating on them in some way was somewhat disappointing and I thought that a situation like a mental clinic could have a more creative and interesting plot device to achieve the same goal.Keir Gilchrist played Craig very well I thought, as he was reserved and portrayed a depressed teen like I thought it should be. That's my opinion though, so it's probably wrong. Dana DeVestern playing Noelle was good, but any fair-haired pretty actress could have played her. Like I said though, she fit the character well. I thought that Zach Galifianakis stole his scenes, and played his character Bobby very well, showing how Bobby appears confident and in control to start and slowly we see that all is not what it seems in his life. I haven't read the book so I don't know what happens concerning further character development for Bobby, but I would have liked to have seen what happens to him after he leaves, and maybe a photo during the end sequence of him and Craig meeting up.Most importantly, this movie really made me consider the reality of life; what it means to be human and the consequences of having a high intellect (i.e. as a human we can doubt ourselves and our worth, whereas a dog is pretty much black and white with its decisions). Though it's not a 'watch-it-again' kind of movie for me, this ranks quite highly on my list of favourite movies. I would recommend to a friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the movie, it was clear for me that it was much more than meets the eye, that made me look things from a different perspective, and for me that is the best benchmark to tell if a movie, book, TV show or any other form of entertainment is really good. The plot in general isn't that original, but the producers's approach was pretty good, with some really nice twists. The role play is really good, not to mention that is pretty hard to act like a madman and convince someone else that you really are, but to be honest, I didn't expect anything else from such a cast. All in all, I think the aim of the movie is to make you think that if your problems seem to be big at first glance, there are other people who are doing much worse than you. That's all I have to say, no spoilers (I hope), just go watch the movie and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Kind of a Funny Story- *** (out of 4) Everybody's got problems and some people's are bigger than others. 16 year old Craig is one of those with serious problems (or so he thinks), he's stressed out and suicidal. He can't stand the anxiety anymore, so he goes to a mental institution. When he gets there, he immediately regrets it, but in the end, he manages to develop some confidence in himself and even make a few new friends and a love interest. It may not be the most expressive or emotional teen flick you've ever seen, but there is no mistaking this film's beautiful story. Its sympathy for neurotics and crazies makes this special indeed and the message that you just have to grasp life is one of a kind, plus you can't go wrong with Galifinakis as a suicidal oddball with great advice and a swagger all his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The coming of age story for an overwhlemed boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Kind of a Funny Story is a good movie, but not a great. The plot is somewhat original, the acting is okay, and it's funny. It is advertised (and even described in the above synopsis) as being about a "clinically depressed teenager". This makes it sound like it will be a "Girl, Interrupted" kind of movie, however, that is slightly misleading.The story focuses on Craig (Keir Gilchrist) a 16-year-old boy living in New York City. Craig is absolutely collapsing under the pressure of his vigorous schoolwork, preparations for college, busy parents, and the fact he is in love with his best friend's girlfriend. He is so overwhelmed that he feels the urge to kill himself, and decides to check himself into a psychiatric ward. He foolishly thinks he can just stay for one night and "get better". But Craig quickly realizes it's not such a quick fix, and is in for a 5-day stay. While in the psych ward, Craig develops relationships with some other patients. Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) is a funny, middle aged man suffering with severe mental health issues, who ends up teaching Craig a lot about life. Alyssa (Dana DeVestern) is a creative girl who cuts herself and (it's pretty obvious even from the trailers) develops romantic feelings for Craig. Craig even ends up learning from his roommate Muqtada (Bernard White), an Egyptian man who never speaks or leaves his bed. Through his experience in the psych ward, Craig learns about life, maturity, love, and his own personal passions.It's Kind of a Funny Story is not so much about a teenager overcoming mental illness, as a teenager learning to deal with the pressures of normal life. The fact is that Craig does NOT have a mental illness, and he quickly learns that when he is around truly sick people. If anything, this movie sheds light on how the pressures of education, parents, and society are so great that it literally pushes young people to the edge of their sanity. Truly, this is an issue that should be discussed more, because there ARE many teens like Craig who experience mental anguish because of the immense stress piled on them. However, the problem with the way this story is told is that Craig is? not all that likable. Throughout most of the movie he comes off as a whiny, annoying, wimp. These characteristics, along with the fact he has a good family and very privileged life can leave many viewers irritated. For those who are or know someone mentally ill this movie can come off as borderline (no pun intended) insulting. But to truly understand and enjoy this film, you must see that it is about society's out of control pressures on teenagers, not mental illness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's kind of a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Transpiring through the commonly perturbed mind of a contemporaneous teenager attempting to survive the unremitting bombardment of fulfilling parental expectations,materializing overly ambitious college aspirations and completing mountain- high piles of difficult assignments; "It's Kind of a Funny Story" fine-tunes our scope of life- particularly the precollege youth's scope- by enhancing the erstwhile blurred areas from which to derive veritable happiness through the enlightening juxtaposition of true depression against misconstrued age-exclusive pressures. It is precisely through observing a microcosmic society surpass and even thrive in their unique way despite of the obstacles that are far more challenging than those magnified by Craig (Keir Gilchrist)- the stressed teen who voluntarily joins a mental institution- that we can clearly understand the magnitude of certain issues when scaled with other far more troublesome ones. Though this lesson may sound obvious, it is always a valuable reminder to appreciate the pros that we possess. Although set primarily in a mental hospital, "It's Kind of a Funny Story" never shuts itself down into an abstruse corner of darkness and utter miscomprehension. Quite on the contrary, the film successfully administers a dosage of comedy while maintaining the necessary mood to avoid anaesthetizing us from the corrosive thought of always being the bearer of the most tormenting conflicts. Keir Gilchrist demonstrates a very convincing performance that transcends pity towards the naivete shown by his character but also a strong feeling of endearment as he learns how to live from a wide array of peculiar individuals. The relationship that develops between Craig and Noelle (Emma Roberts) is one of the highlights of the film given the astonishing compatibility that was previously dubious. The moving, seriocomic acting witnessed by Zach Galifianakis is also one of the key components in this sweet-tasting antidote. Granted it may react more effectively with the teen audience but the moral it instills through this insightful journey is just as entertaining and valuable since it fortifies some of the antibodies responsible for combating life frustrations. All in all, "It's Kind of a Funny Story" is an endearingly entertaining placebo that will revive the pleasantly piquant taste of life.</fullReview>

The peer pressure, the parental pressure, the world pressure sometimes can be quite overwhelming, and that brings us to this marvelous story.Filled with odd characters that some way or another help the main character (Craig) re-evaluate is life finding a path that in the end fulfills is need of happiness.We have a fantastic Zack Galifianakis that simply surprised me, with a contained performance at times and exuberant at others.A very difficult lead character played by Keir Gilchrist misses the sadness that was required for someone who is depressed, i'm sure that everybody has some particular way to deal with the blues, but common, not even once we see him cry, (thinking of his family when he's about to kill himself, not even one tear??), but he goes OK.However the dream, or imagination sequences are very interesting. The supporting cast is very solid, giving exactly what is needed to the movie, subtle and humorous bits. Although we don't see the family characters as often as i would like.To me this movie is a lighter Life Interrupted sprinkled with every teen movie where the character at the end realizes that is life is not that bad if you have the strength to step up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When his depression deepens and casual suicidal thoughts turn to near-action, teen-aged Craig (Keir Gilcrest) decides to take the situation out of his own hands and checks himself into a mental institute. Hoping for a quick fix to his problems, he soon finds himself locked away for a week inside the adult wing of the hospital while the teen side is remodeled. While undergoing the therapy he hoped to avoid, Craig begins to make new friends, including Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a gentle soul who can't seem to adjust to the realities of the outside world, and Noelle (Emma Roberts), another teen whose suicidal thoughts have taken on more drastic measures than his own. Through these new bonds, Craig seems to bloom, to become a real person instead of the obligatory well behaved, overachieving adolescent he's always felt he had to be. Confronting the expectations that have been innocently placed upon him by his parents, his friends, and his own mind, Craig fights to discover his real identity.I cannot recommend "It's Kind of a Funny Story" highly enough. Writer, director, and cast all come together for a near seamless coming-of-age comedy that dwells in the quirky but never heavy handedly. It is a pleasant mix of "Garden State" and "500 Days of Summer" centered around a slightly younger crowd. Writer/director team Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck penned a brilliant script that puts each of the cast in a position to shine. The film moves well, never lingering excessively but also without passing anything over. Each issue is handled with grace, which prevents "Funny Story" from becoming bitter or sad. Craig's parents (Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan) are shown to be caring, loving people who share in the blame for their son's current situation only through accident, instead laying the blame at the feet of a society that expects too much of its children. Gilcrist, meanwhile, is exceedingly likable, an actor/character you immediately and genuinely gravitate toward. And while each of the supporting cast have their moments, Galifianakis shines the brightest, delivering an honest portrayal that gives the story an added layer of depth. Though perhaps a bit shallow at times, "Funny Story" is a huge success, a warm, heartfelt, and even fun movie that holds its own with the very best quirky comedies.My site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's Kind of a Funny Story" is a cute, feel-good, kind of quirky movie that certainly had some potential. Here is my full review of the movie.With an interesting family dynamic of the main character Craig (Keir Gilchrist) and his parents George (Jim Gaffigan) and Lynn (Lauren Graham), Craig feels he can't live up to the standards expecting by them and his school, and contemplates ending his lifeThe first few scenes are bad, and for a few moments I contemplated turning it off, but being the nice guy I am decided to give it some more time. It started picking up steam, quickly.It had kinda of a feel of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, only with a teenager. After being admitted he makes the best of the situation and tries to adapt to his new surroundings Liked the scene that shows what his lifestyle is "supposed" to entail once he gets out of school and lands the perfect job. The various video clips were interesting to watch.Learned a new term - "flirt punch".I actually enjoyed Zach Galifianakis's performance, he was actually quite likable with humor I could get behind - unlike his role in DUE DATE.Great first scene between Craig (Keir Gilchrist)and Noelle (Emma Roberts), as they had good chemistryCute music video number but too long.Notable quote : "A mental hospital isn't the best place to hook up"There were lots of cliché phrases ("get busy living') and message toward the end, and I couldn't help but roll my eyes at most of them. The romantic element of the movie was pretty weak. Cheesy line as a metaphor for the main character's life "It's not a mess, it's just undergoing renovations"There was a silly dance scene at the end. To wrap up my review of "It's Kind of a Funny Story" pretty weak overall, but it had some nice moments and a few good laughs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's indeed kind of funny how every description of this movie begins by saying that "a depressed teenager". First of all, he had no depression. He was just stressed out due to application deadlines and school related pressures. We all passed through this, and the movie kind of makes fun of this story when every one of his friends start saying they are depressed too. On a initially stupid, but ultimately good choice, the kid goes to a ER and is admitted in the psych ward where he actually meet mentally ill people. And it's also kind of funny how he manages to connect to this people in a week period more honestly than he was connecting with his old friends, and I think that's the point of the movie. OK, I have to admit that the love story pushed down our throat is unrealistic, but a feel-warm movie would not be complete without a happy ending romantic side story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie talks about depression ? something I have experienced a great deal in my life, so it was easier for me to relate to this issue. This turned out to be a sweet comforting movie.Depression is a topic that needs to be handled with discretion. I didn't have many expectations with this movie but it surprised me. The beginning was enough to suggest that it would not be disappointing.I love Zach Galifianakis's comedy style with his straight face and funny one-liners. It doesn't go hardcore on this terrible disease or pretend to suggest a solution for it. I'd say it is kind of a funny story. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a decent teenage oriented film for all. I have to admit I'm biased so if you're reading this better take that into account. I'm infatuated with Mr Galifianakis' charm. I can't be nonsubjective. I loved the film because the guy was lovable. Obviously the film had other qualities like a good dialogues, believable and engaging characters, bearable soundtrack (mind you there's hardly any of the recent stuff I would consider good music in a motion picture), feel-good entertainment for people under pressure, and of course another amazing performance from the rising star- Mr Galifianakis! I recommend the film for one good reason: it is like a therapy session/self-help book without the horsesh!t. Watch it, you won't regret it*.

		<shortDescription>It is a Funny Story that is also Moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High School's tough, so Craig tries a psych ward. Craig is a 16-year-old kid who seemingly has everything in the world going for him, good family and friends and good grades, but Craig is suicidal and doesn't understand why, so he checks himself into a psychiatric ward to try and cure himself without his high school friends knowing that he's been committed. As is per movies such as this, Craig discovers himself over his five day stay at the psych ward, making friends and helping change their lives whilst also discovering love, but unlike many other movies, it works so organically within this story that it is believable.The opening scene shows Craig getting up on the edge of a suspension bridge, about to jump, then he is stopped by his parents, who are only stopping Craig because they want to know what to do with the expensive bike in which they bought him, if he commits suicide. Of course, this was all a dream, but it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. It's Kind of a Funny Story laces the typically untouchable subjects of the human psyche that make people squirm and it makes you not just laugh about it, but understand it in the way in which we need to understand in order to cure our psychological problems.Craig learns self-empowerment, that he actually has something going for him in life, and that the unhappiness he was exhibiting was because he was not living the life he wanted. This is demonstrated in some spectacular sequences, including one where the entire cast of the movie sings Queen's "Under Pressure" as if in an '80s glam rock music video, or an animated sequence that careens through cartoony city streets showing the unlocking of Craig's artistic abilities. And actually, the movie takes itself seriously. These sequences all take place in Craig's mind, as do many other sequences in the movie. Craig's voice-overs coupled with his imagination transpire through dream sequences as to what he's thinking at the moment, what all his friends at school are thinking, or any other thing that may transpire in a teenage boy's mind. It is through these dream sequences and almost Ferris Bueller-like asides from Craig that make this movie the rich and emotional experience that it is.While It's Kind of a Funny Story is technically a comedy, any comedy that comes within the story only comes through the characters simply being the characters and not through Hollywood contrivances of plot and story. The acting is spot on, never really a sour note with Keir Gilchrist as Craig or Ema Roberts as his love, Noel. Possibly the most surprising performance is that of comedian Zach Galifinakis, who delivers a fine dramatic performance as psych ward patient and Craig's best friend, Bobby, and while Galifinakis is given plenty of moments to make you laugh, the through line of his character's desire to be with his daughter but not being able to overcome his depression is quite possibly the most moving aspect of this piece of cinema.It's Kind of a Funny Story is what I'd imagine the result would be if John Hughes decided to make a movie about a suicidal teen, supplement his usual High School aesthetic and applying it to a psychiatric ward, that in all actuality has way more intriguing options for interesting characters than an ordinary high school. While the movie is coated by the directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden (Half Nelson) with an overt indy, hipster aesthetic, much like last year's (500) Days of Summer it does not deter from the sheer enjoyment and impact that you get upon watching this heartwarming movie.I give It's Kind of a Funny Story a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, Unsatisfying Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read the novel "It's Kind of a Funny Story" by Ned Vizzini a while ago and knew it had been adapted into a movie not too long back, and decided to watch this a few months ago. As previously said, I'd read the novel and thought it was fairly good and the movie would be worth a shot at watching. I had actually heard some very positive things being said about it and there was really no reason not to try it. What can I say - it didn't live up to my expectations. During the movie, I had told a friend I was watching it, and their response was that it was 'pretty good'. By then I became very excited and in high hopes that it was going to be ever better than the book. But it truly wasn't; it was just bad. The movie was bad. I watched this at around 2 AM and it was so unbelievably boring that I nearly fell asleep in the middle of it. About three-quarters in, I was BEGGING time to go by faster so the movie would end already (I have a hard time not finishing a movie). The characters were very flat. They had little to no personality to them. I felt like the characters were just slapped together very sloppily. Some rather important things were left out that the novel had, and that definitely irked me when it was over. One thing that I did like, though, was that the actors' appearances stayed true to their descriptions in the novel. Craig looked exactly like I expected him to, as did Muqtada (sp?) and Aaron. Other than that, the movie was plain. Nothing stood out, nothing about it made you want to watch it again. The novel made me chuckle a couple of times, but the movie was just not funny at all. I think I actually forced a laugh a few times just to let it all out; I was expecting it to be funny, especially since Zach Galifianakis was in it. In all honesty, I think a majority of people who didn't know a thing about the movie saw it just because Zach was one of the actors (maybe that's how they caught a portion of their audience?) and left disappointed. I understand that the point of the movie is that you don't have to be a survivor of a traumatic experience or sexual abuse to have depression, and yes, that is a very good point. But the movie simply didn't give it justice. I'm glad I didn't have to pay money to watch this movie. I give it a 3 for trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average comedy-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An entertaining if not original comedy about a 16 yo who checks himself into a NY clinic rather than jump off a bridge. Turns out the teen wing is closed for renovations so he's put in with the adults - and a very cute girl his age. Needless to say, hi-jinks and a romantic hook-up occur. It's unfair to call this a teen "One Flew Over the CooCoo's Nest" as it has no such aspirations and there is no Nurse Ratched. It does have the usual cliché that his 5 days there results in considerable progress in his own problems as well as many of the other patients. Some excellent lines, a robust musical number, and a fine cast raise this above most of the dreck in the cineaplexes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well written light-hearted teen drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Kind of a Funny Story" is an aptly titled film. It's just a story, and it's kind of funny. It's more drama than comedy, and although it was slow, they really did drag me into the story. It stars Keir Gilchrist as Craig, a teenager who thinks about killing himself and seeks help. He finds help at a psychiatric ward.Is Zach Galifianakis a doctor or a patient? Like Robin Williams in the beginning of "Patch Adams", he blurs the line well. Here he delivers the same off-beat humour that we have come to expect from him. I was also quite impressed with Emma Roberts who plays a love interest for our teenage hero. They were all well written characters, and I found it very appropriate that they kept Roberts' reasons for being in the psych ward concealed.This is a teen drama about teen problems, told in a light-hearted kind of way, and it's ultimately a great film. At first I found the main character was just abusing the system in a selfish manner, but the film turned me around on that and I really connected to Craig in the end. Other reviewers compared it to a teen version of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and I did see the similarities. I also recommend it to fans of "Charlie Bartlett".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Starts on a Bridge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Attended a screening last evening and came away a bit surprised. The preview, thanks in part to Ida Maria's blaring "Oh My God", had me convinced this was going to be a typical slapstick teen comedy. Instead, co-writers and co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck deliver a black comedy-drama that has appeal to both teens and grown-ups.The story revolves around Craig, a 16 year old who is feeling depressed and suicidal given the pressures of a relentless father, looming college entrance exams and a screwed up social life. You are right if you are thinking this sounds like just about every 16 year old on the planet. The difference here is that Craig checks himself into a psych ward ... he ends up in the adult wing, as the teen wing is undergoing renovations. Craig is played by Keir Gilchrist, who I can best describe as a young Keanu Reeves clone, only too smart rather than too clueless.Since this is a comedy, you can imagine the characters who fill the ward. Craig bonds with Bobby, played by Zach Galifianakis, who seems happy to play the mentor role for Cool Craig, but just can't seem to find the strength to live his own life. Of course, we also get the emotionally damaged hot girl played exceptionally well by Emma Roberts (daughter of Eric, niece of Julia; Nancy Drew). The film accepts its own stereotypes for the other characters with labels such as "the schizophrenic".The message of the film seems to be that we all go through stages of doubt and uncertainty, and the best "cure" is to somehow remove the stress and discover our real talents and personality. You may end up creating art in the form of a brain map, or even a music video of Bowie/Queen's "Under Pressure" (an elaborate inset to the film).The filmmakers appeared to struggle with where their line was for the direction of the story. With previous films "Half-Nelson" and "Sugar", my guess is their vision was a much more complex and darker script rather than the final version which has more mass appeal. The Zach Galifianiakis character specifically, seemed poised to make a real statement. Instead we are left with his reserved, knowing smile as Craig presents him a gift and the hope of getting together for ping pong. Also, not much story is given to Emma Roberts and her penchant for cutting herself. She seems magically cured after a roof top encounter with Craig. Anyway, the comedy sections are more successful than the drama sections, provided you are able to find humor in the illness and weakness of others.This is certainly not at the level of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", but it is an entertaining film from a comedic perspective. It will probably be remembered as Zach Galifianiakis fist role where he flashed some real acting chops, and hopefully as Emma Roberts breakout role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picked out because it claimed similarity to "Perks of Being a Wallflower". Was thoroughly disappointed. Movie was not original, contained mediocre acting, the comedic inserts were weak and poorly executed, and was not a very believable and/or realistic depiction of a potential real life scenario to highlight a few of its many low points. I started with high expectations (mainly because I quite enjoyed "Perks of Being a Wallflower, and in general I do enjoy this style of movie), however, my interest quickly adopted a downward trend as I got to know... uhh... actually I was so apathetic I don't even remember his name. Regardless, I hoped for the best as I continued on, learning more about character "A" and his excuses for woes only to discover, despite a valiant effort on my part, the movie had very successfully disengaged my attention from the movie to literally anything except what was directly in front of my face. And I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what movies are supposed to not do? (maybe it's just me). This was by far the largest pitfall, the movie generated zero interest. I had no inclination to find out what happened next. I may be a hard marker but this movie depressed me, and I didn't like it. Oh, also the romance was garbage, just saying.</fullReview>

The acting is decent and it was filmed beautifully, but I really feel that they should have included the events in the first half of the book in the movie to better explain Craig's situation. I also feel like you did not get the opportunity to get to know some of the characters quite as well and how they impacted Craig. This had the potential to be a really great movie but because of everything that was left out and how drawn out what they did include ended up being, it was just boring.

		<fullReview>If this film, in a parallel universe, was found on a colour chart it would be in the pastel range. That simile may be convoluted, that's what my mind came to while languishing through the middle section of this film. The film leaves you with a sense of 'oh, is that it,' when the credits mercifully begin to roll. Now, as I have not read the book, I cannot adjudge that the dreary plot line is due to the films production or the book it was derived from. In a nutshell the film is a moody teenager experiencing his age related stress, of course magnified tenfold because he is an American teenager (and, by God, being a teenager in America is an arduous task, or so society will have us believe).On the plus side there were a few funny moments, I remember laughing but not what made me laugh, and the ending seemed as if it was meant to be heart warming but I must of been in a cold hearted mood as I merely scoffed. Scoffed at the previous 101 minutes I had apparently just frittered away with this pettiness.</fullReview>

This film is a mere classic story, with usual ending, though not sappy cause it's quite short. Keir Gilchrist plays quite well. Character of Zach Galifianakis is quite vague, his intentions unknown, at the end you don't know whether he'll live happy ever after or will be dead in a few hours. Zach pay quite well in drama film but I must admit his waddle is same as in funny films and thus it ruins a lot. All other actors play too little time so you cannot say anything about them. Music is quite at the level. Screenplay not bad. Story is quite true, it could happen to many people around. I ranked it 5 cause it could have been much much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Kind of a Punny Review- but I am kind of a crazy guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Kind of a Funny Story" is really kind of a sad &amp; funny story on a mentally ill teenager and his five day experience in a mental hospital. It is no "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and maybe it is not authentic on what really happens in a mental hospital; but you know what, I fell kind of crazy in like with it. "It's Kind of a Funny Story" stars Keir Gilchrist as the aforementioned teen Craig who checks in a New York mental hospital after going through some turbulent and stressful teenage times. He meets numerous odd characters in New York, and then I guess he meets a few more in the mental hospital. Fortunately the film gets "zacked" with a few thespian uppers, and I am referring to the talents of Zach Galifianakis who plays mental patient Bobby, who befriends Craig and becomes his mental mentor; sort of speak. Craig takes a relative liking to Bobby and puts him on his Craig's "new friend" List; they have that? Anyways, Craig also meets Noelle, a good-looking female teen patient who might just want to get a little crazy with Craig. There are familiar teenage themes in the movie that we have all seen way too many times before in "coming of age" flicks: parental pressure, academic stress, self-esteem issues, seeking of independence, etc, etc, etc; but somehow in a place where people go or are sent to get better, it takes an innovative approach. The filmmaking duo of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck did an admirable job with their direction and screenplay of the movie; nothing to go nuts over, but it did work. Gilchrist was a bit too robotic in his starring role as Craig. Emma Roberts shined as the pretty young woman (yes, an Aunt Julia shout-out) Noelle. And great supporting help was also contributed by Viola Davis playing the hospital psychiatrist. I also enjoyed the entire supporting acting ensemble of all the actors who played mental patients in the film. But the movie belongs to Zach! Galifianakis' performance as Bobby was insanely hilarious and spot-on! "It's Kind of a Funny Story" will not make you laugh or cry out loud, but it will make you chuckle and uplift your mood, and that my friends, is what I call a real-deal cinematic anti- depressant. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part of me really wants to hate a movie like this. Portrayal of mental illness like its a seasonal affliction is one of the reasons that a lot of people continue to be mis and under treated. The stigma of mental illness in our society is unfortunate and movies like this are not going to do a lot to change that perception. Then, I tell myself to just lighten up and enjoy what a pretty good story! I really enjoyed the movie on a lot of levels. The actors are all quite talented. Even though the characters are painted with rather broad strokes, they are still people that I want to like for the most part. Some of them, having grown up in a world much like theirs, I can even identify with. I wish very much that the lesson that is learned to "accept the things we cannot change" was one that more people could subscribe to. Craig is an everyman. A youth in America who is overwhelmed by choice rather than hardship. His typical over-privileged lifestyle is not a new story and the realizations that he comes to are not groundbreaking. Still, he makes you feel good about little things and about appreciating what you have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Is Kind Of A Funny Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck adapt Ned Vizzini's novel into a film that's kind of funny and kind of serious. You've got quirky characters admitting themselves in a psychiatric institute but this isn't like your average psychiatric hospital comedy. The use of subtle humour with intense drama is carried out very effectively. The humour works very well but at the same time it never invades the intensity of the dramatic scenes.'It's Kind of a Funny Story' pretty much reminds us that life itself is kind of funny and that once in a while, we ought to just take a break from the world and our daily hassles and just think of what really matters. It's a well crafted little film. Nothing is too over the top. The directors avoid the typical Hollywood clichés. The various characters in the hospital are amusing and create a quirky yet funny and somewhat sad (but not hopeless) atmosphere.While I found most of the characters to be well written, including the minor ones, the Nia character is a cliché and it's hard to understand why Craig is so head over heels crazy about her. We also hardly ever see the Aaron character who is supposed to be Craig's best friend act like a friend. Their friendship is poorly developed which is a shame because when Craig describes his favourite childhood memory to Dr. Minvera, Aaron is there. In addition the Craig's father is more or less the typical workaholic dad.The cast is excellent. Zach Galifianakis and Keir Gilchrist work very well together as odd friends. The role seems tailor-made for Galifianakis. Viola Davis is superb (and she has never looked better). Lauren Graham is wasted in a tiny role. Emma Roberts is very likable.Overall, 'It's Kind of A Funny Story' is funny, quirky, uplifting and can even be inspiring for some. It serves as a fine reminder that not everything in life ought to be taken seriously. To quote Dr. Minerva (who herself quotes the bible) "Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'It's Kind of a Funny Story' (2010) follows Graig Gilner (Keir Gilchrist), an out-of-sorts, depressed teenager who checks himself into the local hospital after having suicidal thoughts. After begging to be treated, Craig is admitted to the adult psych ward, known affectionately by patients and staff as 'North 3'. Despite initial uneasiness about sharing a ward with people suffering conditions such as schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, Craig befriends Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a middle age divorcée that has attempted suicide on numerous occasions and Noelle (Emma Roberts), a charismatic, self-harming teen. After my latest 'anonymous teen/indie' film, 'The Squid and the Whale', I had average expectations for this film. It did exceed those expectations, but only marginally. While starting out strong with an interesting, relatable premise, coupled with high quality narration from Gilchrist, the second half of the film lets it down, as cheesy, Hollywood sentiment seeps through the script. While Gilchrist is fine throughout and Galifianakis (showing a truly diverse range in comparison to his most high profile work in 'The Hangover') is especially wonderful in a number of scenes, Roberts however, is an actress that I have never loved, and her performance in this further cements my opinion that she is only in the business because of her infinitely superior aunt. Viola Davis however, is a shining light as the head psychiatrist and meetings between her and Gilchrist provide the film with its most genuine and moving moments. However she is not utilized enough, a real shame.The ending too, feels odd, for a lack of a better word, and the final line left me cringing and confirmed my overall opinion of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is directed by Ryan Fleck &amp; Anna Boden. Ryan Fleck who you may remember from the acclaimed Half Nelson [2006]. Anna Boden who was Ryan's Editor on Half Nelson. The story follows Craig, a 16 year old boy who takes zoloft to battle his depression and uncontrollable stress vomiting. Craig comes from a fairly middle class family, his dad works a lot, his sister is a genius but his mom is fairly normal. On a night of high depression Craig goes to a hospital and gets himself admitted into a mental ward so that he doesn't kill himself. Upon his stay at the mental ward Craig meets Bobby played by Zach Galifianakis,who plays a suicidal bipolar person who also has a daughter and wife. Criag also meets a pretty girl named Noelle who also has suicidal tendencies. This film suffers from a tonal problem. It's a mix between a serious film and a funny film but the thing is the jokes are about 50/50 hit or miss, and the character's problems from Bobby, Craig, and Noelle seem to be a bit trivialized. It's more of a film where characters are facing their insecurities of their self esteem more than their serious mental issues which lead them to endanger their lives. Zach's performance in this film is classy, he's always in character every scene and I think this film really shows his serious side. However, I think Keir Gilchrist who plays Craig really doesn't have the star power to hold the film together, he's not very magnetic and often delivers his lines flat. Craig's dad George I felt was also miscasted. Jim Gaffian who is a fairly well known stand up comedian can't really play the tough overbearing father. The film is also really rocky in the beginning, its hook is not really very inciting and the script sort of has a strange pace to it. Often in the movie they'll cut out to go to these "out of world" scenes where Craig's thoughts are actually portrayed visually in a sort of fairy tale or through narration, but the trick isn't very impressive and lacks consistency. Also the editing is fairly poor for being directed by an editor. I almost stopped watching the movie 45min in. However the last third of the film really starts to pick up and eventually you start to enjoy Craig as a character and enjoy how he sort of alleviate some of the other patients problems and because a stronger person. The last third of the film is worth it if you can last through the mediocre and sometimes poor direction for the first half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie because I saw it starred three celebrities who I was familiar with. First was Zach Galifianakis, who I've seen here and there. The second was Emma Roberts, who I've loved since watching her in 'Unfabulous' and the third was Keir Gilchrist who I've recently learned about, thanks to 'The United States of Tara'. I tried watching this movie a few weeks back, but got bored 1/3 of the way. I then decided to give it one more chance this afternoon.'It's Kind of a Funny Story' is really kind of a funny story. The film looks intimidating and looks like it has a lot of serious drama, seeing as the movie takes place in a hospital ward designated to help those with mental problems. That was kind of the reason why I was reluctant to watch this film. I didn't feel like being bombarded by severe problems. But I'm glad I decided to rewatch this movie again, because I found out that the drama in this movie isn't too grim. The humor, which was done subtly, made the movie a lot lighter.I liked all the characters and the relationships each one had with one another. We were introduced to a lot of different and colorful people, but not one of them were teased. In the shown psychiatric ward, everyone treated the other one with genuine respect and it felt like everyone was a family. I liked that about the film. It gave a really feel-good vibe.The start was good, the middle was mediocre, but the ending was great. I loved the way the movie ended. It really made me feel happy. This movie reminds us that we shouldn't take everything so seriously. We should learn to stop and breathe and count all our blessings. The lesson of the movie was surperb. That's why I liked this movie.Viewed on: April 6, 2011</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's a 16-year-old boy doing playing music and table tennis with adult psychiatric patients - on a school day? It's kind of a funny story... IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY, adapted from Ned Vizzini's 2006 novel of the same name, is the new comedy-drama from acclaimed writer/directors Ryan Fleck &amp; Anna Boden HALF NELSON, SUGAR. It's @5:00 A.M. on a Sunday in Brooklyn. Craig Gilner played by Keir Gilchrist of "United States of Tara" is bicycling up to the entrance of a mental health clinic; this bright 16-year-old is stressed out from the demands of being a teenager. Before his parents Lauren Graham of PARENTHOOD and Jim Gaffigan of AWAY WE GO and younger sister are even awake, Craig checks himself into Argenon Hospital and is admitted by a psychiatrist. But the youth ward is temporarily closed - so he finds himself stuck in the adult ward. One of the patients, Bobby Zach Galifianakis of THE HANGOVER, soon becomes both Craig's mentor and protégé. Craig is also quickly drawn to another 16-year-old displaced to the adult ward, the sensitive Noelle Emma Roberts of the upcoming SCREAM 4, who just might make him forget his longtime unrequited crush Nia Zoë Kravitz of the upcoming X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. With a minimum five days' stay imposed on him by the adult ward's staff psychiatrist Dr. Eden Minerva Academy Award nominee Viola Davis, Craig is sustained by friendships on both the inside and the outside as he learns more about life, love, and the pressures of growing up.well i wasn't very excited about this movie, i mean i liked the trailer but the only thing i was looking foreward seeing in this movie was Zach. this movie good very average reviews, not a good thing. i have no idea what kind of humor is this, its definitely not silly one, maybe dark or witty. i love this kind of humor. this is such a different kind of movie i don't know its a witty comedy or just a dramedy with lots of intelligent, genius dry dark witty humor. this movie generally was very funny, i had an awesome good time watching this movie. this movie is not a masterpiece or excellent but a good movie or should i say a good attempt. this movie has this young lead actor Keir Gilchrist who is good at his job but he needs a bit more improvement which is quite normal of course. he was good for the character he was playing and he played it well. Zach Galifianakis did an amazing job, i love this guy, he got terrific comic timings and he is so superb in these kind of roles, he plays this same kind of character in every movie. i never get bored or tired of it though. he is superb as always. did a good job. Emma Roberts wasn't much there and she was not good in the movie, i didn't liked her in these movie. Viola Davis was OK. acting wise not bad, good.direction of this movie was good, almost excellent. i liked there effort, screenplay was good, slight problem towards the end but still a very lovable and engaging screenplay. good cinematography and editing. i enjoyed watching this movie a lot, had a really good time. it is a a touching, honest, and whimsical dramedy. a very adorable movie. The dream sequences and flashbacks were each done in different creative styles that I enjoyed. The sketched animation, freeze frames, and music video were fun. I couldn't help but think of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. good writing and everything else. SEE IT&gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One the most touch dramadies (drama/comedies) I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the trailers and commercials totally undersold the quality of this film, I cannot believe this film hasn't won or even been nominated for any type of award. Keir Gilchrist hasn't been in many well known films but he was an excellent choice for the character of Craig. Galifianakis was a surprising choice for Bob, a mentally ill man who has tried to kill himself 6 times and has a daughter that he loves, but Zach did blow me away, the character was portrayed amazingly. Emma Roberts hasn't had a lot of good career choices, usually after you go on a Nickelodeon show thats kind of it for you, but she has something special which is why she has made it, totally threw herself into the character of a girl we all know, so maybe she will grow up to be a good actress like her aunt. The writing and directing of this film is amazing, wouldn't expect anything less from the Boden-Fleck dream team, they do outstanding work and have a good future ahead of them in Hollywood. As a whole this movie is just about people, about people we all have heard about or seen on the street, seen in other movies, just played by different people with a different story, I haven't read the book it was based on but it must be amazing. A great film for a person with a good taste in movies who can understand what the film is saying, I stress that anyone who has heard of this film should go out of their way to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Born-again Dylan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>". . . He not busy being born is busy dying." Bob DylanHaving The King of Hearts and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as the gold standards of mental ward films meant I would not be favorably disposed ahead of time to It's Kind of a Funny Story. After all, what can beat the eccentric, zany worlds of either of my golden films? Yet, I like Funny Story because it doesn't overplay the kooky card; it tries to gently expose the thinking of a depressed 16 year old, Craig (Keir Gilchrist), who has tried suicide but doesn't seem the type. In that way the film can touch the soul of almost any teen, for whom diffidence and uncertainty are constant companions. He just has some normal hang ups that he tries to deal with in an extreme way, landing him accidentally in a hospital's mental ward for a few days' observation and life lessons to be learned along the way.After checking himself into the adult psychiatric ward of a Brooklyn hospital for five days, Craig makes connections that are not profound or personality outrageous but sympathetic like Bobby (Zack Galifianakis), who dispenses wisdom from Dylan (see above) but offers a placid outlook that is both realistic and romantic. Craig's Egyptian roommate, Muqtada (Bernard White), never goes out of the room until Craig magnetically draws him out, not out of charisma but a sweetness that broadcasts the world might not be such a hostile place.As is required in almost all indie films, the adolescent must find another to fall in love with, make music with, and kiss with on a roof. Such a girl is Noelle (Emma Roberts), an independent, tough, but underwhelming hottie who really shouldn't be in the ward anyway (except for the multiple suicide attempts, if you can believe that). There's a musical number that barely fits the film, but, hey, it's an indie. It's a bit of a stretch to believe that Craig is rehabbed in a few days, but that's the happy indie world. As Craig leaves the unreal world of the ward, images of life appear with a voice-over that reaffirms the primacy of living. See Dylan at the beginning of this essay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...except it's not! This film is supposed to be an uplifting comedy, however I found it painfully predictable and a bit sad. Keir Gilchrist was great, playing Craig, a young mental patient who wants to kill himself. Gilchrist and the flashes of his thoughts, that we get to see, are the best part of this film and the only thing really worth seeing. Zach Galifianakis, who is one of my favorites, isn't at all funny, he's actually kind of pathetic in this film. Despite Gilchrist performance, the movie is actually quite stupid, I mean what kind of mental hospital lets the patients have access to the roof of the hospital? It looked good, has some really good actors in it, but nothing happens, the story is predictable as hell, and it's a "comedy" in which no one really says or does anything funny. I was hugely disappointed with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting idea-decently played-some moments which are awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie! But, I can only give it a 6, sorry, some things went terribly wrong here. 1)The main actor does not appear depressed and he does not behave like one of the guys who is really under pressure to perform &amp; succeed- trust me I was like that when I was younger and I know a lot of people who still are. That's why I actually enjoyed it like 8- I could really relate to this. I think if you put the sound off and watched the movie there would not be the slightest evidence of depression and you would probably not get at all that he is under pressure. It just gets told (by the main character himself!). 2) The moral theme: I hate when movies try to teach me something in a very direct way. Please be more subtle and translate it into emotions. 3) Please cut the Hollywood crap that everything turns good for everyone. You can't mix a movie about being under performance pressure with romance and happy end for everyone. It feels uncommitted- "well, if the audience ain't buying this- we can still sell it as a romance". Also please cut the parts where he helps and supports everyone- In my experience people who put themselves under pressure to perform at their best are self obsessed - why else would they care about their relative success so much? They may be nice people underneath but they do not notice the needs of others nearby that much. They spent so much energy on performing that they hardly have any left. They are really hungry for energy and they don't throw their food away. They are quite rational about that.In my opinion there was a part missing- that showed his situation prior to the hospital. Without that it appears unreal.Good part: It never got boring, the characters where interesting (though a bit plastic sometimes) and the story is something unlike I have ever seen. Great material but not well implemented. May be a good movie for 16 year olds, but those are probably not reading my reviews :)PS: I really loved the dating advice the main character got. I think it is what girls like to hear, because it basically says:"You are way better then me I'll do everything you want if you just go out with me and keep my dream of getting layed one day alive" and it is also what totally does get you not laid (unless she is in the mood, but you can wait for that a long long time) but gets you banished to the friendship zone incl. slave work forever!! Trust me, been there:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humane, funny story; wonderful Keir Gilchrist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a dry season for movies, and this is the best I've seen in a long time. It's very relatable: the idea of checking yourself into a mental hospital, thinking it might solve your problems, has crossed the minds of many. This mental hospital is, as you would expect, full of lovable souls who can't quite get control over their minds. But I loved this movie because it is absolutely, completely a New York movie of the moment: it's set in New York, and the Brooklyn Bridge is practically a character in the movie. And the suicidal angst suffered by the lead character, played by Keir Gilchrist (who I love in The United States of Tara), is the pressure placed on smart NYC public school kids to get into the top high schools, and go from there to the top colleges. And the kid just wants to get away from that.My favorite elements of the movie are the fantasy bits: a rock video featuring the inmates to "Under Pressure" by Queen; animated bits showing the complex artistic mind of the main character; even a little CGI making fun of the possibility that there might be a happy ending.Some really good, well-known actors are in the cast: Zach Galifianakis as a fellow patient; Viola Davis as the head psychiatrist; Aasif Mandvi as the psychiatrist who admits Keir Gilchrist to the facility.If you don't see it at a theater, watch the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Kind Of" a better than anticipated mix of John Hughes teen comedy/CUCKOO's NEST wannabe; Zach delivers the goods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY (2010) *** Keir Gilchrist, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Roberts, Viola Davis, Lauren Graham, Jim Gaffigan, Zoe Kravitz, Thomas Mann, Jeremy Davies, Bernard White, Dana DeVestern, Aasif Mandvi. Better than anticipated adaptation of Ned Vizzini's novel by filmmakers Anna Boden &amp; Ryan Fleck about a tensed up teen (Gilchrist) who decides to usurp his suicidal depression by checking into a mental health facility only to find that there's more to life than feeling bad when he gets some life lessons from the staff and patients (including a rare low-key turn by comic Galifianakis excelling in the guffaws and melodrama). Roberts is equally good as a 'cutter' that sheds some light into the darker undertones. While there are want to be echoes of "ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST" the film feels closer in vein to a John Hughes teen angst comedy. Highlight: a fantasy karaoke of "Under Pressure" hits the right comic/touching tones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a watered-down adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ned Vizzini's novel "It's Kind of a Funny Story" is an incredibly accurate portrayal of what it's like to live with hyper-anxiety. I should know. It's a condition I've had as long as I can remember. Unfortunately the movie adaptation is a little lacking.Co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck seem to want to do a film that does for mental hospitals what Wes Anderson's "Rushmore" did for prep schools. Like "Rushmore", "Funny Story" gives us quirky characters, a wink-nod style of editing, and an eclectic soundtrack. However, Boden and Fleck lack Anderson's wry sense of humor and his willingness to make his characters unlikable.In the Jason Schwartzman role is Keir Gilchrist as Craig, an over-stressed 15-year-old who checks himself into a hospital for suicidal depression. Unfortunately, the teen psychiatric wing is under construction and he is put into the adult section. In the Bill Murray role is Zach Galifianakis as Bobby, who becomes Craig's best friend and mentor--largely because they both see themselves at a different age in each other.The acting is superb all around. Especially Galifianakis. Like Bill Murray in "Rushmore", he shows the dark underside of his comic persona. This is not to say the viewer won't recognize his shtick from other films. His funniest moment (I thought) was lip-syncing the David Bowie part to Queen's "Under Pressure".Where the movie falls short is that--probably to keep the film PG-13 so teens could see it--all the references to pot-smoking from the book are gone and the sex is very toned-down. Also, there is the issue of racial political correctness in the casting: In the book, Craig's psychiatrist Dr. Minerva is a Greek immigrant and his unrequited crush Nia is half-Asian-half-Jewish. In the film they're both African-American, played by Viola Davis and Zoe Kravitz respectively. And I was disappointed that Asif Mandvi was limited to one scene as Dr. Mahmoud. In the book, he's the most important non-white character, but in the film, most of his lines are given to Jeremy Davis as Smitty the volunteer. (If there is any justice in the world, Asif will be the next "Daily Show" star to blow up.)But my biggest complaint is that they didn't include what I thought were the book's biggest concepts: "tentacles" (responsibilities that breed even more responsibilities that often conflict with each other), "anchors" (things that can be enjoyed just for themselves without complication), and "the shift" (the hoped-for moment when the anxiety goes away and one can live a normal life). Without these concepts, it's impossible to explain to an outsider how Craig feels."It's Kind of a Funny Story" is a wonderful book that answers the question that I heard too many adults asking when I was in my teens and 20's: "Why would anyone want to kill themselves when they're too young to have any real problems?" The film is a well-acted piece that unfortunately only scratches the surface of what the book has to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as a movie about screwed up people and how they may interact with each other in an institution, it is typical. However the depiction of completely trusting doctors and placing the utmost benefit and value in drugs to resolve problems it's nothing short of a very long pharmaceutical commercial. If while watching this movie you are unaware of the subtle utterances that doctors equal God then be prepared to be placed in a trance of utter doctor trusting. You may find yourself making an appointment to just make sure your are feeling okay. You may question how you are feeling at that moment and have your self committed for a psychiatric evaluation, just to be sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's kind of a BAD story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought, OK a movie that is finally truthful in it's title. With a title like "its kind of a funny story" all it has to be is kind of funny to deliver. It never delivered. I didn't see any real attempt at funny and I NEVER laughed once.I like movies that are either funny, or revealing of deep concept and thought provoking in making people consider and think about deep revelations and concepts of the pursuits of humankind and life... This movie has none of that. This movie is more along the same old line of, "I'm depressed because I want to stick my genitals inside that person but they wont let me because they want to do that same thing to someone else." It is the same story about a shallow sheep kid who "loves" this girl because she is hot but can't have her because she don't think he is hot. Nothing to do with revealing the concept of deep relationships and love between these two people who are consumed with deep thought provoking interest with each others' character.All the terrible tragedies in the world and all the things a person can engage in to make their lives more useful and complicated which can result in have a legitimate feeling of wanting to kill themselves and the best we can keep getting for a script about someone wanting to kill themselves is writing about someone who wants to kill themselves because they think someone is so sexy? So, this kid wants to kill himself because he thinks a girl is hot and she is not his girlfriend (I know, here we go)... so he goes to a hospital to get pills (that he already has at home but stopped taking) and then ends up getting more than he bargained for by getting committed by the doctor because the kid insisted to the doctor that he be committed. Then he sees another girl through a window while in the hospital and a viewer can only think, 'here we go again, he thinks she is hot so if he don't get her as a gf (not because he loves who she is as a person but because he thinks she is hot looking sitting in a window) are we going to have to suffer another 'kind of funny story" that is not at all funny or interesting? The characters in the hospital are not funny and are not well developed or acted. The main kid is pretty uninteresting. This seems to be a movie that includes components that appear copied from the 80s movie Dream Team (like the mental hospital theme, ping pong table scene, etc) but the characters are nowhere near as developed or funny as they were in Dream Team. And even though I like to watch Dream Team, it wasn't even that great of a movie as far as script and directing. So goes to show how this new movie came off with me.The writing is predictable, regurgitated (same old story) and weak. For example, the way the start of the movie is written to get the kid into the hospital is weak and makes no sense. Supposedly the kid goes to the hospital just to get some medication to take to make himself feel better and when the doctor refuses, the kid wants to get checked in for a couple of hours to get that medication and gets completely thrown off guard when he ends up getting committed for 5 days and realizes he made a huge mistake.But it is clearly stated that the character already had pills but stopped taking them a while ago because he though he was better. So then why not just go take it now that he wants some? Why wouldn't he go home to get his pills if he wanted something to take? Why go to the hospital and risk being committed against his will just to get some pills when he already had some? Weak writing or just a pathetic character who is NOT even "kind of funny" to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Better Than The Book, but Still Great In Many Ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see "It's Kind of a Funny Story" for two reasons: first, because Zach Galifianakis is in it, and he is usually hilarious, and second, because I read the book by Ned Vizzini and loved it. I always believe it's best to read a book before seeing the movie upon which it is based. However, if the book is really good, the movie has the potential to be very disappointing (case in point: "The Bonfire of the Vanities" (1990)). The movie differs from the book in a lot of ways, and I still think the book is better. However, it's still a solid movie, and has many strengths to it.Writing and directing duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck ("Half Nelson" (2006)) were the team behind this comedy-drama. They wrote the script without Vizzini, and probably shaped the story so that Galifianakis' character, Bobby, would have a stronger supporting role. Although there was a "Bobby" in the original story, he was not as significant in the book as he is here.The basic story, however, remains mainly the same. Craig (Keir Gilchrist of TV's "United States of Tara" (2009)), is a depressed 16-year-old New Yorker who checks himself into a hospital in fear that he might throw himself off the Brooklyn Bridge. The suicide hotline he called suggests he do this, and he initially assumes it will be just one doctor's appointment to refill his prescription of Zoloft that he stopped taking a month earlier. Instead, he is checked into a hospital ward of suicidal patients like himself, where his psychiatrist, Dr. Eden Minerva (Academy Award nominee Viola Davis, "Doubt" (2008)) recommends he stay a minimum of five days.This movie is more like a John Hughes film than "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" (1975), a film it will inevitably be compared to. Whereas the Milos Foreman classic (and the Ken Kesey novel) is more allegorical to anti-establishment practices, "It's Kind of a Funny Story" emphasizes people who could not deal with the pressures of the real world, or at least temporarily.The film touches upon the pressures that Craig feels, which could be contributors to his depression. He goes to an elite public school, he has a friend Aaron (Thomas Mann) who succeeds without working as hard as Craig does, Aaron is dating Craig's crush Nia (Zoe Kravitz), and Craig is in constant fear of future failure. A lot of young actors could have been over-the-top in playing a kid who cannot take these pressures. However, Gilchrist has a quiet reservation to him that makes him believable. Vizzini's first person narration in the novel helped make Craig's character more sympathetic, but Gilchrist did well with what he was given, and even had some funny deadpan moments.Of course, Galifianakis is best known for his deadpan humor, and became an A-lister for it thanks to "The Hangover" (2009) and his increasingly popular stand-up comedy acts. While he has his funny moments here, such as pretending to be a girl Craig likes to build up Craig's confidence around women, there are also some moments where his character is truly heartbreaking. One part that really got to me was when he returns from a job interview with his buttoned-up shirt around his head like a turban. When you think it's going to be a funny moment, he then picks up a sofa cushion and screams into it, thereby telling you exactly how the interview went.Galifianakis isn't the only actor in this film who delivers a surprisingly strong performance. Viola Davis took a role that could have been forgettable and added heart to it. Emma Roberts is best known for her roles in kids movies ("Nancy Drew" (2007), "Hotel for Dogs" (2009)) and gives real depth to Noelle, another suicidal patient on the ward who Craig develops a crush on. Gilchrist and Roberts have great chemistry together in their scenes too."It's Kind of a Funny Story" is just that: It is very funny in some parts, and a bit sad in others. It is never depressing to the point where you would want to check yourself into a psychiatric ward after seeing it, nor does it seem to glamorize the mental health process. While the movie does not have the emotional depth that Vizzini's first person narrative does, it is still worth checking out. However, regardless of whether you read the book first before seeing the movie or not, I strongly recommend reading the book. Ned Vizzini is a great writer, and we may see his previous novel, "Be More Chill" adapted into a movie soon also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew very very little about the movie when I decided to watch this film, but when I saw that Zach Galifianakis was in it I needed no convincing as generally he plays a very funny character. I was wrong.Although I didn't hate the movie, my expectations were far too high. The fact that I had just previously watched the movie 'Due Date' where Galifianakis truly was at his side splitting best probably did not help at all. I thought this had potential for sure, they were working with patients in a mental ward so they needed a funny character to take on a humorous role.I also thought they needed to have a something 'big' happen. Maybe one of the patients could harm/kill themselves which would give our main character 'Cool Craig' a better perspective and understanding on how small his problems were in comparison to those who really were suffering from major depression.Anyway overall, I thought the movie was alright so a solid 4 I think is adequate.Reviewed through the eyes of Straight talking Tony NZ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY': Four Stars (Out of Five) Based on the popular novel of the same name by Ned Vizzini (released in 2006) comes this teen psychiatric ward comedy / drama that sort of plays like a light youth version of 'ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST'. The film is co-directed and co-written by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the team that also brought us 'HALF NELSON' and 'SUGAR'. It stars Keir Gilchrist (of TV's 'UNITED STATES OF TARA' fame), Zach Galifianakis, Emma Roberts (daughter of Eric Roberts and niece of Julia Roberts) and Zoe Kravitz (daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet). It's quite a bit different than Boden and Fleck's other films but in a good way, some critics have found it a little disappointing coming from the talented two but in my personal opinion it's their best work yet.The story deals with a sixteen year old (Gilchrist) coping with depression and stress who recently stopped taking his prescription of Zoloft and is having recurring fantasies of jumping from the Brooklyn Bridge. At the advice of the suicide hot-line he reports to an adult psychiatric ward looking for a quick fix to his problems. He's then committed for a minimum of five days. There he befriends an older inmate named Bobby (Galifianakis) and a girl his own age by the name of Noelle (Roberts) who are both suicidal as well. He develops an odd friendly relationship with Bobby and of course develops romantic feelings for Noelle while he struggles to get over a big crush on his best friend's girlfriend Nia (Kravitz) who recently admitted problems with depression to him herself.The film is extremely humorous, thanks in large part to Galifianakis, but also emotional and moving as well; it's ultimately a feel good inspirational tale. Galifianakis is funny but also shows signs of true dramatic talent, Roberts is surprisingly good and likable as the hero's love interest and Gilchrist is well cast in the lead. The supporting cast is all adequate as well (with nice turns from Jeremy Davies, Viola Davis, Jim Gaffigan and Lauren Graham) and Boden and Fleck's script and direction is pretty much right on. The film is also highlighted by a very fitting score provided by Canadian indie rockers Broken Social Scene. The film pretty much delivered just what I expected and wanted from it, it's a nice little indie comedy drama that's both funny and touching. An enlightening movie with an uplifting message for anyone of any age.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost thought at the beginning that it would be an accurate portrayal of a psychiatric ward; I liked the fact that it isn't a disparaging comment on the uselessness of the profession (it actually does help a lot of people), and the unit psychiatrist is shown as an empathic creature. The business-like approach Craig gets when he says he's suicidal seems pretty spot-on, at least until patients are triaged through. Now, the unrealistic components may find some degree of justification in trying to make the movie's premise take off, such as finding the door to the stairwell unlocked (???), having a visitor alone in the patient's room (????), the absolute lack of division between patient age and psychopathology on the unit (let the language of absence speak loudly.. they're just renovating their adolescent unit, which apparently would only have 2 patients on it), and the fact that having a relationship with a borderline self-mutilator is a hellish ride (not all that cuts is borderline, point taken, but she fits the mold, even if her character is insanely underdeveloped). If one turns an amaurotic eye to these items, the film still falls flat; it can call itself an independent film until there are no more dead horses left to beat, but honestly I saw no raw emotion or frailty in the film, nothing rang true with regards to any real human experience? life is tragic, adolescent angst multiplies this reality 1000-fold. There is no proverbial bow waiting to be bestowed onto anybody's life, but they would have us believe in the magic of the 5-day curative stay? The bubble-gummy teenage happy message is "you have such a wonderful suburban hipster life ahead of you? it's hip to be depressed man, we've all been there". Way to market Zoloft as "the drug" to make one feel better (that phallic comment probably wouldn't have been there if he was still on it), product placement much? Anyway, silly film, reasonably OK premise but not at all convincing of anything except that I should've learned my lesson after watching the trainwreck that was Juno that "independent" is another word for "Hollywood suck-up script with less money".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly Entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from Ned Vizzini's 2006 novel of the same name, 'It's Kind Of A Funny Story', directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, is an average film, that entertains mildly, and rather leaves more than half of the questions it raises unanswered.'It's Kind Of A Funny' is about a 16-year-old depressed kid, who goes to a psychiatric hospital, to calm himself. Over-there he meets a bunch of people, who change his point of view towards life and happiness.To give it's due, the film does entertain at times. The sequences between the protagonist Keir Gilchrist and supporting actor Zach Galifianakis, are good. But the entertainment value is missing most of the time. Also, the culmination comes across as half-baked. The adapted screenplay doesn't really offer the accurate answers, to the solid questions it raises. Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's direction doesn't impress much, as their writing isn't very convincing.Performance-Wise: Zach Galifianakis is superb, as expected. He delivers in every sequence. Keir Gilchrist does well. Emma Roberts doesn't get much scope, yet she makes her presence felt. Zoë Kravitz is strictly okay. Viola Davis is effective, while Aasif Mandvi continues to act.On the whole, It's an Underwhleming Experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been a long time since I walked out on a movie. Time to reset that counter. Having read the other reviews, I wonder if we saw the same movie. They lip sync "under pressure". What self-respecting movie has lip syncing? Acting was poor, characters unbelievable and the script had nothing to say. I was not alone in walking out. It took no convincing the group that our time would be better spent watching...jackass. Yes this was that bad. The ending must have been something ground breaking to generate good reviews. Maybe the secret to life? It seemed to imply Truth was only a moment, perspective, or enlighten conversation away. The crazy man that sees truth is an overworked and boring concept. Maybe this film was made for kids just experiencing this idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bored me, my girlfriend, my dog. It was so on the level with absolute vacuum of a smart shot, showing less than 1 photon of intelligence, from start to end, that you easily use this movie as evidence in a trial against whoever produced it, and make a lot of money for the inflicted brain damage.Stay away from it, don't even get curious.Zach Galifianakis is nothing in this movie (secondary role anyway). It's on the opposite side of the universe, compared to his role in Hangover. Zach, stick to a *funny* comedy, and don't fall for movies which state they are comedy and drama at the same time. There's no such thing. Nothing mixes well with drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marketed as a comedy, but not funny at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think they even tried. More effort was put into the advertising of this movie than actually went into the production of the movie itself. Nothing of interest ever happens, the main characters are flat and uninteresting themselves. I kept waiting for the fat guy from The Hangover to say or do something funny, but it never happened. I didn't hear a single person in the theater laugh one single time, but I did notice several people leave and not come back in. How this thing currently has a 7 star rating on IMDb is unfathomable. This movie isn't worth a $1 Redbox rental, let alone the $6 matinée ticket I paid. If this was an independent low budget art film I would give it a higher rating, but this is inexcusable trash for a mainstream movie. Do yourself a favor and wait the two weeks for this waste of time to come out on free TV, because this isn't even worth watching for free, and you'll likely change the channel to Mexican midget wrestling after the first ten minutes of this unfunny, undramatic movie that fails to entertain on any level whatsoever.</fullReview>
