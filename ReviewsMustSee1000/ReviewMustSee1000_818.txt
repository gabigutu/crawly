		<fullReview>OK, for those of you who aren't sure whether "Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid" is a good, or even great movie, just do the following:Scroll up to "memorable quotes". Go on, do it and then read what follows. I'll be right here when you get back.Finished? Did you read those lines? THAT, my friends, that and the fact they are spoken by some great actors is what makes this film so wonderful. They are perfectly balanced between being funny, endearing and also revealing about the characters. There's genuine emotion and warmth in a lot of that.Conrad Hall, George Roy Hill, Burt Bacharach et al all contributed marvelously but I love the cast; such quality and for some of them, in small, but memorable roles: George Furth, Ted Cassidy, Kenneth Mars, Strother Martin, Katherine Ross and the stars at the top; Newman and Redford who did perfect justice to Goldman's script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman and Redford at Their Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest westerns ever made, although much of the movie takes place in South America. It is a great look at two likeable outlaws, full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are two bank robbers, chased by the law. The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do. The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them. There is really no connection all the way through, for the most part.The story isn't about the plot, however. It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It is a close look at two criminals, the talented Sundance Kid, and Butch Cassidy, the one who does all the thinking. The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film. Watching the two interact, with a superb script full of great dialogue, is what makes this movie so exciting.See this movie if you are a fan of westerns, or just a fan of good movies. It is exciting, superbly made (with lots of interesting silent scenes to music and montages of photographs), but it also has a lot of depth.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent and bloody, but romanticized by the insouciant charm of Newman and Redford...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Roy Hill's film has its excitements and it claims the fashionable climactic bloodbath, but mostly it's played for fun? It's a highly individual Western; a triumph of style, in fact? The style is dominant, intelligent, flowing with charm; the playful teasing, and Newman supplied with a hat on a bike, and the contemporary lyrical Bacharach pop tune? It's a style that flowers in the Newman-Redford relationship, which is one of the most affecting in movies?All this gives it the feel and look of fanciful myth carried to a point unusually removed from reality... Backgrounds are sketched rather than etched? You are never really moving toward the west in time and place... With belief suspended, feelings are only light1y involved?But it's derring-do at its most flamboyant and given a tangy taste by its essentially modern sense of humor... When Butch and Sundance ride back from relaxation to their Hole-in-the-Wall lair and find they have a mutiny on their hands?Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy) wants to take over?Butch doesn't quell it with bullets but with a boot up Logan's backside? It's that kind of picture?Similarly, when too much dynamite scatters the haul from a rail hold-up, this is a moment for wry, amusing comment? And when the posse pursues the pair this is one posse that 'heroes' can't easily shake off? It's always there, cleverly made more irksome by long-shot, so that finally only a 'death defying leap' as the circuses say, can separate hunted from hunters?. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is undoubtedly a captivating tour de force? Its flavor is preserved from cloying by just the right edge of wistfulness provided by Katharine Ross as the schoolteacher girl-friend who goes along and who suggests the transience of it all?Newman and Redford good-natured fellowship is felt from the opening to the final scene? Sundance seems closer to the traditional Western character... He is strong, silent, willing to face confrontations and shoot it out? Butch is an atypical outlaw, enormously charming and courteous, has never killed anyone, and tries to avoid showdowns? Throughout the film, Newman is engagingly spontaneous in his expressions, gestures and timing of dialog?While Sundance is practical, Butch is a hopelessly ridiculous optimist and romantic dreamer? While they flee the posse, he continually expresses optimism, but beneath is a child-like need for reassurance? Small indications of his self-awareness emerge at other times, undercutting his casual exterior? For instance, despite the naturalness of the ménage-?-trois, Butch is really the outsider, and he knows it? In the lovely still-photo montage of their New York holiday, Butch watches with wistful longing as they dance, but then smiles?aware of his isolation but content in their happiness? "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture... It won four (Cinematography, Score, Song, and Original Screenplay).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Winner From the "Class of 1969"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a great film just due to the pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. These two work so well together that the film would have been impressive no matter what. However, with a smart story and great direction by George Roy Hill, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" was the smash-hit of 1969 as it achieved box office dominance and won more Oscars (four) than any other film that year. It did not win the Best Picture or Best Director Oscars as "Midnight Cowboy" and its director John Schlesinger took home those honors, but it has stood the test of time and is right up there with the other imperative films of that important year ("Midnight Cowboy", "Easy Rider", and "The Wild Bunch"). The two titled characters are two shrewd outlaws who love to rob trains and banks. However, the law has about had it with the outlaws and the two decide that Bolivia is the place they need to be. Also along for the ride is school-teacher Katharine Ross who obviously has feelings for both men. They both want to go straight in Bolivia, but temptation is too big for them and in the end tragedy will occur for the titled characters. Of course this film is based on real people, but so little is known about them that the film-makers were able to take many liberties with the tale. The film-makers went for comedy and action, but it is the drama and the likable characters that make "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" one of the best films produced in the 1960s. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Script For a Near-Perfect Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is my favorite film of all time, and the biggest reason for that is because of its script by William Goldman. It's very rare in film that a script has perfect lines in it from beginning to end, but this film is an example of what can be achieved by Hollywood screenwriters. It was William Goldman's script of this movie that sparked my passion for the American cinema. Though most Westerns of the cinema past have serious and gritty tones to them, this film has just the right mix of comedy, wit, and adventure. The greatest team in Hollywood history, arguably, is the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The presence by these two Hollywood legends has help cement this film as one of the greatest movies ever made - according to organizations like the American Film Institute. The direction by George Roy Hill is first rate, and much credit also has to be given to cinematographer Conrad Hall, who did a great job giving this film the superior look of the Old West.  Katherine Ross adds to this film in the role as the beautiful Etta Place, as does the score, which makes us feel good about going to the movies. This was the film that, for the first time, got audiences to root for "the bad guys". This film should be shown in every film school to show film students how to make a theatrical film. I will always love this movie, and indeed, this movie is something special. It is also special to me because the REAL Sundance Kid was born in my hometown of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the 60s &amp; 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is pretty much the ultimate action western movie I can think of. This movie has everything you could want, and it appeals to almost any type of viewer. Paul Newman, one of if not the best actor of our time is the lead along with Robert Redford, the two go together perfectly, I dare say this is one of the best combinations in Hollywood history.Anyways the story takes place in the midwest, Newman and Redord run "The Hole in the Wall Gang" named after their hideout. They rob trains and take big scores, later the Pacific railroad gets together the best tracker and lawmen in the entire Western United States to track and kill Butch and Sundance. They must manage to evade their elite counterparts, the movie is 100 percent entertainment, especially during the chases. The movie is based on true events and is spectacular.This movie won Best Score, Best Song (Raindrops) which was very good untraditional music in a western, it fit good in this movie, Best Cinematography, shot by Conrad L. Hall who also did Road To Perdition, arguably the best cinematography done to this very day, and Adapated Screenplay, all for the right reasons. George Roy Hill, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford all went on to create "The Sting" in 1973, which is possibly one of the best movies ever made. I praise this movie, 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The All-Time Great Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best and most-liked films of the 1960s, this is still a fun movie to watch today. When I saw this on DVD on a nice flat-screen set, I was amazed how good this looked. I had seen it several times before on VHS and hadn't realized how good this was photographed. I just discovered Conrad Hall was the cinematographer, which explains it. Few, if any, were better than him.One remembers this western for several things: the two leads looking over their shoulders incredulous that their pursers seem to be always there; Paul Newman riding a bicycle to the tune of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head," the beautiful Katharine Ross, the chemistry of Newman and Robert Redford as a two-man team, on and on. Those three lead actors, with the repartee between them, and the likability of each, make them fun to watch as they dominate this picture. It's just solid entertainment and another example of good film-making that doesn't need a lot of R-rated material to make it successful. Photography-wise, the western scenery was great, there were some wonderful closeup shots and I really liked the tinted old-time footage inserted in here. So, when you combine all the elements, it's no surprise this film won so many awards and endures so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of my favorite westerns. It has everything you could possibly want for every movie fan. They're so many great aspect and I will attempt to display some of them.The acting, what can I say about it. It was a perfect fit for Redford and Newman who are both friends in the movie and real life. They deliver exhilarating, funny and electrifying performance. It is so great I can't even put it into words. These two actors were robbed of an at least an Oscar nomination. It has to be the biggest Oscar snub ever. Watching this movie my only wish is that Redford and Newman would have done more movies together.The writing was great and creative. I have never witnessed a movie that was so serious and yet so funny. The writing totally propelled this movie forward. The fact that Butch and Sundance went to Bolivia trying to outrun the law was hilarious. This has got to be some of the best writing ever.The directing by George Roy Hill was as well amazing displaying the chase scenes and just sitting back and letting the writing and directing take over. But most of all he let Robert Redford and Paul Newman do their thing. You could see that they were both feeding off each other and George Roy Hill never seemed to interrupt their chemistry. I would advise anyone and everyone to watch this. They are just so many laughs, many fun action scenes and of course Paul Newman and Robert Redford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie all around. It's a great Western, it's a great comedy, it's a great action, and it's a great drama. George Roy Hill did an excellent job with this movie. Paul Newman is one of my favorite actors, and who doesn't like Robert Redford? I just recently saw this movie and I was very pleased when it was over. They also managed to make this an accurate depiction, because, like the tagline states, for the most part, it's true.Paul Newman and Robert Redford do outstanding jobs as Butch and Sundance. They have make a great team, and it's fun to watch them rob trains and banks, and narrowly escape from the Pinkerton Posse. This movie also has great performances. The two actors make you like Butch and Sundance, and you want them to escape.I also thought it was interesting when I learned that the real Hole In The Wall Gang (besides Butch and Sundance)would soon become the Wild Bunch, or so I'm told. I find this movie a total enjoyment and can be enjoyed by anyone. I think that even the most shrill person can find things they like about this movie, so check it out, because it is and always will be a classic! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: A post modern Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Roy Hill´s funny Western is still modern and hasn't aged bad at all. Paul Newman is charming and charismatic, and Robert Redford is energetic. I don't know why some Western-fans doesn't like it because it is filled with powerful and spectacular gunfights, humor, friendship and beautiful pictures - which is the reasons why you watch Westerns, isn't it? I am fully aware of the fact that 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' was an unusual Western when it came. After this there were made other attempts or experiments like this but I don't think that they succeeded. 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' has also the rare ability to even smell, taste or feel classic when you watch it ... Robert Redford was never better than here.Rating: 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word.....Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember seeing this movie, at the Colony Theater in Portsmouth Virginia, when it was first released. Since then, I've seen it at least 30 times, most recently last night. In my humble opinion, Paul Newman &amp; Robert Redford made an excellent movie twosome 30 years ago [and expanded on it a few years later, in The Sting]. In reading the reviews submitted about this movie it makes me happy to see that most of the people agree with my opinion. How could you not like these characters, along with Etta, "those guys" following them and eventually Strother [who will always be remembered for his "what we have here is a failure to communicate" in Cool Hand Luke] Martin? Not to mention the scenes where Etta enters the picture, when Butch has to fight Logan, when they have to jump in the water and, of course, the ending sequence of events. I won't say "they don't make them like they used to", but this one is a keeper. And if you agree with my evaluation, and have a DVD player, watch the DVD that has interviews, etc., to give you an even better picture of this excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Boys go West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this film again on DVD -- more than 30 years after the first time I saw it -- I'm struck by two things. First, it holds up well for a movie so redolent of a particular time (the 1960s, of course, not the 1890s). Second, whether the filmmakers fully intended it this way or not, it's really a very good film about a topic Westerns don't tackle often: arrested adolescence.Most great Westerns -- ``My Darling Clementine,'' ``Rio Bravo,'' ``The Wild Bunch,'' ``Unforgiven'' -- are about adults. ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' is about two guys who, physically, are pushing 40, but whose mental age is stuck somewhere around 16. They may be charming, but their whole lives revolve around their narcissistic pal-ship. For them, being outlaws doesn't seem to be about expressing anti-social impulses or even getting money they haven't earned, but merely about hanging out with each other. Their talk with each other is mainly brittle ritualized patter and stock jokes, mixed with Butch's pipe dreams. They can't talk about anything serious even at the end, when they must realize -- at some level -- that they're about to die. Screenwriter William Goldman emphasizes the oddly callow, adolescent tone of their relationship by repeatedly having them express surprise when they stumble over some bit of biography -- their real names, or the fact that Sundance is from New Jersey -- that you'd think real friends would have known about decades ago.The movie's whole point is that Butch and Sundance can't develop any type of dramatic arc. Harshly changing times demand they change with the times or die -- and they can't change and ultimately choose, by default, to die. They do get a huge lucky break when they get away from the Superposse _ but all they can think to do with it is change not what they're doing, but merely where they're doing it. They can't even change enough to keep Etta Place with them, even though both Butch and Sundance really do love her, in their way. (Etta, in contrast to Butch and Sundance, is harshly realistic about her life and her limits -- she knows she isn't strong enough to die with them or to see them die.) Butch and Sundance, as far as we can see, don't care about much outside themselves and Etta. This is why the movie's ending -- that famous freeze frame -- is so perfect. Butch and Sundance are secure, together, in their niche in history. They don't have to worry about changing times or the baffling world outside themselves any longer. They've won out over time and change -- the only way anybody ever can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overrated western does not hold up well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out, like, almost 40 years ago. Was it really that long ago? I guess it was. Anyway, I remember it as being a good movie and I haven't seen it since. So now I have kids who are teenagers and so I think, hey, maybe they'd like to see a good western, funny and entertaining, so I put it in my Netflix queue, and it finally came up last week and we watched it last weekend.What a disappointment.For the life of me, I cannot understand why I ever liked this movie or how it got the reputation it has. It is simply a bad movie that does not hold up well. What makes it bad? The one attribute I would give this movie is boring. Really boring. The scenes just dragged on and on and it got so that I just wanted it to end. Like the bicycle/Raindrops-keep-fallin'-on-my-head scene. What was Hill thinking? If he wanted to establish a relationship between Newman and Ross, the length of that scene could have been cut by about two thirds. Likewise later on, when the camera was panning across sepia photographs of the three main characters to illustrate them making their way down to Bolivia. Again, way too long. We already got the point, but still the sequence dragged on interminably. I actually hit the FF button on my DVD remote at one point and even at 2X, I was surprised how long it took to get to the end of that sequence.And the chemistry between Redford and Newman was almost lifeless, like a glass of soda left out overnight. I don't why, but all the lines (like "who ARE those guys?") I remember as being funny just fell mostly flat. Also, a good actress can light up the screen; but Katherine Ross was about as incandescent as an sick firefly. True, she was not given much to do in this film, but what she did get, she did poorly, reciting her lines mostly in a dull monotone. It's as if she was anticipating her later role in "The Stepford Wives" (which, incidentally, was a much better movie than this one).So I don't know why everybody thinks this movie is so wonderful; I did not find it so and I guess I will have to be in the minority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Who are those guys?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is in my all time top ten movies, and has been for quite awhile. At the same time, I can't say that it's my favorite Western, as the film almost transcends the genre to become the quintessential buddy movie. In their respective roles as Butch and The Kid, Paul Newman and Robert Redford develop a magnetism and charisma that give the movie it's tremendous appeal.I recall the first time I saw this movie upon it's release in 1969 and how original many of the scenes and concepts played out, from Butch's put down of Harvey Logan's (Ted Cassidy) challenge at Hole in the Wall, Sundance's gunpoint strip by Etta (Katharine Ross), and the humorous exchanges between the bandits and E.L. Harriman's trusted train guard Woodcock (George Furth). Life on the run never seemed as glamorous as Butch and the Kid attempting to outwit "those guys". Even the final scene, with the Mexican troops encircling the "yanquis bandidos" location, I kept wondering how they were going to get out of this one.The film also cleverly introduces one of the year's top hit tunes with "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head", though if you want to be critical, it wasn't raining during the segment in which it runs, which on reflection doesn't seem to make sense. But the upbeat tempo of the tune does support the light hearted action on screen and just works.Some veteran character actors perform admirably here as well. Of particular note is Jeff Corey as Sheriff Ray who carefully orchestrates his own bondage by the boys lest he be considered in cahoots with them; and Strother Martin as the Bolivian paymaster who hires Butch and Sundance as the proverbial foxes in the hen house to guard the company payroll. The scene with the Mexican bandits was reminiscent of an earlier era's treatment in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre", though with dire consequences for the banditos this time around.At just under two hours, the film seems to fly by, a testament to intriguing and involved story telling. Even when you know it's over for Butch and Sundance, you're hoping for one more exchange before lights out, such is the camaraderie one feels for the film's protagonists. This is a movie I return to at least once yearly for a good old dose of action and humor, and it still delivers time after time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard a lot about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, story and movie wise. I enjoyed The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly so much that I decided to give Western movies another shot, maybe I just didn't appreciate them more when I was young. But Butch Cassidy was pretty slow paced and doesn't even have much of a story. So why the big fuss? Robert Redford and Paul Newman had good chemistry and I did believe in their friendship and partnership sort of speak. This movie was also beautifully shot, so there are a few points where I can say I had a positive view on the movie.But I felt like there was no story and it just wasn't really my type of movie that I could get into. I hope most of IMDb users understand, we've all been there. But if you want my opinion for those of you who don't enjoy Westerns, only stick to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. If you want to, give Butch Cassidy a chance, but I did warn you.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes it's hard to see what others see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually if you find that you don't like a film which has been deemed a classic you can at least see what it may be that leads people to think so highly of the film. That is not the case with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. I don't get it. I'm not seeing what so many others apparently are seeing. I see an incredibly overrated film that is not even remotely worthy of the near mythical status it has attained. Whatever it is that supposedly makes this film a classic is well and truly lost on me.The biggest problem with the film is that nobody involved apparently could decide what kind of film it was they were making. Was it a serious Western or a comedy Western? The film ends up stuck in some sort of netherworld in between. It's much too jokey to take very seriously but not nearly funny enough to be labeled a comedy. The film tries to be multiple things and ends up not being much of anything at all. It's a film that never really convinces, things always seem a bit off. Just the very concept that the "good guys", the guys we're meant to sympathize with and root for, are actually the bad guys was always going to be a little jarring. Hooray for the train robbers! It could have worked but it really doesn't. No fault of the actors as Paul Newman and Robert Redford, Newman especially, make the characters of Butch and Sundance respectively easy to like. And Sundance's girl, played by Katharine Ross, certainly has her charms as well. But even if you end up liking these characters it's still hard to like the movie.You would think it would be hard to make a boring movie based on the exploits of notorious bank and train robbers. But that's pretty much what we have here. This film moves at a snail's pace, moments of excitement are few and far between. The interminable chase sequence dropped into the middle of the film surely doesn't help. If I had to watch Butch peer into the distance and say "Who are those guys?" one more time I'd scream. Get on with it already. Honestly for much of its running time this movie has you desperately trying to stifle yawns. And when the movie tries to have a little fun it generally doesn't work. So many jokes which fall flat. And that famous, yet exceedingly dopey, bicycle sequence. Hard to take the movie seriously after that. Good song though. I just have no idea what in the world it's doing in this movie. One thing you can say for the movie is that it is beautifully photographed. Cinematographer Conrad Hall's Oscar was well earned. And Newman and Redford, both of course terrific actors, do have very good chemistry and Ross fits in well also. The interactions among the three lead performers provide some good moments. But there are not nearly enough of those moments to salvage the film. It's dull and drawn out, it's neither serious enough to work as a real Western or funny enough to get by on comedic value. The film just doesn't work. But it's a "classic". I don't get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last of the Old Western Gangs (Also: Bonus Information about the Real Wild Bunch and the Pursuing Detective)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me state right now that "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the greatest westerns of all time. It even deserves its place in the top 100 of America's best movies (#73). This writer even rated the film nine stars. It deserves all of them. On the other hand, its heroes are really anti-heroes. Yes they are the criminals, but because they are good-looking and likable and charming and humorous we root for them. But this is not the message of the traditional westerns that were about the noble guys who won in the end (played by William S. Hart, Tom Mix, Gene Autry, John Wayne, etc.) and the dastardly dudes who got what they deserved (real folks like Bill Longley, Black Jack Ketchum, John Wesley Hardin, Ike Clanton, etc.). These bad guys were so unabashedly immoral that people booed them in movie theaters. But for several years before 1969, the framework of the original American Western was transforming. Perhaps movie audiences became bored with the good guys winning. Then there were the attitudes of the counter-culture. So characters of ambiguous morality began to become central; if they still lost at film's end, they at least got sympathy. Our movie is about the "Wild Bunch," last of the outlaw gangs of the old American West. Its specialty was robbing banks and trains on horseback. But the frontier had closed in 1890, and even the remaining wild western pockets were becoming less of a haven. Not only was the telegraph expanding, but the telephone and automobile were already invented. Civilization and technology were making the old time gunslingers obsolete. The Pinkerton detectives and the Union Pacific Railroad were becoming more resourceful. There were less and less places of refuge, although Butch Cassidy's band did well enough at Hole-in-the-Wall pass (north of Casper in Wyoming).The feature is finely crafted, although it probably gathers more from the legend rather than from historical fact. There are many wonderful things to enjoy: The gorgeous cinematography of Conrad Hall (filmed in USA/Mexico) and fine Western settings, the music by Burt Bacharach, the script by William Goldman, the direction of George Roy Hill. The film gathered four Academy awards: Cinematography, score, song ("Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"), and original screenplay. There are quite a few memorable scenes: Opening Thomas Edison Company silent movie that features The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, fancy gun-work by the Sundance Kid in the sepia-toned vignette, Butch and Logan in the knife fight during the gang rebellion, the blown-up express car with flying dollar bills, continuous posse chases, the Newman-Ross bicycle scene, an angry bull, the cliff jump on horseback, the near-botched bank robbery in Bolivia where the two men clumsily attempt to speak Spanish, the ending freeze frame shootout. Although folks get shot in this film, we are spared the endless gore that characterized some filmmakers, like Sam Peckinpah.The Chemistry between Paul Newman, already a big star, and upcoming Robert Redford is masterful. Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) is the talker, the planner, the brains of the outfit; the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) is silent and brooding, but also quick with a gun. Wittily the two leads play off against one another in a sardonic manner. A third important lead, the lovely Katherine Ross (Etta Place), plays a delightful foil between the two men. By the way, two surviving photographs confirm that the real Etta (Ethel) Place was one of the most attractive females of the Old West. Some of the real gang members are also characters: Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy), Flat-Nose Curry (Charles Dierkop), and News Carver (Timothy Scott). Bonus Information: Butch Cassidy (née Robert Leroy Parker), born in 1866, called his gang "The Wild Bunch," not "The-Hole-in-the-Wall Gang." As befitting the grandson of a Mormon bishop, he was affable and eschewed excessive gunplay. "I have never killed a man," he claimed. Butch Cassidy really did blow up a United Pacific railroad express car to smithereens near Wilcox, Wyoming on 2 June 1899. (Employee E.C. Woodcock was staggered, but survived.) Pinkerton agent Charles Angelo Siringo was already hot on the trail. Siringo's name was not used in the movie. Instead we hear Lord Baltimore and Joe Lefors and the United Pacific posse. But it was Charlie Siringo (Siringo disdained Lefors) who trailed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (née Harry Alonzo Longabaugh) for 25,000 miles, as he wrote in one of his books. In fact, Siringo tracked desperadoes from Alaska to Mexico. In 1900 an attempt at amnesty between Butch and Utah Governor Wells failed. Nevertheless, the Old West was dying, and Butch, Sundance, and Etta Place, after visiting New York City (1901), "relocated" to South America in Argentina. Sundance may have married Etta in December 1900. More than once Sundance and Etta returned to the USA; apparently they attended the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. Pinkerton agent Frank Di Maio (or Dimaio), who took over from Charlie Siringo in Argentina, had discovered the exact location of Sundance and Etta, but either a tip or the rainy season ruined his chances of capture. Etta Place returned to the USA for good in 1906/1907; her subsequent history is largely unknown. Butch and Sundance met their eventual demise at San Vincente, Bolivia in November 1908 or at Montevideo, Uruguay in 1912. Flat-Nose Curry, News Carver, and Harvey Logan were already dead. Curry was shot to death by a sheriff in 1900; Carver was killed by lawmen in 1901. To escape capture in 1904 after he had escaped from jail, Logan shot himself. Not mentioned in the movie was William Ellsworth "Elzy" Lay, last of the Wild Bunch. Although he was captured, tried, and sent to prison in 1899, he did a very good deed in jail. So he was pardoned by New Mexico Governor Otero in 1906. Thereafter Lay went straight for the rest of his life; he died in 1934.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't imagine any other actors playing these roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the two films Redford and Newman did, this is my favourite out of the two. Redford and Newman just fit the roles of Cassidy and the Sundance Kid like a glove and they gel so well together on the film. I really can't imagine anyone else playing the roles as well as they did. I really enjoyed the interaction between the two, Cassidy (Newman) has the best lines and in character is the lighter of the two and Sundance Kid (Redford) is darker and hard and you really see the contrasts of the characters, how they deal with situations differently.I have always been fascinated about the wild west legends and this film kept me engaged in the story from start to finish. I particularly thought the scene where George Roy Hill superimpose Redford, Newman and Ross's image on old film was amazing and he and the editor did such a good job of making the actors part of the scene that you couldn't tell it was fake.There are a lot of brilliant and iconic scenes in the movie which are my favourites, some include Cassidy and Sundance jumping off a cliff, robbing the train, the fight between Cassidy and Harvey, Cassidy and Sundance fleeing their pursuers and the gun fight at the end. It just works on so many levels, the casting, direction, editing and story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this movie was made in 1969. But then I look at how YOUNG Newman and Redford are in the film and how craggy and 'well-seasoned' they look now and figure, yeah, that was a long time ago. The pairing of these two actors was brilliant; the chemistry between them, the way they can play off each other's strengths, was recaptured years later in The Sting. BC and the SDK starts of as a loopy set piece of two giddy train robbers just living from one holdup to the next one - but then they rob the wrong guy and he hires a world-class tracker ("Who ARE those guys?") who just won't give up. They keep running - all the way to Bolivia. And okay, maybe the bicycle scene in the meadow with Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head is schmaltzy - but didn't you love it? And don't you remember that scene every time you hear the song on the radio? A movie really doesn't get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive western film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell the truth, there are very few western films that I actually see. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a rare exception. This film truly is not your average western. For one thing, the film does not revolve around good guys vs. bad guys the entire time. It's more of a story about Butch and Sundance themselves. The movie can be humorous at times, throwing in tons of little bits of intelligent verbal comedy, as most great films throughout time have been able to do. Robert Redford shows a side of brilliant acting with lines such as those in his "Can I move?" scene in which he cannot simply stand still and shoot his target. Paul Newman is also especially good, interjecting some wit and sarcasm that make this film so enjoyable. This movie also introduced "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head," one of the best original songs in movie history. Though I like Newman and Redford's second film together ("The Sting") even better, this is still a great film on its own. Perhaps it's only the film's ending that makes this movie less than perfect for me. Though it is more historically accurate, it does provide somewhat of a sense of disappointment here. Nevertheless, the rest of the film is nearly perfect, very enjoyable and worthwhile. A classic, and one of the best films of the 60s.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trust Newman-Redford to deliver.....with Extremely Beautiful photography?.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most entertaining and satisfying westerns of all time. There are many factors which works wonder in favor of this movie. Among them:1. The biggest plus point for this movie to be what it is, is the casting of Newman, Redford and Ross. Apart from the obvious declaration that screen chemistry between Newman-Redford is one of the best of all times, chemistry between Newman-Ross and Redford-Ross are some of the other highlights of the movie. Especially, Newman-Ross scene where they ride in a bicycle is pure joy to watch with the background musical score. Not to mention each scene where Newman and Redford share together are some of the finest moment's cinema lover could ask for.2.The other major selling point of this movie is that it doesn't have the usual elements of most other westerns which are there all the times i.e., needless bloodshed/ revenge plot/ gun tricks and so on. So this way it was a complete different viewing experience for me and I enjoyed it a lot. Hero here is not interested in taking revenges, he is not very thrilled by the prospect of killing, and he knows the odds against him when there are many villains involved. And yet he does the things westerners do, like robbing trains, loving women, and killing when utmost necessary.3. Other major factor is the Cinematography. I won't be exaggerating when I suggest that this is the foremost beautiful movie to be photographed, ever! The picturesque landscapes, the white flowing river and everything from day-night to train to houses to people are all so meticulously captured on the camera and with such beautiful, smooth colors that I am totally amazed by this work. Hats off to Conrad Hall for his marvelous efforts.4. Background music is really good, especially in the bicycle scene and in general throughout the movie. It is very different from music so often related to westerns. 5. Direction is superb, dialogs are smart and witty.I have tried to cover all the pluses that came to my mind, but still feel I missed some although some on purpose because if I start writing on those it will take more time for me to finish this comment. Especially particular scenes of Newman-Redford but all of them are so good, full of wit, that it won't be fair to comment only on some. So if you have or will watch the movie then you might know what task I have here to write about some of them. Overall, one of the finest westerns of all time, and yet so different from most other films of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You Keep Thinking Butch, That's What Your Good At"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting that a film Midnight Cowboy about a street hustler managed to beat out a western about a couple of real western characters for Best Picture of 1969. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is simply one of the best westerns ever made, it's got wit, and charm, and will get you positively infectious in your enthusiasm for it.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has the incomparable team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. George Roy Hill the director had a stroke of inspirational genius teaming the two of them. They both play a different character. Butch Cassidy is the amiable thinker and planner for the Hole in the Wall gang. Outlaw that he is Paul Newman is so charming in the role you have to root for him. He's a guy who thinks fast on his feet. Note what happens right at the beginning of the film when Ted Cassidy, best known for being Lurch the butler on the Addams Family challenges him for the gang leadership. It's one of my favorite scenes.But even better is Newman with George Furth as the dedicated employee of the Union Pacific Railroad in two scenes where this stubborn little clerk tries to singlehandedly stop the robbery. Furth in fact is my favorite character part in the film.Of course Newman is backed up by the laconic fast draw The Sundance Kid as played by Robert Redford. He's got a nice quiet menace about him, but you can tell how much affection he has for Newman. What comes through is these guys genuinely like each other on and off the screen.Katharine Ross plays Etta Place who was Sundance's mistress. I liked her also, she's a survivor and one grateful for the good and bad times she's had. Ross is a former schoolteacher and she went into the relationship with her eyes open with no regrets. But the most poignant moment in the film is when she tells both of the men that she'll go with them to Bolivia after the USA has gotten too hot for them and do whatever they want, but she won't watch them inevitably die because they can't change with the times.A lot of the same themes are expressed in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as were done in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The difference is that Butch and Sundance have a ton of redeeming qualities whereas Liberty Valance has none.B.J. Thomas's rendition of the Academy Award winning song Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head is what people remember most about this film. It's certainly one of the most recognized movie themes ever written. Besides Thomas, good records of the song were done by Andy Williams, Perry Como and Dean Martin. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid won some other technical Oscars including a most deserved one for cinematography. It missed being Best Picture and Best Director for George Roy Hill.In the only western he ever did in his career George Roy Hill came up with one of the best. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid should be seen back to back with The Sting. Hard to say which one is the better.</fullReview>

Everything is a bit light and fluffy, and the whole production seems to say "Look! Heartthrob actors, dressed up like cowboys, doing cowboy stuff!" It certainly has entertaining portions (along the lines of Hollywood's usual "something for everyone"), but I wouldn't call it a good movie. Best watched after Sergio Leone's masterpieces have faded from memory. I didn't take that advice and found myself thinking "this is so weak!"</fullReview>

Paul Newman and Robert Redford shine as the title characters - I could not take my eyes off of them on the screen. The supporting cast plays off them wonderfully, and the screenplay, full of wit and charisma, is the best I've ever seen. There are some wonderful filming sequences in this movie, used innovatively to compliment the scenes and plot. The score is memorable - not just sweeping soundtrack stuck into the frames of a western, it is really music, beautiful and creative in of itself. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a poignant classic - they don't make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western? No ? but a warming and funny gentle comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cassidy and Sundance are part of the Hole in the Wall gang. However the West is becoming harder for criminals and soon they find themselves the target of a posse. Wherever they go they are followed. Eventually they travel to Bolivia to escape the heat, but can they manage to go straight?This is one of the slightest and flimsiest westerns of modern days. Even Young Guns has more cohesive plotting than this. However that's not what this is all about. For all it's lightness it is really, really good fun. To all intents and purposes it's a comedy regardless of the period it is set in. The plot does little but provide some funny chases and ample oppourtunity for the two stars to play off each other to great effect.Ross is good but really this is only Newman and Redford's film, and they play it well. Both have a great rapport with the other and it adds to the bickering etc. Their lines are all great and the film lives and dies with them. It has slow portions and bits that don't really work too well, but as long as Newman and Redford are on screen then fun is never too far away.Overall this is not a great western, but as a classic buddy comedy it's bang on. Funny and warming every time you watch it this is a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing this movie for the first time, and while simultaneously reading about Robert Leroy Parker, I felt it appropriate to give my two cents. The character development and chemistry between Redford and Newman is excellent. As is the case with their performance in The Sting, the two really excel together as a team. The shootout in the end best demonstrates the comradery and the brotherhood that the two share. I can't figure out why the soundtrack from this movie won so many awards. It wasn't terrible but it sure wasn't spectacular. Oh well, such is politics. The balance of humor and drama was superb, transitioning between each other like clockwork. The sets and the actual geography of the sets was incredible. I think I spent more time marveling at the mountains and the rock formations then the characters at times. If you are looking for a fun film to watch, or a unique western, I suggest this film whole-heartedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could this really have been the beginning of Sundance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly revisionist western in the best sense of the term, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" was one of the quintessential American movies of the sixties; a huge commercial success and showered with Oscars. Over the years it has gone somewhat out of fashion but it is still a ground-breaking classic no matter how you look at it. It moves seamlessly between seriousness and a beautifully honed comic sensibility continually buoyed up by one of the greatest of all screenplays by William Goldman, too jokey for some, perhaps, but clever, myth-making and intelligent and while many movies that seemed so much of their period or which wore their influences a little too obviously, (in this case, the French New Wave), "Butch ... and Sundance ..." certainly isn't one of them.Admittedly Newman and Redford coast their way through the film; they look like they are having too much fun. This is laconic acting at its most laconic, but Conrad Hall's photography is still stunning so the film looks as good as it sounds. I have no doubt that George Roy Hill's subsequent Newman/Redford pairing "The Sting"'s best picture Oscar was one given to make up for "Butch's" failure to take home the big prize.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the all time great movies of not only the Western genre but of cinematic history. The time of the Western outlaw is coming to an end and while we see Butch &amp; Sundance try and change their ways, they ultimately fall back on what they know best - bank robbery. The relentless pursuit of the law in America forces them to take flight to Bolivia where they are still forced to run.The playful back &amp; forth between Newman &amp; Redford as the titular Butch &amp; Sundance often makes you forget the fact that these are two of the most wanted criminals in America at the time. This easily allows you to fall onto the side of the outlaws outrunning the law, rather than the typical lawman hunting the bank robber. The script is flawless and the timing of Newman &amp; Redford is spectacular. Having them vying for the affections of Etta Place brings a more humane side to a pair who would have been labelled ruthless killers in America at the time. Their ultimate doom is well known by Old West history buffs but there is an overwhelming feeling that you want them to escape to Australia as they discussed. There are still reports that both lived on after their time in Bolivia but the final scene a fitting way to send off two of the most notorious outlaws of their time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman. It stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross and Strother Martin. A Panavision/De Luxe production with music by Burt Bacharach and cinematography by Conrad Hall.Not exactly a hit with the critics of the time, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had no such problems at the box office or with longevity of popularity. It is still today one of the few Western films that none Western fans enjoy immensely. Much of this can be attributed to the wonderful buddy buddy chemistry between Newman and Redford, and of course the general blending of ragamuffin drama with cheeky chappy comedy.The casting as finished was not exactly set in stone, Newman was always in but was originally going to play the part of Sundance. McQueen was pencilled in for Cassidy, as was Lemmon while Beatty was mooted as well, but eventually a chance was taken on Redford and Newman switched to the role of Cassidy. On such things can a movie be made or broken, as it turned out it was the ace in the pack as legendary characters were brought joyously to life.Only based on the basic real life facts of the Hole-in-the-Wall gang led by Butch Cassidy, the film follows the simple formula of two lovable rogue entrepreneurs being chased by a Pinkerton posse whilst robbing their way to a new life in Bolivia. A gorgeous sepia opening sets the standard for the visual treats to follow, with over a quarter of the film being an extended chase sequence through the landscapes. As Hill and Goldman (Academy Award Best Story/Screenplay) provide the tension in the sequences, Conrad Hall (Academy Award Best Cinematography) brings clarity of beauty and dust strewn sweat.The music by Burt Bacharach (Academy Award Best Music) has not always gone down well with critics and fans alike, especially the pivotal "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" (song by country singer B.J. Thomas). But in the context of the scenes, and the changing of the West (even the Western movie in fact), the music works. Yes, "Raindrops" is a touch corny in essence, but the accompanying sequences as the bicycle replaces the horse in major metaphor - and the warmth of the Etta Place (Ross a little bland) and Cassidy friendship is born out - it's hardly a film killer. In fact it's a daring move by the makers.Hugely influential on Westerns that would follow and spawning further tales of the exploits of Butch and Sundance, Hill's movie has earned its much loved reputation. With the constant by-play between Redford and Newman always engaging (who are those guys?), a number of iconic scenes firmly ensconced in movie folklore, and technical smarts to cherish, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid never takes its foot of the pedal or its grip on your heart. Because as the freeze frame sepia ending passes muster as a blaze of glory, it's indeed true, Hill, Hall, Goldman, Newman and Redford have made a true Western classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a gunman, you're one hell of a pessimist ? Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sting is one of my favorite films and so when the opportunity presented itself to see the first pairing of Hill, Newman, and Robert Redford on the big screen, I had to take advantage. Being the earliest success and having an image of one of the best westerns around, I must admit to being somewhat surprised at the humor tossed about at the start. Did I think this would be a serious film? Perhaps, but never did I anticipate it being a buddy comedy to the core with a witty, dynamic duo at the lead. While Newman and Redford definitely steal the show, Butch Cassidy is much more than just two outlaws having fun. Brilliant cinematography, directing, and a few impressive shootouts help prove why this film is held in such high regard.The film is dated, for sure, in many parts. A cheesy rendition of the Oscar winning song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" showing Newman and actress Katherine Ross riding a bike through a farm is one instance, (especially since they weren't even romantically involved), as are the silent time-progressing montages set to similar musical stylings. Heck, the movie even drags a bit due to the flimsy plot at its core. The crux of the story involves the end of robbing banks and trains on horse, and how these two men experience this truth. It is a dead artform and the police and hired hands have gotten too sophisticated to just let criminals getaway. Therefore, one can only witness so many robberies, no matter what country they occur in, without hoping for a little bit more. However, that said, you won't be bored because our anti-heroes refuse to let you. Whether thieving, escaping, going straight, or just laying low, Newman and Redford work together as though they have their entire life. The comedic timing is perfect, the facial expressions genuine, and the audience reaction nothing short of laughter upon laughter.Butch and Sundance, (Newman and Redford respectively), know they are a dying breed, even going so far as saying they may be over the hill in the business. Their return to the Hole in the Wall Gang Cassidy formed proves this with an attempt at usurping power by another member in lieu of a "welcome back" party. The confidence, or perhaps insanity, in each keeps our leads from ever backing down or giving up. Butch always has a new great idea to make things better and Sundance always has his guns at the ready to make sure those plans can occur. It is a pairing of brains and brawn like any other, two friends living the high life by stealing and spending lavishly, looking for the next big score, the next slice of danger, or, if they're lucky, both. They've been at it for a long time at the point to which we are introduced, and they have a set system that has worked in the past. Sometimes people take things personally, however, and change the rules. You can only knock off the Union Pacific so often before its owner enlists a posse of hired hands to kill his enemies by paying more than they even steal from him. Now that is a grudge if I've ever heard one.You definitely can't discount the Oscar-winning cinematography from Conrad L. Hall either. His use of blocking and framing is pretty great and the ability to always have the leads in the foreground while still seeing the hunters on their trail in the distant desert is an impressive feat. Scenes like watching the torch lights split up in the nighttime distance, only to see them join up again in pursuit show the kind of planning that went into this production. And Hill also decided to be inventive in his process of editing and progression as well. The movie begins nicely with old silent film footage of the gang stealing from trains on a projection while the credits roll to its right, showing how the medium itself will be utilized to help tell the story. While there are more traditional montages, like the exploits of the Bandidos Yanquis with help from Ross's Etta Place in Bolivia, the most memorable sequence of time-lapse comes from a collage. Yes, the traveling from out west to New York to South America is told through sepia-toned photographs taken along the way. I can only guess that Roger Avary had this moment in mind when he chose to similarly show Victor's European vacation in Rules of Attraction.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is by far more buddy comedy than weighty Once Upon a Time in the West fare, but that is not a bad thing. There are definite themes of time passing and men attempting to grow old, yet, sometimes, seeing that the job just can't be left behind. You don't become career criminals expecting to live a long life; you do it for the adventure and the fun a quick fortune can bring. The film does get a tad serious towards the end, especially when the world begins to fall around them and Ross starts to put into action her promise of following them anywhere as long as she doesn't have to be there when they are killed, but at the same time never loses its comedic edge. These two affable bad guys smile in the face of fear and as a result give us a very memorable conclusion to the adventure. With a brilliant freeze-frame, letting the end occur in the minds of the viewers, Hill caps one heck of a ride with the best action and banter yet. There is nothing like saving one's best for last to leave an impression.</fullReview>

You'd be hard pressed to find two names that lit up a marquis together like these two back in their day and its exactly what makes a film like "Butch Cassidy" go from good to timeless.No, the film wouldn't be nothing without them, but it's their over-masculine insults trying to mask their deep care for one another that makes them both funny and endearing, as does their care-free attitude about theft. Hill reflects all of this in his film and it makes it that much better.The movie follows its titular outlaws in the twilight of their infamous careers. Their reputation precedes them and their age, particularly Butch's, catches up with them. Throughout the film is a sense that times are changing and that they won't be able to keep robbing banks and trains forever, an appropriate and meaningful foreshadow that affects the film. Things stay good for part of the film, but eventually someone is on their trail and they're just as crafty. Butch and Sundance go on the run, unable to shake them off the trail.Newman brings his usual swagger to the role of Butch. He's clearly aging, but his idealism and vision for finding the next big job never fades, even when it gets him into trouble. Newman carries the perfect sense of humor and is never afraid to make Butch seem vulnerable, as legendary as he is. Redford is the skilled, more easily angered of the two, always keeping his logic handy. He's always quick to insult Butch but always quick to defend him. The unspoken bond between these two is strong and excellent.The cinematography in this film is top notch, especially in the beginning. Conrad L. Hall gives these men the mystique, makes each scene feel like a tall tale or a legend. It's really quite beautiful and the changes from sepia to living color sell this mood even more. Even more than the images, the choice of scoring this film is the most interesting and daring choice of all. Burt Bacharach provides an old saloon theme, a more positive tune as his only scoring and then writes the classic tune "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" to accompany a care-free montage. The music echoes not the danger and peril as would a typical Western score, but the joy and timelessness of the story. It seems strange at first, but it's the right choice given the film's themes.No one forgets a great on-screen tandem and that is Newman and Redford. There's an undeniable chemistry between them though they are both strong enough to star on their own. It's this duel alpha male butting of heads that makes them play off each other so well and ultimately not be a contest of upstaging. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The word legend gets used all to easily now a days. But in this man i think it is an under-statement. On and off the screen this man was a giant ! My condolences must go out to his family.In my mind he was the last real link between the old Hollywood and the Hollywood of today. I bet you can not find a single person in the movies or in life that would have a bad word to say about him.Butch Cassidy is one of my favourite films of all time but i could pick 10 or more of his films that would make my list of favourites of all time, that was the calibre of his work.Over here in England he is on the front covers of all the major news papers today which times as they are and things that are going on in the world right now speak volumes of how much this screen legend will be missed.RIP Paul Newman........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated by still interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I'm too fond of the traditional Hollywood western and the great 'spaghetti' westerns of Sergio Leone, but "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" strikes me as a clumsy attempt to adapt them to the changing sensibilities of the late 1960s.Gone are some clichés that we actually liked, like the sweeping orchestral score that seemed as majestic as the landscapes on screen, but still present are some of the clichés I could do without, like the invincible "fastest draw in the west" outlaw and the hapless, submissive woman. The movie does, to its credit, replace the traditional one-dimensional gunslinger with characters with at least some emotional depth, and perhaps that is its most enduring update of the western style.The story is alright, amusing in parts, as the duo's exploits cause them to be pursued by the greatest trackers in the west, forcing them to flee to Bolivia. The movie relies almost entirely on the chemistry between Newman and Redford, as there is just a token effort to build drama and suspense through the traditional tools of the western. The overall effect seems clumsy, especially with its inexplicably anachronistic soundtrack, but I do respect that this movie was apparently exactly the sort of "western" that audiences wanted in 1969. As a movie in the great pantheon of westerns, I don't think it stacks up to the greats, but it is certainly worth watching for its novel, if goofy, take on the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a true great majestic western action adventure all provided by Paul Newman, Robert Redford and of coarse the director of the film- George Roy Hill. First of, the chemistry between Newman and Redford are nothing short of absolute magic. The direction from George Roy Hill is epic and sweeping and puts the audience in the time of fast sharp shooters and valiant heroes.The comedy put into the characters of Newman and Redford are classy and intelligent, the action is also as much use as the comedy- brilliant sophisticated and incomparable. So if you are looking for a western that has comedy, action, romance and adventure. Then look no further than Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, let your imagination sour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Guys are Good Guys: Best Comedy-Drama Western of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a list of movies that defied most film conventions at the time of their release, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" would have to be on the list. Before "Butch Cassidy", the typical western involved good guys with white hats and bad guys with black hats, basically John Wayne versus Jack Palance, and the winner was already foretold. And few of these offerings had much in the way of character study and/or development. "Butch Cassidy" warped the conventional and created a very different way of looking at the genre. From one angle, you might argue its a parody of the American western. On another angle, its a character study. Or is it a comedy? Some of the lines are better than most comedies filmed today. And it is also a drama with tragic elements. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " is all these things."Butch Cassidy" parodies the traditional American western by focusing on two outlaws as its main characters and giving them beloved humanity. They are even described as "two-bit outlaws on the dodge" in one scene. And yet, we are drawn into their story in a way you might expect being drawn into the story of two good guys. The lawmen of the movie, who are chasing Butch and Sundance, are like specters. We see them from afar barely visible, often riding in the distance a mile or so from our "heros". They appear ominous and unforgiving in a way you might think of the typical bad guy riding into town in movies made only 10-20 years before "Butch Cassidy". We find ourselves fearing the "good guys" and loving the "bad guys".The movie is a complex character study of its two leads. It's impossible now to imagine this film working as well as it does without the talents of Paul Neuman and Robert Redford in which a strange and unpredictable chemistry evolved. As the movie progresses, the relationship of Butch and Sundance is gradually revealed. Sundance is the more erratic and high-strung of the two while Cassidy is the intellectual criminal, analyzing situations, although both are portrayed as highly intelligent. At one point, Sundance says, "You just keep thinking, Butch, that's what you're good at." The comedic elements of "Butch Cassidy" should be celebrated as much as its other aspects. The movie brims with wonderful innuendos, sly remarks, and interesting sarcasm. At one point, the issue of Sundance's girl going with them comes up, and he tells her that he wants no wining or complaining, or "I'm dumping you flat." To which Cassidy says, "Don't sugar-coat it, kid. Tell her straight." This kind of humor permeates the entire film, with some of the best humor erupting in the middle of desperate situations.And finally, "Butch Cassidy" is a tragedy, or at least a tragic-comedy. (No wedding at the end.) At the beginning of the tale, the characters are light-hearted bandits in which they rob trains but always sympathize with the passengers, and even the poor bastard hired by the railroads to guard the "loot". At one point Cassidy tells him "Whatever they're paying you it ain't enough." But then the tide turns as the railroads fight back and hire a sophisticated posy to hunt down and destroy the fun-loving outlaws. The film becomes an interesting study in how these two outlaw stars must now face their greatest foe. It should be noted that the real Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid were ruthless killers who engaged in many gunfights where they mercilessly slaughtered their foes long before they went to Bolivia. Their portrayal in this 1969 film is not really history, but the story works on its own terms.Few filmmakers would attempt to combine all these elements in a single story, and yet the film works on every level. Maybe in a way, although it has these elements of comedy, drama, character, and tragedy, it is ultimately just a well-told story of two guys who happen to be bandits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...But Once They Ruled The West!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1950s and 1960s, adventure movies were often Westerns. In later years, they were just as often buddy movies. "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid" is kind of where one became the other. It's lasted because it's so good, and also because it did some things that were unusual at the time but became very customary soon after.It's funny to read the comments from people knocking this film as a form of praising "The Wild Bunch." They were both westerns made in 1969, and the main characters in both are outlaws, but there's not much else they have in common other than Strother Martin and Latinos dying in slo-mo. Disparaging "Butch Cassidy" because it's not "Wild Bunch" is like attacking "Star Wars" for not being "Gone With The Wind."I think "Wild Bunch" is great, too, but in a much different way, tough, mean, and brutal. "Butch Cassidy" is a sunny charmer, aimed squarely at the mainstream but with nice touches throughout that surprise you with their understated brilliance. The opening kinescope sequence; the sepia washing into the blue horizon as Butch and Sundance ride away from the card game; the still photograph section during the trip to New York, and especially the powerful last shot. There's nothing crazy or clever about the film, except when you realize it was designed to attract theater goers and did so despite taking so many chances within its conventional form.The music riles some. You can read them all here. "Bacharach and David were totally wrong for this type of movie, what's with all those 'Dating Game' tunes, I fast-forward through the bicycle part, etc." As Sundance would say of these criticisms: "Bitch, bitch, bitch!" "Butch Cassidy" works because it is anachronistic. It's not cinema verite, it's not trying to seem real for a second. The kinescope bit at the beginning is your clue, this is a western movie that's fully aware of its nature as a movie, and expects the same from the audience.That being said, I'd like to add that the bicycle sequence is my favorite part, because of the great song, the wordless interaction of Paul Newman and Katharine Ross, the way the sunlight dapples the lace curtains and the caramel locks of Etta's hair. It's also something else, too, the one moment of peace Butch gets and an oddly effective grace note in his otherwise miserable life. The look he gives the bull after crashing through the fence is not just cute but summarizes in one priceless instant Butch's approach to life's travails throughout the film.I used to think the chase part went on too long, but now I just sit back and enjoy the banter, and the gorgeous scenery. (I don't know where Conrad Hall shot this picture, but I have a hard time believing it was anywhere on Planet Earth.) Nothing else to complain about with this one, nothing.Obviously the most appealing aspect of this film are the two leads. Its a happy miracle that with all the big names being bandied around, we ended up with Newman and Robert Redford. Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen wouldn't have worked not because of inferior acting skills but inferior chemistry. Newman and Redford work so well with each other because they aren't competing but playing off each other. They are actors, and they have egos, but there's no stench of narcissism connected to this movie. That's why it's so enjoyable even through the slow stretches, and why it's a shame Newman and Redford only did one other movie together after this.George Roy Hill directed that movie, "The Sting," as well as this, and it's bewildering how little credit he seems to get for his work. Sure, he won an Oscar for "The Sting," and was nominated for one for this, but he's nearly forgotten today. Maybe it's because he was so versatile. Hill made "Slap Shot" and "The World Of Henry Orient;" two films as far apart as any in terms of demographic appeal. "Butch Cassidy" is one of the most inventive, successful mainstream films ever made, and it's inventive and successful because Hill was the man with the plan behind it.One other thing: If you like this movie but don't have this on DVD, get it. If you don't have a DVD player, it's worth having for the "Butch" DVD alone. It's a generously front-loaded item featuring gorgeous imaging, an informative commentary track, penetrating interviews with all the stars looking back, and most especially a documentary Hill narrated a year after the film came out which details the many challenges he confronted making this movie. Hill's final line in that documentary is a gem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the score makes me want to stab a sharp #2 pencil deep into my ear, the film ultimately justifies its classic status with enthralling photography, endearing characters, fairly good pacing, and - above all - a good-natured sense of humor.The opening scene, in all its sepia-toned glory, presents an inspired introduction to the two lead characters. Butch Cassidy, wry and easy-going, tries to end a dispute between Sundance, the stoic, and an unseen antagonist. After that, the film takes a dubious turn with the introduction of the love interest, played by Katharine Ross in an exceedingly bland performance. In fact, I would have gladly forsaken historical accuracy in favor of eliminating her character entirely.The thrill of the hunt (or rather, the hunted) drives the first half of the film. Seen only from afar, the "Superposse" gives off an aura of mythical strength, disciplined perseverance, and unparalleled skill. This epic chase escalates to the brink of fever pitch when Butch and Sundance abruptly flee to South America (again, realism is a curse).The pacing of the film stalls a bit at this point due to a tedious, unnecessary montage sequence. The story regains its former humorous and thrilling style thereafter, except for an inane robbery/self-congratulatory dinner progression complete with cheesy late 60's bubble-gum vocal jazz (stab stab stab). The final scene is very well executed even though the Bolivian army is not nearly as interesting or as diabolical as the "Superposse."The secondary and peripheral characters amuse and entertain throughout (Woodcock, Logan, The Bicycle Salesman, Percy Garris, et al). I particularly enjoyed Sheriff Bledsoe's frantic and impulsive rambling ("You're gonna die bloody, and all you can do is choose where").Definitely catch this one if you have the chance.</fullReview>

This movie has it all: a great story, superb acting, wonderful comedic moments, clever dialogue and fantastic character development. Also timeless scenes pervade such as `no rules in a knife fight', the undressing scene when Katherine Ross's character is first introduced, the cliff jump and of course the fabulous ending in which director George Roy Hill stops the film but lets the sound continue thus revealing the pair's fate, but saving the audience the sadness of seeing it. It is a perfect compromise. The interaction between Newman and Redford is as memorable as it is amusing. One of the ten best movies ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 'buddy' genre has been all the rage in Hollywood since the 1980s, but I think its origins go right back to BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID. Sure, the guys here are anti-heroes, but other than that they have the same laidback, wisecracking charm as many heroes who've come ever since. The influence of this comic western is undeniable, particularly in Italy, whose producers made dozens of jokey westerns after the release of this one.Looking back on this film now, I actually think it's quite a slight movie. I like the use of sepia photographs to evoke the setting, but the montage sequences don't really work all that well (although they are included out of necessity, as the producers didn't have permission to shoot on the elaborate sets required). The film gets by thanks to the seemingly effortless performances of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who have plenty of chemistry together. Yes, Katharine Ross feels extraneous, and the narrative is repetitive, but there are touches here that make this a well-loved movie: THAT song, and THAT ending. In the end, that's enough, and Butch and Sundance have gone down in history...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally don't mind watching some 'Good Ole' Fashioned' western movies here and there, so when I came across Butch Cassidy (In Blu-Ray might I add) I didn't mind renting that bad-boy out (obviously having a bit of knowledge about the film). Since I watched 'The Sting' not so long before, I was very pleased to see Robert Redford and Paul Newman together as main characters again (technically speaking, it is again for me, despite the fact that 'Butch Cassidy...' came out 4 years before 'the Sting'.I was pretty eager to watch this film, and if I've learned one thing about watching movies; optimism tends worsen the film (as you expect something much more than what the film offers). So this may have affected my rating of Butch Cassidy.As the summary suggests, the film contains a lot of memorable moments that do promote one hell of a reminiscence but unfortunately that's only about a quarter or a third of the film. The only reason why this film has scenes so memorable is because they're surrounded by scenes that struggle to captivate you as the viewer and therefore are forgettable. But because of those scenes (the good ones - the memorable ones) are so well done and crafted, and the characters are so undeniably likable and the use of the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head", it is impossible to hate the film. To save you guys the disappointment, I would like to add that maybe if the ending scene closed with a second-use of the song, "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head" (it is only used once in the film) the ending could of had more of a punch and inevitably created a slightly better film (only by a bit) So, With this in mind, Butch Cassidy is a memorable classic that does offer some juicy scenes but ends up falling flat in the consistency of the film. My experience with this film would be equivalent to riding a roller-coaster (which does all those groovy shenanigans i.e. high speed and goes upside down and all that yahoo) but only lasts about less than a minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Reverse Western With Fantastic Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I miss the late 1960s. Not that I lived during them, not that I look back at the Vietnam War as if it were a good time in American history, not that I'm one of those young buffoons who blames their friendlessness on their possession of an old soul ? I miss the late 1960s because of their filmmaking. There was a feeling that anything was possible, that stars we got to know in the earlier years of the decade were suddenly drifting toward the game- changers rather than the drivel wholesome pieces, that Hollywood was suddenly a hip place instead of a soap scrubbed habitation. How movies finally had something to say, whether it be artistically or socially. It's exciting how we could have waltzed into the theater in 1960 to see a "Pillow Talk" 2.0, only to come back a few years later and find ourselves with "Blowup", "Easy Rider", or "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?". No decade has come close to the reinvention seen in the shape-shifting decade."Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the defining films of the time, among the series that entertained us with an easygoing, lo-fi atmosphere rather than a chintzy, big- budgeted one. It's a reverse Western: everything looks as though it could be a part of a later-in-life John Wayne adventure, but the tone is less rugged, more self-deprecating. It's a hybrid of different styles, some reminiscent of Robert Altman, others Robert Benton and Peter Bogdanovich. Only slightly serious, with more than enough comic relief to call itself a ? gulp ? comedy, it's difficult to put a finger on what "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" really is. Perhaps that was intentional, going out to be an undefinable western romp and coming back a champion. But I suppose its breeziness is part of its charm. Without a care in the world, the actions of the titular characters are unpredictable and wandering, as though it all were improvised. So thank God Paul Newman and Robert Redford have enough charisma to keep us from snoozing as if we were being faced with a laborious spaghetti western.Newman is Butch Cassidy, Redford is the Sundance Kid; as the Old West's most formidable train robbers, they are said to be legends ? just don't expect them to wear the term like a five-year-old dons a Superman cape. They view their actions as time wasters, as a way to have some fun on a boring Sunday afternoon. They don't like to kill. They like the thrill that comes with running away from the law. The danger is appealing. But they've been doing the same thing for too long, and they're well aware they aren't going to live to be one-hundred, with so much flak behind their names. They're going to be the victims of a shootout, maybe in a week, a month, a year. So Butch Cassidy, or the Sundance Kid, I don't remember which, proposes they go down to Bolivia ? there, they can refresh their thieving ways, and, eventually, live a normal life. In tow is the Sundance Kid's girl, Etta (Katharine Ross), and for the first few months, things are blissful, successful. But when an old enemy makes his way into the area, they realize that escaping from past wrongdoings may only be a temporary solution.When "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" isn't making us laugh, it moves by slowly; because it doesn't have the same mesmerizing quiet of other crime based dramas, like "Thieves Like Us" and "The Thomas Crown Affair", a moody setback does nothing besides pander by. But when the film is good, it's great. Newman and Redford have better chemistry than some of the most notable screen couples of the time, conversing with such witty ease that we can't help but want to be a part of their crime spree ourselves. One of the best scenes in the film, which finds the duo at the edge of a cliff as the law chases them, is ecstatically funny, an inexperienced Redford complaining that he doesn't know how to swim, worried that he and his crime partner might have to jump. Newman guffaws like an older brother, and, when they do go through with the deed, their rapport, especially as they go downstream, is delivered with effortless comedic energy. Newman and Redford are fantastic together: as the quintessential everymen who happen to be movie stars, they seem destined to headline together. How they only made one other film together ("The Sting") is mind-boggling ? they put the B in bromance. You can forget about Starsky and Hutch, Crockett and Tubbs; Newman and Redford are the real deal.But "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" relies too much on the charisma of its stars. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering how excellent it is most of the time, but when it drags, it drags. It's better off as a comedy, and when it decides to go for a serious moment, we're hardly convinced. We want to have fun with our actors, not see them in crisis ? the ending, all "Bonnie and Clyde" "tragic", doesn't fit. We want more adventures. If Clint Eastwood were starring, maybe we'd be okay seeing him go. It would be heroic. But Newman and Redford are much too likable to be too-serious-for-their-own-good anti- heroes, and we don't want to see their brotherly love come to an end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of westerns, and of Newman and Redford. I think the Sting is one of the greatest crime movies of all time. But this movie just isn't that exciting. It doesn't have those memorable moments that a lot of these classic westerns do. You would think with the star-power they would make the average script a classic, but I guess not in my books. I know a lot of people love this movie, but like Blade Runner, I just don't see why.To start, there just isn't much plot. The premise is they steal money and then runaway from bad guys (who by the way you never even get to really see). I would have been fine if they built up these bad guys like the did and then at the end have a classic gun fight, but it turns out its with a foreign country at the end instead of the guys who have been chasing them the whole time. Also, how do they get back to Katharine Ross' character? weren't they chased without horses miles away? Then the next morning they are all of a sudden there. Maybe that's nitpicking but if I noticed it, its a mistake. I just felt like this movie fell short on several levels.But even though I didn't like the end bad guys, I did like the final gun fight, I thought it at least put some excitement onto a rather boring movie. Besides the negatives I did think Newman and Redford were fine in their roles but I cant say I will remember anything particular that they said to each other. I realize all film is subjective, and most people love this movie, but that's just not me.6.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" tells the mostly true story of a pair of notorious outlaws on the lam. The film won four Oscars and is now regarded as a cinema classic. However, for me, it took a few viewings before I really warmed up to it.The movie is anything but a typical western. For one thing, part of the story takes place in Bolivia, of all locations. There's also more comedy than is usual for a western. Lastly, the Burt Bacharach score defies convention. Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western.However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee.I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour &amp; drama.As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he &amp; Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me.Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wild West film that will make you cheer for the bad guys.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid George Hill, the director, uses Bolivia to represent the dream place Butch and Sundance want to reach in order to get a fresh start. It was suppose to be an escape from the life they have been dealing with, as well as a chance to bring change for them. In the beginning of the movie they bring up Bolivia as the place to be, which leads to the conclusion that they will end up there at some point. When they finally reach their dream place it's not what they expected it to be, in reality the country is poor and run down. After all they been through Bolivia turns out to be another obstacle they must overcome. At first Bolivia acts as an escape for them and is a change. It's clear that Bolivia is an escape since it throws the posse, which is after them. The problem is that the change they get is that they are foreigners and stand out. All their plans they had are slowed down because they have to learn the native language, Spanish, in order to do business. Bolivia also brings change to Sundance's attitude once they get there. This is easy to see from the point they arrive in Bolivia till the end of the movie. He develops an on edge attitude, which he is easier to set off. Bolivia becomes the end of their dream since their adventures end here. An important item to take note of is the white straw hat that is always worn by Joe Lefors, the best lawman around. This hat represents the law which they are running from throughout the movie; they are never able to outrun the law. When in America the posse is after them then in Bolivia they are chased by officers there. Weather they are in American or Bolivia the hat is still present. This hat also brings fear to Butch and Sundance. An example of this is when they are in Bolivia they see the hat and are instantly scared and leave the restaurant they are at. There are two pivotal points in the movie. The first one is when Butch and Sundance go to Sheriff Bledsoe in order to join the war. Then the second is when Butch and Sundance get into a gunfight with the Mexican outlaws. Each of these scenes is similar in a number of ways. In both of these scenes Butch and Sundance use it as a way to go "straight", or become the good guys. The first scene they try to join the war because they feel it's a way to become the good guys. Then in the second scene they feel by carrying out their contract they are now the good guys and even say they have gone straight. Another way these scenes are similar is because they try to escape the posse after them. By joining the war they feel the posse won't come after them because they will be fighting for the country. Then when they kill the outlaws they feel the posse can no longer come after them since they have changed their ways. When Butch and Sundance decide to run to Bolivia they ask Etta if she wants to join. She accepted their offer on one condition which she said she was not going to stay around and watch them die. This becomes a notable part of the movie. Later on in Bolivia Etta, for no good reason, decides that she wants to head back to America. If you put these two elements together you can tell that trouble is going to happen. After she is gone Butch and Sundance end up in a shootout and are killed, which Etta predicted since she left them. This movie was all about teamwork and how far it could get you. Throughout the whole movie Butch and Sundance worked together in order to escape many dangerous situations and see things they never thought possible. Although in the end the numbers game worked against them but they went down as a team. I learned that this movie was based on actual characters. The events that took place in the movie were loosely based on the real lives of Butch and Sundance. Some of the events that did happen in the movie actually took place but it may not have been as dramatic like the film. The ending scene was not historically correct because the bodies in that shootout were never identified. The name of their gang in the movie was not the name they went by in real life.I feel Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who played Butch and Sundance, had a really good chemistry during this film. Their chemistry really made them a great pair for this film. These two were friends in real life which makes it understandable of why they were picked for these parts together. All throughout the movie the chemistry makes the movie flow and it can easily been seen that they truly carried this film. Without that great chemistry between these two then this film would probably not of been as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a Western film based loosely on fact as the film tells the story of Wild West outlaws Robert LeRoy Parker, known to history as Butch Cassidy and his partner Harry Longabaugh, the "Sundance Kid" as they migrate to Bolivia while on the run from the law in search of a more successful criminal career.It stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid respectively,together with Katharine Ross.It was written by William Goldman and directed by George Roy Hill.Witty pals Butch and Sundance join the Gang in successfully robbing yet another train with their trademark non-lethal style. After the pair rests at the home of Sundance's schoolmarm girlfriend, Etta, the Gang robs the same train, but this time, the railroad boss has hired the best trackers in the business to foil the crime. After being tailed over rocks and a river gorge by guys that they can barely identify save for a white hat, they decide that maybe it's time to try their luck in Bolivia. Taking Etta with them, they live high on ill-gotten Bolivian gains, but she leaves after their white-hatted nemesis portentously arrives. Their luck running out,they are soon holed up in a barn surrounded by scores of Bolivian soldiers who are waiting for the pair to make one last run for it.The film has gone down as among the defining moments in American cinema due to the iconic pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, jaunty screenplay, Burt Bacharach score and the entertainment it gives the viewer.Aside from that,it has set the benchmark for buddy action- comedies for many years to come and the charm that both lead stars - Newman and Redford - deliver in their roles has become the standard in terms of performance.Watching this is a great experience and anyone who appreciates great film will truly understand that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic western and a classic buddy movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may be most famous for its Bolivian Army Ending but there is a fine film before its iconic end. The eponymous Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are a pair of outlaws who specialise in robbing banks in the American west along with their 'Hole in the Wall' gang. One day a member of the gang tries to usurp Butch's leadership of the gang and suggests that they should rob a train... twice; once on the outward journey once on the return! He is quickly put in his place but Butch and Sundance go ahead with the plan. All goes well until the second robbery; far from being unexpected as thought, the owner of the railroad has sent a second train behind the first and it is carrying a group of men that includes the toughest lawman and the best tracker in the country. The outlaws split up but those in pursuit stick with Butch and Sundance; following them through the night, across rocky terrain and up mountains. They only lose them when they jump from a cliff into a swirling torrent! After collecting Sundance's girlfriend Etta they head east to New York before catching a ship to Bolivia where Butch is convinced they will prosper. As it turns out life there is little different from what it was in America with the exception of the fact that here they don't speak the language and need Etta to help them. Inevitably they are cornered and Butch suggests they try Australia next!This film is rightfully considered a classic; Paul Newman and Robert Redford are great as Butch and Sundance; and more importantly they work well together. Katherine Ross puts in a solid performance as Etta although her role is obviously much smaller. The action is gripping, especially in to prolonged chase scene... that might not have been dramatic but the way their pursuers couldn't be shaken led to a feeling that a deadly confrontation would be inevitable. I was surprised at just how much humour was to be found in the film; and thankfully it didn't feel forced; particularly funny moments include the scenes where Butch fights the man trying to take over his gang and the later scene where they confront another gang in Bolivia with very limited knowledge of the language! All this adds up to make a classic western and a classic buddy movie; something that all film lovers should watch at least once... although I suspect most will want to watch it more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves its reputation as a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the special posse of experts is finally formed and is pursuing them too well, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) move their bank robbing business to South America accompanied by the Kid's girlfriend, Etta (Katharine Ross).This was the breakout role for Robert Redford's movie career (Redford named the "Sundance Institute" and the annual "Sundance Film Festival" that he founded in honor of this effect). While some respected critics, e.g., Roger Ebert &amp; many others (see the 50% ratings of 'rotten' by 'top critics' reviews of this film on "Rotten Tomatoes") regard this movie as overdone or only "so-so," or "not western enough," most viewers find it still greatly entertaining and interesting. I agree with the majority: it remains remarkably fresh and fun. There's so much clever banter throughout between the two stars, it borders on comedy (so much we become oblivious to the scores of people we see killed during the story's unfolding). Its Oscar winning screenplay very much draws on actual people and events (but please see Wikipedia's article on Butch Cassidy for how closely the movie mirrors reality). The actual lives and activities of Butch &amp; the Sundance Kid are almost over the top--and so is this movie, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I'm not a Western fan, but this film is an exception. The tale of Butch Cassidy and his gang is a well-know story of the days of yester- year. Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the titular characters are a real treat to watch on-screen in their first team-up. The humor in the film makes you almost forget that these two men are "fierce" thieves. This film is a ride through the history of Cassidy and Sundance's criminal career packed with comedy, drama and two great stars who only did two films together, but made the most of their time. If you're a Western fan then check this film out and be prepared for a good time.</fullReview>

Butch is the leader of the Hole-in-the-Wall gang. They are train robbers. I think we met them earlier in Cat Ballou. Butch and the Kid end up in Bolivia, and that is why I resurrected this movie, because I am going to Bolivia for a star party in the Andes. Katherine Ross (a Natalie Wood look-alike) is the Kid's girl. Of course, both men want her. The bicycle scene is memorable, and the gambling scene is cool. The story is set in 1910. Burt Bacharach's song, "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" is showcased and takes us back to an era when Top 40 was king.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most likable criminal couple in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How is it possible that when people hear the word 'western' they immediately think of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Well, there are exactly THAT many reasons for this interesting phenomena. Firstly, the stunning directing by George Robert Hill makes it look like an exactly archetypal movie in this specific category. It easily became a smash hit at the box-office in the United States in 1969 and went on to create a major fan base all over the world.Secondly, it offers a spellbinding storyline provided by the great William Goldman. It's packed with everything that can be connected with this most American of all genres: genuine characters, grand wild west feeling, gunfights, train robberies, pretty dames, dangerous enemies, gangs, chases, great adventures, a little romance, a little comedy, etc. Additionally, all the clever dialogues make the movie much more pleasurable and engaging.Thirdly, the cinematography is really incredible, offering the most captivating views of Western American and Bolivian landscapes, which the viewer is able to admire right from the beginning up till the very end. Also, the fantastic shifts in takes from sepia to color in some of the most climatic scenes create a perfect atmosphere.Fourthly, I believe that I didn't mention the two stars, the most memorable couple of gunslingers, train robbers and lawbreakers that ever roamed through the vast American desserts ? Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). Based on a real-life pair of criminals, their story is partly true and partly imagined. On the run from the law, the boys decide to hide in Bolivia and start a new career there. Along comes Etta Place (Katharine Ross), Kid's girlfriend. They try to learn Spanish in order to be able to rob banks, but what comes out of this farce looks more like a comedy than serious business. After a series of successes and some misfortunes, they are finally wanted all over the country, like they were in their homeland. In the most gripping, and unforgettable final scene they have to fight with tens of policemen and even though the viewers knows that they are criminal and, thus, should be caught or killed, the way they are portrayed makes it easy to admire those two up-to-no-good characters.Surprisingly, the scene, which stayed in my memory for the longest time, wasn't this one or any other of the fast-action sort ? it was the one when Butch was riding on a bike with Etta (accompanied by a beautiful song 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'), like they were two innocent kids, strolling around farms, as if nothing really mattered.All of those factors make this movie look special. I won't be original when I say that this is probably one of my favorite western of them all, but that's the truth. No one can deny that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kind will go down in history as one of the finest, most entertaining, and most achieved movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to ignore the classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a classic that must not be ignored. Anyone who likes movies has to see Butch Cassidy at some point in their lives. The movie itself is great movie. The movie is entertaining and at some points romantic. The love story among Newman, Redford, and Katharine Ross is enthralling. One man loving the woman sexually and the other emotionally is a love story as old as time and contributes to the movie being a classic. Although a little boring at some points, Butch Cassidy is a great movie, and the ending scene in which the two bank robbers are cornered at decide to go out in a blaze of gunfire is one of the best scenes in movie history. Overall, Butch Cassidy is not the best movie ever made and at times a little slow but it is one of the best of the classics and must be watched by all movie enthusiasts. A great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman's Best Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy" could possibly be Paul Newman's best movie ever. The action scenes could have been better, and I could do without "Raindrops" and I don't think the movie would suffer at all without it, but you could find a hundred films where music (or dialogue) that doesn't match the period or genre is used. A great example of this would be the final scene in "Dirty Dancing." The filmmakers are asking you to suspend reality, go with it! This is just a great "buddy" movie. Newman and Redford being the ultimate buddies. It's a lot of fun, without the cheesy happy Hollywood ending that we would get if this were made today.Although today, somehow Butch and Sundance would have survived to make the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid several times, it is difficult to say what I like best about the movie. At times it has been the hilarious dialogue, while other times it has been the well-executed gun fights (and brawls). Upon my most recent viewing, I found myself most caught up in the cinematography and the content of the shots. The cinematography is certainly good, but I don't think it is notably stunning. Still, the landscape shots are particularly beautiful and tend to somehow complement the sense of camaraderie between the two protagonists. Speaking of the main characters, Paul Newman and Robert Redford delivery a great performance as a duo, playing off each others highs and lows perfectly, building intensity in their relationship on screen until the final, epic still.</fullReview>

The shot of the special army coming out of the train was great how they were Ble to make the scene. As a new Hollywood era film the bad buys were highlighted and though they die in the end they are cavorts throughout.

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a story about the characters themselves. There isn't much focus on the plot, but mostly the characters and the light-hearted mood. The whole story is about the unique relationship between Butch and Sundance. They always keep their sense of humor even when faced with death. They laugh when they know they're being chased and mocked. It doesn't seem they take anyone or anything serious. They even share girlfriends and this shows that they do not have any real affection for anyone. Their dynamic relationship allows them to know what one another is thinking. An example is during the end when Butch yells "Australia" before Sundance can ask him the question. The film is also a type of "growing awareness" film. They are slowly realizing that banks are what they used to be and their job is getting more difficult. Butch Cassidy: What happened to the old bank? It was beautiful. Guard: People kept robbing it. Butch Cassidy: Small price to pay for beauty. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the great buddy movies of all time. It's a great all around film filled with everlasting humor, drama and action. It's impossible not to like the two characters that lead this film from the very beginning. This film makes me want to have a friendship like they have. There is much to enjoy about this film; the story, the period, the cinematography, the score and especially the characters. The true driving force of this film is the dialogue which is owed to the leading actors and the screenwriter. The two leads are very much alike on the inside but on the outside they bare some differences that make them very dynamic. Sundance is a more traditional western character that uses his gun skills to solve problems while Butch is more optimistic and uses his ideas to get away. "You just keep thinking Butch, that's what you're good at." Their sense of humor is always on the same page, however. They always remain to laugh and give each other a hard time, even when faced with death. In the finale, as they both lay bloody and out of breath, they still manage to ridicule each other. "Is that what you call giving cover?" "Is that what you call running?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best westerns of ALL TIME. When it originally was released, Roger Ebert was one of the few who hated it, even as to compare it to "Bonnie and Clyde". Now, I do acknowledge that the prior mentioned film is historically relevant because it sparked the end of the former Production Code and made violence 'cool', as well as popularized the French New Wave style of film making, but I didn't really care for that one. I'm all for romanticizing the so-called villains of history, but the tone in that film was way too hyperactive. One minute it was grueling violence, another it was comedic. All of a sudden you hear that comedic theme as they make their get-away. The reason I find this film superior is that tone is consistent, and the darker nature of it is much more subtle. For example, Katherine Ross' character, among others, constantly reminds our titular duo that their age of prosperity is over, though they never really seem to except it.Paul Newman is forever iconic as Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford no less as the Sundance Kid. The film's strongest aspect is the close relationship between these friends, and the tremendous acting really exemplifies this throughout. It'd be insane to try and count how many films have attempted to mimic this glorious and unbeatable chemistry between the duo, and on the opposite end just how many have failed miserably. The comedic nature of most of their dialogue is fitting and just so memorable, I dare to watch the film and not walk away quoting it. Like the sequence where the train robbery goes wrong and that haunting pursuit begins. Of course, there is that hilarious exchange with the assistant Woodcock (George Furth), but it leads up to one of my favorite series of lines between Newman and Redford; "How many are following us?""All of 'em." "All of 'em? What's the matter with those guys?" I love how the pursuit was shot if you ask me, makes it feel much more personal and foreboding. Not to mention you get to see more of the glorious cinematography of Conrad L. Hall which captures the Western feel quite nicely. And oh yeah, this film is one of the few to pull off an anachronistic score so well. Before "Spiderman 2" or "Clerks 2", let be known this film made use of that oh so familiar song, and in the best way too.A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more original and entertaining movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this is a great movie because it is being very unique and fresh with is approach. It's hard to describe this movie really. It's stuck somewhere between being a typical old fashioned western and a more modern one, while taking a very adventurous and entertaining approach to it all.Even though the western genre was still very popular at the time and also very much alive, this movie yet feels the need to look back at it and pay tribute, as if the genre had long been gone already. Really, I see this movie as an homage to the '60's westerns and it uses all of its very typical ingredients and even pokes some fun at it, without making the movie a parody of the genre. A real accomplishment, since you actually can really still take this movie as a comedy.But it however is more being a comedy because of how entertaining it is with its story and characters and not because it is filled with some slapstick or moments that will make you laugh out loud. It's more subtle than that, which helps to make the movie work out as a throughout entertaining one and a very pleasant watch.The movie mostly is being so fun and entertaining to watch, due to its two main characters, played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford. They are a great screen duo and portray some very memorable characters, with a great chemistry together. Besides, their acting is really great as well obviously. Especially Newman shines, like he basically always did, in every role he played in the '60's.It's also being a real adventure movie with its story, that takes you to a lot of places, while the two main characters are being on the run. During their journey they come across a bunch of different characters, while also still trying to make some money as well. Most western are of course more or less being like this but this one definitely all takes it a step further. It's actually being more of an adventure movie than a western, so even when you really aren't that big on westerns, you could still definitely enjoy this movie.It's a pleasantly directed movie, with a nice fresh and original approach to it. Visually there is also very little wrong with the movie. It has a great style all throughout, which really reminds you of the '60's western genre, while the movie at the same time still manages to feel like a much more modern movie as well, with a great and unique musical score by Burt Bacharach and a very young Sam Elliott in it too. It actually was his very first movie role and it perhaps isn't a coincidence that it is in a western.Simply one very entertaining movie!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman is the amiable 'Butch Cassidy', and Robert Redford is the solitary 'Sundance Kid'. Following the true story of the west's most successful outlaws, this movie ranks with 'The Searchers' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' as one of the best of its genre. It is funny, entertaining, and although it does have brilliant action sequences, it is not overly packed, like many westerns. When the law begins to catch up with them using the new Pinkerton Agency, Butch and Sundance must travel to Bolivia with Sundance's girlfriend: Etta Place (Katherine Ross). This superbly lively and emotional western has gained a rightly deserved reputation for its comic and artistic effects. For those that find John Wayne too boring and Clint Eastwood too gritty, this is the perfect film. George Roy Hill's greatest success, this film will forever live as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who ARE Those Guys?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of things that make BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID one of the greatest Western films of all times. Take a solid screenplay by William Goldman, put in a great director like George Roy Hill, and pair Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the two titular characters, and the end result is a hugely entertaining and witty adventure that takes us from the high plains of the West to the out-of-the-way jungles of Bolivia.Admittedly the details about the real-life late 19th century outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and their Hole-In-The-Wall gang are softened for purposes of entertainment (the real-life participants were among the most notorious badmen in the history of the Old West), but it is quite a thing to see Newman and Redford get away with so much because we can't help but like them. And when the Union Pacific railroad sends a posse after them following the blowing up of a payroll train, we fear for their lives (as they keep asking themselves "Who ARE those guys?!"). The two men and their schoolteacher love interest Etta Place (Katharine Ross) hightail it down to Bolivia to continue their outlaw ways; but soon, they become wanted men again as "Bandidos Yanquis." Attempts by Newman and Redford to "go straight" by getting into the employ of an eccentric payroll master (the always-colorful Strother Martin) don't go as planned; and then it all comes down to a standoff in a small Bolivian town.BUTCH CASSIDY was released in the same year (1969) as three other radically different Westerns: the more traditional John Wayne-led, Henry Hathaway-directed TRUE GRIT; Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH; and Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Although not anywhere near as violent as Peckinpah's, nor as surreal as Leone's, this film is still much more cynical than TRUE GRIT, since, like Peckinpah's film, it mourns the loss of the Old West, as progress and road agents are now strangling a once-limitless frontier and forcing outlaws and renegades south. And like Leone, it also shows even the railroad becoming more corporatized as the 20th century dawns. All of this is happening, even as Burt Bacharach's score (complete with "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head") plays on, and we see Butch and Sundance getting away with a whole lot of money and a whole lot of schemes. At the same time, however, after being told by an ornery sheriff (Jeff Corey), "Your times is over! Don't you get it?!", they realize that they are probably not going to live much longer.As a result, BUTCH CASSIDY, for all the fun it shows us, is every bit as fatalistic as Leone's and Peckinpah's radical restructurings of the Western myths. And yet it is this dichotomy that makes the film such an enduring film of its genre, with Newman and Redford perfectly matched (as they would be again, and with Hill directing, in 1973 for THE STING), and superb cinematography by Conrad Hall. Nobody should miss this film, especially when it comes to being a fan of that most American of film genres, the Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid the way it was meant to be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid(1969) has long been one of my favorite films. The combination of great photography of amazing landscapes, a brilliantly witty and charming script by William Goldman and outstanding performances by two of the great leading men in the history of American cinema make the film one of the most watchable and most enjoyable pictures I'm sure I will ever see. I had watched the film at least half a dozen times but upon learning that the film would be screened in Albany's Palace Theatre as part of SEFCU's Classic Movie Series I leapt at the chance to see Butch, Sundance and Etta on the big screen in a beautifully designed local landmark. It was an amazing experience, complete with the old fashioned "Let's go out to the lobby" cartoons and scratches and blotches on the over 40 year old film stock this was the genuine article and it felt as if I had traveled back in time for two hours. A great film and a great experience and I'd encourage anyone to see Butch Cassidy or any other classic film on the silver screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is an epic western. These two badass train/bank thieves strive to disappear from the face of the law, but the law won't let them. This movie was a beautiful work of art. So intelligently made. The movie had excellent cinematography, and the gratuitous violence was so loose, so flexible it had "New Hollywood" written all over it. The movies shot compositions were very creatively explored throughout the film. One of the best scenes is when Butch and Sundance Kid encounter Bolivian Indians who are trying to steal their money, the shootout is epic. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, I also loved the scene where Butch and Sundance's girl ride bikes together with the music playing in the background. It was intimate and so creative. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Just like the old days"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the old Hollywood production code was abandoned in 1967 it wasn't just sex, violence and profanity that started appearing on cinema screens. For the first time since the early 1930s you could get away with making criminals the good guys. One of the nicest products of this new era of liberty was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a Western very much of its time in style and values, and yet one so warmly human and respectful to genre convention you feel it was aching to be made all along.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is first of all a superbly written screenplay. What is striking is how witty it is from start to finish, enough to arguably classify it as a comedy Western. But this is far from being a Blazing Saddles-style spoof. The humour is very natural, and largely serves to make the characters instantly likable. A great example is the early scene in which Butch is challenged by Logan, and Butch uses his intelligence and his sense of humour to overcome his opponent, whereby from then on we admire and route for the guy. Another great aspect of the picture is how the two main characters are opposites who complement each other. The easygoing amiable Butch and the prickly, cynical Sundance are like a gentler version of the brains and brawn dynamic of many criminal duos both real and fictional.It may seem obvious now, but it was only after a lengthy selection process that Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as the eponymous heroes. But just like the written characters, this pair have a great rapport and complementary styles. Newman has such presence and charisma that, even though his character actually makes a lot of bad judgements throughout the picture, he still has the air of man people will look up to and follow. Redford handles the difficult balance of bringing out Sundance's curmudgeonly manner but giving us the impression that it's all a front and he is a nice guy deep down. Above all they both make their performances look effortless, so that although these are obviously heavily idealised portrayals of the real historical figures, we believe in them as genuine people.This was the picture in which ace director George Roy Hill really hit his stride. He often uses camera set-ups that may seem against cinematic convention but help to focus us purely on what is important. Take the sepia-toned sequence after the opening credits. We start with a very odd shot of Paul Newman walking through a town which, rather than show him in a more normal wide-shot showing off the whole street, frames him in mid-close-up. We then get a lengthy shot of Redford framed similarly whilst the gambler he is talking to has his back to us. What these shots do is draw us in completely on these two characters for their introduction scene, without distracting us with the faces of anyone who is inconsequential to the story. However, after these opening few shots we move to the wider group shots and landscapes that let us know we are in familiar Western territory. There are some other neat touches from Hill in the chase scenes that form the climax of the first half of the picture. He keeps the pursuing lawmen in long-shot, never allowing us to get a proper glimpse of them, which makes them a depersonalised presence, and puts us constantly in the place of heroes. Also rather than cutting back and forth as many chase sequences do, he has several set-ups in which both hunter and hunted are together in the same shot (very difficult to organise over such great distances), which gives a very realistic sense of the pursuit.The icing on the cake is surely the music. Not just the Burt Bacharach tunes, at turns achingly sad or wonderfully jaunty, but the way they are used. The central montage of sepia photos has a beautiful sense of nostalgia to it, and the fact that these "good times" are presented in a way that is somewhat distant and abstract gives them a tone of poignancy when compared to the bad times that are to come in Bolivia. These good old days are dead and gone, the montage seems to say. Of course Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head is a tad anachronistic but it suits the tone of the bike ride sequence perfectly. Touches like this, the occasional nods to the nouvelle vague and the modern-sounding score, along with the carefree ethos, make Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid very much a movie of its time. And yet, it does not have the pretentiousness or downright weirdness of so many late-60s cinema, and with its good-natured charm it is in fact one of the most accessible and enduring pieces of its era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know there are people who love or don't like this film, but I am one of those who loves it. It is a different kind of western, but in my mind, that is not a bad thing, quite the contrary. I loved the first ten minutes, that was very clever and refreshing. The cinematography is fabulous, doing perfect justice to the beautiful scenery. The score is suitably jaunty, and the Raindrops Falling on My Head interlude is a wonderful touch and quite moving come to think of it. The script is witty and infectious, not to mention memorable, and the direction and pace I had no problem with either. Robert Redford and especially Paul Newman are perfect as the charismatic outlaws and their chemistry is simply unforgettable. All in all, just a great movie and one of my favourites of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

To me, it represents a wonderful example of the potential of human relationships. No anxiety, no possession, just a free, happy trio. The bicycle scene is one of the greatest scenes in film, and I've always thought so. You either get it or don't. Very little scenes in anything convey a feeling of freedom and happiness the way that one does. The dialog is great/hilarious. So many quotable lines. One of my favorite westerns.

		<shortDescription>What's so great about this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't often feel a need to review a movie - especially when it's one that I didn't like much. But since this movie is so famous and so highly regarded, and since I found it to be such a mediocre film, I had to voice my opinion. If you're like me, you'll want to skip this movie.After years of putting it off, I finally saw this movie the other day. I could not believe that what I saw is considered a classic and a "must see" film. OK, so I know it has some pretty good lines and scenes, and it has some iconic actors, and the screenwriter has a pretty impressive list of films he's done before. But there's a lot more to making a good movie than just having famous people work on it. And in my opinion, this is a very boring movie.Whenever I watch a movie that I consider boring, it's usually because I don't care about the characters or the story, and when that happens, it's the screenwriter's fault. William Goldman wrote one of my favorite movies, the Princess Bride. That had a great story and some really great characters. And for the most part, it was done with relatively unknown actors.This film, however, had some very famous actors and was about some very famous actual historical characters. I love stories about the Old West, and I really should have enjoyed this movie. Instead, it was very hard for me to watch this film. I fast-forwarded through many parts of it just to finally get through it.The "raindrops" scene with Newman and Ross on a bicycle was completely out of place. How does a late 1960's pop song have anything at all to do with Butch Cassidy? This scene is horrible. It added absolutely nothing at all to the film. We already know Katharine Ross's character has relationships with both of the title characters. The bicycle scene was totally unnecessary, and I can't imagine why that wasn't cut out of the movie entirely. Even if you watch it on 2X, you'll still waste 5 minutes waiting for the scene to end.There's another scene when they're traveling to Bolivia. This takes forever as well. Do we really need to see the sepia-toned pictures of these actors making their way down to Bolivia? I don't think so. It certainly doesn't have to be as long as it was, either. I hate it when screenwriters don't give the audience enough credit. We all know how far away Bolivia is. We don't need to see 12 minutes of footage to know it took a really long time for them to make it there.Finally, a word about the acting. Newman, Redford and Ross have done some great work in other movies. In this one, though, I'm not sure they were necessary at all. Just about anyone could have done just as well as they did. I didn't see any reason at all that they were needed for this film to work.My advice to you is to skip this movie. It is terribly overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was immediately taken with this film when I saw the transition from the sepia tone to standard color. Cassidy and the Kid form a perfect comedic combination but don't shy away from being classic western bad-asses. their chemistry works excellently and it's clear why they are one of the great big screen partnerships. The montage in the middle of the film, showing the pair's journey to Bolivia with Etta, is done quite well using only pictures which each image looking authentic and iconic. The film is shot in a retrospective style, making the work seem like a story or tale. The end of this tale is represented perfectly in the frozen image of the duo rushing out of their cover, which fades to the sepia tone and closes their legend in iconic fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody know this is a clever, anachronistic piece of commercial of offal, written by a wise guy and directed by a man of no artistic pretensions whatever, but after more than forty years this remains a charming comedy of two roguish and uber-handsome outlaws in the Old West.Newman is Butch Cassidy as Peck's bad boy, always leading the taciturn gun-slinging Redford, as the Sundance Kid, astray. Together, they have the sensibilities of Harpo Marx. It's "based on a true story," meaning half of it is made up. Katherine Ross as the real-life beauty, Etta Place, is pleasant to look at but seems here chiefly to prove that Butch and Sundance aren't queer, since she has little to do but undress and make predictions of doom.Some of the gags are clunkers ("Man, I got vision --") while others are pretty good ("This may be the garden spot of Bolivia --"), but that's true of most comedies.It was filmed all over the place and the location shooting and photography by Conrad Hall are exceptional. I imagine the long-distance shots during the pursuit were filmed in Mexico because it's getting more difficult to find sweeping panoramas of hills and mountains in a country that is now approaching a perfect state of urbanization, or rather suburbanization. One shivers with agoraphobia when he can look for miles in any direction and not see a telephone pole or a pall of smog or a Gold's Gym.Let's see. This was released in 1969. The year before, "The Wild Bunch" had scored a big hit at the box office, so we have a thoroughly misplaced scene of slow-motion death here. (I blame Akira Kurosawa for starting the whole wretched business in "Seven Samurai.") Of course "The Wild Bunch" led to a host of imitations, but so did "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." How many semi-comic buddy action movies followed? I have counted them. There were four hundred and forty-two imitations, not counting those in Urdu. I mention "Lethal Weapon" only in passing.Here's another thing, propelled strictly by commercial considerations, that was imitated. Burt Bacharach's original score was contemporary, diverse, and colorful -- waltzes, polkas, rag time, a gallop, a successful pop tune. I always felt that Burt Bacharach's popular music during the late 1960s was inventive and surprising, a nice alternative to The Beatles, whom I enjoyed immensely. Of course Burt Bacharach's songs and movie scores were always middle-class but his talents seem to fit this film because nobody in it -- not Newman, Redford, or Ross -- sounds like anything other than middle class themselves.Anyway, it's a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the plot is conventional, but the talents of Newman, Redford, and Hill combined make it stand out above many of its fellow Westerns and earn it its place as a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contained within the running time of George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the greatest classic moments in the Western movie genre. The two titular characters (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) are trapped between a sheer drop into a river and a 'super-posse' of the best trackers, sharpshooters, and lawmen money can hire. One wants to take his chances jumping into the river, the other wants to shoot it out with the posse and they bicker with each other like an old married couple, partially forgetting about the bounty hunters coming up behind them.That's just one example of many classic moments in this memorable Western: a slightly fictionalized retelling of the true story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the two leaders of the Hole in the Wall outlaw gang that gained notable notoriety during the 19th century and into the early 20th century as they robbed trains and banks, fled from lawmen, tried to evade captured by fleeing to Bolivia, and just finding themselves wrapped up in the same mess again. Not very much is known about the personalities of the real Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, but Newman and Redford's performances bring to life two of the most memorable characters in film history.Basically, we Butch, who is the brains of the outfit. He plots, his scams, he comes up with the wildest ideas to get out of their seemingly never-ending predicaments. He's also quite pacifistic, having never shot anybody before. And then there's Sundance, who is just the opposite. Quick on the draw, bulls-eye with the aim, pessimistic, ready to fight any day. There is no moment of true friendship seen between the two of them and we can't imagine how there ever could have been since they are constantly being locked up in arguments about what methods of escape they should take next. They seem attached to each other simply by the fact that they were the two more infamous outlaws of the time and had scrambled their way out of countless scenarios.We have two really good actors under the command of a really good director and they are what really makes this movie work. The plot: it's nothing special. Just the basic, outlaws-on-the-run conventional tale but the talents of these three men make it work above others. There is also director Hill's effective blending between moments of silence and serenity and constant, ominous brooding omens of the worst kind. Such as the rumbling, storm-like sound effects used for the approach of the 'super-posse', which really heighten the efficacy of their presence since we seldom see them up close.It's also a very well blend of action, adventure, humor, drama, and comedy all into one motion picture. No, it's not perfect and there are a few elements and scenes in the film that I am not in favor of, such as this sequence where nothing is shown on screen except a slide-show of photographs that really overstays its welcome at least for me. But putting these minor complaints aside, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a well-crafted Western and it continues to stand out as one of the most beloved classics of all time and it features one of the most exhilarating final gunfights I've ever seen.</fullReview>

After a relentless posse is formed to track them down, Butch and Sundance are constantly on the run eventually flushed to Bolivia where they attempt to continue their wistful ways. The cinematography is breathtaking at times although i thought the scenes from Bolivia were somewhat poor. This box-office hit won two Oscars, one by David Goldman for his script writing and the other by Burt Bacarach and Hal David for the movies theme song "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head". Katherine Ross also plays the part of Sundances beautiful girlfriend Etta Pace. If you are a Newman and Redford fan this is a must see!

		<fullReview>Two American bank robbers head for Bolivia to evade capture, in this George Roy Hill directed Western, based on real-life events. I have never understood the appeal of this film. Its plot is boring for the most part, although it does pick up in the second half.Maybe Butch (Paul Newman) and the "Kid" (Robert Redford) charm viewers with their roguish and outlaw attitudes and behavior, so that they, in effect, become the story. Maybe the appeal is their spirit of teamwork. Or maybe it's because the two are so photogenic. In any event, the plot's slow pace could have been improved if the film had been only about seventy or eighty minutes. As is, it's stretched out to 110 minutes with what seems to me to be lots of filler, especially in the first half.The color cinematography is dark, so dark I could hardly see the images at times. So much of the plot happens at night. The scenery might have been beautiful ... if I could have seen it. And I don't care for all those photographic stills; I find them distracting and jarring.This film certainly gets great reviews from others. That's fine. My preference in Westerns would be "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "For A Few Dollars More".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman and Robert Redford star as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, two notorious outlaws who strive to maintain power during times of social change, in a film that was extremely successful upon first release in 1969. As the film first opened, I was expected a western masterpiece, as the tensions were strong, the action was exciting, and there was some fun humor throughout, especially in the sequence where Butch and Sundance have to jump off a cliff. But when the characters go to Bolivia, the film starts to go downhill pretty fast. The pacing starts to drag heavily, the tension is poor, the score gets to be painfully annoying, the action sequences become tiresome and repetitive, and the worst part, the final act is weak and extremely disappointing, making me wonder why a film like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is regarded as a classic in the first place. I do give it credit, however, for its great performances from Paul Newman and Robert Redford, its wondrous Oscar winning cinematography, and that awesome song "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head", but other than that, this film is a misfire, in my book.</fullReview>

Paul Newman is what makes this movie work. Newman is more charming and charismatic then any other actor in any role and single handedly makes this film special. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid would have been nothing more than your typical western without Newman but with him it becomes one of the more memorable Westerns of our time. Redford does well as the level-headed Sundance, yet without Newman his role would have just been forgettableThe theme song "Raindrops Keep Falling on my head" is one of the worst songs ever written. As far as the action scenes or the buddy scenes or the robbery scenes or the endless violence, all of this has been done a thousand times and nothing about this movie is all that special.

		<fullReview>For something different from a normal review, I went through a "William Goldman" phase in the early 1970s. He wrote a lot of great novels and (sometimes related) screenplays. Most of them were compelling page-turners.Anyway, as to this movie, I think I saw it in around 1970-71, a year or two later after it appeared in theaters. (I saw very few current releases in theaters at that time. $$$) I had just entered college and a lot of movies I had missed in the late 60s were suddenly available. (And around that time I saw the c. 1940 classic "Citizen Kane." Before cable or satellite or Netflix, this is how many of us saw these classics. Often in rooms with projectors set up and us sitting on the floor.)In the era of MASH, a great film. I agree with many that the 1970s was a golden era of movies. Too many to start name and 2001, a great film.However, sometimes things were weird. I think one of the first independent films I saw when I arrived in college in 1970 was "The End of the Road," with Stacy Keach. Wow. was this a trip on the dark side!--Tim May, California</fullReview>

But as far as plot goes, it is nothing new.What makes this movie stand out to me, is how unusually it is structured.

The cinematography is enthralling and so is the tight screen writing.One can feel for the fallen heroes of their kind without necessarily eulogizing them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Film that keeps you guessing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect to be so enthralled with excitement in this film. The title of this film doesn't make it quite clear what you are supposed to be expecting out of it. I was very surprised to see that this film was a thriller and one that kept me guessing in fact. The cinematography in addition to the quick edits made in the editing process after shooting only helped to keep my interest throughout. The sound also helped to intensify the tense moments when you weren't too sure whether the main characters were going to make it. I would recommenced this film to anyone who is looking for a great movie that will keep you guessing and an ending that you will not expect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Line Summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy) and Robert Redford (Sundance Kid) go on quite the adventures with their no good actions. Days on days the two rob banks and do so much damage they move to a different country. They bring along Katharine Ross (Etta Place) as their undercover. The two of them (sometimes with Etta's help) ended up doing a lot of damage, but they got worse damage in the end.Since this film is based on a true story the theme would be to not take what doesn't belong to you. We always want what we can't have and sometimes more of it. When we repeat the same actions over and over (stealing) we will eventually pay the consequences. Sometimes worse later on if we keep acting on poor decision making. Butch and Sundance Kid traveled long a far to escape their "consequences". They didn't want to fess up to their actions and it was thrill for them to get away with it. The two went through great lengths to escape their troubles and always were one step ahead of their enemy. Butch and Sundance Kid were not all that worried of getting caught. They knew they were the two most wanted men, other than that they just went about their days like everyone else. Butch and Sundance Kid only looked out for one another and would cover for each other. Their relationship was very secluded with just the two of them. They may have had "other" friends in the "whole in the wall gang" but the two of them were the leaders that stuck together through and through. The angles throughout the film pay close attention to their "escaping segments". They literally show the highs and lows and in between. As a viewer you see them rock climbing, jumping off the rocks into a flowing river which gives you a more than actual feeling of being there because on the angle that scene focuses on all together. The lighting in this seen is surprisingly bright and sunny. Figuring they have been on a horse, their own two , feet for days it was like a free moment for them just to jump and cool off and just got with the flow (no pun intended). Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid teaches you a lot more than just how to escape after stealing, it teaches you consequences, respect, and vulnerability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely witty and relentlessly entertaining Western comedy-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by the illegal escapades of the two most famous members of the Wild Bunch, this is an extremely witty and relentlessly entertaining Western comedy-drama. The superb script by William Goldman is full of marvellous dialogue and deservedly won him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. As strong as it is, however, I think that the first half is marginally better than the second. The director George Roy Hill handles the material with a huge amount of energy and flair and he made wonderful use of the locations offered by Utah, Mexico and New Mexico. It is a beautiful looking, stylish film with great cinematography by Conrad Hall. Although the film is based on fact to some degree, it is fictionalised in many places and I am sure that the real Butch and Sundance had quite a few more rough edges than their counterparts. However, any and all liberties that Goldman took with the facts worked in the context of the film. I loved the decision to begin the film with an imitation of silent Westerns while the sepia-tinged opening scene was another great tribute to the filmmaking techniques of days gone by. With the exception of "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" by Hal David and Burt Bacharach, there is comparatively little music in the film, which was an interesting choice but one that worked well. The film stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford in a pair of wonderful and effortlessly charismatic performances as the titular outlaws. Their chemistry is electrifying and it is a terrible shame that they only made one more film together, namely the even better "The Sting" which was likewise directed by Hill, as I have seldom seen an on- screen duo who worked better together. I don't know how well they knew each other when they made this film but they click so perfectly that it would be difficult to imagine it working, at least to the same extent, if one or both of them had not been cast. They have a great deal of charm and, even if you're an actor, that is difficult to fake. Of the two, Newman is perhaps the stronger but that may be because he has a marginally more interesting role. Butch, whose real name was the less catchy Robert LeRoy Parker, is depicted as being a warm, affable, eternally optimistic and fiercely intelligent smooth operator with a tendency to plan at least two or three moves ahead. Conversely, Sundance - whose real name of Harry Longabaugh would later be used by Goldman as a pen name - is considerably more laconic, pessimistic and openly cynical than his partner in crime. They have a very interesting relationship as they often snipe at each other but their bickering has a solid foundation in friendship. Each will always have the other's back. In fact, each is probably the best friend that the other ever had. There are times when Sundance looks like he wants to shoot Butch but there is a real sense that he would follow him to Hell and back. Speaking of Sundance, Goldman was not the only one to use his name in later life as Redford founded the Sundance Film Festival in Utah in 1978.The scenes depicting Butch and Sundance's attempt to evade the six man posse are some of the very best in large part because the focus is squarely on the two male leads, giving them a great opportunity to exhibit their easy chemistry. In fact, if the writing had been of the same standard, I'd have been perfectly happy for the remaining hour of the film to consist entirely of nothing but Newman and Redford's banter, though immediately that would not have been very cinematic. The finale in which they are cornered by the Bolivian Army is another highlight. I particularly loved the moment when Butch tells Sundance that they should relocate to Australia in order to continue their criminal careers even though it is obvious that neither of them have much chance of making it nine feet, let alone 9,000 miles. As the exact circumstances of Butch and Sundance's deaths have never been definitively established, an urban legend has arisen that the two men survived and returned to the United States. In an episode of "In Search Of..." in 1978, the former's much younger sister Lula Parker Bettenson claimed that he came home to Utah and eventually died in 1937 but she refused to disclose where he had been buried. Nothing of this sort has come to light concerning Sundance's supposed later life but, in any event, the evidence of either man surviving that fateful day in Bolivia in 1908 is less than conclusive, to put it mildly.The female lead Katherine Ross is rather boring as Sundance's long- time girlfriend Etta Place but that's okay since, in spite the fact that she is the third most important cast member, her role is not all that crucial to the film. One of Etta's most interesting moments is when she wonders in a wistful tone whether she would have gotten together with Butch if she had met him before Sundance. This suggests that she may have feelings for him but that she remains with Sundance either out of loyalty or because her feelings for him are simply stronger than her ones for Butch. Strother Martin has barely five minute screen time but he is probably the third most entertaining cast member as the self-described "colourful" mine boss Percy Garris, who gives Butch and Sundance a job when they try to go straight. The film also features nice appearances from Jeff Corey, George Furth, Cloris Leachman, Don Keefer, Kenneth Mars and Ted Cassidy in a rare role outside of the sci-fi, horror and fantasy genres.Overall, this is a hugely entertaining, thrilling film which has given me the impetus to check out more Westerns, which is certainly the Hollywood genre with which I am least familiar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally loved this movie. As a kid watching this I thought it was a great movie and was one of my favorites. Now watching it again years later I have come to appreciate it even more. The acting is just flat out superb throughout the movie. Robert Redford (The Sundance Kid) and Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy) play their roles so well and show the real companionship of their characters. They integrate a funny yet serious role throughout the movie. One of my favorite scenes was when they were trying to decide who would jump off the cliff first. Sundance is telling Butch that he can't swim but rather than telling him it would be alright he says that the fall would probably kill him and then they both jump at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a treat this film turned out to be! First of all, credit must be given to the tremendous on-screen duo, Robert Redford and Paul Newman! Their chemistry was top notch, and a complete joy to watch from scene to scene. Now, to the film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid allows the audience to be a part of the Hole in the Wall gang, led by Butch Cassidy. Paul Newman's Butch comes through the screen as a fun- loving ham of a mischief maker in the Old West. He has no problem leading his gang of outlaws through bank holdups and train robberies, and he does so with ease given his disposition. What a performance from Paul Newman! His good-humored outlaw tops the critic's charts of performances, and I see why. Just watching his character makes the audience want to jump in and holster up for he and his gang. And where there is Butch Cassidy, you will also find the Sundance Kid. Butch's right hand man, Robert Redford's Sundance Kid is a stoic man's man, a perfect partner to Butch. Sundance is charged with keeping Butch's ideas mounted in realistic expectation, and keeping him focused; no doubt were these two large tasks, but Redford's Sundance Kid is the perfect character to manage both. This is one of the best on-screen duos I have ever seen! As we follow the gang through the story, we find out that, as the Wild West is becoming a bit less wild, there has been a special gang composed solely to bring about the downfall, deaths, of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. No matter how far they go, or how stealthily they travel, the appointed gang is never far behind. Another treat to the film is getting acquainted with Etta Place, played by Katharine Ross. We meet her in a compromising situation, and soon realize that Sundance has a sense of humor as well. There was no mistake that Etta was the Sundance Kid's girl, but the audience is left to wonder, as the chemistry between she and Butch is made apparent, if there were not a Jules and Jim type of agreement between the two of them regarding Etta. One will never know the full intricacies of the gang, we still enjoy a riveting story of outlaws trying to outrun their demise, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is remains forever, a classic. Technically, there is not enough good that can be said about this film. As it begins, the audience is introduced to the gang through a silent "movie" being shown which really cements the notion of traveling into the past. The film also opens with an almost sepia colored wash over the film, then, after a run-in, we are greeted with a beautiful transition to full color so well done it was reminiscent of the transition in The Wizard of Oz. Brilliant camera work also accompanied the picture with wonderful shots of open plains and enough mountains to satisfy even this Colorado girl's heart! Certainly, no comprehensive review of this film would be complete without mention of its exquisite score. This score provides the perfect mix of songs for the perfect mix of characters on screen. About 2/3 of the way through the film there is a wonderful montage showing the characters as they complete their journey, again, really allowing the audience to immerse themselves in this world and feel like part of the gang. This film is a wonderful work of art that has sustained the years, and now resides in my personal top 20 favorite films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't call this a must-see for any form of movie fan. It's great and doesn't give the illusion of perfection, but there are problems. However, if you want to get a career in production, especially as a screenwriter, director, or DP, you should watch it if only for instructional purposes. As a whole, it's memorable and therefore it isn't surprising that it's regarded as a classic film.The story follows two outlaws who start off robbing trains with their cronies, but later have to go on the run after their band is killed by law enforcement. We see nothing of our antagonists, who are loosely named but never have any development. We are meant to like Butch Cassidy because of his light-hearted optimism more than the sullen and irritable Sundance. Butch also seems to have more self-confidence and is okay with what he does, whereas Sundance tries to hide behind facades of toughness that betray his fears, making him seem almost cowardly instead of rationally afraid. What is interesting about their friendship is that they seem to know very little about one another and yet have complete faith in each other. It makes you wonder what it was like when they first met. They seem to have been friends for a decent amount of time and are familiar with the other's tendencies and personality. With the pair throughout some of their escapades is their shared lover Etta Place. She is pretty well written for her type of character, clearly transcending the social norms of women in her setting and perhaps even those of the 1960's. She is not objectified or portrayed as weak, but neither is she a man-eater that can combat law enforcement single-handedly like a female superhero. Basically, we can see that she is a strong woman without ever actually being shown it.The plot can cater to fans of pretty much any genre because it contains elements of several genres, but none is overly prominent. There is excitement and the illusion of action throughout, but the only true action set piece comes at the climax. There is a romantic plot with Butch and Sundance trading Etta, but it's not overly prominent. There is a bit of mystery in who is chasing the two/three outlaws. The western setting and bank robbing scenes also cater to fans of westerns and crime movies. And, as with any work of cinema, there is a feeling of dramatic conflict throughout. However, none of these plot lines are ever fully resolved, which might be disappointing. The ending, while picturesque, doesn't bring a satisfyingly final conclusion to any of the story's conflicts.In a production sense, the film is a masterpiece. The directing and camera-work is very artsy and distinct, particularly at the beginning. If the entire movie had been shot as well as the first thirty minutes was, I would have loved it, but instead I just liked it. The only place where the stylized photography didn't work for me was the four minute montage of black and white pictures that showed the three characters traversing the east coast. The script is very well done in a dialogue sense, though pacing is an issue at several points. Newman, Redford, and Ross give us three great performances as well and bring the characters to life before us.I would recommend this to most viewers, but do strongly advise that you have an open mind while watching it and try to appreciate it. I know that this isn't always possible, but it's still worth trying here. If you aren't enjoying it by the time the characters depart for Bolivia, it's probably in your best interests to stop. For those who see it through, you might think it's overrated, perhaps rightly, but it stands the test of time better than most films. Overall Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining yet Overrated Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969): Dir: George Roy Hill / Cast: Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katherine Ross, Strother Martin, Kenneth Mars: Overrated yet well produced western about the fame of two bank robbers whose luck is rabidly closing in on them. Starts out great but montage sequences are terrible giving off information that should be examined more. It concludes on a similar note as Bonnie and Clyde although it fails to sustain the power of that film. Directed by George Roy Hill who previously made such acclaim films as Toys in the Attic and Hawaii. Paul Newman plays Butch Cassidy as the leader and thinker. Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid is skilled with a gun. They both attempt to go straight but the unlawful lifestyle seems always crouched around the corner until they are met with no other choice than to face the consequences that they knew were bearing down upon them. Katherine Ross was wonderful in The Graduate but here her role as a school teacher is underwritten. She is also part of the famous but pointless bicycle sequence where the song "Raindrops Falling On My Head" is featured. Her flirtations with both men render her unfocused. Strother Martin is also featured but too briefly, as well as Kenneth Mars as a sheriff who cannot bring this duo down. Strong theme showcasing one's sins finding you out. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is such a memorable movie because it's the total package. Newman and Redford are one of the great movie pairings, there's a wonderful sense of fun with the whole thing, and it's got all the beats of a great western; one that's wholeheartedly a product of its time. You don't think that Burt Bacharach would make a good western score, but it just . . . it works here. It's spare, only crops up here and there, but the acapella singers fit the tone. And it's instantly recognizable. Hell, when you hear "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" in "Spider-Man 2", you know exactly what movie Raimi is referencing.For me, what makes this movie is the writing. I mean the dialogue on this thing! It's what makes this such a subversive bit of enjoyment, a movie about gunslinging bank-robbers that's almost too hip for its own good. This is probably the mother of all buddy movies because of that, and most of the humor comes out in the Butch-and-Sundance bickering (their back-and-forth is hilarious). They're just such a likable duo. It brings out a smile so often that, even when things become dark for our heroes (in one hell of a shootout), you walk away with high spirits from such a great ride.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two robbers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a western - crime movie in which we watch two professional robbers who robe banks and trains which deliver money. When the law comes really close to them, they go to Bolivia in order to get away but more problems come up. Also these two robbers are best friends who are trying to do their best for their "job" and earn as much money as they can.I liked this movie not so much about the plot but for the interpretations of the cast and especially for the interpretations of Paul Newman and Robert Redford who played as Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid respectively. I also have to mention that the direction of George Roy Hill was simply magnificent and he did a really great job on it. Something else that I also liked in this movie was that is based on the exploits of some historical characters and this is something that makes this movie special and unique.Lastly I believe that "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a good movie to watch and worth seeing because it has plenty of suspense and makes you be in tense in the whole duration of it. I also believe that this movie has to be considered as a must watch movie for the fans of western movies or just the fans of crime movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy (real name Robert LeRoy Parker) and the Sundance Kid (real name Harry Longabaugh) were two real-life Wild West outlaws, and the film tells a fictionalised account of their careers, both in the West itself and in Bolivia, where they emigrated in 1901 with Sundance's mistress Etta Place (real name unknown) in search of richer pickings. According to the film they left America because they robbed one train too many belonging to the Union Pacific Railroad, following which the railroad company boss, E. H. Harriman, paid for a special posse to track them down and kill them.The plot has a number of similarities to that of another well-known Western from 1969, Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch". In that film too the protagonists are outlaws who are on the run from a posse of bounty hunters paid for by a railroad company and who take refuge in a Latin American country. (In that case the country in question is Mexico rather than Bolivia, although even in "Butch Cassidy" the supposed "Bolivian" scenes were actually shot in Mexico). In both cases the outlaws meet their demise in a shootout with the forces of law and order. And both films are what can be regarded as "late Westerns" in that the action takes place after 1890, by which time the Wild West was gradually becoming a tamer place and life was becoming more difficult for the bad guys. ("The Wild Bunch" is set as late as 1913).The film takes a fairly sympathetic view of Butch and Sundance, treating them as amiable folk heroes rather than as dangerous criminals, and fosters the legend that they never actually killed anyone during the American part of their career, relying upon threats and bluff rather than the actual use of force. (They do shoot people in Bolivia, although only in self-defence). In "The Wild Bunch" too Peckinpah is generally rooting for the Bunch rather than for their enemies, and it has been suggested that this attitude owes something to the spirit of anti- authoritarianism and rebellion which were in the air during the late sixties. I am not so sure. Glamorisation and sentimentalisation of real- life Western outlaws was nothing new; Hollywood had been doing it at least since the days of Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda as Jesse and Frank James, and probably long before that. If the Production Code forbade glamorising criminals, the scriptwriters simply denied that these men were criminals in the first place. The end of the Code in the sixties merely meant that film-makers could be more barefaced about something which had long been common practice.The film was a huge success at the box office and the top grossing film of 1969. Its reception from the critics was generally favourable and it won four Academy Awards. It helped to make a major star of Robert Redford and to cement the reputation of his older co-star Paul Newman; the two actors and the director George Roy Hill were later to team up again to make "The Sting". (Oddly enough, Redford was not the first choice for Sundance; that was Jack Lemmon, who turned it down). It has been selected for preservation in the United States National Registry of the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." Despite these achievements, however, I have never quite been able to see it as a great milestone in the history of the cinema, which is how some have described it.Certainly, it has its good points, prominent among them being some attractive photography of the Western scenery and a good musical score; its hit song, "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head", has become famous, even among those who have no idea that it was originally from a movie. Two of those Oscars were for "Best Cinematography" and "Best Song". Newman and Redford are easy to watch, if occasionally a bit too laid- back for my liking, and perhaps make their characters a bit too likable, which makes the violent ending seem jarring. (In "The Wild Bunch", by contrast, William Holden and his associates are just the sort of characters whom one might expect to die in a hail of bullets).What the film lacks is anything to set it apart from the standard average Western, of which many examples were still being made in the late sixties. By contrast "The Sting", to my mind a considerably better film, could never be mistaken for a standard average crime drama. That idyllic interlude where Butch and Sundance frolic with Etta (who in this version of the story appears to be involved in a ménage-a-trois with both outlaws) to the strains of "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" does not really count as a ground-breaking innovation, even though it was to be imitated in the "Marmalade, Molasses and Honey" sequence of another Newman Western, "The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean". As for that bloody ending it was, as Roger Ebert pointed out at the time, a blatant attempt to copy "Bonnie and Clyde". "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a watchable and competently made Western with two charismatic stars in the leading roles. But no more than that. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was no way in hell I was gonna miss Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after finding out that it features the same director &amp; duo of actors who were later responsible for the Oscar- winning The Sting, which I dearly loved. And to find it in my collection &amp; realize that it has been sitting there for years turned out to be a pretty pleasant surprise.Loosely based on a true story, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an American western that tells the story of two Wild West outlaws who are chased by a special posse that is able to pick their trail no matter where they go, thus ultimately forcing the two to escape the law by fleeing to Bolivia where they ultimately find a more successful criminal career.Directed by George Roy Hill, the biggest strength of this film is the flawless chemistry between Paul Newman &amp; Robert Redford who in their respective roles of Butch &amp; Sundance carry the story throughout its runtime, and are wonderfully supported by Katharine Ross who plays Etta Place; Sundance's lover, while its camera-work, editing &amp; music part is exquisitely executed.On an overall scale, there's plenty of fun, humour &amp; charm to be found in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It's a beautiful film to look at, is highly enjoyable &amp; entertaining from start to finish, its premise is handled in a very light-hearted manner and it also manages to culminate on a high with an ending that's as satisfying as it is heartbreaking. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

The movie has a great flow and vibe to it. The movie revolves around Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) and there Gang "Hole in the wall" they are famous outlaws who have been robbing trains and banks for years and they finally have met there match after coming across a renowned Indian tracker "Lord Baltimore" who was hired by lawman in the area. The Movie has everything you want in a film. Going into this movie I thought it was going to be a phony spaghetti western that was made in the 1960's but its not, its a great thriller, adventure, comedy, drama. If you haven't see yet your missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Western and One of the Best Buddy Comedies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I first saw it as a child, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has always been one of my favorite movies. It was such a different take on the old west and life of an outlaw than I'd seen before, or that anyone had seen for that matter. More playful than even John Ford's most light hearted works, but without the sappiness of the old singing cowboy comedies, it made the west seem like not only a grand adventure, but also great fun. With its oddball sense of humor and the interplay between its two stars, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is both a great western and perhaps the best buddy comedy Hollywood ever made.As the title suggests, the film follows the exploits of two of the Wild West's most infamous outlaws, who with their Hole in the Wall Gang robbed banks and trains far and wide, earning themselves a reputation as some of the move dangerous men alive. But you'd never know it if you met them. Far from hardened outlaws, Butch and Sundance are friendly, laid back cutups who find enjoyment where they can and never take life too seriously. Charming to a fault, they're even nice to the people they're robbing. They're not really bad men you see; they just have expensive tastes and a strong aversion to hard work.Whether it's a narrow getaway, a stick up, or a friendly visit to the nearest brothel, everything they touch becomes good natured fun, and it all works because of the men playing them. Hiring Paul Newman and then newcomer Robert Redford as Butch and Sundance was one the great happy coincidences in Hollywood history, like casting Ingrid Bergman opposite Humphrey Bogart, and began an on screen partnership even more enduring. The chemistry between these men is incredible; even knowing this was their first film together it's hard to believe they hadn't known each other all their lives.On their own each man has exceptional wit and charisma. Together they're the perfect comedic duo; Butch the talkative joker, Sundance the tight lipped strait man. Never overplaying their shtick, they always lay on just the right amount of humor. When times are good they're like a pair of schoolboys playing hooky. When times are bad they're worse than an old married couple.Of course not all the credit goes to the actors. The director and the screenplay are crucial to the film's ability to keep its cheery tone. Even when Butch and Sundance are running for their lives, hounded by the best lawmen and trackers in the west, it's no reason for things to get serious. Now they're just a couple of saps who can't catch a break, leading them to a harebrained stunt that remains one of the screen's great moments of physical comedy.Much of the film's humor and charm come from its dialogue, yet at times it accomplishes a great amount with no words at all. The New York montage condenses the story of their fun in the big city and their departure for South America into a few brief moments, the series of black and white stills and old timey waltzes and carnival music wonderfully evocative of the period. An entire string of Bolivian robberies likewise becomes a cheerful musical interlude.And speaking of musical interludes, the whole movie is so carefree and delightfully screwball that it even manages to make the dreaded Semi-Obligatory Lyrical Interlude- in which lover's engage in pleasant activities that have nothing to do with the plot- work. Rationally there's no reason why a scene of Paul Newman riding a bicycle with a woman we've just met should follow a train robbery, but here it's so charming that we either forget that or just don't car. There's simply something magical about watching Newman and Katherine Ross peddling around that meadow, and his wordless 'daredevil' scene is the best thing since Buster Keaton.Yet the good times can't last forever, certainly not for men in their line of work. The fact is that the world they know is passing away. The Wild West isn't as wild as it used to be, and their profession is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. They realize this and go halfway around the world to a place that's still wild and lawless in an attempt to forestall it. It works for a while, but it's only so long before their past starts to catch up with them. In the blink of an eye things turn deadly serious, and we realize that the world's closing in on them and they can't escape it, no matter how far they go. In the end Butch and Sundance died as they lived; on their own terms, as outlaws, and following no-one's rules but their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic of American cinema, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a surprisingly funny movie at times while being dead serious at others. It's the tale of two outlaws, the titular Butch and Sundance, who are on the run from an all-star posse intent on killing them for a wealthy client. Sundance brings his wife along as they trek to Bolivia, where they get back into their old ways after going straight for quite a bit. This leads to a climactic confrontation between the duo and the police.Before I gripe, I do enjoy this film a lot and think that Paul Newman and Robert Redford have great on screen presence and chemistry. That said, I find that the film has bad balance. It can be a really funny movie but it also goes into serious life or death scenarios ten minutes later. The bicycle scene was cute and silly but then the two are running for their lives from the posse and I'm scratching my head.Humanizing characters, especially anti-heroes, is a good thing but I feel the film took it much too lightly. I also found the ending lacking. I understand what happens but cutting off the film at such an emotional point seems kind of lame. This is the same year that The Wild Bunch was released and I was expecting the ending to be like that, with a massive, action-packed shootout. Instead we're left with a mildly amusing ending that doesn't do as much justice to these two legendary characters as I feel it should have.I don't have too much to say as I really can't complain too much and I can't rave about this movie enough to do it justice. It's a fantastic western that any fan of the genre should see and any fan of film should take note of. I don't think it's the best western ever made, but it is a very memorable one that belongs in any hardcore film fans collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesomely casted by two handsome Hollywood stars, Paul Newman, Robert Redford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a Brilliantly Witty Western film starring Paul Newman, as Butch, and Robert Redford, as the Sundance Kid. The film is an American Western based a story in the early 1900's about two outlaw bank robbers that lead the infamous "Hole-in -the-Wall Gang." The name of the gang is from where their hideout was located in mountainous terrain of Wyoming. The primary location of filming was in the USA and Mexico. Butch and the Sundance Kid are two outlaw drifters living a life of gambling, prostitutes, and drinking. Robbing banks and trains for money to uphold their loose lifestyles. Butch is the brains of the operation while Sundance Kid is the fastest gun, in that time. Being hunted down by notorious posse of lawmen, Butch and the Sundance Kid realize their fate, as outlaws, is coming to an end. They wittingly try to change their lifestyles and become respectable citizens. The two plan new adventures with Etta Place, played by Katherine Ross, a young school teacher, which they both are fond of, however, Sundance Kid is her lover. Butch and Etta have a noteworthy escapade riding on a bicycle as a contemporary song by Bacharach "Raindrops keep falling on my head" is played. They learn the customs and language of a foreign country, Bolivia. Etta Place helps them learn and plot their next hilarious adventure to again pursue their lifestyles of being outlaws and robbing banks. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" earned seven Academy Award nominations. It won four Awards in Cinematography, Score, Song, and Original Screenplay. The film was uniquely directed by George Roy Hill, creatively written by William Goldman, highly credited for the authentic western landscape and cinematography by Conrad Hill, and the brilliantly schemed musical score by Burt Bacharach. Awesomely casted by two handsome Hollywood stars, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and co-starring beautiful Katherine Ross. Also acknowledged for their unforgettable acting are: Strother Martin, Henry Jones, Jeff Corey, George Furth, Cloris Leachman, Ted Cassidy, Kenneth Mars, Donally Rhodes, Jody Gilbert, Timothy Scott, and many more?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Roy Hill's magnificent Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is ironic in two ways, it is very funny, and it is based on true events. Besides the movie being a story it is more of a character study that tells us more about Butch and Sundance. The movie stars Paul Newman As Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid two outlaw teammates who rob lots of trains together in their careers as criminals, and then run to Bolivia while on the run from the law and both get shot to death (sorry to spoil it for you if you haven't seen the movie, or don't know the history behind it.) Hill directs this movie with great effort as much as he did with his next film starring Newman and Redford which was The Sting (1973. I also forgot to mention the very good casting for this movie (besides Newman and Redford) which also includes Katharine Ross, and Sam Elliot ( who is uncredited for this movie). This movie was a total great in my opinion and one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who cares about plot. It's all about chemistry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best buddy films of the New Hollywood era (1967 - 1974) or any era for that matter. The chemistry between Newman and Redford is terrific. Their humor, driven by William Goldman's Academy Award winning script, is sophisticated, witty, and sarcastic. Newman is superb playing Butch, the affable guy you'd want to buy a beer in a bar, while Redford's Sundance Kid was, is, and always will be the ultimate cool character in all of film.As a side note, I have to say that it makes me laugh when someone refers to this movie as being "dated". A Western, by definition, is dated but if they're referring to the dialog, all I can say is - Are you kidding?? I also find it comical when people complain that there's no real "plot" to the film. Who cares when Newman and Redford are this entertaining??!!This was an enormously popular film in 1969, an instant classic ... and as we all know, the classics are timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love westerns. So when it came to adding westerns to my watchlist this was placed at the very top. Mainly because many other fans of the genre were saying it is one of the greatest ever made. However I wasn't blown away, expecting a 5 star movie I was instead given (in my opinion) a 4 star one.The film does have fantastic traits, the main being the casting of the two leads; Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy, and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid. The duo have fantastic chemistry which makes their conversations sizzle with entertainment. By the end of the film you crave for more scenes featuring the two outlaws.George Roy Hill sits in the directors chair and on the whole he does a damn fine job. His most praise-worthy parts being the first scenes and the last. The way he introduces the lead characters is one to admire. I can't mention those scenes without mentioning the DoP's name: Conrad L. Hall. Especially for highlighting the beauty and torment of the West.In terms of the overall plot the film is more of a character study then anything else. I would've loved "more" to happen in the middle of the film, but then again this is based on truth. But all in all the screenplay is great, after watching you'll be quoting the movie for the rest of the day.Overall this is an enjoyable Western featuring a stellar cast that'll keep you entertained for the whole 2 hours. Also, that last shot - awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A historically important film on male bonding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A historically important film on male bonding. This is one of the first Western Films where male bonding was glorified, though there were others earlier than this, I believe this movie got two men together who were bonded thick and thin. The chemistry between Butch Cassidy played by Paul Newman and the Sundance Kid played by Robert Redford is amazing. Without the chemistry, I am sure the film would not have worked and would not have stood the test of time.I am watching it now after a couple of earlier viewings and today too, I felt the bonding of these guys so enticing and charming. The climax where the cover and run are done, is a testimony of what they stand for. Now having said that, the film is not all too good, sweet and nice, there are some sour moments (if not bitter) and they are given to us by uncalled for heists, and a bit of drama to get the girl too. Katherine Ross plays the female character of Etta Place. Though she does here role well, she acts as a kind of spoilsport between our two heroes and it kind of irked me. I saw it as an uncalled for aberration in another wise wonderful film. I liked the cinematography, the color correction, the art direction and even the writing for a good part of the time. The sepia toning done as part of cool correction is wonderful too. It gave an authentic, earthy feeling which is essential for the film. Now, the editing I wish could have been crisp. There is a fight in the beginning that's witty and charm and as the film spans it's length the charm fades and that's the sad part of the film. I wish it would have had more witty moments than it actually did, the second half or later hour felt monotonous too. So, I am OK with what I got and wish it could have been so much better. I am going with 4/5 for this film, just for the sheer repeat value it has got for me that I felt low, so I need a friendship film, I get to this and I got back to this film third time. It implies there is some greatness affiliated to it as per me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID was the first western I saw in a theater as a kid (during its re-release) and it blew me away. The contemporary attitudes of the two leads and the relative realism of the action that was depicted were two of the things that really stood out at the time (older westerns rarely if ever risked attempts at the kind of self-deprecating humor that Paul Newman engages in throughout the movie). When Robert Redford's eyes lock onto his accuser's gun during the opening confrontation, it's enough to establish his character's single-mindedness (and potential for violence at any moment); it's a great little touch and it's just one of many throughout the movie. Unlike all too many westerns, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID makes us CARE about these two characters (rogues though they may be) and it's THAT carefully-cultivated caring that makes the ending all the more poignant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>witty one liners, daring train robbery's, adventure and excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No other film in the history of sweeping landscape of the western genre conjures up more vivid images of witty one liners, daring train robbery's, adventure and excitement than those elicited when you think about the epitome of the Wild West outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Just as the film makes an effort to state at the beginning, the whole story behind the film was based loosely on fact, there were really two train robbing outlaws who migrated to Bolivia in search of a more successful criminal career and they were really called Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, although their real names were Robert LeRoy Parker aka Butch Cassidy (played by Paul Newman) and his partner Harry Longabaugh aka the "Sundance Kid" (played by Robert Redford). The film starts off with a slow sweeping sepia drenched shoot of a small American town, we soon settle on Butch looking longingly out a window to the sepia streets that lay beyond it. The colour grading almost make it feel that we have stepped into a nostalgic snap shot of time that we as well as Butch feel is coming to a slow agonising end. Later on through a poker match we introduced to Sundance, which the scene later seems ironic because it best represents who Sundance is, someone who likes to keep his card close to his chest, and even though on the surface he may hold a indecipherable poker face, just like Clint Eastwood in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, there is so much more under the surface. While for the first 25 minutes of the film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid may seem like polar opposites, Butch being a loud, obnoxious smooth talker and Sundance the brooding silent one. They actually make a great team, Butch is the brains and Sundance is the brawn or should I say guns of the team; together not a safe on a train anywhere in the world can keep them away from its money, even if it's not down to the most subtle of techniques, which means almost blowing up an entire train with far too much dynamite, they always still get it. But the owner of the train would then say; full me once shame on you, full me twice shame on me and full me three times and I'll hire an almighty relentless gang that will follow you from hell and back again, then twice around the moon and I'm pretty sure Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid could confirm that statement, as they spend days trying to lose the gang, with ever increasing difficulty. Eventually with a whole lot of courage or some would say stupidity, they are soon able to gain enough distance to allow them to unite with Katharine Ross as Etta Place and migrate to Bolivia, taking their thieving habits with them. But once again there old foes find them... Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid went on to win four academy awards, for best cinematography, Best Song for Burt Bacharach and Hal David for "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head", best score and best screen play, however despite being nominated it lost both best picture and best actor for Paul Newman too Midnight Cowboy and Jon Voight (rightly so). But as good as the award winning score and cinematography was, I felt the best aspect of the film was the was the passion, enthusiasm and talent that both Paul and Robert brought to their respectful roles, and I truly believe that in any other year both of them would have walked home with the statue. I simply loved their camaraderie and sheer respect they had for each other; you could really tell that they respected each other's craft and presence, feeling at times as if they were really brothers in real life, making it such a delightful experience anytime they share the screen together. Katharine's inclusion was ultimately small but crucial, she brought all that tender, vulnerability from The Graduate, but this time she added a whole new layer of steal to the character which I felt showed that she had greatly developed as an actress. It's difficult to review some of the plot elements of the film, due to the fact that is based on a true story, so you don't know what parts are for audience entertainment and what other parts were historical fact. Let's just assume that it was purely fiction, I was annoyed at how the fact they built up the 6 pursues so much, yet you never actually get to see them or see first-hand what makes them so formidable which was highly fascinating. But that was just me being nit picky. The only thing that came close to the performance of the two leads was the screenplay, rightly ranked #11 on its list of 101 Greatest Screenplays ever written by The Writers Guild of America. Every scene had a laugh out loud witty patter between the two leads of the or from the minor characters that left your side in stitches. But I do feel that director George Roy Hill and writer William Goldman should have held some of the gags back and opt for a more serious tone to the film, because these were two guys who knew the end was coming, and all they could do was make jokes? But on the whole Butch Cassidy and the Sundance will always going down as probably top 10 greatest westerns films ever, a title I feel that it earned and greatly deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Kid, the next time I say, "Let's go someplace like Bolivia," let's go someplace like Bolivia"- 45 years of a great western classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>45 years ago, there were two westerns that came out in 1969. One was popular. One was not so popular. The one that was popular with audiences was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The one that wasn't popular with audiences was The Wild Bunch. The Wild Bunch made it to my Top 10 favorite list. But, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was also in the same league as The Wild Bunch. What more can you ask for this picture? Not a whole lot. The story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is not really true to what happen to the duo, but the movie is sort of a fictional dramatization of the two bank robbers. The movie begins with Butch, (Paul Newman), entering a bank that already starting to close up for the day. It's the 1890's, there's not much left for the world for bandits. Butch loses his chance to rob the bank, however. Meanwhile, his friend, The Sundance Kid,(Robert Redford), is playing a card game with two other men. The big man behind the card game suspects Sundance is cheating. Sundance denies this. To prove that he is the quickest gun around, he demonstrates his talent by shooting the big man's gun out of his hand. The duo then head out of town to meet the Hole-In-The-Wall gang, which is what Butch Cassidy's gang is called, even though realistically, the real Butch Cassidy's gang was called the Wild Bunch. They have already been selected to work with Harvey (Ted Cassidy), instead of Butch. After beating up Harvey, Butch, the Sundance Kid, and the other gang members, decide to rob a train by blowing up one of the train's boxcars. It turns out that the man who is hiding in the boxcar that they have blown up works for E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad. But, when a posse of lawmen show up unexpectedly at their robbery, Butch and the Sundance Kid decides that they have no choice but to run from the law. The movie also develop an relationship between the two men and a woman named Etta Place (Katherine Ross). In one particular scene in the movie, Butch and Etta shared a joyful and somewhat sweet moment together as Butch rides a bicycle to the tune of "Raindrops are Falling On My Head.", sung by Burt Bacharach. That scene works very well because it shows just how joyful it is to watch this movie. When the law becomes too close to bear on, the trio decides to travel to Bolivia, where they are bound to rob banks. They do get lucky, however. Yet, both Butch and Sundance know that their times are closing up for the both of them. Time is short and banks are going for broke. There isn't much more to go around for. The finale of the movie takes place in a plaza, where Butch and Sundance face off against the Bolivian army, who is waiting outside. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a fun and funny western. It has the charm and wisdom that is fueled by both Paul Newman's and Robert Redford's performances. They like each other in this movie and we like them together. In my opinion, there are probably the best movie buddies since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover team up together in Lethal Weapon. Another reason why this also works in a beautiful way is the cinematography. The cinematography is rich and colorful, with breath-taking shots of canyons and riverbeds. Furthermore, the cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall, won a Oscar for his work in this film. The picture is very good-looking and very beautiful to watch. To me, the movie is sort of a softer version of The Wild Bunch. The reason why is because in The Wild Bunch, there was a hard edge to the story and the characters. It was a lot more violent than this one. This one isn't as violent as The Wild Bunch. In fact, both movies succeeds in making the western genre more pure. The screenplay for this movie is very well-written with funny dialogue in between drastic situations in which Butch and Sundance must figure out a way to elude the Bolivian army. In one particular scene and the most famous scene in the movie is when Butch and Sundance are trapped on a cliff. Below them is a raging river stream. Sundance wants to fight them. But, Butch, keeping a cool head, decide that they should jump into the river. With Butch trying to egg Sundance to jump, Sundance leaves no choice, but to jump into the river. Even the longest curse word ever said in the movie is also heard. A lot of people like this movie, yet there are some who didn't like. I like to know why they didn't like it. It is because of the charm? It is because of the chemistry between Newman and Redford? Is the movie classic in it's own right? I specifically don't know or how anyone would hate this movie. It is a classic. I enjoy so much of what went on during the whole movie. It was fun. It was funny. It was thrilling. It was tragic toward the end. But, above all, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid continues to be one of the best westerns around. It is also one of the best movies of 1969. As for the buddy genre, it would be qualified as being the best buddy movie ever made. Why? Because Newman and Redford are likable throughout this movie. Whether they have to jump into the river or try to rob a Bolivian bank and also command the tellers and people in the bank to put their hands up in Spanish, it all works very well. It's supposed to be enjoyable. Even after 45 years, it still keep on chugging away. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film again last night on Netflix. The last time that I saw it was in about 1973, when it was broadcast on TV. My mother loved the soundtrack and probably had the hots for Paul Newman and Robert Redford. I fondly remember watching it with her, but I didn't remember all the details of the movie.I was pleasantly surprised at how well it held up. The cinematography is pretty spectacular throughout, so it's easy to understand why it won Best Cinematography in 1970. I was most impressed with the composition of some of the shots. Near the beginning for the movie, when Butch and Sundance come together, the steady shot on Sundance and the cropped shot of his rival card player, really give a great sense of tension.There are some good laughs and some good action, along with a bit of a love story. Be sure to notice the long blonde haired girl that Newman takes upstairs when they're hiding out in the town. It's one of the first film appearances of Cloris Leachman.The soundtrack doesn't hold up quite as well, except for the award winning song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head." Some of the Bacharach tunes with the multiple voices going Doo Be Doo just seem a little out of place. I'm not sure who else was up for Best Original Score, but I think that Raindrops must have swayed the decision.If you like today's George Clooney and Brad Pitt movies, you'll enjoy this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released on the hooves of Sam Peckinpah's blood drenched last gasper The Wild Bunch Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a kinder gentler more sanitized for public consumption look at outlaws on the run with the Twentieth Century gaining on them fast. It even has a pop tune video and a jolly Burt Bacharach score to keep things light and mawkish which might spell disaster for a wild west shoot'em up were it not for the legendary first and best pairing of Newman and Redford as Butch and Sundance.The Hole in the Wall Gang has been making a living robbing trains for awhile when the Pinkerton's begin to intensify their pursuit. With their membership decimated Butch, Sundance and his girlfriend light out east to NY and eventually on to Bolivia in hopes of beginning anew.The naturalness between the laid back Butch and the wound tight Sundance has the perfect cadence of a friendship partnership developed over time as they play off of each other with the comfortable familiarity of a Tracy Hepburn duo.For a film featuring protagonists with a bounty on their head Cassidy has an upbeat mood most of the way as director Arthur Hiller keeps things light and polished but nearly sacrifices the picture in favor of entertainment with the intrusive BJ Thomas ditty video and an overlong montage of tintype imagery from Coney Island. It is left up to Conrad Hall's cinematography, especially in low light situations, to supply the film's power and suspense with one outstanding composition after another. With Hall's strong look informing the picture and Newman/Redford clicking like Rogers and Astaire Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is well worth a watch in spite of it's heavy saccharine aftertaste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very impressive western with excellent performances from both Redford and Newman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very impressed with this Redford &amp; Newman Western. The dialogue is endlessly quotable and the film contains probably the best on screen chemistry (in Redford and Newman) between 2 lead actors that I think I've ever seen. To me, at times, they were more like a married couple than a double act. Who can forget the funny exchange between the 2 men before they jump from the top of a cliff into the river? Also, the critical moment where Butch mentions to Sundance that he's never shot anyone before. Of course, there is also the classic line 'Do you think you used enough dynamite Butch?' These were just a few funny moments that stood out for me, but there were several more throughout the film.The plot sees our 2 outlaws Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid (Newman and Redford respectively) robbing the Union Pacific Flyer Train - which is an idea that the original leader of Butch's gang Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy) had come up with. When Butch defeats Logan in a knife fight, he takes his old gang and robs the train. The gang are successful the first time, but when they strike a second time they use too much dynamite on the safe and thus lose quite a lot of money. In addition the owner of the pacific flyer E.H Herriman sends in another train with a group of lawmen including an expert Indian Tracker Lord Baltimore and a tough lawmen Joe LeFors to track them down and kill them. When the heat gets too much in their home town of Wyoming, the 2 men decide to flee to Bolivia with Sundance's girlfriend Etta Place (Katherine Ross) and decide to switch from robbing trains to robbing banks.For me, this film was excellent when Butch &amp; Sundance were robbing trains in Wyoming and I also thought it was excellent when they got to Bolivia. It was the middle third for me where the film lagged slightly (not very much happened), but thankfully the great chemistry and humour between Redford and Newman still made the middle section watchable. I was also a little bit disappointed that we didn't get to see any of the lawmen (the 2 most prolific lawmen were only mentioned in 'name only' - we never got to see things from their perspective, we didn't get to see how they tracked them etc). Whilst, Butch &amp; Sundance were great and Redford and Newman's performances were great and they were both endlessly entertaining I still would have liked to have seen more of the lawmen. I was also a little disappointed with Katharine Ross performance as Sundance's girlfriend, she was a little bit flat in my opinion which was a shame particularly as Redford &amp; Newman were so good in their respective roles.Despite these minor issues, this is still an excellent western which is largely carried by Redford &amp; Newman. The minor problems with the film are more than outweighed by the captivating story and the humour and chemistry between Redford and Newman. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quintessential entertainment study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a great example of how a commercial movie ought to be. A movie that understands its field and in that space it works its magic. Most of the commercial cinema today is subservient to the audiences to the point that all it does is vomit one cliché after another. Butch Cassidy though commercial in its nature, has far more polished edges that makes it a standout. It's stylish and aesthetically pleasing, has a nice soundtrack and the story is well worked out. Nothing has been overdone here, it's comic when it ought to be and manages to maintain the tone and rhythm throughout. It create a very intimate bond between the audiences and the two outlaws. As for the finale, it's grim but at the same time not emotionally shattering thus perfectly encapsulating the spirit of the movie. It strikes a perfect balance between the requirements of the studio financing it might have had and the kind of treatment the story deserved.Coming to Paul Newman and Robert Redford, they deserve as much accolades as the director for seeing this movie through. They shoulder it from the beginning to the end. Undoubtedly the script has a funny layout but the chemistry between the two set the screen on fire. Both have their own distinct style of humor and both execute it to perfection. This movie in my opinion is not quite a trail brazer in the conventional sense but there is so much to be learned from it. It mixes entertainment with no-nonsense approach. It's recommend for both viewers and voyeurs alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great American Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Roy Hill directs one of the great westerns of the 1960s that didn't star John Wayne or Lee Van Cleef. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and the film made them icons and sex idols instantly. This film was very popular among movie-goers, that it gave rise to a whole new generation of American western films in the 1970s and 1980s.The soundtrack to the film is just as amazing as the film itself, with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' sticking out. Also, the last scene in the film, which was set in Bolivia has stirred more interest in Butch and Sundance since the film was released in 1969.Robert Redford even used his character Sundance in the film, as the name of his film festival, which is recognized worldwide. The American conscience, without this film would be quite different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most folk heroes start out as criminals, right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a "Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, "who are those guys?", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie fairly entertaining for a western-type film. I appreciated the sarcastic humor that was spread throughout it. The montages were kinda upbeat and nice. The music wasn't typical for a western and I liked that. The "old" photos used to show passed time were neat. I found myself going back and forth between liking Butch and Cassidy and disliking them. Their friendship was adorable and how they bickered back and forth. But shooting people and being robbers, not so much. So I would go from laughing at their antics to then feeling sorry for the others involved. I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969. When two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Boliva with Sundance's girlfriend. Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate 'This is a stick-up" that's only a minor detail to the nicest 'bad guys' who ever rode the West.*Special Stars- Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Catherince Ross, Trevor Martin.*Theme- Eveen if you're nice to be around but an outlaw, the law will catch-up with your lawlessness.*Trivia/location/goofs- Oscar winner 1969: best story &amp; screenplay and Cinematography. Lead roles try-outs: Jack Lemon, Steve Mcqueen, Marlon Brando, and Warren Beatty. The final decision changed after Redford wanted the Butch role and Newman the Sundance role.*Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable buddy film (+girlfriend) with excellent writing, casting and production values. This fine script took two obscure and little known Western characters and made them a house-hold word. A fine example of Hollywood's best achievement and a real treat for anyone watching this film. BTW: Be sure to see the who uncut version, because those reduced and edited TV or Cable versions does not give you the director's story on these characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't bad. The best part were the robberies because that's what kept it interesting. The dynamic between characters wasn't bad either. This was my first Paul Newman movie and he was pretty good in it. It reminded be a lot of Bonnie and Clyde which was only two years earlier. Maybe it sparked a bunch of robbery movies just like it like this one. The ending was similar too in a way, even. But one thing that was different was the setting, which I liked just as much. I like the atmosphere of it in this movie and it kind of made it interesting to watch. This was my first Robert Redford movie too and I enjoyed his performance just as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid falls uneasily into the gap between the old-style traditional westerns and the more modern ultra-violent deconstructionist westerns. And, in so doing, it more or less creates a sub-genre of which it is the only member.It purports to tell the story of a couple of relatively small-time crooks whose specialities are small town bank hold-ups and train hijackings. They, and a lady friend, Etta Place (whose relationship with them is somewhat ambiguous) reach the point where dogged Pinkerton agents are set upon them, so they attempt to escape by running to Bolivia, where fate awaits them.The gaps in the sketchy knowledge of the real-life characters on which this is based are filled in most entertainingly by screenwriter William Goldman, performed with huge and obvious enjoyment by stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford (in Redford's case, this was a star-making performance) and directed with innovatory panache by George Roy Hill, and peppered with unexpected musical cues by Burt Bacharach.It is a treat. Make sure you see it if you have managed to miss it so far over the last 40-odd years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment, but it could have been perfect ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If my review was a medical diagnosis, I would say "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" suffers from a benign case of cinematic schizophrenia, just as if "The Sting" featured a scene similar to the tollbooth massacre in "The Godfather".As much as I genuinely enjoyed "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", I had the strange feeling the film was constantly hesitating between two different approaches : comedy or drama, and if only had the director, George Roy Hill made a choice in both, the movie would've been perfect. And here is the first dilemma: as a comedy, it features some of the funniest lines and exchanges from American Cinema, which made the friendship more appealing in its comical aspect, and didn't fit the courses of dramatic events that would lead to the heroes' demise. While "The Wild Bunch" was a dramatic friendship story, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" had to be a buddy movie.My mention of Peckipah's iconic and superior film is not fortuitous. It has a lot in common with "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" as both film embody the agony of the Old West myth through the introductions of new vehicles such as the car for the 'bunch' and the bicycle for the 'Butch', and the similar plot lines featuring tough guys running away, whether it's from a bunch of bounty hunters or a posse, the escape is like a symbolic exile, when the civilization has conquered the west and the only valuable direction is the South, Mexico or Bolivia ? countries not contaminated by the progress, where the vestiges of the Old West still remain, where banks can still be robbed.The modern take on the Western genre is not without a bit of nostalgia, on which the use of sepia in both films is the most eloquent expression. However, western is a difficult genre to handle and probably the less compatible with the genre-binding approach. You can amplify its effects, as did Sergio Leone, increase its level of violence like Sam Peckinpah, transcend its ugliness to a hypnotic documentary-like realism like Altman with "McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller" or turning it into a sweet enchanting romantic comedy with self-derision as the best way to translate the way of old west frontier idealism, like "The Ballad of Cable Hogue". But as tempting as it is, you can't do everything and I felt like Hill wanted to try every tendency to stay on the safe side, and as a credit to his talent, it's a miracle that it didn't ruin the film.Although I admire the directorial job of George Roy Hill, I suspect the desire to do something modern was inspired from the current streaks of realistic films of the 'New Hollywood' era. I mentioned, "Wild Bunch", "The Graduate", "Bonnie and Clyde" emulated in both the opening and the concluding scene. The last shootout was a deliberate way to keep a touch of realism in the film, reminding that guns needed to be loaded too. And the explosion during the bank robbery is one of the most convincing and spectacular from any film, even by today's standards. Now, how could such perfectionism have allowed the dramatic scene when they kill the Bandidos, the slow motion was ridiculously over the top, it didn't fit the film at all. And the film features many moments that shouldn't have been there. The script introduces us to funny or colorful characters like the News reader from the gang, or the scene-stealer Strother Martin, and the way they act label them as comic relief characters, and then they are instantly killed, in the coldest and most brutal way. The shocking effect made me feel cheated. The movie's mood had to be a cheerful comedy with some dramatic undertones, and the running gag involving the Woodcock character would never have me expected the film to turn in such a dramatic series. The movie had to be a Western "Sting".The film's modernity relies more efficiently on its spicy humor, and the great score from Burt Bacharach, which provide a smooth iconoclast, feel to a film. But I guess the movie finally grew on me, thanks to the great chemistry going between Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and how the two characters completed each other. The lines they exchange are priceless, and full of wit, the cliff scene, the Bolivia arrival, or the issues with Spanish languages were absolutely hysterical, the kind of humor all relying on timing and body languages and that creates the charm of such movies like "The Graduate". It's ironic that the movie features Katharine Ross, Ellen Robinson, again in the middle of a love triangle, but Etta Place, not the typical female action-killjoy, was the icing on the cake that provided the romantic touch and a reason for the delightful musical interludes, on the top of them, one of the film's defining moments, the bicycle ride.All the way, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is the perfect example of a great film that could have been even greater if the director stay focused on one specific tone. I learned in the commentary that Hill was surprised at Newman's lack of seriousness while playing Butch, but it was the right tone, how could you make a drama out of such an outstanding script. William Goldman's Oscar-winning screenplay is a comedic goldmine transcended by Newman and Redford's chemistry, a perfect comedy works on the body languages, the looks, at one point, there's one smile Redford gives, and never had a smile made me laugh so hard."Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is redeemed by its wit, its beautiful cinematography by the master Conrad Hall, the score, the acting, and more than anything, its entertaining value. It's a classic, entertaining, Western but it could have been a masterpiece of unconventionality ?</fullReview>

I laughed when I saw this film at the first viewing and I have got to say that I still laugh whenever I see the film although not quite as much. Of course there is more to this film than just the laughs and the film has a good feeling about it and by that I mean that it seems to have been created with a good deal of care and the professionals involved all seem to have done their part. In many ways it was a film like the Sting which was of its time but doesn't really compare favourably to the really great films before or after it was made. That said and after all its only my opinion its well worth watching and is almost two hours of good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never watched "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) before, I must admit that a lot more references in other works that I never used to quite get, make sense now. More specifically, I can now say that after many years of watching "Spy Hard" (1996), I finally understand the significance of the bicycle scene over which "Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head" plays."Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969), besides being loosely based on actual events (which I found interesting), brought a new aspect to filming. This aspect was the way it used the glorifying of violence to portray the violence in a thought provoking manner. I feel previous films neglected to use strong and very visible violence because it was inappropriate to do so, but for this film it worked, and we have witnessed violence grow more persistent in films ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Great "Modern" Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. George Roy Hill did a great job giving it the feeling of a real western even though it was released 30 years after the height of the genre. He coupled beautiful cinematography with great casting and an exciting closing scene. The scenery is spectacular and you'll feel like you've been dropped smack dab in the middle of the "wild west." The best part of this film though has to be the casting. Paul Newman and Robert Redford were great (Especially Redford)and much like Bonnie and Clyde you're easily able to connect with and root for these two although they're constantly breaking the law. The two are witty, charming and surprisingly funny. The only knock I have on this film is the music. I feel like it was a mistake using more modern music in the film which was supposed to be set in the 1890's but it's a small complaint against an otherwise well made movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Justifiably praised for the successful pairing of Robert Redford and Paul Newman, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is an expertly crafted Western which turns away from being bombastic or hard-hitting. The moderate to light tone the film-makers choose makes this film like a refreshing summer breeze: By the time you appreciate how fine it is, it has nearly blown past you. Thoroughly entertaining yet not insipid, this movie has visually memorable moments. For example, when Butch and Sundance flee to high ground as night falls, they turn round to look for the trackers pursuing them and see the beams of their lanterns advancing in the darkness - a scene which is simultaneously beautiful and unsettling. Well wrought and enjoyable, Butch and Sundance displays a very rare achievement in Hollywood: combined star power effectively employed.</fullReview>

Rather than all the tough, cold action from normal westerns, Butch and Sundance added much humor to the film. It was a film where you are actually on the bad guys side because their characters are so likable! I enjoyed how Butch, played by Paul Newman, and Sundance, played by Robert Redford were such a dynamic duo! The script was very well written. Most western films have very cheesy lines, and an unnatural tone, but this film worked just perfectly. The dry humor was such a nice touch.It was interesting to see how quickly after the Hays Code had ended that there was nudity in films in the late sixties. For example when Butch's girlfriend undresses in front of him. This type of material never would have been allowed even ten years prior.</fullReview>

I think the American people all have a side to them that wants to rebel against government and the law. This movie, which came out in 1969 stands to represent just that. As the cultural revolution is in full swing, this movie helps capture the imagination of freedom with these two characters. The cinematography is very well done, there are a lot of shots that i found to be extremely visually appealing. There certainly is a good job done in the process of creating verisimilitude.

There were a couple moments in the film that I thought didn't work well. For example, there was a chase montage while the characters were in South America. It had really odd, somewhat annoying music, and it went on for way too long. I didn't like it and even fast-forwarded part of it.

		<shortDescription>Chemistry makes a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was released in 1969. This is a great period for movies because the Hays Code had just ended. Characters were allowed to act differently than before, usually in sexual ways. An example of this is when Butch Cassidy had his girlfriend undress in front of him. The next scene begins with them in bed together. During the Hays Code married partners were not even allowed to sleep in the same bed. The acting in this movie was great. These roles were perfect for Redford and Newman because although they were best friends in the movie, they were also friends in real life. This created great chemistry between them which made the acting so natural and realistic. There was one problem with continuity after Stother Martin's character was shot. In the first scene he is lying with a branch across his face and in the next scene the branch is gone. This movie is one of my favorite westerns and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and hilarity.</fullReview>

This American western is full of action with added subtle slapstick comedy intertwined. Starring Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy) and Robert Redford (The Sundance kid) as two bank robbers trying to survive the only way they know how. The message being transmitted is the importance of friendship and loyalty. Through the good and the bad, the two outlaws are in it together never to leave the others side until the end. This isn't a typical western, the screenplay was written to focus on more than just violence and criminal life, but also in-depth character development to really feel like you know them. The finished product is unique, giving the early 1900's a more modernized feel.</fullReview>

This movie has amazing acting from the entire cast and is entertaining all the way through. There are multiple classic Hollywood western gun battles. Each scene is shot beautifully in the wild frontier, not giving up a single detail. One thing that takes away from the movie is the music. it is often un appropriate for the scene or is distracting from what is happening on the screen. If you can get past the music the film becomes a lot better. The one thing that stands out the most in my mind and makes this movie one of the greats is the chemistry between Redford and Newman. seeing the two of them on screen together makes this movie an instant classic that i will continue to watch for the rest of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is and always will be known as one of the greatest Westerns, and really greatest movies of all time. though I personally prefer The Good the Bad and the Ugly, and both versions of 3:10 to Yuma, I think Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a much more fun movie. This film seems like an easier Western to get into. A lot of people have the image in their heads of Westerns as cowboys versus Indians and duels at noon (even though most good Westerns don't really fall into that.) I think anyone that imagines Westerns to be this way should watch a film like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Its not your average western but at the same time a near perfect one.The main thing that keeps this film fun and exciting is the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. They play off of each other so well, and though it's not really a Western Comedy it often times feels like one. It's a different genre yet it has similar style to The Sting made 4 years later, obviously mainly due to the team up of Paul Newman and Robert Redford and director George Roy Hill. Great dialog, great directing, great acting, great cinematography, and classic shootouts and chases. It's no wonder why this movie is so popular. Some people, including me, aren't a big fan of the bicycle scene with "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head." I don't really think it fits well in the film but it doesn't ruin it. That is my only criticism of the whole film. It's a very original and clever film that deserves all the attention it has got, yet still deserves more. Recommended to anyone, especially fans of Newman, Redford and westerns, and anyone that "doesn't like westerns" but is willing to give it a chance, you won't be let down. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real good and fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's a real American Western. Not spaghetti in the least and not parading ? la John Wayne in the even slightest least. Real tough, dirty, hateful. Two lazy and absolutely zilch young men who do not want to do anything, learn anything, even swimming, and yet want the money other people are making so that they both with their common lady love can have high life on the frontier. Just marginal and incompetent young men who do not have any sense of time, of the past and the future, of what was possible before and what is leading to no future, but who cares about the future since we have good money, good food, good wine and good bourbon right now. Tomorrow is another day and we have to spend the night somewhere before we reach that tomorrow. And they don't learn. First they do not see that trains are finished and that train companies are going to set up the real tracking teams they need to capture them, dead if possible. When they finally realize trains are out just like banks are finished, they go to New York and board a boat to Bolivia. And there they discover banks are not paying, local bandits are both more numerous, better organized and tolerated, but also not quite fast enough for two Yankee outlaws. But they also will find out that no one is going to close their eyes and they will report everything. They won't wait or be afraid. Let's tell the local police that is quite plentiful, and they will in their turn call the cavalry and then dying will no longer be an option. It will be the only bottleneck way out, shot by hundred of bullets and not two or three. Beautiful film that tries to give the real smell and feel of the frontier in those days, dirty, smelly, dusty, potent with filth and total lack of courage, but economically enterprising and trusting the best trackers and the best professional shooters to do the job. Posses and vigilantes were out now in the time of railroads and steam engines, and industry and two digit growth rates. The sentimental and psychological side is maybe not as rich as in the spaghetti westerns, but the film is effective to make you be relieved from any fear that such a past could come back. It is gone and good riddance. And what if we were confronted to that kind of gangsterism again in our suburban sprawl? Then I guess we would have to call the cavalry in again.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really fun western and just about nothing about this film is dull or dry. Robert Redford and Paul Newman makes a perfect team, and even though they are bank and train robbers you can't help but want these guys to get away, they are just too charming and charismatic. The plot is entertaining and the dialogue is fun and witty, it really went the right direction. Two great actors in a film makes it even better, Butch Cassidy(Paul Newman) is somewhat of the brains of the operations and The Sundance Kid(Robert Redford) is the muscle or expert gunslinger. I personally think it would have been cool if they got a bit more in depth with the people that are trying to track them down and kill them which leads both the robbers to head to Bolivia. Redford and Newman really shine in this movie and I personally think it's at there best. This is a impressive film and a instant classic. If your into western movies, this is a must watch and I recommend this to any other movie lovers as well.8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly the most perfect western movie ever.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of the two infamous outlaws of the wild world of west Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.They may be the biggest outlaws that ever hit the area and are the leaders of the gang named "Hole in the wall".They are very different from each other,if Butch is a good natured man with great ideas,Kid is quick and deadly as lightning but they are very close buddy,their friendship is so strong that they even love the same women Etta Place,a school teacher.The west in now changing and things are not so easy now as before,luckily escaping the almost certain death Butch and Kid escaped to Bolivia with Etta,where they also started robbing the bank and soon they also became infamous there as "Bandidos Yanquis".This movie is not like other western movies,this movie is not as stylish and violent as other western movies of Sergio Leone or The Wild Bunch.This is the original work more like an art movie,very slowly burning masterpiece with the most perfect script ever written for a western movie which get equally great treatment from it's Director. There are many very-well written quotes and lines in the movie which makes the scenes memorable.The second part of the movie is as entertaining and binding as first part of the movie,there is not a single moment where the story gets weak and we felt lack of interest.This is also the most beautiful western movie i have ever seen, wonderful cinematography which makes the prairies and wastelands surrounded by mountains look astonishing,even the montage scenes that are filmed with different brownish color looks so beautiful. Another wonderful thing in the movie is it's soundtrack which is not used to create thrill in action scenes like in other westerns, they use background score(like in a romantic movie) in montage scenes and in the bicycle scene(which is the loveliest scene for me in the movie,the way they use the sunlight which make the scene very pleasing).Brilliant performances and great chemistry among the three lead actors Paul Newman,Robert Redford and Catherine Ross.The whole movie was full of fun and adventure from start to end,a complete entertainment,there are many moments that make you laugh aloud specially train robbery scene but it is not a comedy movie.the ending was so tragic but did not make us sad,which is the only reason for me to give this movie 9 instead of 10,i think the ending should be more emotional.Except this,there is not a single mistake in the movie,this movie have such a high standard of film-making which is very hard to compare with other movies of same genre,perfect and mind-blowing peace of art.I'm not too fond of western movies but Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the best western movie ever made and also among the few westerns that i like so much.For me this is the second favorite western movie(after The good,The bad and The ugly).A must watch for every western movie lover and even if you are not,i recommend this movie as it has everything which you found in traditional western movie but at the same time it is very different and original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun. Not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>www.ourfilmreviews.com "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is an okay, fun movie but not nearly the masterpiece of cinema that the majority of critics seem to believe it is. I first saw it when I was a kid and had fond memories of it, but watching it again the other night I was met with a certain degree of disappointment. The acting is good (Paul Newman is always great. Redford does a fine job but it is really Newman's movie) and the one-liners are memorable, but the story is so disjointed and one-dimensional that the film doesn't reach any level beyond that of a lighthearted adventure flick.The critic James Berardinelli praises the movie for taking the Western genre into more lighthearted territory. He writes, "The movie is jovial without being silly; it retains the sense of adventure that characterizes the Western, but replaces the often somber mood with one that is airy and, at times, almost comedic. As directors like Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone took the Western in one direction, George Roy Hill and William Goldman threw audiences a curve ball by opting for the road less traveled ? and were rewarded with a success." I don't mind that the movie gives the Western genre a lighthearted and jovial spin. The problem is the film fails to connect the jovial events in the movie to a deeper understanding of its characters and thus fails to move beyond the lightheartedness. Lightheartedness and jocularity are good and fun, but they just aren't sufficient on their own to make for great cinema. They make for lighthearted and jocular cinema, not greatness. Since Berardinelli mentions Sergio Leone, let's for a moment compare the movie to Leone's masterpiece "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly." Leone's film treads into jovial territory as well, but the jocularity does not consume the film. The film also contains a gritty seriousness, a look into the greedy, dark heart of man, and a suspenseful climax. As a result, the film is a much more satisfying western and a more satisfying cinematic experience than the rather one-dimensional "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." The film follows a very simple cause-and-effect narrative that plays out like this: Butch and Sundance rob trains. Butch and Sundance are chased by the authorities. Butch and Sundance flee to Bolivia with Sundance's girlfriend. Butch and Sundance rob banks in Bolivia. Butch and Sundance are chased by the Bolivian authorities. The End. All the while the two leads are given pithy witticisms for every occasion. For the most part, these escapades are great fun. The film is very funny at points, as when Butch uses too much dynamite on a train's bank safe. When it explodes, the entire car is blown to smithereens and the money floats down all around the rubble. My favorite scene of the movie is when Butch and Sundance attempt to rob a Bolivian bank, only to get frustrated by the language barrier and walk out. The middle part of the movie, however, suffers from poor editing and a lagging narrative. When the authorities (an apparent ensemble of the best law enforcers and headhunters in the west) are chasing the duo, the chase consists of nothing more than long, sweeping shots of Butch and Sundance on horseback, riding at full speed through the landscape. This is the point in the movie when you should use the restroom or make yourself a snack. You will miss nothing in terms of narrative or character development and the shots of the landscape are too dull to deserve our interest.The film also features the pop hit "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head," a song written by Burt Bacharach for the film. The song is featured in a random montage of Newman riding a bike with Katharine Ross' character. There is very little development of the Ross character and no development of her relationship to Butch prior to the montage. As a result, the whole sequence seems out of place. While it is a catchy little tune, its use in the movie is indicative of the film's shortcoming as whole. The filmmakers had a catchy song on their hands so they made a random montage to set the song to. The montage was inserted into the film so that the movie could boast featuring what they knew would be a radio hit, even though the montage is basically useless to the film as a whole. In the same way, it seems like the film was primarily used as a chance to use Paul Newman in a big production western. The producers were able to sign a big star, so they made a movie for him.In conclusion, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a fun movie worth seeing. Paul Newman is his typical great self, Redford makes a lasting impression (the film launched him into stardom), and there are some very good comical sequences, but the film fails at being anything more than good Hollywood fluff. Good for sure, but far from great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Movie Of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK So this has to be my favourite movie of all time. It's not considered to be the best movie ever and I'm not gonna lie it isn't the best but it is MY favourite.Each scene is better than the last, and the chemistry between Redford and Newman is tangible. I have to admit though I am a little bias considering I think Paul Newman and Robert Redford are the most gorgeous men that ever lived, and more than once was I jealous of Etta.The Script is SO funny, i find myself laughing throughout the whole movie, but even though its hilarious the action and drama are still there.I know some people find the music out of place, but i think its just perfect! It works as kind of a comic relief and reflects the pop music of the 60's and beginning of the 70's instead of the tradition western music.Raindrops keep falling on my head is constantly stuck in my mind, along with Redford and Newman and this completely amazing movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Newman never better, grand fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The test of time will code this as a classic, not only for the lead pair of Paul Newman and Robert Redford for the first time, but a tight story with great dialogue and a magnificent cast of character actors. Grand fun, but the moral tale does not disappoint as the fun loving bandits are run out of the country by the owner of the Railroad who has taken it personally that they pick on his train. Katherine Ross adds grace and wisdom after you have already realized these guys are not near as smart as they are cleaver and charming. See if you can find Cloris Leachman in a small part and remind yourself that it is Newman and Redford that stole your heart not two scruffy train robbers who lived undocumented lives on which this story is hung.Remind yourself that it looks that easy when Fred Astaire dances too. The pair are masters and while I stand by my rating, it would be hard to pick between this movie and the same actors in "The Sting." Both works of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hollywood Cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Featuring two of the most iconic actors of their generation, 'Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid' was one of those instant classics that came from that particular period. 'Midnight Cowboy' was another.The two title protagonists are played by Robert Newman and Robert Redford, both at the height of their powers. One is a very talented gunslinger, the other isn't. Both are very good friends. Each has reached the special level of intimacy that takes the other's strengths and weaknesses for granted. They do not compete; there's no need. They are what we would now call: mates.Although the movie is usually classed as a western, it is more a comic opera, like 'Midnight Cowboy' or 'Grumpy Old Men', that is partly set in the west. In fact, half of the action is set in Bolivia, which few would associate with the traditional Hollywood western.The two stars play their roles with an easy economy that is beguiling and entirely believable. They are great fun to watch. Other actors are lesser known but fill their roles without criticism. Filming is wonderful. Great use is made of the American west, and lighting is often sublime. They are on the cusp of the 'great change' that was quickly overtaking the 'wild west', a point emphasised by the emergence (and dismissal) of the safety bicycle.Theme and incidental music is often criticised. You like it or you don't. It was the director's choice, and he chose most other things. I'm happy to take it with the rest of his choices.This is an extremely funny, slow-burning masterpiece that takes its time and draws you in to its slightly 'MASH'-like humour. A movie of the same period. Don't think of it as a western so much as a comedy set in the west and the south. The stars and their parts make it what it is. The ending is comic and - although tragic - too quick to be the stuff of pathos.Highly recommended. It still knocks spots off many later offerings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Ebert wrote "William Goldman's script is constantly too cute and never gets up the nerve, by God, to admit it's a Western.", I think he's right, but the thing is, they didn't try to make an old school western movies, they mixed western with Chaplin's comedy, and buddy movie, making the result, entertainment itself.It's the story of Butch(Newman) and Sundance(Redford), the two leaders of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. Butch is all ideas, Sundance is all action and skill. The west is becoming civilized and when Butch and Sundance rob a train once too often, a special posse begins trailing them no matter where they run. Over rock, through towns, across rivers, the group is always just behind them. When they finally escape through sheer luck, Butch has another idea, "Let's go to Bolivia!".Imagine Sergio Leone's movies mixed with "Lethal Weapon", and than you have something close to this movie, but the truth is, this movie is original, and I can't think about another movie that look like this one. In the beginning credits, they made a tribute to old Westerns, and what I understood about it is that they were trying to say, "We admire the old Westerns, and those classics inspired us, but we're making something a little bit different, out of what you guys created, alright?".Sometimes they even used Chaplin's kind of humor to entertain you, like the scene of Butch riding the bicycle, and it worked, I laughed more in this movie than in a lot of comedy movies, and not only bad ones. The first part of it was concentrated more in the laughs and showing how close those two guys really are(Note the intimacy between Butch and Etta, Kid's wife). The second part is a little slower, and the rhythm falls a little bit, not that it's bad, it's great, but it's hard to make the second part as good as its incredible first part. The photography is great, but not different than the other Westerns.The Acting is splendid, Newman is one of the best actors of all time, and he proves it again in this one, he's charismatic and funny, unlike Redford's equally great performance, that makes his character darker, and hesitant about his actions. But the most important element of the acting in the picture, is the chemistry between those two actors, which made all the situations more believable, and the ending more striking, plus it's incredibly funny to watch them arguing.Verdict: When this movie ends, you'll want more, because it's entertaining and funny, in a way that you don't see a lot these days, plus the performances by the two leads are brilliant</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top 50 Westerns of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" ranks as one of the top 50 westerns of all time. This agile, amusing oater about two notorious outlaws who roamed the great Northwest robbing banks and trains is not your ordinary, conventional horse opera. Scenarist William Goldman and director George Roy Hill changed all the rules. For example, unlike most outlaw sagas, the eponymous heroes are never shown dying on screen because there is some dispute about where they died. Instead, the film ends on a freeze-frame of them charging into the open with their revolvers drawn. Mind you, this 1969 Oscar nominee for Best Picture is still a status quo western because our affable heroes are still punished for their misdeeds, but Butch and Sundance were not murderous felons prone to blowing the heads off their adversaries. In fact, Butch does not shoot anybody until the duo wind up in Bolivia. There is neither a bad scene nor a bad performance in this post-modern exercise in frontier banditry. Paul Newman and Robert Redford generated so much chemistry here that the played grifter buddies in another epic "The Sting," and it did will Best Picture. Ace lenser Conrad Hall who photographed "The Professionals" and "Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here" makes the old west look truly nostalgic. The bickering banter between our two heroes is absolutely hilarious in this comedy/adventure epic.The action opens as Butch (Paul Newman of "The Left-Handed Gun") is scouting a bank to rob and learns that they have installed new, state-of-the-art equipment to protect the bank from outlaws. "That is a small price to pay for beauty," Butch remarks and heads back over to the saloon where his sidekick, Sundance (Robert Redford of "The Way We Were")is playing poker. He wins another hand and the dealer accuses him of cheating. Butch urges Sundance to leave things as they are because he--Sundance--is getting over the hill. Quietly, Sundance refuses, and the dealer challenges him to a shoot-out. The dealer (none other than Sam Elliot) overhears Butch tell his partner, "I cannot help you now, Sundance." The dealer suddenly changes his mind. However, before Sundance is willing to leave, he compels the dealer to ask them to stick around. "Why don't you stick around," the frightened dealer asks. "Nah, we gotta go," Butch replies. Before Sundance exits the saloon, he whirls and blows the gunbelt off the dealer and fires more bullets that send the gun belt skidding across the floor.Our heroes ride back to their remote hang-out, Hole-in-the-Wall, where they learn the Harvey (Ted Lynch of the original "Adams Family") has decided to take over the gang since Butch is rarely around. Butch defends himself by noting that he has to do research to rob banks and trains. The gang informs him that they intend to hit the train both coming and going, but Harvey challenges Butch for leadership of the gang in a knife fight. "What about the rules, Harvey?" Harvey blinks at Butch, "Rules?! In a knife-fight?" Butch kicks Harvey in the genitals and cold-cocks him with a blow to the head. Actually, Butch likes the plan and they hit the railroad both times. The second time that they strike, they have to festoon the safe with more dynamite that necessary. The explosion destroys the boxcar, shatters the safe, and sends dollar bills floating like confetti. About that time, a second train arrives and a posse of sharpshooting gunmen descend on them. They wipe out the entire gang and chase our heroes to an isolated cliff and Butch and Sundance have to take a high plunge into a river.After this fiasco, Butch learns from schoolmarm Etta Place (Katherine Ross of "The Graduate") that Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad has launched a manhunt to bring them in dead. Our heroes decide to relocate to South America where the pickings are easier. They have several musical interludes and we hear B.J. Thomas sing the immortal song "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" while Butch rides a bicycle--the symbol of a new age--and narrowly escapes being gored by a bull. In South America, they prosper until the army comes after them. Eventually, they go straight and work as bodyguards for a mine owner (Strother Martin), but Bolivian bandits rob them and our heroes shoot it out with them.This is an immensely enjoyable western that even women should love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film about friendship and adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is directed by George Roy Hill, is written by William Goldman and stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katharine Ross.Wanted outlaws Butch Cassidy(Paul Newman)the leader of the notorious Hole In The Wall gang,and his closest friend Sundance(Robert Redford),return to the gang after some time away to find there's a new leader.That is until Butch fights him and wins.The gang arrange to rob a train of it's cash and all goes well until the gang are fired upon and are forced to split up.Butch and Sundance take off together pursued by a party of trackers determined to bring the guys in.They hide out for a time with Sundances girlfriend,schoolteacher Etta Place(Katherine Ross).The first time Etta is shown is when Sundance makes his way into her room and orders her to strip,at first a very shocking scene we gradually learn they are lovers and the scene becomes very funny.However they are soon on the move again and take Etta with them to Bolivia.Needing money to survive,they end up robbing a bank whilst trying to remember enough Spanish to carry it out without casualties. However by this time we can see that time is running out for them.More than a Western this is one of the best films about friendship ever made.The pair are as different as chalk and cheese but form an unbreakable bond.Their only loyalty in the end is to each other.Butch is the talker,confident,charming and wholly likable and yet considering what he does has a surprising secret.Sundance on the other hand is ashamed to admit any weakness, is sardonic,tough and a man of action.Their relationship is the highlight of the film and although the real Butch and Sundance were perhaps not as charming as shown here you believe they were.B.J.Thomas had a huge hit with the title song Raindrops Are Fallin On My Head written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David this is funny,exciting,thrilling and memorable and one thats not to be missed.You'll want to saddle up and ride off with these two by the time you've finished watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Paul Newman-Robert Redford duo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid had got to be the coolest western crime movie I ever seen in 60s. It got the wits, the crime, the drama and adventure! Paul Newman and Robert Redford were equally the best in their roles. Though honestly "The Sting" was incontestably very good as well, this film out reigns the latter for me. Katharine Ross, which appeared later wasn't bad as well. The most captivating was of course the story. However the story wasn't materialized well to its depths if Paul Newman and Robert Redford, two legendary actors had pulled the trick. They were really good in portraying the characters. And to convince you, the real sister of Butch Cassidy (in real life) appreciated well how Paul Newman played the character well. Robert Redford on the other hand was superbly brilliant and cool as well. This is the first movie I saw him playing western. Butch had the brains, Sundance got the action. They mixed well and we see a great movie. Most of the time being enthralled, I got most of the laughs the comedy the two naturally performed. Very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Almost Perfect Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good Ole Western movies which enchant movie lovers all over the world is one of my favorite genres. Fascinated By Sergio Leone, I have watched very few westerns made by film-makers apart from him. But I am glad I watched this one. Supposedly based on true facts about an infamous gang of robbers in the late 18th century which is led by the master-mind Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and his 'talented' associate Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), this movie talks about the rise and fall of the protagonists. It has all the ingredients of a classic western - Train/Bank Robberies, Excellent Cinematography, Great Locations ranging from desert sand dunes to flowing rivers, impressive BGM and perfect casting. Newman has a charming screen presence, He is one actor from whom you cannot take your eyes off. But Redford has matched Newman in every scene which is a tough task to follow. Ranked as one of the best westerns in many official lists, I recommend this movie for one and a half hours of pure entertainment. Rating : 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bandidos Yanquis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Roy Hill's extremely famous 1969 film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (with Paul Newman as Butch and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid), wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It ain't a really great western or one of the best films of its year? overrated is the word but also one more: entertaining. "Butch and Sundance" is a really fast-paced Best Picture nominee (it was also the 1969 top grossing film in the US, by the way) with good if not extremely likable two main characters. I must say that in the end I liked the film (plus I was very glad to finally see it, of course considering it is considered a true classic) but: a) I will not watch it again (probably never again), and b) I really, really hated some parts of it. Let's see, the runtime marks almost 30 minutes and pretty much I was like "so far everything is really good": cool introductions to our main guys, in sepia, great fun with Butch and his replacement as the leader of the gang ("Harvey thought of that?"), the first success with the Flyer and the ladies. The film disappoints in the same way Butch and Sundance would disappoint some of their admirers. I will try to explain this: like I just said the first minutes of the film are just about fine since basically we are all right with the legends. Certainly is the fact that, for instance, the legendary Sundance doesn't know how to swim what may cause to those that are even sort of glad when they are being robbed by the legends some laughs. We don't really mind since of course the legend is a thing and the reality is another thing but we do mind when the film goes in a direction that is like a "f*** you" to the tone of most of the film. And that different direction sometimes works in Bolivia but the bicycle scene with Butch and Etta (this young woman that is played by Katherine Ross and that is the love of the Sundance Kid but that also has a very close relation with Butch) is, well? and you may like the song, that's another thing (I first heard it on the soundtrack of Forrest Gump and I do like it, it's not a favourite but it's kind of nice) but anyway, soon after the surprising bicycle riding moment we have again our western with the legends being tested, with the legends worried. And Bolivia is sort of strange, pretty much it works since when it's a comedy I laughed (even sometimes legends like Butch and the Sundance Kid could not even let the respective people know they were committing a robbery!) and it works having the beginning of the legend of the bandidos Yanquis (again an annoying music part though). It's fun but also I'm a bit disappointed?nevertheless a truly magnificent ending!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Academy Awards were all over this film for music and cinematography and the script, but they completely ignored the actors. BAFTA did a little better in recognizing Robert Redford and Katherine Ross. Paul Newman seems to be given short shrift in the film.There is no denying the quality of the direction by George Roy Hill (The Sting, Slap Shot), and the brilliant script by William Goldman, who won an Oscar for this script and for All The President's Men. He also wrote Marathon Man. But direction, scenery, and a great script are nothing if you don't have great actors to deliver the lines.Redford was outstanding, Newman set him up perfectly, and Ross was dazzling. They all delivered the lines better than anyone I could imagine to make a semi-buddy film (can't leave Ross out). They also had great support from a great cast.Raindrops may keep falling on my head, but Newman and Redford rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a movie that gauges what sort of person one is, it is without a doubt "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". If you don't like this movie, you are a grouch, have horrible taste, are quite stupid and should not be allowed to procreate or even dwell amongst the general population. This movie invented the modern Action/Comedy. The proletarian anti- hero who somehow manages to barely get away with some pretty amazing things while cracking some jokes along the way has its archetype in Butch Cassidy. Well before John McClane was blowing up the headquarters of 20th Century while shout "Yippie Kay-Yay" and Axel Foley was shoving bananas up the tail pipes of pursuing police vehicles, Butch Cassidy was popping off one-liners and using his smarts to outwit his enemies in a fun and action- packed way. Sundance one-ups any Steve McQueen character in his quiet, confident cool. It's no wonder that McQueen was the original actor offered the role. It's just as well that he turned it down on account of something rather stupid (He wanted top billing over arch-rival Paul Newman). This is Bobby Redford's best role. It would be unimaginable for anyone else to play the Sundance Kid. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a non-stop thrill ride and a good old fashioned zany comedy along with being the best movie ever in my humble opinion. It should have won Best Picture in 1969 and Paul Newman should have won Best Actor for this role. It was a crying shame that while nominated, the forgettable Midnight Cowboy win the top prize that year (on account of being Rated X and controversial for its time). After all, this was at the height of the counter-culture. Regardless, this is the one film you must see before you die. As a matter of fact, to call it a mere Western or a Comedy or a 60's flick is to do this movie a grave injustice. This movie lies within the range of "Most Under-appreciated Movie Ever" to "Greatest Film of All Time". If you disagree, seek immediate psychiatric help! You've been gauged as mentally disturbed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed in this classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gorge Cassidy" (Paul Newman), a.k.a. "Butch Cassidy", and "Lonny Longbaugh" (Robert Redoford), a.k.a. "The Sundance Kid, are two of the greatest robbers in the history of the Old West. They pulled jobs on banks and trains with an expertise that made them famous from coast to coast.Now, years after being out of the business for about two decades, they decide to pull one last bank heist in Bolivia, with the help of a school teacher (Katharine Ross) with romantic ties to both men.I have to say that I am pretty disappointed in this film. I found it to be slow, with not enough action considering the topic of the movie. It dragged so much that I noticed spending more attention to my computer than watching the movie itself on cable television.One thing that stood out was the on-screen relationship between Newman and Redford. This is what carries the movie I believe, and most likely why this movie is called a classic now. You feel as if the two are not just partners in crime, but friends with the ribbing that they give one another.Another problem with this movie is the soundtrack. The only piece of music that is memorable is Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head by BJ Thomas, and that was a weird tune for a Western set in the Old West. If you ask me, the song was just an odd choice.I also barely enjoyed Ross as "Etta Place". Her character was barely developed if you asked me. It appeared that she was there as a romantic interest, and to help teach "Butch" and "Sundance" Spanish for their attempt at robbing the Bolivian bank.If you expect a lot of gunfights, you are mistaken on this one. Of what there is in the movie, they are short and well placed.The cinematography is hard for me to judge since Encore Westerns used a pan-and-scan format. I had to deal with only half of a scene when two people were talking to one another. But, from wide shots, I could see some spectacular scenery, including the famous scene when the title characters jump from a cliff into the water.Because it was declared a classic, I've been wanting to see this movie. I am highly disappointed in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stealing is Not for Me-Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with this film is a very common problem in motion pictures. We become too involved and sympathetic to those who are doing wrong.There is much comedy here but the fact remains that Butch and Sundance were robbers, and in the end, they wound up as many in that illegal profession do.Yes, it is true that there are some very funny lines. We are amused by the dedicated worker robbed by the duo two times. Announcing a hold up in Spanish with directions must have brought the house down.The audience must have also been enlightened by Paul Newman's acrobatic ability on the bicycle with and without Katharine Ross, who obviously took a much more mature role here after her 1967 smash "The Graduate." We really can't figure out Etta here. Did she really love both guys?B.J. Peaker's Oscar winner-Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head is wonderfully staged, but where is the rain?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a movie that is hailed as not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time, but one of the greatest movies in cinema. I have tried 3 times now to get into this, but each time I end up being bored silly by it. This has made so many memorable lines to quote for people, so many parodies for the bicycle riding scene, with the song "Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head" but in the end, I really didn't care. For it's time it's very iconic, but today it's heavily outdated, and the infamous gunfight at the end while one of the best things about the movie, is even outdated. Paul Newman and Robert Reford are not a problem, they are the reasons I managed to keep awake through the duration of this movie, and the scenery is absolutely gorgeous, I have to admit, i'm just very picky on westerns, and this is another one that bored me.Performances. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are both fantastic. They ooze class and charisma, while having there macho type moments as predicted, they are the saving grace to this film. Katharine Ross is OK, but is pretty wasted.Bottom line. This is an overrated movie, that is not on my list of classics like it is on many others. It's just too uninteresting for my liking. Recommended because it is a required viewing, I just don't care for it.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic legendary western tale of two criminals that works due to the chemistry of the leads and it teases.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1969's "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is clearly a classic western as it does a pretty good job of the retelling of the two legendary bank robbing western criminal outlaws. And the film is done in a way that pleased most viewers even though the western genre is not everyone's cup of tea, still the action and gunfire is traditional enough to make any old time viewer feel at home and have a classic feel. Yet as you watch much of the film from the robberies, hold ups and getaways and even the acting you will feel a tease as I for one feel this film is a big tease of chase and go that spotlights it being fun to be on the run as a criminal. Anyway still the acting and chemistry is what makes the film as the two leads who in 1969 were clearly just getting in their prime are wonderful as Paul Newman is wise and bright as the old criminal mastermind Butch Cassidy and the young and shining Robert Redford is in fine form as the up and coming outlaw Sundance. And Katherine Ross gives a good supporting turn as the shared love squeeze of both outlaws. Overall the film is a feel good journey of on the run getaway after getaway journey as in it's time in 1969 was a defining film for it's time period. Yet it's stood to be a classic due to the teasing style of outlaw fun and the chemistry and classy performances of two legends like Redford and Newman made it stand the test of film history time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one seems to be better on reflection. After seeing it 24 hours ago, I think more highly of it than when I was actually watching it. The movie entertained me, but most of the time I was thinking "this is pretty overrated". Yet right now I want to watch it again! This is probably mostly due to the unique screen chemistry shared by the two leads, Paul Newman (Butch) and Redford (Sundance). The famed robbers probably weren't as charming as these two, but who cares? It's a classic character study of the extrovert, Butch, and the introvert, Sundance, who bicker but can't really live without each other. What I find striking is how this menage a trois angle, with Katherine Ross as schoolteacher Etta, plays out. She may be in love with them both, or may just have nothing better to do. They like having her around, but they are really in love with each other. Nary are they apart, and Etta fades into the background so that when she leaves we don't even notice. Ross may be accused of playing bland but I think that was what was intended with the character. Then again, director Hill had her banned off set apart from doing her scenes, so it couldn't have helped her with the part.I didn't like the sepia bits at all. The opening credits seemed ripped straight from Penn's "Bonnie And Clyde". And the film wasn't as funny as it makes out to be (the line "Who ARE those guys?" wears out fast). The song "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" jars. Some scenes I really liked, others I didn't. But I'll go back to it, because I thought Newman and Redford were special together. Obviously audiences felt it too, as they teamed again later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassidy vs Cassidy, Curry vs Curry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun naming trivia: Butch Cassidy, played by Paul Newman, has a fight with Kid Curry (Harvey Logan), played by Ted Cassidy. "Kid Curry" is later used as the name of one of the similar heroes in "Alias Smith &amp; Jones", ironically played by Ben Murphy, the Paul Newman look- alike! Cassidy fights Cassidy, Curry fights someone who looks like the other Curry...This is a very good movie, although not perfect. The story about the two charming outlaws, with more or less truth behind it, is pretty good, although a bit over the top sometimes. The ambition to tell the story about the real outlaws is undone more than once by over- simplifications and dramatic effects. Fortunately, the movie has qualities beyond that.I think that the fine performances by Redford and Newman is what holds it together. That, plus the good photography, and the fact that the script most likely was very original at the time. Later, the "Alias Smith &amp; Jones" TV series shows what would have happened if they had been granted amnesty, which they are denied in the movie, resulting in a lighter version of the story.So, if you want something less bloody than "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid", get "Alias Smith &amp; Jones". If, on the other hand, you like "Alias Smith &amp; Jones", this is the original that you can't miss!A classic, definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redefined The Western Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, I know. . .many can take issue with the title above. Consider Sergio Leone's "spaghetti" Westerns, or Sam Peckinpah's brutal "The Wild Bunch." Both directors broke ground, but in my very humble opinion neither had the same impact on the genre that director George Roy Hill commanded when BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID hit the big screen in 1969. This film took a Western and injected it with a healthy dose of pop culture. The soundtrack bears this out--even to the point of treating us with the pre-MTV music video, "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." Ever see a John Wayne movie of the Sixties that had jazz singers humming the soundtrack? Didn't think so. Even more compelling is the story, a story about two bank robbers trying to hang onto the Old West in a rapidly changing world. They're outlaws, but they're the "good guys," totally likable and captivating. The viewer is pulling for them to escape the law, plan their next move, rob another day. The ending is inevitable, yet tastefully and poignantly done. Much has been made about the chemistry between Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy) and Robert Redford (Sundance)--and rightfully so. The dialogue, banter, timing between these two wonderful actors is flawless, brilliant, overwhelming. There are classic lines ("Who are those guys?") and scenes (Butch's "rules" for a knife fight) that will live in cinematic lore forever. Katharine Ross as Etta Place ("I'm 25, single, a schoolteacher, and that's the pits.") is a wonderful addition to the cast as Sundance's girlfriend and soulmate to both outlaws. Equally innovative was the film's cinematography--starting in grainy black and white and changing to vivid color as Butch and Sundance ride over breathtaking scenery. BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID ushered in the contemporary Western, and I'm darned glad it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is just a phenomenal film starring two of the biggest studs of their time: Robert Redford and Paul Newman.Butch Cassidy is indescribably great. It has such a unique feel to it that I was unable to feel on any other film I have ever seen. When I watched this film, I stood in aw after I had comprehended the job that Paul Newman and Robert Redford did. Those two guys completely sucked me in, and almost made it feel as if I was right there next to them throughout the entire movie.Although bank robbing fugitives, Paul Newman and Robert Redford still make Butch Cassidy and Sundance likable people. Even though they did rob banks, you had an odd feeling of wanting to root for them.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is Astronomically flawless. From the start of the movie until the very end, you are at the edge of your seat, experiencing laughter, adrenaline, gasps, and perhaps even tears when it comes to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest Western I ever saw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Western is for real! "Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid" were one of the toughest outlaws in the West, yet they made their mark in history. Butch(Paul Newman) and Sundance(Robert Redford) new the tricks of the trade on robbery. He and his gang would rob the Union Pacific RR and other banks just to get their kicks. I liked the part where the gang would have Harvey Logan(Ted Cassidy, Lurch on the "The Addams Family", and the Narrator of "The Incredible Hulk") be in charge of the robberies. Butch and the Kid wouldn't allow it. So they fight about it and Logan is put down fast. Then there's Etta Place(Katherine Ross, "The Graduate") who woos both the Kid and Butch. I like the bicycle scene where the song "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head". That scene would be mimicked in "The Great Muppet Caper" Yes these two would go all the way in robbing banks, but when the price goes up, they reroute to Bolivia. Ever since they been east, the trio had plenty of fun without robbing a bank in that area. Yep, they went down in Bolivia, or did they? I heard resources that they survived the attack despite the wounds. But who's to say? This is a true story, despite a few changes I liked it though. The gun shooting duo of Butch and Sundance lives on in history. 5 stars!</fullReview>

The movie owes a lot to the terrific screen-play but added together with the fine cast and able direction it's a winner.

		<shortDescription>Not your traditional western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Some spoilers!It is an important clarification to make that 'Butch Cassidy' thrives on legend, on not being too realistic, but balancing realism and fantasy over a thin line. This is not your John Ford western (noble and loving of the land), nor is it your Sam Peckinpah western (realistic and bloody), nor is it your Sergio Leone western (gritty and stylish). It is in a class all its own, courtesy of George Roy Hill, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Conrad Hall, and, of course, Burt Bacharach, who won the Academy Award for best score.The obvious story is that of the two "aging bandits" (their not really either), who escape from the law. There are those memorable moments, such as the train robbery with a little too much dynamite (and the employee of Mr. E.H. Harriman), the chase into the rocks ("Who are those guys?"), and the "straight" job working for a mine in Bolivia (and the owner who really loves his tobacco). But the more subtle draw to the story, in my opinion, is the legend behind it. There are little points made like "Most of What Follows Is True", but the biggest point is made in the last still frame. Sure we see them run out, and sure we hear the Bolivian captain yell "Fire!", but can you really say they are killed? Remember, these guys are the two-bit legends of the west, resourcful in all they do. That is the beauty of this film-they're real, but not over-the-top real.The cinematography is absolutely magnificant (point-in-case: the bicycle seen where the camera is on the other side of an old fence, allowing some light to be seen), the music is poignant and appropriate (yes, even the scatting singers-it progresses the plot well), and, of course, the pitch-perfect chemistry between the witty Newman, and the tough Redford. This one is a must; a one of a kind!</fullReview>

I checked it out with and without the commentary on a DVD, and it was just fine either way. Just good old-fashioned American movie making, something you can watch with your kids and not worry about anything too embarrassing cropping up (save for the hot scene where Sundance gets back with Ms. Ross-who never looked better). Nothing too revealing came out of the DVD interviews with Newman and Redford from the early nineties, but it seemed like a nice trip down memory lane for both them and me. However, Redford did seem to really enjoy the scene where Butch kicked Ted Cassidy ("Lurch") in a "very sensitive area"!</fullReview>

Still, BUTCHCASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID is a highly enjoyable flick that exploits the true story (not that it really mattered) about the two real-life outlaws. Packed with gunfights, chases on horseback, and the hilarious chemistry between the two stars, BUTCH AND SUNDANCE is the most fun for any fan of the western, and even non-discriminating fans.

Redford and Newman are a fantastic double act and look as good as anybody ever has in cinema in this movie. I wouldn't say the film is fantastic in itself but what does make it a classic is the cinematography , the funny script (not the actual story) and the two lead actors. It does make me wonder why in their later years Robert Redford and Paul Newman have kept their film appearances down to a minimum and why they haven't done a film together since the 70's. I'm not sure if they fell out but one thing is for sure the chemistry they produced together in this film is a rare thing indeed. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure we all have one film that we see and ask the question " what is all the fuss about !? " for me BCATSK is that film. It's far beyond my comprehension how this film was so popular with filmgoers and critics. Although I think critics jumped on the band wagon over time in part due to its popularity as I think it was coolly received when initially released . Whatever the case may be its my personal candidate for most over rated film ever ! To start with I didn't find any of its lame dialogue witty or funny. I specially hated the initial scene with Redford and Ross " keep going teacher lady and Why can't you ever be on time " also the closing lines between Redford &amp; Newman were also unfunny and corny. My recollection of the trailers for the film gave me the impression this was an action film and I consider it to be a contemporary of films of its time Bonnie &amp; Clyde and The Wild Bunch. Those were truly great films while BCATSD was a pale imitation. The few action scenes in the film were too lightweight and the only memorable moment in the film for me was when Butch &amp; Sundance kill bandits during a period where they try to go straight and Sundance comments " well we've gone straight " When the film tried to get serious and hard edged the producers bailed out badly at the end. Our Hollywood pretty boys were freeze framed at the conclusion instead of being graphically shot to pieces as was the norm for the time and had they the courage to film it that way it would have given the film some power. I'm sure they would tell you that it was not the intention of the film to go in that direction but this was to be a fun light film. Light yes fun perhaps to those amused by the dialogue but nothing else. I'm sure the Newman Redford combo and chemistry had more to do with the film's success than anything else. It was nicely photographed and had a good score but what is this movie about and what is it saying to us !? The Pinkerton pursuit was overlong and I think in part due to the lack of any real script. I got the impression they wrote it as they went along. I don't think BCATSK was a bad film just a mediocre one that just happened to become an all time classic.</fullReview>

The highlight of the film for me was a fantastic chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are being hunted down by a relentess posse of men. The banter between the two leads is fantastic, the only minus point I would give this picture is the music, it was just odd, and didn't seem to fit the film, especially Raindrops keep falling on my head, ugh! Apart from that...an excellent film and one of my favourite westerns ***8/10***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often, I see a "must see" movie and say to myself "what's all the hoopla all about?" and this describes my reaction to this movie perfectly. I'm not saying it's a bad movie disguised as a good one (such as The English Patient or 2001) but it just seemed so incredibly ordinary. Now I know that my scoring the movie a 6 won't affect its overall score and there are TONS of reviews that say it was great, but I just hope against hope that I am not 100% alone on this. There were some scenes I liked, such as the fight scene, but so much of it left me cold (particularly the music--very popular then, but kinda hokey to me). If you want to see a better Redford and Newman pairing, watch THE STING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Beatles Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question is not whether this film is good, but why it was so phenomenally popular, and is remembered so fondly. Unless you were there, it is hard to understand the context. This is a Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes. Check out the John and Paul caracatures, complete with Sgt Pepper moustache. The photography is ripped out of Warren Beatty's mind, and casually surrealistic. The musical scenes, especially the bike scene, are inspired by the Hard Days' Night school.A distance from reality is established in every detail: the overexposed photography often lapsing into sepia, the anachronistic dialog, the `look at me relax' approach to acting, and the abstract, supernatural posse composed of legends who are not supposed to come here. Someone was able to put his finger on how to package a revolution for consumption. This commercialization is of course why the greater promise of that revolution never appeared. This film made Robert Redford famous, a generous soul and minor talent, and it is easy to see why he would be proud. But Paul Newman knew better even then, and I suppose he regrets having participated. No matter, he has real legacies.When I reviewed it last week, the Beatle connection was immediately obvious. And I was struck by the Katherine Ross character. In 1969, how we wished Yoko had been like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>did this cross the line and then some. It looks beyond fake, staged and cheap even for its time. The cast is ridiculous to say the least, I understand Newman was partly behind the production so he must've been some big time narcissistic douche to think he could portray Butch Cassidy. According to Hollywood all historically notable people who ever lived were handsome pretty boys. I bet when they come up with a remake which shouldn't take long, they'll try to cast DiCaprio who apparently resembles every notable character who ever lived and some other pretty eyes boy. The release date for this along other overrated films turned out to be instances of perfect timing, apparently the 60's were perfect or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am compelled to rant for a moment. Anyone familiar with the "Reviews" system in the Rotten Tomatoes Community knows about the little sidebar that shows up when you write. It shows the three most recent user reviews for that particular picture. At this moment, I'd like to share the kind of unfortunate crap that people think about movies: "Watch it, that is all." "Probably the first of the westerns with slapstick humor" "One of the best Westerns ever made, Paul Newman and Robert Redford make one of the best pairings in cinema history." ...what? I honestly want to see a list of the pictures these people have seen that they would consider "Western." BUTCH is about as much of a Western as NO COUNTRY. It's an homage from a much different time. BUTCH is what happens if you take a bunch of cocky youths out of their VW Rabbit, give them a joint, make them watch THE TIN STAR, and then hand them a camera. Indeed, this is precisely what makes BUTCH such an enduring picture. It preserves both a tested cinematic format and the edginess of 1969. But is it deserving of the label "one of the best Westerns ever made"? No way. It is a shameless carbon-copy of BONNIE &amp; CLYDE. The second half of the film is remarkably slow. And, those who have seen it will understand, it is too damn pretty. I will agree that Newman and Redford make an endearing couple. Redford's passion for cinema is tangible and Newman follows his impossibly charming lead. But there's something else. I never pick up on cinematic homoeroticism. But here? Even Little Ms. Robinson can't calm them down. Those who point to DAYS OF HEAVEN as some kind of cinematographic landmark need to take another look at BUTCH. The picture-taking is so under-appreciated. Perhaps it is so because it is remarkably out of place. The camera is outrageously active. It plays around with weird and aimless focus lengths, puzzling apertures, and every zoom opportunity in sight. It doesn't fit. But that doesn't change the fact that some of the darkest, most dazzling photography of the second half of the century lies dormant in this picture. None of my evaluation changes the fact that I watched this movie with my father. I remember him recommending it to me years ago and we finally looked at it last night. He saw it in on the big screen when it came out in '69 and there is no substitute for the joy a movie lover can feel when he or she enjoys their favorite hobby with someone so close and who shares the real connection we seek.58.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman and Redford Make This a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) *** 1/2 (out of 4) After robbing one bank too many and having the law right on them and not letting up, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) decide it's time to head for Boliva. Once there they discover that the quiet life is too boring so they go back to robbing banks. Many people consider BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID to be one of the best movies of the decade and one of the greatest Westerns ever made. I'm not going to go that far on either one but there's no question that this is a great little gem that has a lot going for it. Of course, the best thing going for it are the two lead performances by Newman and Redford.It's easy to forget that when this movie was released Redford really wasn't a famous person. Sure, people knew who he was but this is the film that turned him into a superstar and it's easy to see why. He's certainly believable as the fast gunfighter but where the performance really shines is with the comic timing. Redford is really, really funny here and that laid back approach really works well. Of course Newman was already a legend by the time he made this so it's no shock how great he is.Newman and Redford simply have a wonderful chemistry and even though neither are comic actors, their timing and chemistry with each other is just so perfect that it's impossible to see anyone else in these roles. The supporting cast also features a fine performance from Katherine Ross and Strother Martin in a bit part. The film also benefits from some beautiful cinematography, which perfectly captures the vast landscapes. Throw in a nice music score and the Oscar-winning Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head and you've got a very memorable gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am in my forties and consider myself a fan of the movies. I've seen many Robert Redford and Paul Newman movies, and over the years I've seen bits and pieces of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.However, I never watched the entire movie in one sitting, and still haven't. I had no qualms with acting but rather the directing, editing or script. The movie does not stand up, which is unfortunate because George Roy Hill made wonderful movies, including the Sting and I believe a train robbery movie, but this movie was dumb, boring and lacking a plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's not to love about 'Butch Cassidy'? Three bona fide stars with much appeal, a funny script, some lovely Burt Bacharach music.I found this a very entertaining film when it was first released; indeed, one of the best films of 1969.Subsequent viewings have been disappointing. How can I put it? Lots of nice frosting and not much cake.It's viewed best as a light comedy western, I think. Then again, I like "Cat Ballou" for the same reason. And although "Butch Cassidy" has some truly funny moments, I can't think of anything as funny as Lee Marvin's "Kid Shaleen" from "Cat", for which he deservedly won an Oscar.I also think of a true classic, "Destry Rides Again", which kept a running dramatic story right along with some wonderful comedy.Don't get me wrong. Katherine Ross is very pretty. Newman and Redford are appealing, handsome male leads. It has a refreshing, quirky style. And it doesn't hurt to have one of Burt Bacharach's better movie soundtracks. (Although I find his "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" melody as over-rated as this film.)Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Redford is notorious for taking easy roles, always the 'hero' or 'anti-hero' (most likely the 'hero').Newman on the other hand is a fine actor, and has taken on some strong parts ('The Hustler', 'Cool Hand Luke'). I expect more of him.I've come to regard this film as a very entertaining and manipulative film. What's not to like about it? Redford at the height of his sex appeal, Newman's dreamy blue eyes, a very lovely Katharine Ross. It's a success. It's a very easy success.Personally, I'll take James Stewart and Dietrich's 'Frenchie' over this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid does wonderful things with mood and atmosphere. It tells the story of bank robbers Butch Cassidy (played by Paul Newman) and his partner The Sundance Kid (played by Robert Redford), based loosely on historical fact.The film is a humorous, cheerful, poetic and cinematic account of two semi-legendary outlaws, winningly acted and directed. Newman and Redford made a superb, handsome, dry-humoured double act, and every Hollywood studio wanted to reunite them after this outing. (It finally happened in 1973 in The Sting). One of the decade's great commercial successes, not least because of the song 'Raindrops Keeps Fallin' On My Head'. Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid has been part of the United States National Film Registry since 2003.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Film That Stands The Test Of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have finally come to realize what all the hoopla was about and don't know what took me so long! I have recently seen Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid and I don't think I'll ever forget it. This movie simply blew me away and, even though it's from the 60's, the film is just as fresh and relevant today and certainly holds up to any Western produced since. (I hesitate to even call it a Western either - it has more wit than most "comedies" I've seen lately.) What made this movie so great for me is the undeniable chemistry between our outlaws, Newman &amp; Redford - it's absolute perfection. This is one of the all time greatest 'buddy' films I have ever seen - you'll definitely be rooting for 'the bad guys'! The characters are so endearing and so real that I could not believe they were acting. Nothing feels forced or even scripted, it's just naturally one great ride! One of my personal favourite features of this movie is the way George Roy Hill chose to shoot the 'possey' that is sent after our two main characters - he makes the film that much better by choosing to shoot long sweeping scenes which prove highly effective. Even more intriguing is how there are several shots throughout the film where the characters are seen through objects and not always dead on (like through fences or window panes, etc). It gave me the feeling of being a voyeur instead of right there with them; which is a somewhat new feeling that I really enjoyed. Hill is an excellent story teller and I simply did not want this picture to end.Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is sure to please any movie lover despite age or favourite genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my 3 all time favorites movies along with "The good, the bad and the ugly" and "Pulp Fiction".For me this is the best movie that mix action with comedy. The chemistry between Paul Newman and Robert Redford is great. The way that Newman plays the quick Butch is very funny and is impossible not to like him, Redford is a good complement for him like the serious expert gunman Sundance.The plot of the movie is about two bank robbers Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid who are running away from the law in the old wild west, and they have a estrange love relationship with a beautiful young school teacher named Etta Place.The jokes are very clever and funny, like its famous quotes like "who are those guys?" . The final scene of the movie is one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema.You have to watch this movie, it doesn't matter if you are young or old, male or female you will enjoy it the same, this movie is clever, has action, a little of romance and it's a lot of fun. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was both my first proper Western and my first proper Paul Newman film - and I was extremely pleased with it. It combines gun shooting with romance, wit, an adventure and two characters that you can never forget: Butch Cassidy (played by Paul Newman - R.I.P) and the Sundance Kid (played by Robert Redford). You stay with these two characters and their female partner (played by Katharine Ross), the whole way and you begin to love 'em. In this film, two Western outlaws called Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, find themselves the only surviving members of their criminal gang: the Hole in the Wall gang. The two try to start building new lives, but they can still not keep away from bank robbing...I loved this film because of everything in it - the only things I did not like about this film are the endless amount of gun fightings (many of these scenes could have easily been shortened). What I enjoyed most about this film was the romance and adventure, often you feel like you are really there with BC and TSK when they gallop, canter, trot and walk their horses through the wilds of America. The wit was also a very good touch, just about necessary in my opinion - although many other people will disagree with me on this.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys gun shooting, good actors, romance, humour and amazing journeys combined! Enjoy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Roy Hill Directs A Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Roy Hill is a director who directed around 20 films, a majority of them involving either Paul Newman or Robert Redford. When he got a great script to work with like this one, and The Sting, he directed great films. When the script was not quite as good, he didn't do as well to raise the effort as with Redford in The Great Waldo Pepper.This film based upon the real Hole in The Wall gang story is lavishly treated here and the story is a winner. The triangle of Redford-Newman &amp; Katherine Ross is exploited magnificently &amp; this film is one of the better of the westerns of the late 1960's though there are a lot of great westerns that seemed to come out in the 1960's.If your a fan of westerns, this one holds up next to classics like The Wild Bunch and some others. This film has more fluff than the former, but it still is a classic in many ways on it's own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This phenomenally successful Western about lovable bank robbers made Redford into a star and spawned a drove of buddy-buddy movies. The main attraction here is the chemistry and the witty banter between Newman and Redford, which is so enjoyable that it makes up for Hill's pretentious direction. Ross's role is so inconsequential that she shouldn't have bothered to show up. The plot is very thin and the film has little rhythm to it. The "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" sequence is silly, and the long montage of still pictures before they head to Bolivia kills the film's momentum. This film is the antithesis of "The Wild Bunch," the great Western released the same year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a true work of art that combines action, thrill, romance and humour. Newman and Redford make the best on screen couple, with Newman playing the colourful and fast witted Butch Cassidy and Redford playing the reserved quick shooter the Sundance Kid.The film holds many memorable scenes including the knife fight that you think is going to be messy, but cleverly ends before it has even started, with hilarious consequences. The train robbery with Woodcock was truly legendary in the way that Cassidy is able to leer Woodcock out of the carriage and the way in which they blow the safe with a little too much dynamite. Also the scene where they try and rob a Bolivian Bank without speaking the language. These were just a few of the side splitting scenes. Then we have the more touching moment shared with Newman and Ross on the bicycle to "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head", a true cinematic masterpiece. The film would not be a Western without action of which there is plenty of, including the scene where they are escaping from the gunmen. The most memorable and moving scene of the whole film is the gun fight, between the two heroes and the Bolivian law enforces. Not only do we witness the heroes becoming wounded, but they continue to share their electrifying wit with one another, even when they are at the lowest.The film finishes spectacularly with the two heroes running out to confront the Bolivian law enforcers, not realising that the Bolivian army has in fact gathered. You are then left with a freeze frame of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, while all you hear is gun shots in the background.</fullReview>

I can't think of another duo in a movie that had such a great mix together. So may great one liners you can't even get through all of them. I still laugh my arse off when they first arrive in Bolivia and Redford steps in crap and gives that look to the camera like, what the heck are we doing here.

		<fullReview>We can well remember seeing a television special about the making of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969). It was some years ago, probably in the late 1970's and was very informative to a really uninitiated kid like myself. In an interview with the screenwriter, William Goldman, he revealed much about the motivation in writing the story and the intricacies of putting together a story part fiction, part legend, part true happenings.Mr. Goldman said that while there had been countless numbers of screenplays and movies about Jesse James, but not one had been written about Butch and Sundance. He had set out to do something about that. It would appear that now, after nearly forty years, that he had succeeded.From the very start, it became apparent that the story would certainly be something that was very different. Whereas there seemed to be certain criteria unofficially established to render a story a "Western", Goldman, while keeping all this in mind, struck out in another direction. He gave the two outlaws full three dimensional personalities, idiosyncrasies, virtues and foibles. In short, they were rendered "human", or as close as a filmed characterization could come.Starting off the story in "town", where Butch Cassidy(Paul Newman) is obviously casing the joint in planning a future job. He observes changes at the town's bank. There are more locks, a guard is on duty at all times during business hours. The establishment closes promptly at 2 O'Clock closing time. "What happened to the old bank?", Butch laments. "It was beautiful!" "People kept robbing it.", matter-of-factly replies the Bank Guard.Just down the street a piece sat the Sundance Kid, busily engaged in a mid-afternoon Poker Game. Sundance has been winning, and exception is taken to the fact by one of his opponents. Accusing Sundance of cheating, and threatening him with harm, standing and making it obvious that he would draw and fire at the Kid, if he didn't leave the money on the table and vacate the establishment.Butch enters and observes that there was a short supply of brotherly love at the Poker Table. Butch attempts to mediate the dispute. Sundance is as vehement about his innocence as his accuser was about his accusation of cheating. Arriving at the conclusion that his peace making is getting nowhere, Butch 'throws in the towel' with the final remark, "I can't help you, Sundance!" News of his opponent's being the Sundance Kid brings a sobering effect on the accuser. "I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating!", was his next remark, as he acquiesced to Butch's request to invite Subdance to stay, which he didn't. The two then ride away from town toward their hide out at 'Hole in the Wall'.This entire opening sequence was filmed in a sort of old fashioned Sepia Toned print. It is a process which is not color, nor is it Black &amp; White. It was very effectively used, a real grabber to the audience.The effect was further amplified by use of a succession of close-ups. Eyes, clocks, locks, latches and faces all take their turn in being essayed by the camera lense's revealing encounters.As the pair rides off from town to their rendezvous with the Gang, the presence of full-color film fades onto the screen. It was a well planned and executed gimmick to grab hold that audience's attention.From then on, we follow the exploits of the Whole in the Wall Gang, its internal disputes, internal politics, etc. We also find out that an all star posse of specially hired lawmen whose only object was to hunt down and kill Butch and Sundance.Oh, and of all the fine performances turned in by suppoprting players, we must make mention of three in particular. They are: Kenneth Mars as the long-winded, short on influence town Marshall, Struther Martin as Percy Garris, American Mining Company Boss in Bolivia, and Jeff Corry as Marshall Ray Bledsoe, whose performance was absolutely pivotal.It was about this very point that Author Goldman said that he had gotten the most grief from "the Suits" at 20th Century-Fox. After all, the outlaw pair leave the good old USA for the mining country in Bolivia. Now, no real American would do a thing like that, not even an American Outlaw! But, alas they did do that thing! That old TV special, previously mentioned, did reveal a lot about parts of the film that were excised from the full body of the work. This served as enlightenment about some aspects of the movie that we had been wondering about.For example take the very elaborate opening credits scenes depicting a train robbery by "The Whole in the Wall Gang" as shown by the Thomas Edison Company.(all shown as the Burt Bacharach original Film Score starts in, slowly at first with a couple of Piano keys.) Why such extravagance for opening credits? As it turns out, the depiction of the silent film was from a deleted scene that had the Trio (Butch, Sundance and Etta) viewing a primitive Edison film in a Bolivian City. This was supposed to have actually happened! And the guys were very angry 'cause the Edison Co. Director got it all wrong!This would seem to be a trait that is all too common, even today!</fullReview>

The charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid lie in the chemistry between Newman and Redford, 2 bandits whose caustic wit and blunt humor are the lifeblood of this classic. A lot of what contributes to the elegance of this film is the touch of styling that director George Roy Hill brings into it, from the use of sepia tones in the opening sequences, the still montages done to Burt Bacharach and of course the way William Goldman just reiterates it in the narrative and puts it plain that this is a story about 2 men running from the law, trying to make their way, and before (SPOILERS) they eventually go down in a blaze of glory, the final lines of dialogue prove that their company and aspiration may have been worth it all.El dinero no es nuestros!"What are you doing?"

The two main characters open up a conversation about the white hatted man but that's it, and he remains a mystery through out the film. Also,If this movie had been done today, that final shoot out would have definitely been shown in all of its bloody, bullet riddled climax. So what's with the freeze frame? For more specific blood and guts imagery, see The Wild Bunch; another western classic. Why it's damned Good?! Any western film enthusiast who were to list the top 5 westerns of all time would be a fool not to include this one on their list. It's got a little of Everything. I really don't know where to start, and I would bore a reader if I were to list all of it's splendid and great attributes. (Authenticity, Newman &amp; Redford, cinematography, score, comic touch, long chase) Ahah, ahem ... So to name one; It's flow. In todays movies, there's too much cutting away to a "meanwhile" scene. See any of todays movies and it's the next day or it cuts to the next scene with the same character in a matter of seconds. This movie carries you from the 2nd train robbery to the great Butch and Sundance free fall escape and it all takes up a big chunk of the film with a nicely blended, easy, highly entertaining, unflinching, funny, captivating manner that is top notch and rarely paralleled film making. It's flow. I don't care how many times they say "Who are those guys?", I wish they had said it at least one more time" Over all, the classic western is near myth, so please treat yourself if you haven't seen BC&amp;TSDK. Why this one was past over for Midnight Cowboy as best picture Oscar is beyond me.</fullReview>

Still, the movie is far away from being a pretentious western epic as so many genre flicks from that period in time were. This is a fleet-footed and funny movie with clever dialog and great performances by both, Newman and Redford.Sometimes it drags on a bit, but that maybe because my perception has been spoiled by today's fast-edited action movies. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" really is the Hollywood classic it is made out to be. Even the soundtrack is unforgettable. It's a must for everyone who considers himself a lover of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jules et Jim" goes West.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many Westerns can be read as having homoerotic subtexts with the advantage of 21st century attitudes and the apparent need of modern - day critics to seem "aware" of what was never intended in the first place.This tendency slowly but surely prepared the ground for film makers to introduce openly gay characters into the genre until it climaxed - if you'll pardon the expression - in "Brokeback Mountain",a full -on adaptation of a charming short story by Annie Proulx. In 1969,even at the rag - end of the liberal 1960s ,the world wasn't ready for a story of man - love between chaps in chaps,especially one starring such hetero heroes as Mr P.Newman and Mr R.Redford .So Mr Hill gave them the very pretty Miss K.Ross as a shared love interest that neither of the boys,frankly,seemed very interested in,being pretty much wrapped up in each other. With this strangely asexual menage a trois borrowed from "Jules et Jim" (complete with anachronistic bicycle riding sequence)and other devilish nouvelle vague tricks Mr Hill possibly hoped to set the Western along a new path but,in fact,succeeded in closing the genre down for a few years allowing Mr C.Eastwood to re - invent it almost single - handedly. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is wonderful entertainment,witty, clever,beautifully photographed and a hymn to the physical beauty of Messrs Newman and Redford but it isn't a great Western.In fact it's almost a parody of Western conventions. In pursuit of a fast buck (always somebody else's) Butch and Sundance are like a pair of computer geeks let loose in "P.C.World" as they rob banks and trains more or less at will and with a sort of open - faced innocence.Moving to Bolivia (the way you do) they come up against the army who do not share the widespread vicarious admiration their banditry had apparently caused back home and when cornered in some adobe hacienda decide to go out literally with all guns blazing - cue stop action and sepia fade.A nicely mythic ending that rather spoilt the chances of Butch and Sundance Part 2. There are no incorruptible lawmen,there is no great quest ,no wrongs are righted,no maidens saved.The world has not been made a better place by their passing - except for bank owners and railroad clerks.In short "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is not really a Western at all. But it is immense fun and I enjoyed it hugely. The boys got together a few years later to make "The Sting" which was better in every department - especially the music.I mean,"Raindrops keep falling on my head"? What was that all about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, I've seen the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was an interesting film, and one that stands out for its uniqueness in my memory.The movie sometimes plays more like a really long music video than a traditional western, and the soundtrack- which includes "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"- is wonderful. The movie sometimes takes intermissions to display long passages of time through a series of photographs- all accompanied by the music, of course.The movie is undoubtedly a comedy with only a few serious moments. We follow the trail of the kindly, talkative "Butch Cassidy" (Paul Newman) and his polar opposite, the dark, quiet, "Sundance Kid" (Robert Redford), and The Sundance Kid's girlfriend, Etta Place (Katherine Ross), who, in typical western lass style fits in perfectly with the two men.Our stars are the outlaws, and as is natural in this kind of film, we find ourself rooting for the "bad guys" and hoping that the mean, mean government people (why can't they understand it's not a crime, just another way of life?) don't catch up to them.The movie is a lot of fun, and leaves little to be desired, although it fails when it comes to matching the depth and seriousness of other westerns when it comes to the plot, and may bore some viewers.Oh, and of course, it is missing the famous "draw." Considering Sundance's god-like abilities with the pistol, though, that may have just been for the best.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The picture is an enjoyable Western-comedy with an interesting characterizing personages about the celebrated leaders of the ¨Wild Bunch gang¨ of train robbers,they were one of the last old-style bandits of the West.It's narrated by means of an relentless pursuit by a posse which leads to the two protagonists along with Etta Place(Katharine Ross) to Bolivia where continue their criminal activity. Born Robert Parker(Butch Cassidy as Paul Newman) and Harry Longbaugh(Sundance Kid as Robert Redford).It seems they were eager to take up a life of crime.This notorious pair became rustlers in the mid-90,gaining fame as leaders of the Wild Bunch,a gang of train robbers.Butch adopted the name Cassidy in admiration of Mike Cassidy,a rustler who taught him to shot and steal livestock,he was dubbed Butch from his short time working in a butcher's shop.Still determined on a life of crime he formed a gang,and robbed a banks and he moved into trains robberies later.One of the main gang was Sundance ,they were likable fellows described in a Pinkerton wanted poster as having a cheerful and affable manners.It is said that,though a crack shot,they never murdered anybody and disliked gratuitous violence.They had the quick wit and strength of character to dominate more desperate men.With the Pinkerton and railroad agents hot on their trail,the Wild Bunch broke up and both sailed to South America after the turn of century and disappeared there ,possibly dying in a shoot-out in 1909 near La Paz. The film was a deservedly sensational box-office hit smash so it deftly blends action,spoof, Western with delightful performances. The motion picture won Oscars for Conrad Hall(Cinematography),Original Score (Burt Bacharach),William Goldman(Screenplay),and for the famous song titled : ¨Raindrops keep falling on my head¨ and nominations to director George Roy Hill and players.Followed by an inferior sequel in 1979 by Richard Lester : ¨The early days of Butch Cassidy(Tom Berenguer) and Sundance Kid(William Katt)¨.</fullReview>

I loved it when I was in school when it first came out and years later its still funny, sad, and the movie that inspired the buddy films, none of which are as good. Redford is capable of comedic roles, if you see Barefoot in the Park, you know what I mean. Yes, they were great together again in the Sting but that movie didn't have the chemistry that Butch and Sundance have, and Katherine Ross looks every bit as gorgeous as she did in The Graduate. Terrific cinematography, and comic but insightful dialogue. And who can forget the scene when the horses come flying out of the train. Perhaps we have all felt at some time in our lives the way Katherine Ross did when she wanted to go to Bolivia: "I'm 28, single and a teacher".....</fullReview>

Here we got hero gang leader Butch Cassidy and his side kick the Sundance Kid. Both great at what they do, hold up banks and trains, they realize it is downright time they move on especially since the law is not starting to look as lame as it used to on this side of the continent no more. They are being chased by who I believe are their old gang members, but one can't tell. They both like to spend their money on booze, brothels, good food and finish it that way and have to start from scratch every single time. They both respectfully adore on e woman however who they never fight over because they both have her heart and they are ultimately like genuine brothers themselves till the very inevitable end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Far As Westerns Go, This One Probably Tops Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two outlaws rob banks and trains until the heat becomes a little too hot, and they flee to Bolivia where the bank robbing starts all over again.When you're dealing with the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, you can pretty much guarantee yourself a quality film. As of this review, the movie was sitting as the #135th of all time. I rated it a little lower than many people, but I don't deny the film's power. Redford and Newman are the Damon and Affleck of their generation.If nothing else, the movie is great because it is now iconic and to really understand many modern films you have to appreciate what this one was. How many movies and shows have duplicated the bike riding scene with Burt Bacharach's "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Dead"? Or Sundance's gun-play? And my all-time favorite movie, "Mallrats", does a fine job of adapting the character of LaFours.) The script was written by William Goldman, probably best known for "The Princess Bride", but also "Maverick". I have no doubt the light humor owes a debt to Goldman.The robberies and such were great, the horse-riding was well-done and very believable. I especially enjoyed the dynamite and the character of Woodcock. And the director's use of angle shots to make the mountains look even more impassable? Superb.Katharine Ross is gorgeous and a strong character who holds her own with the wily bandits. She could have had a larger part (except then they might have to rename the movie).Fantastic, epic and inspiration for both film-makers and bank robbers. Long live the legend of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's a buddy flick - that was nothing new even back then...remember "Some Like it Hot"? The buddy motif, of course, is the license to have fun: reading lines, improvising lines, squabbling over who's going to do what (and in the making of this, Newman and Redford switched roles right before filming -- imagine that happening in a studio feature today).But it's so much more. What makes it so timeless is the way the seemingly disparate parts are composed into a greater whole: a framing reference to a silent movie ("Great Train Robbery"), 'silent movies' within the larger movie, stories told with the motion of penny arcade viewing slides, sepia tones to match the changes in the plot's direction...And cinematically, the centerpiece is the masterful composition of the chase scene, with our heroes occupying the foreground, the posse always in the background, and their bantering comments on what they think they're seeing, which tells the story of what *we're* seeing. Dead on target, essential viewing.</fullReview>

Bear in mind that Steve McQueen was slated for Redford's part, but because Zanuck refused his demand to get top billing, he left. Zanuck also wanted Brando and/or Warren Beatty involved, but Hill and Newman said no.Lucky for us!But the average rating for this film on IMDb is a mere 8.1 out of 10. Youse guys is tough!

		<shortDescription>Still Great Contemporary-Feeling Western Classic in a Robust DVD Package Heavy on Extras</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me how incredibly well this 1969 western has held up after all these years. At once classically structured and satirically executed, director George Roy Hill and screenwriter William Goldman have pulled together a supremely entertaining period picture that caters to contemporary sensibilities to this day. It is to their credit that the film remains true to the characters and never gets too broad during its quickly paced 110-minute running time. The story naturally revolves around the legendary outlaws who robbed banks at the turn of the last century. Their escapades are divided roughly into three sections in the film. The first is the introductory set-up where their opposite yet complementary personalities are established. Leading the motley Hole in the Wall Gang, they ultimately pull off a train robbery with an excess of dynamite. The second part is an extended chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are chased relentlessly by a group of unknown bounty hunters.The third and final part details their escape to Bolivia where they are determined to go straight but get caught up with local bandits and find their infamous past catching up with them. It seems inconceivable to have anyone other than Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the title roles. As the more established star at the time, Newman is characteristically laconic as Butch. His innate likability is enhanced by his rascally manner and crack comedy timing. In the more traditional gunslinger role, Redford provides the ideal partner with his flinty manner and unavoidable charisma. In between them is Katharine Ross, fresh from "The Graduate", who plays Etta with sensual élan, though she does not figure in the most critical scenes. Of course, Burt Bacharach's instantly recognizable musical score is here, and while there is an anachronistic feel to such 1960's-sounding pop music over a western, it somehow works because the attitude of the film seems so modern. Even the comically romantic bicycle sequence manages to preserve its buoyancy thanks to the inane but undeniably catchy "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head".Conrad Hall's vibrant, burnished cinematography deserves special mention as it has been preserved well in the 2006 Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD package. The rest of the two-disc package is robust though bordering on overkill, adding on to the features that were already included in the previous 2000 Special Edition DVD. Retained from that edition is the interesting combination of perspectives provided by Hill, Hall, lyricist Hal David and associate producer Bob Crawford in their joint commentary track. New is separate and equally insightful commentary from Goldman. Another holdover from the previous edition is the forty-minute vintage documentary, "The Making of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid", a still terrific featurette from 1970 with participation from Newman, Goldman, Hill and Redford.There are three new documentaries - a 2005 retrospective look at the film called "All of What Follows is True: The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"; a fact-check featurette called "The Wild Bunch: The True Tale of Butch &amp; Sundance"; and the somewhat repetitive "History Through the Lens: Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid: Outlaws Out of Time", a cumulative effort which combines elements of all the other documentaries into one ninety-minute feature. Lots of great insight is provided on the 1994 interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, Goldman and Bacharach. A deleted scene is also included with Hill's commentary (since the audio had been lost) - it is a disposable transitional scene where Butch and Sundance are watching newsreel footage of themselves in a Bolivian theater while Etta quietly leaves to the train station. Lastly, there are trailers for eight of Newman's vintage films. This is definitely a robust package for one of the great films of the 1960's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid tells the true story of two bank/train robbers from the old west who lead the Hole in the Wall gang. When a man they continuously rob gets sick and tired of it, he hires a "superposse" to track down Butch and Sundance and kill them. This causes Butch and Sundance to flee to Bolivia and end up trying to go straight, but to no avail. Right from the opening scene to the iconic ending, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is perfect through and through.I bought the Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD on a whim because I'd heard so much about it, and boy am I glad I did. I made a goal for myself to set out and see the classic iconic films. This movie was a great way to kick it off. This movie mixes everything that makes a good movie. It has funny, witty dialogue, great acting, great direction, great cinematography, great everything. Whenever a movie can be dead serious and deathly funny at the same, it's gotta be good. There is not one dull point in this movie. Throughout the entire film there is funny and witty scenes. The scenes where Butch and Sundance are constantly being chased by the "superposse" are both funny and tense. There is one great scene where Butch and Sundance have to jump off a cliff, but Sundance can't swim. Then there's a scene where they have to shoot their way out of a tight spot but Butch can't shoot. Both characters have weaknesses, and both have their strengths. I absolutely loved the ending of this movie. It was one of those endings where it's so obvious what happens that they don't even have to show you. The movie just freeze frames and we hear the sounds of what's going on. It gives you chills.Paul Newman and Robert Redford are both great actors, and they play their roles to perfection. They are so cool, that the characters are people who you want to be like (uh, except for the robbing and killing, of course).Overall, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it's so well made, I recommend it to any fan of classic, iconic films.10/10</fullReview>

Everything that needs to be said about this film has probably been said a hundred times. It is THE classic of its type: the only truly funny Western I've ever seen. For those who are dog tired of Westerns, this remains one to search for. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are great together (as they were later in "The Sting"), the dialog is worthy of any comedy of any description, and the direction by George Roy Hill manages to embed the story beautifully in its era -- during the period of the Spanish-American war. I haven't seen the "pre"quel (awful word) and don't plan to but this is a true original and deserves its reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year 1969 may have been the greatest one for westerns ever. We had "Once Upon a Time in the West", "The Wild Bunch" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". The last one has Paul Newman in one of his coolest roles ever, with Robert Redford showing the flair for acting that he would soon bring to many other flicks. That scene on the cliff is really something else, as is the movie's final scene.There are some scenes in the movie that look sort of like they were thrown in for comic relief. There's the bicycle scene and the first time that they try to rob a bank in Bolivia. But overall, this is truly a great movie.It's weird to think that I only saw this movie a few weeks after I first learned of Paul Newman's existence (from the movie "I Wanna Hold Your Hand"). My mom said that when she saw it when it first came out, she thought for about a minute that a certain scene involved a rape. But anyway, it's a movie that you gotta see. Also starring Katharine Ross and Strother Martin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is without a doubt one of the few movies that you will enjoy in so many ways. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are a brilliant sight on the big screen in a hilarious classic that will have first-time viewers in tears of laughter. What is so genuine and extraordinary about the comedy in this movie is its originality. They aren't the same old lines spoken in every comedy today, and, just like so many classics, they aren't all sex-related. The face on Redford during half the movie is PRICELESS. Redford can say one word ("Bolivia...") and have a rolling on the floor laughing effect. Newman's calmness and, in certain times, smart responses give him the credit which he also deserves. This is a MUST SEE for anyone who hasn't had the immense pleasure of watching it yet. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate buddy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. It obviously borrowed heavily from the success two years earlier of Bonnie and Clyde where filmmakers took a story about two real life outlaws and fictionally dramatized their story with two good looking actors in the roles of the real bandits. In Bonnie and Clyde they made it a doomed romance and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid they made it two doomed buddies and a beautiful woman for a love interest. Butch in real life was Robert Parker who rode with the outlaw Mike Cassidy and used Cassidy's name as a last name and was a cattle rustler and then a train and bank robber. The Sundance Kid was Harry Longabaugh also known as Kid Curry and the Sundance Kid who was a part of Butch's Hole in the Wall gang of the 1890's and early 1900's. Etta Place is an historical mystery believed to be Ethel Place but since the Sundance Kid's mother's maiden name was Place it's likely she took that name to conceal her true identity. Belived by some to have been the female Colorado cattle rustler Ann Bassett and believed by some to have been a prostitute from Texas few believe the story that she was a schoolteacher who went west for adventure. Paul Newman and Robert Redford star in their first screen pairing along with Katherine Ross and Strother Martin, Cloris Leachman and Ted Cassidy. George Roy Hill had only directed a handful of films before this movie although all were good and he was most noted for Thoroughly Modern Millie. He would direct only eight more before he retired but had continued success with The Sting, Slapshot and The world According to Garp. Novelist and screenwriter William Goldman wrote the story. This film won three Academy Awards for Goldman's screenplay and for Burt Bacharach's music score and song Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head. It was also nominated for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Sound. The only part of this movie I don't like is the video-within-a-movie of the Raindrops song and Butch and Etta's fanciful romantic bicycle ride. I'm most people loved that sequence but it brought the pace of the film to a halt for me. despite that I would still give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly entertaining "buddy" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I wasn't cheating." Sundance's lines at the beginning of the film ring true. At least they ring true for his card game. When it came to everything else, he was hardly a straight player."Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" came out in 1969, and it has since become legend. One of the last films to come out during the PG era, it was extremely influential. It changed a lot about cinema, particularly the way that dialogue was delivered. It also changed the scope of what a "buddy" movie really is.Butch Cassidy, played by Paul Newman, is the brains, the comic, the atypical one. Robert Redford's Sundance is the typical Western star, silent and stern like Clint Eastwood in "Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" and determined like Gene Hackman in "French Connection." Together, what one gets is an offbeat dramedy that is surprisingly touching and warmhearted.The film starts out slowly, taking its time to wade through the first scene. When it gets its legs underneath itself, it starts running. Before long, our two heroes are robbing banks, trains, and whatever else they can. Katherine Ross has a wonderful supporting turn as Etta Place, the love interest of Sundance. When the two decide to head to Bolivia, they let her tag along. At first, they live clean lives, free of crime and mischievous behavior. But that doesn't last long, and our heroes are at it again, creating trouble for themselves, trouble that leads to a far too often copied ending.Overall, this is an entertaining, captivating, unconventional, wry, and touching film that will please almost everyone.</fullReview>

I note from some other posts here that a lot of Butch's fans are perplexed as to why this film hasn't really been elevated to the western pantheon. Well, IMHO Butch is far too slick, glib even, to compare to a genuine masterpiece such as The Wild Bunch. Bunch was filmed and released almost contemporaneously with Butch, but despite the similarity of source material (Butch's gang was called The Wild Bunch) any comparison between the two movies is pointlessly invidious: Bunch is profound, lyrical, challenging, complex; Butch is witty and well-made, but it's unashamedly a star vehicle. There's just no depth here. Plus the ending's a total cop-out.</fullReview>

Cassidy and Sundance exchange fire with the possey, leap from tall waterfalls and much more in this great comic adventure.The most notable part of "Butch" is definitely the screen-writing. William Goldman also pleased with "All the President's Men" and "The Princess Bride" among others. His comic, yet exciting way of writing his adventures that puts him on my list as one of the best screenwriters of all time.Of course, the performances are very well-done too. Newman is cool and smooth as Butch, but Redford's Sundance would be my favorite character. His quiet, calm way of acting in dangerous situations makes him as loved as similar characters (i.e.: Mr. Blonde from Reservoir Dogs, Tom Reagan from Miller's Crossing).Everyone loves this western, and for no bad reason, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of westerns and I dont understand why other fans of westerns have not taken this movie to heart as much as I have. All of the classic themes are still there but told more boldly than ever. The arrival of civilization and the loss of the west. In essence, the western is a tragedy about the loss of the rugged individualism, the character from which America was made. People miss this and that is why we revisit the western time and again. Modern "western" like Tombstone (which I really liked) kind of give us the window dressing of why we liek westerns (e.g., gunfights, black hats, etc.) but dont catch the main theme of the disapearing west..the tradeoff of the rugged individualism for civilization. In most westerns, this is a willing sacrifice by the west (often portrayed by noble anti-hero types). In this movie, it is not a willing sacrifice but a fight to the death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" that is particularly noteworthy. The ending of the film. It is one of the best endings I have ever seen on film. (Spoilers ahead.) Instead of showing the two men get brutally killed, they freeze-frame the men and we hear gunshots. Techniques like this make "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" such a great film, from the opening shots to the last.Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) once ruled the west with their Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. They were some of the most successful train and bank robbers in the history of the world. This story chronicles their lives as the law moves in on them and they move to Mexico, where they went straight. Unfortunately, the law still found them, and killed them. George Roy Hill's adaptation of the story is a novel one indeed. It is helped by William Goldman's smart script that seems to give each character a different trait with full, realistic dialogue, and not any cliched lines. There are no classic western "suicide" lines, where the hero says something very heroic and rushes out, firing his guns rapidly. There are no Clint Eastwood one-liners. There's humor, but not any "Make my day" lines.That's probably one of the other things that is so great about this film. The humor. There is much tongue-in-cheek, and Redford and Newman toss back a lot of lines that are funny. Not only are the lines funny, but some scenes are, too; including a scene where we first see Sundance Kid's amazing weapon talents.And let's not forget the song that made Burt Bacharach famous: "Raindrops Fallin' on My Head," which is used in the bicycle riding scene, which has been spoofed uncountable times by hundreds of films.Newman and Redford give some of the best performances of their careers. I saw Newman's critically-acclaimed "Cool Hand Luke," which was good (I thought it was a bit overrated), but he out-performs that film here."Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" isn't exactly a western, but more an adventure. An adventure about two guys who used to rule the west, and died after they tried to go straight. A film that takes a look at the lives of these two men and puts it on film. A great film told with style and wit.And one of the last lines of the film is a classic."You keep thinkin', Butch. That's what you're good at."5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to own this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recorded this film the other day and my stupid VCR cut the ending, ofwhich I am most displeased. I suspected that any film written by WilliamGoldman would be great (ah, "The Princess Bride"), and was it ever! Thebeginning was slightly slow, but then it paced up and suddenly becameimpossible to leave. I just sat there in my nightgown, heavy with acold, and my eyes widened, as did my smile.I'm not a big western fan. I could mention some comic books I liked as achild, maybe a couple of films and TV series, but that's all. And Icould think of many reasons not to like this film. It's not dirty andrealistic, for those who like that. It's not full of action. It'sremarkably un-hilarious considering how funny it is. But it's a warmfilm, showing two deeply flawed, immature men in a way that makes youwant to take them home in your pocket along with the whole film. I couldhave lived without Etta Place (or with a less bland actress in thepart), but apart from that, it's nearly perfect. Now I just want to seethose last two minutes, and then show it to everyone I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>western and not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder whether to think of the film as if it had two parts. It begins with the credits rolling next to an old theatrical projection, one reminiscent of films belonging to the epoch of the likes of Buster Keaton's "General". Then we are taken to Paul Newman's face. He is observing a bank. Probably one he intends to rob. The first 15 minutes carries a beautiful cinematography. From the black &amp; white documentary about the Hole in the Wall gang we are carried to a beginning with tones of green and yellow. Then cut, and a scene in a bar with Sundance. The only thing revealed is Sundance's facial expressions, and the voice of card players, fingers ticking on the gambling table. While the camera keeps fixed on Sundance's face, we witness a duel involving him and the guy sitting opposite him, whom we don't see, only hear. Then comes Paul Newman, whispering into Sundance's ear, asking him to let it go, being the negotiator, a cunning one. The camera still stays fixed. A feeling of isolation takes place, like disconnection, loneliness. Why the face or the fingers instead of a traditional shot involving all the elements which make up the scene? The bar, the gamblers, the table. Perhaps it was early in the film to come up with a conjecture, but I nevertheless did. This film takes the western genre, deconstructs it, and recreates it. Our sympathetic villains are quite western, the action is quite western, but once you lay hands on the details, the cinematography, disuniform timing, fast forwards, especially when they tour the country and end up in Bolivia, Butch as a cunning businessman way ahead of his time, not belonging to the West, Sundance as the notorious gunman from New Jersey, this film is created by someone who studied western and revolutionized it. Kind of like what Tarantino did with B-films I guess. And the duel takes place. And we see Sundance and Cassidy riding on their horses, with the picture transforming into color. Then we are taken to the second part of the film. Butch and Sundance running from an expert team of bounty hunters and lawmen hired to put an end to their lives. "Who are those people?" Spielberg might have decided to reveal the shark in "Jaws" in the second half of the film, being inspired by the suspense attempted to be built up by Roy Hill during the struggle of Cassidy pulling all the tricks on their "mysterious" followers and the followers figuring the truth out in every single one of them. But out of every element which makes this film so great, perhaps the most electrical component is the lead characters themselves. They are the most sympathetic bank robbers to hit the west. Cassidy being my favorite, despite being the leader of the gang, perfectly complemented by his buddy Sundance, he has never killed anyone. He doesn't bring a serious social criticism, as his robberies are not justified, he simply robs and spends money on alcohol and women, no need for an ethical interrogation on behalf of the audience. But being a robber, nevertheless he has a charm. He holds a twisted sense of humor, seems to care about human life, as he warns the clerk in the train to open up the wagon, but doesn't care enough to stop robbing the train as he blows it up despite the clerk, but after the smoke the first thing he does is check to see if the clerk is still alive. A villain with humor, respect, cunning mind, and selfish priorities. His relationship with Sundance is worthy. Throughout the second part of the film, during their fled, the director takes the oppurtunity for us to love these two. And by the time "the end" arrives, we wish they are not dead. And perhaps they are not. In Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, the gang kills a hundred people or so. Whatever the conclusion is, the end seemed to be another innovation. One has to watch Leone's westerns, and then come back to this film to see what kind of a new breathe it has brought. Perhaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Vietnam" Western without the My Lai massacre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie, no doubt a top ten Western of all time. For somebody like me, who watches a lot of Westerns from the '40's and '50's, it is striking how much more sophisticated this film is in terms of realism, wit, story presentation, editing and soundtrack. Here's what I liked:- Two of the best leading men of their generation in their best roles. Maybe the greatest buddy movie ever made.- Wonderful integration of comedy and drama.- Lots of location shooting in excellent settings. - As mentioned above, a very sophisticated production, especially in terms of soundtrack. Story maintains interest throughout, the characters are all consistent, there are only a couple of plot holes, and most importantly, we really care about these two guys.Here's where the movie fell short in a few areas:- Even though the supporting cast was good, the movie is so intently Newman/Redford focused, that the other actors don't have much to do. "Lonsome Dove", a similar buddy movie, needed to run six hours to develop its supporting cast.- The failure to develop a traditional heavy hurts the movie the most. The posse leader is faceless and almost one hundred percent off screen (there's no actor even credited for the role). I get the whole philosophy thing that Butch and Sundance aren't really the "bad guys". The "bad guy" is the inhuman corporate industrial complex, represented by the railroad and their faceless posse. In that sense, this is a "Vietnam" Western with no My Lai massacre. Fair enough, but the execution of the concept hurts the movie dramatically. Every great Western needs a vivid bad guy who's a real character with a real part, meaning dialog and stuff like that.- I'm not into the whole anti-hero thing. This movie is a sanitization and glorification of criminality. Notice that they never murder anyone. In fact, you get the impression that no innocent bystander or employee was ever harmed during one of their robberies. Really? (True, the "square" corporate railroad employee is injured by the "cool" counter- culture bank robbers in the dynamite explosion, but he's just a little bruised up and his injuries are treated as a joke).- There are a couple of substantial plot holes during the posse manhunt: 1) They appear to be fleeing off into the wilderness to escape the posse. In fact, even Butch admits they don't even know where they are anymore. Yet suddenly they show up in a small town to visit a former friend who is now the town sheriff (very amusingly played by Jeff Corey). They want to negotiate a surrender with the authorities and want their friend to relay the terms. This is confusing, but by itself isn't that big of a plot problem. The real issue is that they arrive in town riding a single horse. Unbelievably, they leave town not only still riding one horse, but without rifles. Earlier Butch was regretting that they didn't have any rifles with which to ambush the posse. Both a horse and rifles would have been easily obtainable in the town.2) It's not so clear why jumping off the cliff into the river was such an automatic passport to salvation. After all, they are now on foot with no food or water and ostensibly very far from civilization. I doubt a working pistol would have survived the soaking in the river, so they probably are without weapons. Even if we swallow the idea that that there is no possible way for "super posse" to get down the mountain and catch up to them - even though they are on foot - it's still not clear how they got to the nearest town, or even found it. If it was that easy, wouldn't it have been obvious to the posse where they would go? Wouldn't they be waiting for them there?That was actually the second time that "super posse" turned into "stupid posse". How did they let Butch and Sundance get away when they were trapped upstairs in the brothel? I mean, they had ten expert killers with guns right outside and these guys were caught by surprise and barely dressed. They went out the back? This is a clever movie. How about a clever plot device to explain their getaway from a hopeless situation?This may sound like nitpicking, but these are sloppy plot holes that could have been easily fixed.- The movie is very disrespectful to the country of Bolivia. In fact, I read that it was banned there for a long time. In the finale, are we really supposed to be rooting for these two bank robbers as they mow down young Bolivian army recruits like they are at a shooting gallery on Coney Island?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen some good westerns, and robbery films, and when you combine the two like this, the result is quite good, from BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated director George Roy Hill (The Sting). Basically robbers Butch Cassidy (BAFTA nominated Paul Newman), with all the ideas, and The Sundance Kid (BAFTA winning Robert Redford), with all action and skills, were the leaders of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. They had robbed too many trains, so a special posse eventually starts trailing them through towns, over rocks, across rivers, they won't give up easily. They do eventually go to Bolivia and manage to hide out, and carry out some successful robberies, until of course they are trapped by the authorities, and there is nowhere to go but out and meet their fate, you remember that freeze frame fade to sepia ending. Also starring Strother Martin as Percy Garris, Henry Jones as Bike Salesman, Jeff Corey as Sheriff Ray Bledsoe and George Furth as Woodcock. Newman and Redford make a great and quite exhilarating double act for this film filled with some exciting sequences, e.g. the leap off the cliff into the river, it may be long, and in my opinion a little overrated, but it is certainly a must see film. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music for Burt Bacharach, Best Song for "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" (also nominated the Golden Globe, and it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Material Not Previously Published or Produced, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Sound, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Film Editing, Best Screenplay, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains (as heroes), Robert Redford was number 61, and Paul Newman number 16 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 54 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 60 on The 100 Greatest Films, and it was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

		<shortDescription>Possibly the finest western ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film is possibly the finest western ever made. Or at least the best action western. Maybe westerns shouldn't really be lumped together but evaluated separately. Many might feel Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid shouldn't be considered superior to an important work like The Ox-Bow Incident so that's why I decided to distinguish this Newman and Redford movie as an action western. Enjoyable "feel good" films like this should be judged by entirely different standards than works like Ox-Bow or Little Big Man, etc.This movie pretty much sets the standard for visual realizations of the mythology of American western outlaws. It's very difficult to identify a single wrong move in this terrific film. It's nice escapism even though we know in real life that outlaws are never this handsome and charming and essentially harmless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect blending of script with acting of Newman and Redford.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that placed Redford on the "A list" of actors. Relatively unknown in 1967, when production began, the bosses wanted a better known actor, perhaps Steve McQueen. But Redford, just 30, turned out just perfect as the Sundance Kid. Newman as Butch Cassidy was in his early 40s and together, as they did in "The Sting", their acting chemistry resulted in this classic. At first it was panned by many critics but the story of friendship struck a chord with movie-goers and the Newman/Redford combination made it a hit.Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid were real outlaws, operating in the late 1800s and early 1900s. While the script romanticizes them quite a bit, the overall story is mostly accurate. However, there forever remained a question about what really happened to them. This movie depicts one scenario. The real Etta Place was a prostitute but here she is a school teacher, played by the beautiful Katharine Ross.The movie establishes the characters early with a bank robbery and escape. Then the middle story involves their being hunted by a hired band of 6 in retaliation for several train robberies. Humor is injected in lines such as, "If he would just pay us what it costs to hire them, I wouldn't have to steal his money anymore." They manage to escape in the great scene where they jump off a cliff into a river. Tired of running, Butch and Sundance, with Etta along, travel to New York, then take a ship to South America to start fresh.The DVD has a nice presentation in Widescreen. The extras are interesting, with modern day interviews with the main actors and others.SPOILERS FOLLOW. While the real outlaws traveled all over S. America, this movie has them going to Bolivia. There they rob banks and still are chased by the band of 6 from America. But their undoing came in a small village at the hands of the local police, bolstered by dozens of military troops called in with loaded rifles. In the final scene, both wounded, Butch and Sundance run into the little town square, pistols firing, then the picture freezes them. We hear many rifle shots, a pause, many more rifle shots from troops stationed all around. Credits roll. This depicts their demise in Bolivia, but some accounts have them going back to America to live under different names.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much a western as an adventure movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I want you to know that I'm not really a fan of westerns. There are a couple of fine ones, like for instance "Once Upon a Time in the West" and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (the movies that are commonly known as spaghetti westerns, because they were made by Italians, this time Sergio Leone), but overall this just isn't my kind of movie. But from time to time I like to forget about my dislikes for a certain genre. When I've got the chance of watching a classic movie, no matter which genre, I will not think twice.Butch and Sundance are the leaders of the 'Hole-in-the-Wall Gang', a gang that was called that way because of the way they committed their robberies. But the West is changing and is becoming more civilized - too civilized for criminals. When they have robbed a certain train a time too often, a special posse begins trailing them and is always able to stay right behind them, no matter where or how fast they run. When they finally know to escape after a daring act of bravery or foolishness (it just depends on the way you look at it), they come up with another fine plan: they will move to Bolivia, the land where life as a criminal is still great...The acting in the movie is nice and I wouldn't be able to choose between Robert Redford and Paul Newman if I had to take one for best performance. Both did a very fine job with this movie, but they had some interesting characters to work with of course. Thanks to the story, which in my opinion can't be seen as a western, but more or less as an adventure movie, this movie is still known and famous. It's original and it was probably a very daring concept in the sixties, when most westerns were still about cowboys and Indians chasing and killing each other.Despite the fact that I'm not too much a fan of westerns, I must say that I liked this one. It will never be my favorite movie, but I admit that I've seen a lot worse in the past. That's why I give this movie a 7/10. Especially people who love adventure movies will like this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never quite worked out why I like this movie so much. Based on a true story, and according the the sister of Butch Cassidy, it accurately portrays that character.Butch and Sundance are 2 wild west outlaws whose daring robberies get them chased all across the wild west in spectacular fashion. Finally they leave for Bolivia where they start a new crime spree.Taking the 1960s and 70s idea of crime as a great adventure it shows these characters as human. Certainly something different from the movies showing the slow talking, fasting shooting John Wayne types.It shows crime for what it is and the consequences. The ending is open ended because rumours still persist that they really moved to Argentina to become ranchers (recent digs in the town in Bolivia have failed to find their remains).No other Western movie has quite managed to capture the feel of this movie, one of the fun ones (I even liked the bicycle riding sequence, though many friends felt it was a waste of time).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old-Fashioned Good-Natured Western Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wild west, two renowned outlaws fall foul of a posse hired by a railway payroll company they have robbed once too often, and decide to flee to Bolivia to lie low. It isn't long however before they become equally well known there, as the Banditos Yanquis ...This is a well-made, entertaining and popular western, featuring a terrific performance by Newman, but is quite unusual in that it is a completely romantic, mythical, playful movie. It portrays its outlaw heroes as all-round good guys; thoughtful, good-natured and considerate, and the frontier as the traditional fun-loving mixture of cathouses, drunks and comedy sheriffs. Could this really have been made in 1969, the same year as Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, the ultimate myth-debunking, violent, sleazy, lawless, cruel, unforgiving depiction of the west ? William Goldman's script is witty and full of great characterisation, and reputedly he researched the real Butch and Sundance's histories exhaustively, but can anybody really buy this as a faithful western story after Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy completely redefined the genre ? That said however, this is an extremely enjoyable movie, thanks largely due to Newman's engaging mix of amiability and bad temper, and the fantastic big-wide-world photography by Conrad Hall, who won an Oscar. Redford is well cast as the Sundance Kid, quick with a gun but not so quick with his wits, constantly complaining about the trouble other people are getting him into, but he'll always be one of my least favourite actors. There are several justly very famous moments, such as the escape from the mountain-top, the freeze-frame ending, and best of all the scene where Newman and Ross ride a bicycle to the strains of Burt Bacharach's song Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, sung by B.J. Thomas. A good movie, and a great western, but also a film out of time. Who are those guys !?</fullReview>

This late 1960's classic was one of the earliest examples of the enjoyable modern day buddy films. The chemistry between Newman and Redford was so successful that four years later, they made another film together "The Sting" which was an Academy Award winner for Best Picture. However, this film was nominated for Best Picture too setting a new precedent for film duo teamings.</fullReview>

Bland, but good looking, Katherine Ross is thrown in to give the thing a bit of heterosexuality. What I don't understand is why films that deal frankly with real criminals, and are exclusively for adults (re Martin Scorsese), are attacked while people that deal with real criminals for family audiences are praised. I guess it as all about how the "give me the money or I'll kill you" is put or whether it is put by someone with a healthy dollop of charisma.To sugar the pill even more we have Raindrops Keeping Falling on your head - which shows that they stopped films to show pop videos even in the late 1960's! Burt Bacharach and Hal David claimed an Oscar for it.Butch Cassidy was huge box office and why not? Large budget, good script and good looking stars on peak form. But, the word "comedy" is like one of those circus tent dresses that fat women wear - it hides the sins underneath. I guess it proves that if you make a film that is silly (in relationship to the real story is claims to mirror) and unrealistic you cannot be attacked for it.Maybe I think too much - maybe I should be like this film's lap-it-up audience - just switch of my brain and treat it like simple entertainment. I tell you what, next time I watch it I will...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid" is one of the best western movies I have ever seen! It's also one of the best 60's movies ever made. Paul Newman and Robert Redford star as Robert Leroy Parker (Butch Cassidy) and Harry Longbaugh (The Sundance Kid), two western bank/train robbers traveling to Bolivia when the law got too close. If you have not seen "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid", I suggest you rent it or buy it at any video store near you. An excellent film!10/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget Mel Gibson &amp; Danny Glover. Forget Nick Nolte &amp; Eddie Murphy. Never mind William Shatner &amp; Leonard Nimoy. Paul Newman &amp; Robert Redford is the ultimate action couple. The chemistry between the two actors is perfect and unmatched even to this day! The whole movie is built around the two of them, and they deliver the goods. This is one movie you cannot afford to miss. Never mind if you don't like westerns, this is a movie full of one-liners and laughter. There are lots of classic scenes in this one leading up to an almost perfect ending. Newman and Redford is probably the best combination I've ever seen, and they are this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is a funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Goldman is amazingly funny. He has a rare kind of humor that is both stupid and intelligent. This movie, to some, will have a few funny parts but be just boring for the most part, but to others, namely myself, the very essence of the movie is hilarious. If you didn't like it, you missed something. Some of the funny lines are just dumb which makes them great, but the entire essence is so funny and you have to kindof look for it. Goldman and George Roy Hill have ways of making you need to search. For example, the random music sequences. If you think about it, they're hilarious, but some people just see them as weird. It's remarkably deeper than surface humor. Overall, it's a great great GREAT movie. One of the greatest screenplays ever written, and probably THE greatest comedy screenplay. Paul Newman is just marvelous. He's amazing. He is truly a great actor. By the way, if you loved this, you'd also love the Princess Bride. It's also a Bill Goldman movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the translated tagline of a minor German movie but it fits well here. The story reminds much of Bonnie &amp; Clyde but doesn't feel as realistic as the latter. Both leads are way too elegant and conspicuous to do the job of a bank robber. And in Bolivia every person on the street would remember these 2 guys for years just having them seen taking a coffee. I didn't laugh much and was sometimes even bored. Both actors who try hard to appear cool don't really succeed. If you are looking for a good Western of the late 60s don't look for Hollywood films except the THE WILD BUNCH)!

		<fullReview>Have you ever seen a picture of a 19th Century outlaw? Did he look like Robert Redford? Did he look like Paul Newman? Or, better yet, have you ever seen a picture of a 19th Century outlaw's woman? Did she look like Katherine Ross? And even much better yet, can you picture 19th Century outlaws riding double on bicycles through a lush countryside while B.J. Thomas sings about raindrops falling on their heads? This isn't a western; it's a Hallmark Card. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars the three most unlikely outlaws Hollywood had to offer at the end of the 1960's. The two male leads, who were to work together so perfectly a few years later in "The Sting," are not believable, sympathetic, or even interesting in their parts. This was one of the most popular movies of its time, but even when I was young and had no taste, I was astonished by its totally anachronistic look and sound. If you want to enjoy a film that features 19th Century outlaws, try "My Darling Clementine." Don't waste your time on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Butch and Sundance run around being chased by some men they don't recognize, and whom they never see up close nor confront. They could give up their lifestyle and try a profession other than robbing banks, but no, they go to Bolivia (because they'll really blend in well *there*) to get away and rob more banks. Pretty soon (but not fast enough) the natives catch on that the two of them are the same white honkies that have been robbing their banks and after a bunch of killing and running, surround them with soldiers and shoot them dead. Hurray.This was a boooring movie, despite my mother's assurances before we watched it that it was great. I think she just thinks Robert Redford was hot when he was young.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot Of Good Things In It, But Overall I Just Didn't Find It That Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I have to confess that in spite of its very high rating this movie didn't really strike a chord with me. It's partly the genre I suppose. I've just never been much into Westerns. Horses and gunfights and saloons have never been of much appeal. Beyond that, though, I simply didn't find the story here to be particularly interesting, nor did I find the movie to be as much fun as a lot of people think it is. I can't give a movie that I don't find interesting a particularly high rating or much of a positive endorsement. Having said all that, though, I do want to acknowledge that it's just my personal bias, and that there's a lot about this movie that I liked in spite of the fact that when it was all put together it didn't appeal to me that much. So, let me offer the positives.First I appreciated the honesty right off the top. There really was a "Hole in the Wall Gang" and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were real figures in the Old West as a part of it. The movie follows the basic outline of their life - early bank and train robberies, the escape to Bolivia and the relationship with Etta (Katharine Ross) are all based on reality. But the movie was honest. Instead of saying "Based on actual events," I loved that the opening caption was "Most of this is true" - thus acknowledging dramatic licence in a way that most "based on actual events" movies don't do. I liked the pairing of Paul Newman (Butch) and Robert Redford (Sundance). They worked very well together and offered pretty good performances in the title roles. The movie did a good job of creating some tension as Butch and Sundance were being pursued by a mysterious posse. The question that kept being asked by Butch ("Who are these guys anyway?") hung in the air quite well. There were a handful of amusing scenes - especially the train robberies involving Woodcock (George Furth) which I enjoyed. A sense of fun was also created by the use (only once, mind you) of the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head." In one sense, that song seems totally out of sync with the movie, but the scene in which it was used, in which Butch takes Etta for a ride on a bicycle, was a silly, fun scene, and a silly, fun song fit that scene, if not the overall feel of the movie, quite well.But for as much as I liked all that, what I have to keep coming back to is that I just didn't really find the movie to be all that interesting. Just a personal opinion and reaction. Obviously most people disagree with me. (4/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film. I'd seen clips, I knew the music, knew the screenwriter's works, I knew this had to be one of best films of all time. And then I sat down to watch it. I don't know what let it down. The script was brilliant. Acting? Hardly, well written, well acted, well filmed. I think it was the costuming that screamed "This is the 1960's...!" and the make up....same thing. After fifteen minutes of this I switched it off. I wish I'd never watched it, the film I thought it would be was so much better. If you aren't bothered by continuity errors (such as wardrobe and makeup not giving a fig about what people wore in a historical era) I'm sure you'll find it entertaining. I'm a historian and it bothers me, intensely. Yes, I'm sure if I drank a lot of alcoholic beverages and watched it again, I'd find it has lots allegory...but until then, no.

		<fullReview>The ultimate "buddy" movie.Buddy movies were all over the place in 1969 in various guises -- this, "Midnight Cowboy," "The Wild Bunch," "Easy Rider." "Butch Cassidy" is the lightest and most accessible of these -- for that reason, I don't think it's as interesting to look at now as these other movies are. But it does serve up a dose of good old-fashioned Hollywood film-making, and in Paul Newman and Robert Redford, it presented audiences with a cinema duo as memorable as that of Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello, or if you prefer a more contemporary example, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, who had manufactured a similar screen chemistry the year before in "The Odd Couple." "Butch and Sundance" is mostly a nostalgic comedy, harking back to the glory days of screen westerns. But for all its levity, there is something dark about it that's hard to describe. Butch and Sundance are anti-heroes in the same way that Bonnie and Clyde were in Arthur Penn's brilliant film -- they've got the glamour of Hollywood movie stars, but their doom is sealed from the second the film starts, and because they're so likable and charismatic, it makes it that much more upsetting to see them destroyed. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Butch and Sundance find themselves unable to exist in a world intent on their destruction -- in this way, the film comments both on the death of the traditional western, and on the alienated restlessness of an entire younger generation that was beginning to make itself heard in American cinema.Also starring Katharine Ross as the third point in a love triangle, and featuring one of the best film songs ever recorded, "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head," which accompanies Paul Newman as he shows off for Ross on a bicycle in one of the movie's highlights.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could say so much about how wonderfully crafted this movie is, from the golden cinematography, to the witty writing, to the beautifully understated acting. But ultimately I judge a movie by how it leaves me feeling after I'm done watching. This is not a traditional western, with the black-and-white, good guy vs bad guy, rooting for justice to be served, with the cavalry or some other force to save the day. It is not just a buddy movie, with good times and comic moments. It is, in my mind, quite an original movie. This movie leaves me wistful, wishing for some golden sepia-toned moments of my own. Longing for a chance at adventure and a relatively care-free life; as a previous reviewer stated perfectly, these boys are middle-aged adolescents, unwilling or unable to grow up. Some of us (not everyone) will be envious of these boys and the life they chose and were able to lead, in defiance of the expected convention. Some of us will feel that wistful longing for a golden time: the closest comparison I can think of is listening to that opening song on Cheers, wanting to find a cozy place that perhaps doesn't really exist for many of us. I did not feel thrilled, I did not feel chilled, I did not feel elated. But I did feel...and I'm willing to feel that way again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Western Parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid (1969): Starring Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Katherine Ross, Jeff Corey, Cloris Leachman, Strother Martin, Henry Jones, Ted Cassidy, Kenneth Mars, Jody Gilbert, Timoty Scott, Donnelly Rhodes, Don Keefer, Panch Cordova, Nelson Olmsted, Sam Elliot, Charles Akins, Eric Sinclair, Percy Helton....Director George Roy Hill, Screenplay William Goldman.From 1969,the end of the 60's decade which was a revolutionary time in Hollywood film (2001 A Space Odyssey, Rosemary's Baby, Midnight Cowboy), comes this classic Western from director George Roy Hill from the screenplay by William Goldman. While not exactly a conventional Western (it's not about good guys defeating the bad guys in a small town or noble cowboys and pioneers), it's a film composed of all the little things that make a Western- the American Old West, frontier/railroad towns, men with big dreams, lawlessness and adventure. But this is not what makes "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" so appealing and interesting to a modern audience. It's because this film clearly makes fun of Westerns through well-written parody. By 1969, audiences were weary of traditional Westerns in which John Wayne saved the day, and were looking to see films that strayed from standard movie plots, although Clint Eastwood would continue to advance his career by doing various Westerns, but these, too, were often full of graphic violence and portrayed the hero as flawed or with a dark side. "Sundance Kid" is about two partners in crime (played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford), who rob banks and conduct scams, rip people off, for money. Before long, they grow tired of this scene but rather than giving up the life of crime, they simply relocate to South America where they continue their act. Etta Place (Katherine Ross)is the saloon girl who joins them after falling for bad boy Sundance Kid (Redford). This film was a big hit when it was first released, it launched the career or actor Robert Redford and one might say even of writer/screenwriter William Goldman, who would continue to write for Hollywood through the years (in 1987, his "Princess Bride" was another success). The music is by Burt Bacharach is terrific, a hodgepodge of Western themes, period "saloon" music and what appears to be comedy through melody (like a very beautiful, orchestral cartoon music). The song "Raindrops Keep Falling From My Head" became a commercial success, and it still plays in oldies radio stations. But while this film is truly wonderful in many ways, there are some flaws. I have always found it to be too long for a film that does not take itself too seriously. This is made apparent by the famous ending which still baffles viewers. What happens to Butch Cassidy and The Sun Dance Kid ? Are they killed by the South American authorities who finally trap them in their own game an this, then, is a film that looks back at their antics as outlaw legends ? Is there a final shoot-out or no ? The vague ending does not count as a resolution, but then again, this film is supposed to mock Westerns and film technique, so its not entirely surprising that there is no real ending, which bothers some viewers. The cinematography by Conrad Hall is both a good thing and a bad thing. The film looks great, even after all these years, providing the film with the look of an epic- wide vistas of Western settings such as country, railroad and towns- but it's also very misleading because the look of this film is serious as if we are not watching a comedy but a drama. This is still a fine film at a time when films were beginning to change, adopting the techniques and formulas which we still see in films today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Redford made a number of films for director George Roy Hill in the late 1960s/early 1970s, two of them (this film, and 'The Sting') with fellow mega-star Paul Newman. Unlike 'The Sting', 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' ambles along with no particular regard to plot structure. These days, films are made faster and tauter than this, and the slow pace sometimes frustrates (especially during the dated, Burt Baccarach musical numbers); but it also has benefits, maximising the low key humour of the script which would surely fail if the pace was forced. I'm not so certain about Redfrod's casting, however: 'The Kid' is actually something of a grizzled character, and Redford arguably plays best as the fresh-faced young innocent: the moustache he wears gives the impression of concealing a permanent smirk. But the film is very easy to watch in spite of this, and is consistently entertaining, even if it lacks 'The Sting's sheer vitality.</fullReview>

No-one is quicker than Butch Cassidy (Newman) when it comes to get rich quick schemes , and his sidekick Sundance (Redford) is a wizard with a gun. When these two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Bolivia with Sundance's girlfriend (Katherine Ross). Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate: "This is a stickup!", thats only a minor detail to the nicest "bad guys" who ever rode the West.</fullReview>

Amply supported by Strother Martin, Katherine Ross, Ted Cassidy, Jeff Corey, this has to be a must-see on any true movie fan's list.Butch and Sundance were still outlaws, but George Roy Hill's account of their life and times comes surprisingly close to capturing the true events. Newman and Redford obviously add to the charm, but Butch was supposedly a charming outlaw. Sundance and other gang members were the ones who ever shot anyone, but not Butch. If there was such a thing as a gentleman outlaw, Butch was supposed to be it.</fullReview>

Another scene in the film which stands out is when the posse chases them to a mountain ledge and Butch says to Sundance, "we have to jump into the rapids below..." and he says he can't swim and Butch says "the fall will probably kill you." After they were close to being caught in the west headed by lawman Joe Laforest, they decide to go to Bolivia. After they overcome the language barrier they are back just like the old days. When a lawman from the past is seen in Bolivia they decide to go straight. They work as payroll guards but they wind up having a gunfight with Mexican bandits. I won't give any more of the plot so I will just say there is a nice musical score by Burt Bachrach and a nice supporting part for Katharine Ross. Thanks a lot</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is George Roy Hill's best movie. Here all his little touches work, except for those atrocious songs by Burt Bacharach. That guy is overrated.By comparison to The Wild Bunch, BC&amp;SK is an artistic flop because--once again--appeasing the audience supersedes storytelling skill. Furthermore, Wild Bunch was a flurry of images (a record in the cutting room) while Butch and Sundance proceed on a straight course the whole time with Conrad Hall's camera zooming the whole time. Sometimes he is more concerned about motion than composition.With Neuman and Redford in this, you know the quality is going to be on the level of, say, Independence Day. Not once in the story do they get over the fact that all they are doing is cracking one-liners and actually get to acting. Katharine Ross is more of a crutch to the story, I still can't figure if that's a good or bad thing. The problem is the movie tries to make its message too obvious as opposed to not worrying about one and having it come off as subtle. RoboCop had this problem a lot.Overall, this is good, but not great. For a better Western, see The Wild Bunch. For better music, try The Blues Brothers. 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful, Touching, Charmingly Funny and Tragic. This movie is in my top 3 movies of all time...and when I tell you that Star Wars and The Godfather are the other 2, then you can appreciate how highly I rate this film. If you want to witness what real screen presence and true movie star charisma is all about, just watch Newman &amp; Redford light up the screen in this immensley enjoyable Western. Lovingly and beautifully photograghed by the late Conrad hall, a wonderful witty script by William Goldman and an irrisistable score by Burt Bacharach all add to the star power on display. Highlights include "The Bicycle Ride" (The perfect date in my eyes!), the shootout in Bolivia and of course that final unforgettable scene. Pure Cinema Magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, if you think this is a true western, you're missing the point. So what if it's not "western movie music" anyway, in my view that's a good thing. I could live without "Raindrops" and I don't think the movie would suffer at all without it, but you could find a hundred films where music (or dialogue) that doesn't match the period or genre is used. A great example of this would be the final scene in "Dirty Dancing." The filmmakers are asking you to suspend reality, go with it!This is just a great "buddy" movie. Newman and Redford being the ultimate buddies. It's a lot of fun, without the schmaltzie ending that we would get if this were made today. Perhaps the first "root for the bad guys" movie. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everytime I see this film I always get a warm feeling inside. It has two of the world's greatest actors ever. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are a pair that live up to the expectations of the film. It is just so entertaining. The best scene, or one of the best scenes is when they are on the cliff and Butch is telling Sundance to jump into the river with him. The timing that they both have and Redford's reaction after saying that he can't swim are classic. The film is beautiful, simple and heartwarming. One of my top ten films of all time.</fullReview>

Whilst robbing another train they spot a group of henchmen sent after them in order to kill them.The remarks, the humor and the way they keep coming out of dangerous situations not to mention that this film truly is a classic even though it was made way before I was born this movie is now in my top 20 DVD collection.

		<shortDescription>LAST OF THE GREAT WESTERNS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Roy Hill's "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a Western like no other. It's so much more than your standard cowboys and indians shoot-em-ups that we've grown accustomed to. This film is about character and Hill provides us with two of the most likable outlaws in screen history and we care about them for two hours, not an easy task.Paul Newman and Robert Redford are cast as Butch and Sundance. I cannot think of more perfect casting. However, we have the stars to thank for that. The odd thing was that Newman was cast as Sundance and Redford as Butch originally. Newman suggested that they switch roles and Redford agreed. I think, that by playing against type, it shows that Newman and Redford are so much more than good looking leading men. They are fine actors as well.Ordinarily, a normal Western would have comedy relief. But the great thing about "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is that it is one big comedy itself, although how much you find funny depends entirely on personal taste.In the one line summary, I said that this film is the "last of the great westerns". I think that is true. There were several good westerns that came out after this (There Was A Crooked Man, The Ballad of Cable Hogue, Two Mules for Sister Sara, Junior Bonner, The Outlaw Josey Wales), but until Clint Eastwood's "Pale Rider" and Lawrence Kasdan's "Silverado", both released in 1985, came out, there were no truly great ones. Along with Sam Peckinpah's brilliant "The Wild Bunch", 1969 was the year of the last great Western.**** out of stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Along with Unforgiven, possibly the best western of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is too often thought of as a western comedy or perhaps a "buddy film". While it is both, it is so much more. It is the story of how the last of the 19th century individualists became hopelessly out of place as organized civilization spread through the United States. The outlaws turn away from bank robbing because they are now nearly impregnable. They are chased after by the "Super Posse" which is made up of individuals from many states, working together and aided by the very railroads the heroes are robbing. When they finally die, it is because even in Bolivia long-distance communication (I think it was telegraph in the movie) allowed the army to quickly get to the scene. The key moment in the movie is when they are told (not a direct quote), "Your time is through. The only thing now is to find the time and place of your dying."My only complaint is that Director George Roy Hill took out a key scene after only a few weeks in the theaters. I was lucky enough to see it before it was cut and it made the movie even more powerful, even if it did, as Hill said, slow it down somewhat. The missing scene is found in the screenplay, which was published into a book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine piece of effortless entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fully admit that much of my passion for this film lies in the fact that it is one of earliest memories of seeing a movie. It is virtually impossible to remove this film from the memories of my parents and how they looked at the end of the 1960's-early 70's. My folks fancied themselves The Sundance Kid and Etta Place in terms of their dress, attitudes and values. This is not to suggest they were outlaws (maybe in the eyes of Nixon administration they were) but rather folks interested in an older time that never truly existed. That personal testimonial aside, I still love the film on its own merits. It isn't a work of art to be sure, but it is a fine example of Hollywood creating new myths based upon real legends. The performances of Redford and Newman are so seemless that it is easy to blur the lines between acting and being a movie star. It may be fashionable to knock their work in this picture as Hollywood confection, but I dare any other actors of the time to pull off these performances. There use of silences and evaluations are far more effective than their dead one line delivery- the mark of a fine acting craftsman. The fact that I as an audience member immediately accept and believe wholeheartedly their circumstance and become lost in the story is a testiment to their ultimate artistry. Conrad Hall's photography is both breathtaking and heartbreaking. He truly creates a romantic look at a time and place that truly only could exist in historic imagination. It is one of the few films I would absolutely love to step into out of real life. Director George Roy Hill knows exactly how to economically stage a scene while remaining invisible. He varies the stories pace effectively between tension, whimsy and gentle tragedy. His humour is remarkably subtle and sophisticated without the slightest hint of condensation to the audience- a hallmark of a good director. William Goldman's script does not simply rely on clever one-liners as so many imitators have in creating similar scripts. It is actually poignant in its simplicity and humour. The scene where Butch and Sundance, although mortally wounded still find the courage to dare to dream about a future is really what fine writing and performing is all about. Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is a classic film in the sense that it never fails to entertain and touch the heart. Some may find it rather saccarine and manipulative now in this age of cynicism and media hype. I don't and since being a film fan is based so much on raw emotional response to a visual story, this is mine. This film is well worth its rabid following as it appears so effortless in its ultimately entertaining journey. A 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this film, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" Paul Newman and Robert Redford team up to portray those two notorious bandits from the later days of the Old West. Newman and Redford give the two bandits an almost likeable image, and one almost wishes they had not chosen the path they were on, because the ultimate price is paid for their devotion to criminal actions and misdeeds. The two outlaws could probably have made a success at any line of work, but they chose to be good at a vocation that was outside the limits of the law.With the two stars, Newman and Redford, turning in great performances, a great musical score featuring the tune "Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head" by Burt Bacharach, and a fine supporting cast, this film will rate as a very enjoyable way to spend an evening. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not one of my most favourite films but one of the best loved. It was the early 70's, I was only 12. The Vietnam war was on and The Beatles' were splitting up and this film suddenly sprang up to take our minds of all that. If Butch &amp; Sundances' criminal exploits didn't instil young boys like myself with the desire to imitate they somehow did capture our admiration. To the despair of law enforcement types everywhere no doubt.All the other characters seemed to fit their roles perfectly. The one I best remember was that long suffering guard on the money van who kept getting robbed.What a guy. And Katherine Ross as Etta the school teacher, my word.For a lot of adolescent young lads this was their first view of a pair of breasts and so lovely they were too. The other memorable scene was of course the bike ride with Etta and Butch, and that tune "raindrops keep falling on my head" which everyone kept humming days later. Many years later I thought back to that scene which was so incongruous to the whole theme of the movie but somehow seemed to fit in perfectly. There have been more noteworthy films by far but for a few special reasons this is probably my best loved. It would be interesting to see if a new generation will appreciate it in the same way. I suspect not. Oh well...Coincidentally did you know there was a scene at the end which was cut from the original where Butch &amp; Sundance following a long shootout ride of into the sunset with 200 dead bolivian soldiers in their wake...Go figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid redefined the American expectation of the Western. Shunning the stereotypical John Wayne classics of years before, BC&amp;SK showcased two of the greatest outlaws of the American West in a gritty, humorous, realistic fashion. To this day (with handful of exceptions, such as the now-corny extended bicycle riding sequence) this movie stands up to the 90's in terms of wit, realism, violence, and humor. It's all all around entertaining movie made perfect with the flawless performance of Paul Newman as Butch and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid.Displayed afresh in stunning digitally perfect, color-enhanced DVD, BC&amp;SK is the paramount Western. Forget the old washed out, circa 1984 video store rental VHS pan-and-scan. This latest widescreen release is more vibrant and spectacular than ever. Subtelty is in the form of Redford's excellent exasperated facial expressions, Newman's charming eye-brow raises when he delivers the perfect wit, and the beautiful southwest landscapes. The viewer believes they are watching a classic Western epic instead of the tragic, yet humorous escapades of the last two American anti-heroes as they try to substain their way of life while avoiding both The Law and their own inevitable last stands in the desolation of South America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently wathched this movie for the third time and found it to be a better movie than the last time I saw it. This is unique because I usually am not able to sit through a movie I have already wathced. I believe that Redford and Newman each gave career performances which were infinitely helped by an excellent performance from Katherine Ross.This movie does move at a slow pace at times, but has its fine points as well. The New York vignette has always been a movie magic piece in my mind and really helped to move the movie along from the overdone chase scene to the trip to Bolivia. The scene in which Butch confronts Logan for group leadership is also a personal favourite of mine. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the final shoot-out in which Butch and Sundance discuss ways to get away and what to do after even though they know they are going to go out in a blaze of glory.This movie could almost be considered a comedy rather than a western because of its melodramatic script and the fact that the viewer never gets to meet "Those Guys". This one will always be on my top 10 list.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about. To me this was just a rather ordinary western featuring two of the greatest actors of their time in Redford and Newman as well as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers in Katherine Ross. However, this film fell rather flat. The only scenes that stuck out from my mind were the bicycle scene, the chases and, my favorite, the fight scene between Butch and Harvey Logan.I guess that you had to see it when it first was released to fully appreciate it for what it was. Remember, at the time that this film was released, America was just ending the most turbulent decade in its history since the Civil War. Events such as the assassinations of the Kennedy's and Martin Luther King, Woodstock, civil unrest and the election of a controversial president in Richard Nixon all made America seek an escape from all the turmoil that was going on and this film seemed to provide it. This film harkened back to a simpler time in American history and it touched a cord with the country. Also, the underlying theme of change could be seen as a parallel for what was going on in America at the time.This film may be a classic to most people, but in my eyes it fell flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance KidButch Cassidy's gang is known in the whole west, they have a wide reputation for their robbings. As the time passes the law will no longer stand back and watch them rob everything, a special team is financed by one of their often victims, and the hunt starts.This is quite an enjoyable movie, and it has aged very well, actually there aren't many things that points out that it might be an older movie. If i had to point at something it is the different style they made movies back then and the less clear picture, but that is okay, becuase it gives a dusty feeling, which is good in this case because it is a western. The movie is also very beautifully photographed with many silent and beautiful images of the west, something that is a must-have for a western. But even though this is quite a good movie, there are still some flaws. One of them i think is that the movie is a bit long, i actually didn't get bored, but i still felt that some of the scenes are a bit too long, especially the first part of the movie, which somehow actually manages to last an whole hour. Also there aren't many action scenes, which is something i love about westerns, this movie seems to avoid them to focus more on the friendship of Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy, and also we see them robbing almost a million banks.Robert Redford and Paul Newman is a fantastic couple on screen, i loved them both together here, their chemistry is very good, and is very important as their relationship is the main essence of the movie. Robert Redford is the mr cool as Sundance Kid, while Paul Newman is the smart and clever Butch Cassidy, who ain't much of a killer though, together they work very well.To sum it all up a bit, my honest opinion is that this movie is quite enjoyable and i feel confident that i will watch it again some day, it's not the best movie i have seen, but it works well and i didn't find myself waiting for it to end. I could have wished for some more action and some scenes cut down shurter, but i was actually positively surprised how well this movie has aged.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More comedy than western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could never understand why it is considered a classic western since it is more of a comedy in a western setting. I put it in the class with "Support Your Local Sheriff/Gunfighter" "The Halileua Trail" and "Cat Balou" . But for some folks I suppose this was their idea of a good western. It is a funny comedy. It did lack for the classic cliche mud puddle fight.Perhaps the chemistry of Redford and Newman made it as popular as it was at the time. It sketched the story of Butch Cassidy and the Hole in the Wall Gang just barely, and it would be nice to see a gritty retelling of their story.The "Raindrops" sequence didn't fit at all, for the western genre but if you view it as a comedy then maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever I am asked what my favourite film of all time is, I invariably answer "Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid". For me, it has everything - action, drama and humour in abundance. It is simply a supremely entertaining movie, which can be enjoyed by all ages.Redford and Newman are in great form and Katherine Ross is perfect as the long-suffering girlfriend. There are also some memorable cameos from Strother Martin, Ted Cassidy and poor old George Furth as "Woodcock".Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys good old-fashioned entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Good Parts, But Overlong And Erratic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another period piece from the late 1960's where the outlaws are the heroes, and is loosely based on real people and events. The chemistry between Redford and Newman keeps the movie afloat (though they also star together in the much better movie "The Sting"), and there are some funny scenes at the beginning. Examples: "I'm stealing your woman!" "You can have her!" and "Rules? What rules-uggh!"But the movie's initial light, fun tone vanishes once Butch and Sundance are set upon by the hired trackers, and they discover just how much they man they stole money from disliked being robbed. Unfortunately, this initially tense chase sequence becomes slow and boring as it drags on, and the movie never recovers, even in the end when the outlaws have finally realized that they have entrapped themselves with no chance of escape.The actual story of the outlaws would be a great basis for a future movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend of the famous outlaws becomes in-jokey star-vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director George Roy Hill's film of the famous bank robbers of the Old West treats its subjects like modern pop icons, with Paul Newman and Robert Redford not giving performances so much as cutting up for their own bemusement. The film is commercially shaggy and loose, but utterly shallow and unsubstantial. Even in 1969, nobody could explain the reasoning for Newman's balletic bicycle ride scored with Burt Bacharach (today that sequence could be an outtake), while Katharine Ross (as schoolmarm Etta Place) looks positively stiff standing amongst the red-blooded machismo. Ross also gets the worst lines in the script, about darning socks and lovin' her man until he dies. Hill plays up the buddy-buddy chemistry for all it's worth, and the movie was a huge hit, though it's cartoony in the worst way--like a joy-buzzer--and leaves a bad taste behind. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Who puts stuff like that in a western? Also, what were those people thinking with that absolutely horrible music score? Raindrops Falling on My Head? The Ba Ba song?

		<shortDescription>Mediocre at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedic western based on actual people--Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). They were outlaws in 1880s and robbed banks. The plot of the movie (what little there is of it) has them robbing banks, joking with each other nonstop, riding from the police, robbing banks, joking with each other etc etc etc. It's basically the same thing over and over. Newman and Redford work well with each other. They toss off one-liners (some that are quite funny) with ease in a care-free, easy-going manner. The problem is that's all their characters are--walking talking joke machines. No complexity or depth is ever shown. Poor Katharine Ross (who can be very good) is also shamefully wasted as Redford's girlfriend. Even worse Redford is terrible as the Kid--blank-faced throughout. Slow-moving and too long also and it turns needlessly violent at the end. There's also a near-rape in the film that's treated as a joke! The movie has some good points--it starts out in sepia (a nice touch) and doesn't turn into color until about 10 minutes in; the bicycle sequence with Newman and Ross with the song "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" (an Oscar winner) playing; Newman is very good in his role and the lines are funny. But everything else is pretty bad. How this was a such a big hit is beyond me. A 4 all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the corny acting and one-liners (maybe 3 were funny?) to the incessant passing around of the girlfriend (I still can't assess who's girl it was) to the shrill music and long-ass pictures to substitute for acting, I thought it stunk. Heard so many good things about this, and I can handle a slow western (Outlaw Josey Wales). But this was something else. I only finished it on principle. Took me two days. Had to mute the Bolivian scenes, the music was so obnoxious, by God. Don't get the love for this weak, mediocre film. You could have accomplished the same thing, but in better fashion, with Young Guns II. Certainly has more heart, that's for sure.Give me True Grit or Josey Wales any day......this blows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess when this movie came out, I was too much of a hippie to see something that had "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" as a theme song. I also wasn't a fan of westerns.I always figured that when I finally did see it, I'd be blown away. Well, it is kinda nice seeing a younger Paul Newman and a young Robert Redford playing with each other. Their characters are neat--a wisecracking Paul Newman, and a silent but wise Robert Redford. The chemistry is terrific. But Katherine Ross adds up to zero in this flick. She's got nothing to do but attach herself to the boys and teach them Spanish. It almost seems like she was thrown in to obviate the obvious homosexual overtones. Her character, and the fact that the boys go to whorehouses, make up for the fact that they ride the same horse and spend every waking and sleeping hour together. Paul looks so lovingly at Robert.How about a remake with the real story?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A couple of 'iconic' elements have hoodwinked the majority into calling this a great film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... but so far as I could see; the ONE great scene has been shown on Oscar telecasts too many times for it to rescue an enterprise that's otherwise so lazy. Yes; Newman and Redford are accomplished, but I wouldn't have expected anything less from them - What I would have expected from the film is a solid 'backstory' for our characters, and a sense of urgency from the narrative; instead of the constant feeling that we're supposed to nudge each other and laugh as our lackadaisical heroes amble their way through life. Burt Bacarach may have crafted a good tune; but that doesn't excuse what felt like an eternity wasted watching Newman ride a bicycle... He's a great actor; but even HE can't enliven a moment so mundane.The admittedly memorable ending wouldn't serve as 'too little, too late' had the movie earned it's 'veneration' of these two unexceptional vagabonds; but the movie failed to convince me over its running time that these chaps were in any way 'special'. You wonder if those who think it's a 'classic' just framed the last ten seconds of film in their minds, and somehow passed over the aimless episodes that served as buildup to the 'climax'? I'll tell you something: I wish I could have such selective perception; but no, I unfortunately remember ALL those other limp moments that went before the ending, as well... !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited so long to see this...why? I don't know.I was expecting lots of laughs, some good old fashioned gun fights in saloons, real western stuff.However what I got a a boring, lame-ass, put me to sleep movie, nothing really worth viewing or waiting to view.Aside of some decent camera shots and settings, and the nice stunt work from jumping off a cliff into some rapids...the rest is just a waste.What I don't understand is...these 2 guys robs banks and trains and payroll...they have a ton of cash to spend, but they decide to flee the country with all their wealth and do nothing with it.They eat lavish and wear very nice attire and can live very well of with what they have in finance, but they don't.What kind of stupidity is that? Say that you've robbed a whack of banks...gathered up around $500 000 in todays currency and fled the country to another country where your money will make you uber wealthy...Why even bother to continue to rob and steal? Buy a house, live by the beach, go fishing...whatever...They had the money to go on a train and on a ship across the ocean and to start all over, fresh...but they totally wasted this opportunity.And back then, it was much easier in terms of getting away with crime So the overall story sucked.Even written in the late 60's, this made for a a really boring movie.After viewing Bonnie &amp; Clyde and Butch Cassidy and the Sudance Kid within 2 weeks of each other, I realize that back in the late 60's...making quality films was close to non-existent.All one has to do is have some lame action for about 2 hours and the characters have to travel across the country - as in soooooo many movies that were made in the 60's and 70's.Assuming that these were really great scripts - which they are not, I would have hated to read the one which the studios passed on.I guess if somebody was able to type 130 pages or so script on a type writer without too many errors, then it would be made into a screenplay.I have seen too many movies where the stories were just time wasters - and they were made in the 60's.Aside from some Clint Eastwood flicks, the rest are just super boring.No real western that emerged from the 60's or 70's had any real plot.Catherine Ross's character was a waste - as were most of the actors in this title.Am I impressed? No.Is it Oscar material? No.Is it to stand the test of time? No Is it a remedy for putting somebody to sleep fast after a long day of work or insomnia? YES! For a movie that I always wanted to see...this sucked.Another Hollywood let down.I am slowly realizing that I don't care to see cinema from generations PRE 1980.If this is quality story telling, then I would rather look at porn...it has as much depth, but is more visually stimulating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Makes You Want to Root for Logan, not Butch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so overrated. I literally fell asleep watching this so-called 'breakthrough western' and wasted my hard-earned money on the special edition DVD. It's like this: Hollywood takes a bit of history out of books and colors it by using the annoying actor Newman and Redford to portray the two outlaws, and engages the two characters on a fictional romp through North and South America. It seems Hollywood is always trying to look for anything with a tad of historical interest to put on the big screen, and 'Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid'was all fluffed up to make an unremarkable event 'exciting'. But the truth is this film has so many drawn out, silent moments (that stretch tiredly throughout two and a half hours) it ends up being boring without being entertaining. The reason it was a 'breakthrough' movie in the late 60's is because it tried to win our hearts by portraying Butch and Sundance as two sympathetic,anti-hero characters. In reality, however, they were just ordinary crooks. The anti-conservative bent of the late 60's and early 70's raises its ugly head in this movie. I wonder what people were eating and drinking in those days, but it seems they were all fed with this kind of Hollywood trash. Too bad big Logan didn't do away with scrawny little Butch in the so-called 'famous' knife fight scene. That would have ended the slow pace of the movie and made my day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one the most immoral movies ever made. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are professional thieves, and Sundance is a soulless killer, and we're supposed to like them because they're handsome guys who say funny things. Well not me, boys.In the end, Butch and Sundance, crackin' funnies all the way, are under attack from a troop of Bolivian soldiers. Sundance shoots down five or six of these honest, nonbankrobbing men, and we're supposed to be impressed by how well he handles a gun. The men he has killed? Not good-looking, not funny, so who cares if they got shot, according to the general drift of the story. Then, when Butch and Sundance get killed, this is made to seem so tragic that we're not allowed to see it.So I hate this movie. If you're not careful, it will seduce you out of your sense of right and wrong. It's not even as if Butch and Sundance are tragic victims who have been forced into a life of crime. They're just a couple of healthy, funny, handsome guys whom everyone seems to like, and they steal and kill because it's more fun than working. The first time I saw this show, I rooted for them myself. I was played for a sucker, and I don't like that I was.</fullReview>

However, I am so disappointed in the use of a running W on the white mule. Yes, they didn't break the mules neck when it fell...but they could have...all for the making of a scene??? Finding out what was done to the mule has made me see the film in a totally different light. It is no longer one of my favorites. Just because it wasn't illegal to use this horrible way to make the mule "fall on his face" doesn't make it right. That's why we have laws to protect animals when filming in the United States. Had I not know about the use of the running W I would have rated the film high, but will not now. Nor will I watch the film again.

		<fullReview>This was a terribly boring movie that had me watching the clock waiting for it to end. It failed to capture my interest from the opening scene to the dull end sequence. The movie is about two outlaws, Newman and Redford, who are on the run from the law. They decide to hide out in Bolivia. But instead of laying low, the duo decide it would be better to continue to rob banks. Their personalities are a little unbelievable. They are portrayed as kindhearted people. This didn't sit well with me, because of all the stealing they were doing (sometimes even from poor people). I don't enjoy seeing real life bad guys presented as Hollywood good guys. It may be considered a classic; but I consider it a CLASSIC example off an overall boring movie with stupid dialogue and goofy action sequences. As you can probably tell, I don't recommend this movie. This gunslinging duo shouldn't have been captured on film. And if someone felt they had to be; that person should have waited for the 90's to do so.</fullReview>

I really did not like it at all.It's all about two cowboys who are criminals who rob a train. Then they get chased a lot by strange lights that we're not even sure are actually chasing them. For all we know they could just be regular cowboys out for a ride (for example to break in a new horse, which is what they did back in days of yore when the film was made) or townsfolk off to a church in a different town. They might do this because their church doesn't cater for their beliefs or maybe for other reasons. there are lots of explanations of what those lights could be. That's how rubbish this film is.All the two cowboys do is get chased and ride bicycles (like they have any spare time if they're getting chased). This film is so boring it's a bad thing to watch it. Watching this film is like getting bad news from your proctologist. Sometimes the two cowboys make trips to Argentina where the film ends with the worst ending I have ever seen. After all that chasing it really bugged me and I can't even tell you about the ending. That makes me mad sometimes.</fullReview>
