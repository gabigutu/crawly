		<shortDescription>How to create something out of nothing? Ask Mark Andrus and Jim L. Brooks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really, how to make something original, fresh and odd out of absolutely nothing except a few characters? Using characters, only characters and nothing except characters. That's the simple formula Brooks uses in all of his work, but, for me, he has never created so much charm, warmth and sensibility as he did in `As good as it gets'.Characters write the screenplay in this movie, and everything that happens - happens because of what they are. They are nothing special ? they are ordinary people we meet in the street every day and that have the same problems a lot of other people have. This movie presents the example of how much you can pull out of that. And if that is written as well as it is in this case, not even a happy ending can bother you. Because, in real life, shown here, what is the end?Everything is good and warm in this movie, everything is fresh and vivacious, understandable and well performed. Jack Nicholson brings one of the best performances of his career, that terrific Helen Hunt finally got a chance to show how skilfully an actor can connect naturalism with the laws of the camera performance, and Greg Kinnear shows the most convincing emotions coming from a gay character I've ever seen.The relationships between the characters are created in the way that you can't predict anything that's going to happen, eventhough you know in advance what could come out of their mouth and what kind of attitude they'll have in a certain situation.You can simply feel the progressive collaboration that occurred between Brooks and the actors and the mutual understanding they developed, and it's not often that you see that kind of artistic superstructure shining on the screen so much as it does here.I find `As good as it gets' complexed, vital, intelligent, emotionally deep and studied, fresh, original, amusing, cheerful, funny, and one of the best films of 1997.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as Romantic Comedies Get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"As Good As It Gets" boasts a splendid, delightful combination of wonderful, zesty acting and a remarkably bright and effective screenplay. Jack Nicholson is pitch-perfect as the obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon Melvin Udall, who possesses some of the strangest and most curious tendencies ever concocted by screenwriters; his Udall is so human, so heartfelt, so genuine, and so whimsical and Nicholson perfects him to such a degree that not a moment of his screen time is unwanted or uninteresting: in my valid opinion, this is Nicholson's best performance of his career, and one of the most reverent performances in film history. What an engaging, enthralling story: an troubled, insecure man helps a troubled, insecure waitress (troubled and insecure in different respects), and the two form an unlikely relationship from being distant acquaintances (Hunt even exclaims that Nicholson is crazy in their most uncomfortable moment in the film) to practical soul mates (Nicholson to Hunt: "I feel that I'm the only person that knows that you are the greatest woman alive"), through a series of misfortunes, self-explorations, and mutual bondings. Kinnear's character Simon has the distinct purpose in being both the bridge and the divider of Nicholson and Hunt's relationship, and he identifies with his character with compassion and understanding, as he has frequently been wronged throughout his existence. The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner. I appreciated practically every element in this wonderful, delightful masterpiece of exemplary romantic comedy, in its indelible acting (Oscars well deserved), its whimsical, touching screenplay (This was neons above "Good Will Hunting"'s quality) and its comforting morale, that despite all of the great odds in life which prevent us from being happy, we can perhaps find it within ourselves to take that one important step in reversing our fortunes, in "stopping with taking pills" and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy, certainly the best film of 1997, and one of the greatest films of all time, "As Good As It Gets" succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This comedy is as good as it gets!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedies (especially romantic comedies) can only be judged by how much they make you laugh and if they make you feel good inside. As Good As It Gets does it for me every time. I'm not just saying this on account of being a "Jack fan." The characters are so beautifully drawn, you forget it's just Jamie from "Mad About You" (Helen Hunt) and the man with the eyebrows (Nicholson). This movie deserved all of its Oscars, and then some. The role of an obsessive-compulsive is an easy one to parody and mock to death, but Jack does it with style, humour, emotion, and that usual Nicholson flair. Hunt has never been better as a waitress with a major anxiety to do something for herself for a change. Greg Kinnear is also very good as a gay artist that ends up having to turn to the irascible Jack for help after he is scarred and left destitute following a break-in. This is such a special comedy, fresh from the pen of James L. Brooks, the man behind the wonderful Terms of Endearment (another wonderful Nicholson performance) and Broadcast News. As Good As It Gets made me feel so good, even though I couldn't really relate to the characters' situations. The humor is pure Jack, set to the script with perfect ease. The emotions evoked by the actors are also authentic and heart-felt, as if they love what they are acting out. Movies like this come few and far between, and that is the reason why I appreciate this film so very much. As Good As It Gets was one of the best films of 1997. Rating: Four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior Hollywood piece of sentimentality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melvin is a romantic novelist who is a selfish manic compulsive who is rude and insulting to all he meets. When Melvin's gay neighbour is beaten up and robbed, Melvin agrees to look after his dog. The dog gives Melvin something to care about other than himself and his life is approaching normal until his regular waitress has to leave work to look after her asthmatic son and his neighbour wants his dog back. Melvin starts to realise that his life needs others for more than just selfish reasons.The big Oscar winner for Jack is recent years is enjoyable if you come to it knowing what to expect. The film is very sentimental but in a good way. The film is gently comic and amusing and the characters (although exaggerated) are winning and involving. The telling is a little long winded at times and the film could have been shorter but it is still enjoyable. It does tip over into sickly sentimentality at times and can be a bit syrupy but it comes with the territory.Nicholson is excellent and is the main reason it all works well. His un-PC Melvin is funny but also a character that you can hate and pity on several occasions. Kinnear is good because he is a solid understated character and not hammy or OTT like he can be. Hunt is good but is left with the majority of the syrup and sentiment where the other characters get more share of the laughs. Gooding Jr continues his trend of being good in over the top roles and is funny and happily avoids becoming a flaming gay stereotype.Overall this is a sentimental romantic comedy that is typical for the genre. The story wanders to it's point but the good cast, led by a great Nicholson, hold the whole thing together. A superior piece of sentimentality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way to go, Jack!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is simply phenomenal. Yes, I will give credit where it is due and congratulate Greg Kinnear, Helen Hunt, and Cuba Gooding, Jr, on their fine performances. They are talented. But I am mesmorized by Jack's intricate facial expressions and inflection each time I see this movie.Critics panned this movie for being totally unbelievable. I would have to agree-why would Carol fall for Melvin? Why does Melvin change his ways after so many years of acid-tongued insults? I don't know. I know people who disliked the film because Melvin was such a you-know-what. Personally, I love the evil retorts he hurls at any innocent bystander. Maybe it's a sick pleasure, but Nicholson's delivery is perfect and I couldn't help but laugh as he takes on everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Jack's on screen, you can almost never go wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who impresses me the second (and I'm not overstating in the least bit) he appears on screen. The moment I see Jack's face on screen, I get this feeling that everything's going to be all right. He could do a Pauly Shore film, and elevate its quality with his mere presence. And I didn't even get to his acting.Nicholson won a well-deserved Oscar for this movie. Then again, I feel like he deserves an Oscar for virtually everything he's been in. Hell, you can even give him an Oscar nod for "Anger Management." THAT'S how great he is! He's one of those actors who can communicate even more emotion when he's not saying anything than when he is. And of course, he has one of the coolest movie star voices ever, so it makes it a joy whenever he does speak. I still feel like "You can't handle the truth!" wouldn't be as priceless a line if Jack didn't yell it. He can say almost any line of dialogue and turn it into gold. In this movie it was "You make me wanna be a better man." Again, an otherwise forgettable line of dialogue made gold by Jack."As Good As It Gets" is a flawed film, with scenes that drag and an overlong running time, but it's highly enjoyable and altogether pretty well-written. Aside from its many hilarious moments, it's also quite touching. But I have to admit that it's the comedy that sticks out most in my memory. There's some priceless gags like when a Jewish couple is sitting at Jack's usual table. He first intrudes into their conversation saying, "People who speak in metaphors oughtta shampoo my crotch." He complains to Helen Hunt, his usual waitress, saying "I have Jews at my table!" He then intrudes in the couple's conversation again, noticing the food on their table, saying "Obviously your appetites aren't as big as your noses." Now, I probably wouldn't want to personally know a man like Melvin in my real life, but I still found those cracks to be hysterically funny. The same when he attacks Greg Kinnear's gay character with constant homosexual slurs.The performances are great all-around. Though Jack pretty much steals the show, Greg Kinnear gives a wonderfully endearing performance. He doesn't play out the gay stereotypes, yet he's sensitive and feminine enough to have me convinced that he is gay (unlike Eric McCormack on "Will and Grace" who acts like he's gay for the sake of the show's gimmick). It's nice to see Kinnear rise from the host of "Talk Soup" and the thankless late night talk show "Later" to a fine actor. Previously, I wouldn't have any notion that he could become what he is now. Helen Hunt also gives a compelling, emotionally packed performance. And Shirley Knight, as her mother, provides a little bit of comic relief. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small but interesting role, and he makes the best of it.The film does have its dull moments, but Jack's one-of-a-kind performance makes it all worthwhile. There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could've played Melvin better than him. I read in the trivia that John Travolta was originally offered the role. Now, I like Travolta, but in this type of role he wouldn't hold a candle to Jack.My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Good As It Gets is one of those incredibly moving films that is also hugely entertaining. It's not just a comedy, you can't quite label it a drama piece, it just is what it is; simply great.What works here so well are the actors and the script. Nicholson and Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well. This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage of that here.As Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific, each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability).Direction is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films. As Good As It Gets is very nearly as good it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is bizarre because, while judged overall its story is shmaltzy and unbelievable, nevertheless each individual scene plays absolutely convincingly and feels very real. It's weird. I don't know if it's just the greatness of the actors overcoming an under-thought out script, or whether it's just the script concentrated solely on crafting great scenes one after the other, but not so much in coming up with a convincing through-line. Whatever. All I know is that this is one of the most entertaining pictures I've ever seen, extremely funny and quite emotionally affecting in places. Somehow, it just doesn't matter - I like it anyway.The performances are uniformly excellent. Nicholson shows real range here - sure, he gets to be the sarcastic curmudgeon we've all come to expect, but his character also has moments of fear, repression and vulnerability which he brings off equally well. My problem with this character (and the "problem" only exists as I think about him afterward, not while I'm actually watching the movie) is in his conception: he seems to be whatever the writers want him to be at that moment, with no particular consistency from scene to scene so when he supposedly "changes" at the end, we're left to think, "Change? This guy's been changing through the entire movie!" And also, the fact that his character is a romance novelist is never really explained or examined in any way.And yet, Nicholson's performance makes it not matter quite so much.Helen Hunt is a revelation in this movie - she nails every scene she's in, whether she's forced to be witty, embarrassed, angry, defiant, emotionally overwhelmed, whatever. She keeps Jack on his toes, and they work off each other brilliantly. Also, I never thought I'd find myself saying this, but Greg Kinnear was great as Simon, the gay neighbor. (It was also nice to see director Harold Ramis - the third Ghostbuster, after all - in front of the camera again, if only briefly, in a small part as a doctor.)What more can I say? Good comedy, good love story, great acting. None of it, in the end, is very convincing, but if you just focus on the individual moments and not on the grand design - a task made easy by the wonderful writing and playing - it's very easy to like As Good As It Gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This almost all Oscar winner cast gives such a great performance that it makes it almost impossible not to love this movie in its entirety!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Oscar nominee James L. Brooks, the story written by Mark Andrus brings up not only very interesting characters but also very interesting issues. I have the video and enjoy watching it. The CD is great with music of Nat King Cole, Shawn Colkin. Outstanding acting by Helen Hunt (Mad About You, Twister) who won an Oscar for this role where she plays Carol Connelly, a single mother, working as waitress in Manhattan, New York. A single parent trying to cope with her work and paying medical bills for son Spencer Connelly, played by Jesse James (Message in a Bottle, The Gingerbread Men, Gods and Monsters). Jack Nicholson (A Few Good Men, Easy Rider, Witches of Eastwick) is Melvin Udall who is an obsessive compulsive. Nicholson also won an Oscar for his part. His obsessive compulsiveness has taken over his life and he is not able to live a normal life. Melvin Udall has tons of soap all organized in his medicine cabinet. He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out. He will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of concrete. When he goes to the restaurant he brings his own plastic fork, knife and spoon in a plastic bag. Udall uses plastic gloves to hold the dog and has all his office supply stacked and all color coordinated in his home/office. He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and takes forever to take a shower. He closes his door several times and counts how many times he has done it. As a writer who works at home I do understand Mr. Udall really well. Writers think somewhat like this: we like to be alone with ourselves in order to think. We have to go inside ourselves to produce good work. It is a very isolated world. We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone. This is somehow like Melvin thinks. People think that he has nothing to do and they keep knocking at his door and he gets really aggravated about that. He is my favorite character in this movie, not to diminish the other ones. He is just so full on nuances that make him very entertaining. Helen's role is very, very, good and she did a really good job with it. Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human being and he is there to teach him many life lessons. The supporting actors are great, you have Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire) playing Frank Sachs, Simon's agent.My favorite scenes: elementary school kids all in uniform screaming: "Wait! Melvin, wait"! Greg Kinnear imitating Melvin. Melvin and Caroll going to eat fresh rolls in the wee hours of the morning. When Melvin realizes that the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.My favorite quote: "I am drowning here and you are describing the water." This is a nice story telling movie. I recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I know what good acting means. You are absolutely surrounded with it in this movie. There is not a single actor or actress in this movie that didn't exceed himself/herself. Helen Hunt is great (I don;t know why, but I find her quite attractive) and I won't bore you about the performance given by Jack Nicholson. When I first saw this movie I thought it was really boring and overrated, but I saw it again the second day and immediately loved it. Maybe the ending is a little bogus, but it's a romantic comedy, so it didn't bother me that much. A fairly complicated plot presented with ease and simplicity works perfectly and there's a nostalgic tone to the movie in whole. Maybe because it's a rare occasion nowadays to come across a movie that isn't stuffed with special effects. This is a movie that should be seen on a beautiful day, when you're in a good mood. Great fun that keeps getting better and better each time I see it. A strong 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without the great Jack Nicholson, this would have been a disaster. As usual he is in brilliant form. One of the many problems with AGAIG is the fact that Helen Hunt only ever plays Helen Hunt. A more serious defect is---there is no perceptible chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt. I never believed in there "love?" Or there relationship. Also--when a gay man gets beaten to a pulp----and a child is continually being rushed to hospital, I have to ask--is that supposed to be funny? The movies running time of 138 minutes is excessive. Its more of a saga than a comedy ..more of a tragedy than a romance. There is an annoying predictability about the whole--thing, too many scenes that make the viewer..uncomfortable. Also scenes that make the viewer --feel embarrassed--for the writer. That---is never a good --indicator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never understand how this movie got so many good reviews. This is nothing but bottom-of-the-barrel-stuff with a glossy Hollywood touch. It has no plot. It simply goes through a whole heap of boring stuff 3 incredibly boring characters put up with in their lives. The interplay between these 3 characters (Jack, Helen and Greg) is so false and put on nobody in their right mind could mistake it for real life. Jack is the only person who deserves some credit for his performance but he's done much better and his character is not worthy of any actor of his stature. Helen Hunt is simply appalling as the whingeing single mum. Her character is completely obnoxious and hard to have any compassion for despite the problems she is facing. When acting becomes too hard for her, she simply takes to flashing parts of her anatomy across the screen. Greg Kinnear likewise does nothing in his role and although not as annoying as Helen's waitress, still seems like he's just tacked into the story (if you'd call it that) for no apparent reason. But the thing that really drove me to hatred of this film is the ending. Jack and Helen were at each other's throats literally 2 minutes before the ending credits but they still somehow get together for a supposedly romantic and happy ending. At this stage I walked out of the cinema unable to believe what I just saw. I'll never understand the mindset of film critics when they can praise trash like "As Good As It Gets". By the looks of some of the other user comments here, I'm not the only one who feels this film is highly over-rated. 3/10 - (and 2 of those are for the dog)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What every romantic comedy aspires to be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and this movie can be watched again, and again, and again (at least by me).By now, most people who watch movies are aware that this one practically swept the Oscars for the year it was produced. It won Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt best Actor/Actress awards, came away with Best Picture and also Greg Kinnear won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Simon Bishop, a sensitive gay artist.Seventeen years later the movie stands up well because of its timeless quality. "As Good as it Gets" is a very tight story and performance by all the actors and there is not one moment, scene or actor wasted. The story centers around people's expressions more than most movies. One example is an elderly woman actress who has opened her apartment door to run an errand and her features contort in disgust when she happens upon Melvin Udall, the Jack Nicholson character who is about to do some mischief with his gay neighbor's dog.Another example is Skeet Ulrich, who plays a street tough who somehow winds up doing a modeling job for Simon (Greg Kinnear) the gay artist. When Simon explains to Vincent (Ulrich) what he is looking for in a pose, Vincent's eyes widen and he murmurs "Wow." Moments later he nonchalantly delivers the type of pose Simon is looking for. Unfortunately, Simon and Vincent's association ends badly and creates a turning point for the movie.There are also several layers of irony at play in the story. It is ironic that Melvin, a hardcore misanthropist mired in full-blown OCD can somehow deliver romance novels that women love and buy by the barrelful. Also ironic is that Melvin's character transformation begins when he must take care of Simon's dog, an adorable little Brussels Griffon.It's also ironic that Carol, Helen Hunt's waitress character, works in a restaurant populated by actress-hopefuls who serve diners while striving for their big acting break. Some have stated that Hunt, a fetching but not-too-glamorous actress was too pretty for the role. However she was dressed down just enough for the role to make it work and her understated beauty comes into play in a big way later on in the story.Finally there's Jack Nicholson. His portrayal of Melvin Udall stands out as one of his great performances because of all the subtle nuances. The shot of him holding Verdell the dog and cooing to him is one of the signature shots not only from the movie but from his whole career. Near 60 when the movie was produced, he comes across more fit and polished than usual, definitely more so that his portrayal of the raucous astronaut in Terms of Endearment, another one of his great performances, which had occurred 13 years earlier.If you've never seen it what on earth are you waiting for? And if, like me you've seen it over and over, hopefully this review gives some new insight as to why "As Good as it Gets" is so gloriously watchable, over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You make me want to be a better man."I finally got around to watching this touching and funny film directed by James L. Brooks that stands out thanks to some wonderful performances and memorable characters. As Good As it Gets is proof that actions are louder than words because despite how cruel and mean Nicholson's character is, he does incredible and kind things for others. In a way this film reminded me of David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook as I found both films to be difficult to follow at first due to the lack of a likable character, but once we get to know who these people are we forgive their flaws and end up routing for them. Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt give excellent performances, and their Oscar wins were well deserved in my opinion. As Good As it Gets is the very definition of charm, and the screenplay written by Mark Andrus (Life As a House) shines thanks to some incredible performances. I really enjoyed this film and found myself laughing through most of the scenes. This is one more film I can eliminate from my shame list, and I'm glad I finally got to experience this romantic comedy which also has a lot to say about overcoming illness.We are introduced to Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), a cranky but successful author who suffers from OCD. He lives on his own in a beautiful apartment where he spends most of his time writing. He always goes out on his daily breakfast ritual which consists of walking to a nearby cafe without touching anyone or stepping on any cracks. He always sits in the same place at the cafe and always demands to be served by the same waitress, whose name is Carol (Helen Hunt). Carol is actually the only one in the cafe who stands his constant outbursts and cruel comments. Melvin's daily routine changes through two events that end up affecting his life. First, his homosexual artist neighbor named Simon (Greg Kinnear) suffers an accident and Melvin unwillingly accepts to take care of his dog in his absence. Second, Carol's son, Spencer (Jesse James) gets ill and she quits her job. Not accepting the fact that Carol isn't there to serve him, Melvin tries to find her in order to restore order back to his life. These series of events force Melvin to change his routine and at the same time he forms an unlikely friendship with Carol and Simon proving that he isn't as bad as he seems to be.The performances by each one of the talented actors are the heart and motor of this film. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt share an incredible chemistry together. It's funny how despite never being able to share his feelings towards her and always saying the wrong things, it becomes clear that she does inspire him to become a better person. The supporting cast is also incredible here, especially Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. who deliver several funny scenes. I was partial to Brooks's work considering I had only seen How Do You Know which didn't work for me and Spanglish which I did enjoy, but As Good As it Gets is without a doubt his best work thanks to an unbelievable cast. This is a smart and funny film, which also could be cruel at times, but it was well balanced. Despite the schmaltzy story it still worked thanks to the characters that carried this film. It's hard not to leave this film with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

Helen Hunt is fantastic. Greg Kinnear is fantastic. Cuba Gooding Jr., in a small role, is also very good. The movie seems like everybody enjoyed themselves making it. I own the DVD of this film, so I've seen it a few times. Each time I watch Nicholson's performance it seems to get better. In the last 10 years or so, Jack seemed to be running through the paces.

		<shortDescription>Talking' about everything upon nothing. If this has been a Sit-com series, couldn't have seen the second season.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A telly-familiar face from the production crew of the Simpsons series, James L. Brooks, directs a 5-year old screenplay and rakes up a pretentious cast of actors. The original script has been written by Mark Andrus in 1992, and has been developed differently from its origin in 5 years time by the director James L. Brooks. The length of the time passed in between this period has surely deprived the efficiency of its editing. Hence, we shouldn't have expected a good relation between the storyline and the plot. Thankfully, James L. Brooks hasn't even put a plot on view. So we get a simple sit-com entirely tied to the actors' contribution in this comedy/family movie. When a movie goes nowhere via its point, comedy is the easiest cure to make it find a way. Consider a horror movie, you watch it but you don't feel any fear; in order to be meant for something, a horror can be cured with some comedy, that way can it only become interesting. On the other hand, comedy is the hardest cure to make a point-lost movie find a way; 'cause you gotta have Oscar worthy performances at least to make it worth to watch. As Good As It Gets is the worst movie of 1997 with its technical features:Editing is the worst, screenplay is a mess, no camera aspects, no successful sound editing or mixing(no one has no idea how can a puppy murmur through a garbage chute and can be heard inside an apartment unit), art decoration has zero achievement(that's why it's a sit-com) ; at the same time As Good As It Gets is at its best for 4 great performances: Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson at the leading, Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. at the supporting. If a Hollywood movie is just leaning upon its cast, why watching Hollywood then? As Good As It Gets absolutely deserved its 2 actor-based Oscars and in total 3 actor-based nominations. The other 4 nominations are a fine cods-wallop! Priggery and meticulousness are very well staged by Nicholson, playing a quirky character at the culminating point of capturing viewers' attention, reminding us of Bart Simpson at age 60; especially with his style of walking crab-wise on the street. Helen Hunt plays and heartens a mother of a sick child within bearing of her vicissitude of fortune at one side, bearing Jack Nicholson as the menace of her emotional argument at the opposite side. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a self-assertive individual and the only person in the movie who can deliver a replication to Nicholson. Additionally, Greg Kinnear is the gingerbread of the movie playing the beaten and robbed gay artist. Because each one of the actors has a complete different view of life, the non-plotted script magnetizes us growing our curiosity on if they ever roll up like a hedgehog together. As Good As It Gets made me want to watch Seinfeld. Based upon same idea, to play along with each other, Seinfeld is much much more better than this one of its analogous. There is absolutely no technical feature to make As Good As It Gets a worth-watching movie. It is likable only for its remarkable acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did this film ever win Oscars?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now and then a film comes along which is praised to the skies but which, when you see it, is just so dreadful that you wonder whether you are mad and the rest of the world is sane, or vice versa.This is a "comedy" which did not raise a single laugh in the cinema in which I saw it. The script is pathetic. Jack Nicholson over-acts dramatically as the central character, and my reaction to Helen Hunt was to hope that she spent as little time on screen as possible. In her TV role as an ugly, neurotic, abrasive wife she was superb. Seeing her in this film, you suddenly realise she probably wasn't acting. Remember the days when actresses looked like Sophia Loren, Doris Day, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, etc? And comedies were genuinely funny and acted by the likes of Cary Grant? Whatever has happened to the American movie?</fullReview>

Opposites attract, people bond to each other while they're on the road as the characters learn how to love and about the value of accepting others. Both Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson play characters who shift back and forth from normality to extreme neuroticism to suit the plot; for me, their characters were unbelievable.

		<fullReview>Trio of star are at their worst playing irritable characters in the movie. One minute they'd be nice to each other, the next minute they'd be mad at each other without any apparent reason. The performances are exaggerated to the Nth degree.Nicholson still acts with that too-familiar sly manner, but runs out of steam this time. He's thrown out of the restaurant where Hunt works for bad behavior, but after a few scenes, he sits in there enjoying his meal again. It's either the restaurant owner or writer-director of this movie is out of his mind. Besides, do you believe a waitress can have long chats with customer without getting warned by her boss?As for the story, there're not enough events to sustain it; just full of ludicrous dialogue from irritating characters. The Oscar winners of this film should have learned how to make a better romantic comedy from "It Happened One Night" (1934).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a way, I appreciate this flick. It's witty and warm feel good. If you can see aside the underlying themes it may strike you as brilliant, even; "One of the best comedies ever made!". But again, if you seek beneath the surface, it's a whole different story. So let me start: it's definitely not about prostitution as such, which you might suspect about 15-20 minutes in the movie, where a brief moment of joy for any one with a bit of consciousness, one understands the male character isn't originally interested in just having sex with the female lead, or is he? But right there we come to the point; take the direct sex out of the equation (or alternatively even boost it if you will) and suddenly this comedy could easily been turned to a drama in tunes of whatever was still going on in US about few decades ago. This movie, without its comedy, could easily have gotten a couple of Nominations if it was to be placed hundred or so years back in time and the female character changed into an afro American person. Just take out the wits. And make no mistake, I'm white myself, but this whole scene makes a mockery out of all comedy this film represents. Still, ignorant as a few, it's ten or nine out of ten for sure. Right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, memorable scenes, a bit inaccurate but accessible, so much the better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people say it runs overtime and plays like a sitcom; why cant people just let generes of film cross into each other, why do things have to have a certain recipe, just leave it the way it is. Its enjoyable because we see an unlikely relationship grow, and having watched many movies, I can always predict that two unlikely characters are put side by side and eventually will fall for each other. In this movie, I didn't clearly anticipate this as Helen shows a natural resentfulness to Jacks crude criticism of weakness and self pity and women in general and his inability to let one good word escape his tongue. I didn't see how this heartfelt waitress, who is "desperately needing for a compliment" could wind up with a word vommiter or even worse a conscious writer with calculated and misanthropic comments on humanity such as Jack. But we see Jack as capable of intense honesty, that I even wanted to reach into the screen and lock a hug with him. "And that no one else knows that they're around the greatest woman alive........well that makes me feel good......about myself". Their relationship I did not fully anticipate, for that I applaud the movie.Another issue is the movies portrayal of obsessive compulsive disorder, a disorder millions of people struggle with. Although he does not have chronic ocd, and the movie cleverly makes us watch what we don't come to cinemas for, and that is dealing with people neurotical and compulsive patterns behind locked doors. But through Jack it comes off sort of comedic, accessible, and incoporates well into the storyline as a person who cannot step out of his rigid brain locked mindset and cannot be openly compassionate. This is not true though of ocd sufferers, they are highly conscientious people, too often overly so and are too often just the opposite, worried about saying something "mean" or letting a bad word escape them which they dwell on for day if they have. Not all, but a common symptom. And frankly, with millions of ocd sufferers in our country did you ever once see skipping pavements and walking as clownishly as Jack does. You don't see that because people with ocd try to hide their own illnesses. But OK, if that makes people more conscious of the illness.Overall, great script, I really enjoyed it "and you people are supposed to be sensitive (talking to his gay friend), I'm drowning here and your describing the water". Helen though not attractive is beautiful in this movie, you clearly see her through the directors eye, jack's eye, and simon who paints her bare back as she is taking a bath. Her performance is endearing and enduring, she is all too real and juxtaposes with Jacks annoying character well. The movie has a lot of memorable scenes. And inadvertently makes us wonder and read more about issues we normally overlook like the healthcare system, homosexuality, and anxiety disorders and the finding of compassion where you will least likely be expecting it; by a man who hires and pays for a doctor to care for your ailing son so you can come back to work to serve him eggs and bacon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly at beginning I spent my 20 bucks for Helen, she is beautiful, elegant and adorable. In addition, Hunt got Oscar via this movie. However, after watching it, I think I am more lucky than before when I only went for Hunt but Jack. It is perfect for me to pay money getting a film of which both the leading actor and actress make me excited.Initially, I don't like Jack, as the most time I saw him is not in movies but on the first row of Staples Center where is the host court of L.A. Lakers. His crazy applause for Kobe Bryant annoyed as I don't like the showoffer - No.24 of Lakers. However after this movie one thing I clearly understand is you can't ignore the merits by the defects of a person. Also the guy Jack playing also make me sick, but this guy gets something making me feel good as well. Once again, it gets proof that the annoying guy also gets merits.The movie helps the communities create a harmony neighbourhood. How can you image that an annoying neighbour like Mr Udall can find his true love and the precious friendship. That's it people must get some merits no matter how badass they are. And another important thing is people are changing, so please do not judge them with your old prejudice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect "As Good As It Gets" to live up to its title, and it doesn't. The big-screen work of writer-director James L. Brooks, including the Oscar winning "Terms of Endearment," has yet to match the quality of TV's "Mary Tyler Moore Show," which he guided to classic status in the 70s. Nonetheless, "As Good As It Gets" is his best work for the big screen to date. Jack Nicholson did not deserve his third Oscar for his role here, but, hey, he's Jack and a delight to watch even though his affliction--obsessive compulsive disorder--isn't rendered too believably (Nicholson doesn't simply avoid stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk, he rather nonchalantly DANCES around them--hardly the thing a true obsessive compulsive would do). Helen Hunt's no-nonsense waitress is convincing, though, as is Greg Kinnear's gay artist. There are more than enough funny lines to merit the Oscar nomination for best screenplay, and even at 144 minutes (what is this? A James Bond movie?), it's an enjoyable ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Bad As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, not literally. It's not as bad as it gets. But it comes pretty darn close. You could easily say this film had the 'Titanic' effect on me... you know, where a lot of people turn against the film for winning so many awards. But here's my problem... it really wasn't a good film when I first saw it. What you have here is essentially a two-hour long sitcom... one you want to end after half an hour. But it doesn't... it keeps going.We are introduced into a story that seems to have been going on for three or four seasons, er... years, and the connections between them all are never quite distinct. The characters are never fully developed because James L. Brooks thinks he can release these cut-outs onto us and get away with it. For the most part, he's succeeded. He's received a warm welcome from many, many people. But not me.This is just putrid. One wonders how this one got nominated for Best Picture, when The Sweet Hereafter was infinitely better. In fact, Atom Egoyan, the director of that great film, was nominated for Best Director, while James L. Brooks was not. Thankfully, this meant As Good As It Gets wouldn't win. But it won for Best Actress and Best Actor, and this just completely astonished me. The hype over Helen Hunt is almost unbearable. I love Mad About You, and I love her character. But every single movie she's done since has just been that character with a different problem. Twister: Mad About You with a twist. As Good As It Gets: Mad About You with an ill child. Even Mad About You is approaching the limits of which I can take, as Hunt won the Emmy for Best Actress purely on her Oscar win. It amazes me that the Academy, a group of selected people who watch the performances and decide, chose Hunt over every other performance, all infinitely better. Kate Winslet was great, but either Helena Bonham Carter or Judi Dench should have won. I doubt most Academy members even saw that movie. Thankfully, Hunt even acknowledged Dench's loss (although, I think she secretly thought she deserved it). Best Actor... JACK NICHOLSON? Are you insane? I mean, he's won before. And he's won for doing this performance. I think the Academy felt bad for not giving it to him for Chinatown, and so they awarded it to him again. The REAL best? Either Peter Fonda or Robert Duvall, both incredible in their performances. Jack Nicholson was doing a cliche of a character, and he won. And why wasn't Leonardo DiCaprio nominated? He didn't deserve to win, but he deserved to be nominated. I don't necessarily like the guy, but as an actor, he's one of the best.I don't normally hate a movie for winning awards, but this is one of those rare exceptions. Undeserving of every nomination and award it received, As Good As It Gets becomes one of the most annoying films in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With it's witty dialogue, simple and easy story, and the first class acting by sitcom television stars Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear, and 3-time Oscar Winning silver screen legend Jack Nicholson, "As Good As It Gets" is the funniest and most intelligent- if pretty unrealistic- romantic comedy since "Pretty Woman." Nicholson has great fun as an obsessive-compulsive romance novelist, and has seemed to have matured just a little bit after nearly 30 years of 'bad boy' performances: Easy Rider, The Last Detail, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Witches of Eastwick, Batman, and Wolf. But, I would still bet on him to win a verbal and eye-staring rumble between him and Robert De Niro, Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda and Michael Douglas. Hunt is extremely good but unrealistic as a lonely waitress whose son is really sick. But she plays the character as best as she can, and she has great screen-chemistry with Jack. Kinnear is probably the actor who steals the show not counting the humor. I'm sure everyone wanted Jack to shut up and put his glasses on when Kinnear told his engaging story about how his father gave him a "sweaty wad of money". That's real acting right there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What does a single mother, a writer(neurotic, of course... aren't they all?) and a gay artist have in common? All three appear in this movie, focused on their relationship. With both stars earning an Oscar each, and Greg being nominated and deserving to win, this has phenomenal acting. Well, the kid is arguably over-the-top at points. Apart from him, the performances are powerful and convincing. Hunt, Nicholson(especially) and Kinnear all use both their charm and their skill to great effect. As far as being a romantic comedy, this isn't as clichd as most of those are. This is a marvelous drama, if there is a bit of sap(don't get me wrong, it is genuinely sweet at times), and not everyone will agree with L. Brooks' indictment of the US health care system(the social commentary is tough to argue with, though). The dialog is sharp and witty. This can be quite funny, if a handful of gags and jokes try too hard, and some will find the depiction of OCD offensive(I personally don't think it ought to be played for laughs, the way it is here). The plot isn't bad. There is a bit of disturbing content, a little vague sexual content(all visual or hinted at) and brief, brutal violence in this. I recommend this to fans of the genres. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Good as it Gets is a movie portraying Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, OCD, and the effects it can have on a person's every day life. Melvin Udall is a middle aged writer that lives his life without stepping on cracks, being late to breakfast, and shows no compassion towards anybody. Although Melvin shows no compassion for any other person when he is forced to baby sit his neighbors dog while his neighbor is hospitalized he falls in love with the dog as misses the company once he returns to his owner. It's not until his daily waitress, Carol Connelly, has to quit work to take care of her ill son that Melvin shows concern for another person. These are the first steps of Melvin being able to put his self-centeredness and compulsions aside to help others in need.Melvin is devoted to his writing and to nobody else; as long as his day goes orderly he can keep his obsessive compulsions to a minimum. To a minimum meaning he will still wash his hands with 12 different soaps each time and will still switch his lights on and off 5 times before being satisfied, but he won't break stride as long as things work in his favor. When Carol is absent from work and can't serve Melvin his daily breakfast is when his disorder can no longer be controlled. He makes a personal visit to Carol's home to see why she is not present at work and in return hires a doctor to personally come to her house to take care of her son so she can return to work. For a person without OCD this may seem odd, but for Melvin this is just his way of getting his life back on schedule. Carol is hesitant in accepting Melvin's offer, but her mom convinces her it's a gift she cannot refuse. Melvin thinks his actions are only benefiting him, but he has changed Carol's life by devoting himself to somebody else that he cares for.Melvin does a precise job in demonstrating what a person with obsessive compulsive personality acts like. He distances himself from everybody by compulsively acting out in a manner that in return nobody would want to associate them selves with, except for Carol. He is obsessed with the number of times he washes his hands, switches his lights on and off, and when he packs. Although Melvin mentions in the movie that he has OCD and could take medication that would help him, the movie implies to the general audience that he gets better because he falls in love and wants to change for Carol. He started showing compassion for others prior to him mentioning that he started taking the medication. Overall I think the movie showed the qualities of the disorder, but I don't think the treatment part of it was accurate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I thought that this movie was a sweet yet sad movie.Kind of bitter sweet and I felt sorry for,Helen Hunt's character. Living with a sick child and her mother.And the down on his luck artist living with his cute little dog.The only one I did not feel sorry for at all was the nut job that Jack Nicholson played. That made the movie OK at the beginning, then you get to the middle of it;and that is when it gets ugly. Because of the beating down that the sweet gay artist that Greg played.I really hated that part.This movie was not at all what the name of it is like;As Good as it Gets. My rear it should have been named As Worse As it Gets!Review by: Meagen Jensen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man-size Jack in a girl-size film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie at the cinema with a male friend. We were two men - men who discovered the wheel and built the Eiffel Tower out of metal and brawn. And AS GOOD AS IT GETS blindsided us.The marketing was smart. Yes, Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson were probably going to end up a "romantic couple," but the trailers appealed to the man of brawn in each of us, showing us off-kilter Jack; an obsessive-compulsive author who tells it like it is, insulting and alienating himself along the way with men, women and other social castes; he didn't step on cracks in the footpath AND he put the weaker sex in their place. It looked biting. It looked cruelly funny. It looked... manly.But in the film's final moments, Helen Hunt spews a line that only a Girly Movie can't be criminally prosecuted for, "Why can't I just have a normal boyfriend?" Isn't she a little old and cynical to be using that juvenile term? And is that all this farce was aiming towards? The pabulum of girlfriend/boyfriend-ism? Cuba Gooding Jr. had to play feyer than a hairdresser for this? Greg Kinnear had to be a gay artist and get bashed and robbed by Skeet Ulrich for this? Helen Hunt had to be a waitress and have a sick kid which fortified her against Jack's insults for this? Jack Nicholson is someone's "boyfriend"? And suddenly - it didn't feel so comfortable sitting next to another man in that theater. We gulped hard, hoping no one would see us two men attending this Chick Flick with no girly dates having dragged us here. Uh, we came to see Jack, really we did; we came for the insults and uh, the insouciant philandering and uh, the lies that make chicks cry inconsolably and uh - how about them Dolphins, hey? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James L Brooks' film "As Good as It Gets" surely belongs to "too good to be true" genre.It is in many ways stylistically similar to "It could happen to you" directed by Andrew Bergman.The reason for classifying this film as an excellent story which easily defies human belief is that it is quite true that there are precious moments in people's lives where they cannot stop putting their trust in other people's lives but it is not so easy to find such people and moments.This is exactly what happens in seemingly ordinary yet momentous lives of this film's three major characters who establish that even bad people change when important events happen in their lives."As Good as It Gets" is a good film to be watched with family as it does not distance itself from its "pro people" stance.This is the only reason why audiences would be able to brook an odd assortment of characters whose sexual and racial preferences are somewhat overtly illuminated throughout this film.All in all,"As Good as It Gets" is a good American film which would go down in history as a work of art which has mellowed out obnoxious prejudices against gay people and single mothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good is all that it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James L. Brooks is a man with a gift for developing interesting characters but with a weakness for squeezing them into cliched and/or manipulative circumstances. When obsessive compulsive Jack Nicholson pays for Helen Hunt's seriously ill son's medical expenses just so she won't have to stop being his waitress, the movie flows along with a lot of invention and energy. But then the movie becomes another one of those dangerous romantic fantasies where an unlikable guy is "cured" of his xenophobia by the love of a good woman.At the beginning the racist, sexist, and homophobic jokes made by Nicholson are played for laughs, which is fine for the movie's purposes, but then Brooks expects us to feel threatened by the exact same type of comments and then warmhearted when he tries to change his ways. Who cares about a bigoted old man's happiness?The movie goes a lot into Hunt's devotion to her son but does she really think Nicholson would make a good father figure? Hunt and Nicholson falling in love is an easy out because then Brooks doesn't really have to deal with the more difficult (and more interesting) ideas brought up in the first half.So is the movie actually good? Well, sure. It's quirkier than most romantic comedies (if you want to call it that) but it's disappointing intellectually in the end. Soooooooo, *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't do anything for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, who is a darn good actor plays Melvin a guy with obsessive compulsive disorder. He meets a waitress played by Helen Hunt to whom he starts caring about and he finally gets involved with his gay neighbor, Played by Greg Kinear who was horribly beaten and robbed when he had to take care of his cute little pampered dog.I didn't much care about any of these characters after a while. The reason why I gave it a 3 is because the only time I was interested and saddened was for the neighbor that got senselessly beaten and robbed. Other than that, it was a soap-opera mess and not something I tend to want to pay for in feature films. The story got bogged down into sentimentality and to deliberately attract Oscar voters with all the unwritten Oscar rules to give it notice.OCD is neither interesting or entertainment worthy in this instance and compound that with the overall meanness of Melvin, it's just not something that would make me care. Helen Hunt's character was depressing as well as annoying - but what turned me off from this film is that this is all something I can run into everyday, so honestly I wouldn't spend my time looking at a film of something I can just look at down my hall way or walk the street daily to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Brooks is clearly at the center of this mess. First, he dishes out the totally lame Terms of Endearment, then he goes back to the same formula of TV-like performances, to the oohs and ahhhs of the Oscar voters, to give us As Good As it Gets, which could almost be its cousin. What is the attraction for these over the top, unrealistic performances?? Nicholson was leading actor in both, and they both stunk. As Good As it Gets goes on forever, like a bad soap opera that won't end, just like "Terms" did. All three leading actors have done so much better in other efforts, but I put the blame on "Mary Tyler Brooks" for making this pastiche as nauseatingly bad as it is. These two movies make a good case for having chimpanzees choose Oscar winners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good As They Get!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How do you write women so well?" asks a flattered young lady after reading one of the man's sappy romantic paperback novels and recognizing his face on the street. He turns around, looks at her and says, "I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability." The secret of "As Good As It Gets" is its unconventional, and often times irreverent, view of the entire romance scene. It is centered solely on two people, Melvin (Jack Nicholson) and Carol (Helen Hunt). Melvin writes those corny romance novels you always manage to find tucked in between the fiction and non-fiction area of your local bookstore. You know, the kind that little old ladies like to read through at an incredible speed in an ill-fated hope to re-live moments of their past.Melvin is a bit like Paul Sheldon, from Rob Reiner's "Misery," although I'm sure if he had been found by a murderous fan he would have been killed early on--he's incredibly blunt and annoying. He probably would have told Annie Wilkes what he thought of her from the get-go, not hesitating any more than he has to.Melvin has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which basically means he goes through strange routines every time he does something, whether it means locking a door twice or not stepping on the cracks of a sidewalk (we all do that, sometimes). I recently read a new Steve Martin novella about a man with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it reminded me very much of "As Good As It Gets" and the Melvin character. Melvin is such a wacko that he pushes his gay neighbor's dog down the laundry chute after he finds it wandering around the hallway.The gay man is played by Greg Kinnear. His name is Simon, and he has a small little dog he likes to call "precious." Simon is an artist, but when a band of kids wreck his apartment and beat him up, he is left with the realization that he hasn't enough money to keep his flat, and his boyfriend (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) may break up with him.But the biggest worry of all is...what to do with his precious?Frank, played by Gooding Jr., decides to give the dog to Melvin--who refuses at first but is left without any option but to obey. He soon achieves a certain subtle love for the beast, and when Simon has healed and comes back for the dog, it doesn't even want to leave. It even starts to develop nasty habits--like avoiding cracks in the sidewalk.Meanwhile, a troubled single mother and a part-time waitress, Carol is constantly nagged by Melvin. Only she can deliver him food. Only she can take his order. Only she can kick him out of the restaurant. Mistaking this for some sort of sexual craving, she tells Melvin flat-out that she will never sleep with him. He doesn't seem to care. That had never even crossed his mind.The fact is that Melvin is insufferably lonely. He likes to act as though he likes to be lonely, but the truth is that his loneliness is something he loathes. He would love to reach out and gain some friends--but he's too proud to humble himself in such a way. We all know people like Melvin--he just takes himself to a new extreme.Melvin is surely one of the great screen characters of all time, ranking up there with Raymond "Rain Man" Babbitt and Forrest Gump as some of the most unique and likable inventions to ever grace the big screen. Nicholson presents his character in an especially effective way--at first he seems gruff, then he seems strange, then his soft side is revealed, and he slowly becomes the likable mean guy who lives upstairs and likes to try and kill neighbors' dogs.Hunt won the Oscar for her work in "As Good As It Gets," but it was truly Nicholson who deserved it.Regardless of all this, "As Good As It Gets" still stands alone as one of the cleverest romantic comedies of all time, and certainly one that both sexes can agree on. The film features some of the most memorable lines ever written on paper, the majority of them all coming from the lips of Melvin Udall, perfectly spoken by a typical gruff Jack Nicholson. They all come off as utterly hilarious and convincing. (Nicholson: "How old are you? If I would guess by your eyes, I'd say you're fifty." Hunt: "If I went by your eyes I'd say you were kind.")This is the type of new-age romantic comedy that rivals the greatness of "When Harry Met Sally" or "Sleepless in Seattle." It's founded in its characters, their lives, their interaction, and how they learn to overcome their own personal obstacles and moral obligations. This film carries all the Autumn-time sweetness and cleverness of a Rob Reiner comedy, and all the lightness of a Frank Capra movie. It's a delightful blend of comedy and romance, and the type of redefining genre motion picture that "When Harry Met Sally" was eight years prior. What a perfect, delightful movie.4.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"As Good As It Gets" has three great performances. Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson deserved their Oscars. Greg Kinnear deserved his nomination. The problem is that all of these performances could be in different movies. There is absolutely no glue holding these characters together. The direction appears to have been done scene by scene. There doesn't seem to be any story just scenes. The editing seems to have involved putting the film in a Blender and then putting it back together, piece by piece. There are great moments though. Helen Hunt describing how she felt looking at a couple is a guaranteed tear-jerker. Helen Hunt bashing HMO's. Jack Nicholson buying a suit jacket from a doorway, washing his hands, and any scene with the dog. Greg Kinnear in the hospital, after he's beaten up. There are other good scenes as well.  "As Good As IT Gets" is worth seeing but it's barely a movie, just a jumble of scenes. James L. Brooks (the director and co-writer) obviously had a very hard time with this material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curmudgeonly romantic novellist, Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson [sic!]) blames his rude disposition on his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder until he falls in love with put-upon waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) who leaves him in no doubt that the way to her heart is via a complete change in his: and that means becoming friends with Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear); a struggling, gay artist on the brink of a nervous breakdown as a result of a vicious aggravated burglary.The above says it all really... American producers have rarely been able to (and never will on the whole) distinguish between the sentimental and the false; and this movie is a beacon to such confusion. Coming as it does from the pen of James L. Brooks - a man responsible for the joyously excellent 'The Simpsons' - this is a shoddily written, would-be screwwball comedy that never ceases to grate and is done precious little justice by either cast OR director. How it garnered it's Oscars (or even it's nominations) is an enigma to me: Hunt is just above adequate; Nicholson is consistently below and Kinnear is as convincing as Hitler on a civil rights march. Not one of the tragic circumstances is either convincing or believable and the denouement is infinitely more predictable than snow on the Alps. As bad as it gets...</fullReview>

I was not amused in the least with Nicholson's obsessive-compulsive schtick nor with Hunt's neurotic waitress. I wish the Academy would recognize actresses who actually work long and hard to perfect the nuances of their characters' personalities, instead of those who can only play one cracked-up role.I didn't laugh once throughout this entire movie. What was so funny? That this sad man had to wash his hands 100 times? No, not really. That silly little dog? Nope. The only bright spot in this movie was Greg Kinnear's gay artist. That's it!Don't believe the hype. This movie is nothing special and it wastes Jack Nicholson and Greg Kinnear. As for Helen Hunt, she needs to stick to television. No one should have to pay good money to see her whine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this is as good as it gets I'll quit watching films. Has a slow start but improves after the first half-hour or so. Nicholson is good - though definitely not brilliant - and Hunt is forgettable. The film as a whole is semi-entertaining. However, there aren't any belly-laugh moments. But the biggest problem are the drama to comedy (and vice versa) transitions which tend to ruin the comedic flow of the film. Although worth checking out, the film is overrated. It's one of those comedies which cause major hysteria among both critics and (probably) viewers, and for totally unfathomable reasons. Oscar Shmoscar; this is most definitely not one of Nicholson's best roles. To be more specific, I will name some films where he was better: "One Flew", "The Shining", "Hoffa", "The Last Detail", and "Wolf". As for Helen Hunt, her Oscar is one in a series of undeserved Oscars for actors who have nepotism to thank for their illustrious careers. How does that old saying go?...

		<shortDescription>An Emotionally packed Comedy and Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Toady I saw the film 'As good as it Gets'. It's a strange film. It tells a story of a unlikely man who struggles with his lonely life, closing him self in a world of imagination and words that fills his 62nd book. Melvin, Jack Nicholson, a troubled writer who has some disorder, some misconception, some dis-beliefs about the world around him and he behave true to his beliefs. There is a man who is living in his neighborhood, Simon, who loves his dog and the men; yes he is a gay. And there is a friend of this gay man Frank, played by Mr. Gooding. Now the character of Jack named Melvin hates his neighbors so much that he can't just avoid to see the Simon's dog. But still he has to tolerate it. When he gets outside, he walks carefully to avoid contact of men walking on the streets and also the crossing tiles or road lines; that he considers as a bad luck. Jack Nicholson played this disordered character so wonderfully that, anyone can feel a pity for him. Besides he visits a usual shop where he takes the breakfast.There he finds a waitress Carol played by Helen Hunt who only sustain his (Melvin's) over the top behavior. That make Melvin takes interest in her. Now this Carol, who is a single mother of a son Simpson and living with her mother; who is trying to get into a relationship that really works for her and the family. She tried to date with a man, who lands up in her bed but because of homely presence they couldn't make it. That really frustrates Carol. The portrayal of a single, workaholic and a needy woman who really wants the companionship of a man, that she not able to get, may be because of her job status or her way of expressing herself right on the face or whatever and feeling sad for her mistake makes her a really beautiful character. Oh how lovely the scene is when she confesses to her mother that what she feels about a man that she want in her life. When Melvin, Carol and Simon goes on a trip; Melvin could not express truly to her as he has a doubt that Carol likes Simon; that makes Carol angry and she spends a night with Simon while he sketches her nude portraits that he haven't sketched for so long. In fact, while drawing her sketches he gives a lots of compliment to her and that really makes her forget about Melvin's mistake and she and he both enjoys the process. Ultimately, after the trip, when Melvin helps Simon to shift into his apartment, there Simon asks Melvin if he really loves Carol; Melvin struggles, Simon tells him then he need to show it to her though he finds it difficult. Simon encourages him and Melvin gets that night to Carol's home and takes her for a morning walk where they both kiss and goes to a shop for a warm bread roll in the morning. The films is so emotionally charged, and that is of varying emotions; love, jealousy, fear, anger, hope, guilt, confidence and many more. That makes this film a complete watchable experience. Over all, the acting, dialogues, cinematography, editing, music and the direction is all added advantage; a bonus!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Comedy about OCD that Flags at the End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James L. Brooks's film contains good examples of the kind of acting (often labeled "great acting" that wins a lot of plaudits but consciously draws attention to itself in a way that might seem superficially attractive but palls in the end.Such is the case with Jack Nicholson's Melvin Udall, a curmudgeonly writer suffering from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), and living on his own in a well-to-do New York apartment. His particular forte consists of being excessively rude to everyone, from his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), to Simon's African American friend Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding jnr.) and the cleaner Nora (Lupe Ontiveros). Some of Melvin's put-downs are so outrageous that we wonder why anyone puts up with them.Melvin's character starts to change when he is unwillingly deputed to look after Simon's little dog Verdell (Jill), while Simon is in hospital, and a relationship develops between the human being and the animal. Meanwhile Melvin shows a hitherto undiscovered streak of generosity as he pays for a high society doctor to treat Carol Connelly's (Helen Hunt's) little son who suffers from a rare form of asthma.As the film develops, so Melvin's softer side begins to show itself; we discover that the reason for his OCD lies largely within himself and his reluctance to admit his true feelings. The story takes a sentimental turn, especially when Melvin, Simon, and Carol go off together for a trip to Baltimore to see Simon's parents.While Nicholson obviously enjoys monopolizing our attention, we nonetheless get the feeling that he is consciously acting for the camera: every little gesture and facial expression is scrutinized in minute detail as we learn something of the soft underbelly of the character he portrays. The ending is predictable, and somewhat implausible, as Melvin sloughs off his OCD in remarkably quick time and learns something about how to treat his fellow-human beings decently.Helen Hunt does what she can with a thankless role; throughout this lengthy film we get the sense that she exists as no more than a foil to Nicholson's star persona: all her gestures and facial expressions depend on how he reacts. She remains perfectly plausible as a server trying to make the best of her humdrum life, but we end up wanting to know more about her complex psyche rather than witnessing yet another (slightly clichd) exchange between herself and Melvin.AS GOOD AS IT GETS is an entertaining film, with Mark Andrus's script containing a fair share of witticisms, but the tone changes for the worse as the action unfolds, as director Brooks substitutes hard- edged comedy for sentimentality, with the plot chugging towards its predictable end. The film represents something of a missed opportunity to look at the consequences of OCD and how it can destroy a personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the characters but a lot of this movie just seemed implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I overall enjoyed this movie, and the characters were great. Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear were excellent in their roles, and it was fun to watch these characters interact with each other. I particularly liked the interweaving of story lines and found many of the happenings in the movie, and some of the dialogue, to be quite amusing.That said, the way the movie developed (and particularly the rather formulaic ending) just seemed too implausible. It was like they could have done so much more with this movie, and just opted for a standard Rom-com ending. And there is a sense that these people will not get along for long (the couple that is). And frankly, I am not particularly taken by the "always-saying- something-rude-or-insulting" character of Nicholson here. It gets old a bit fast, and I am not really sure if it is a very believable character trait. I think human beings develop these kinds of mechanisms because they serve their needs in some way (or they think they are serving their needs); but I can't really see how this habit of insulting people all the time is really serving Melvin Udall's needs. Nor does it seem to have a convincing pathological explanation, as the diagnosis of OCD does not seem to also explain why someone would be a compulsive "insulter." But maybe there are indeed medical cases like this, which I just don't know about. I suppose I am just not a fan of such a character trait. But in any event, this was an amusing film, fun to watch the very different characters interact with each other, and I would recommend it for an evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melvin is a hard edged, obsessive compulsive individual. Although he can write books about love and life, his own existence is not as glamorous. After his neighbour, Simon, is brutally beaten during a robbery, Melvin slowly shows a new side of himself. He offers to take care of Simon's dog, and soon becomes good friends with the struggling artist. Along the way, Melvin also finds a interesting waitress who is accepting of his medical problems......AGAIG is one of those once in a lifetime movies. The stars were as big as they could have been at the time of the films release, and when you think of it, the film isn't really much about anything, it's just a series of scenarios and problems that centre around Melvin and his illness.So why does it work so well?It's the script, the delivery of the lines delivered by all, the emotional performances from Kinnear and Hunt, and one of the greatest performances from one Mr. Nicholson.Even though his demeanour is abhorrent, and his choice of words are more than questionable, it's the scenes when he is alone where he is at his most vulnerable. Yes, some of the tics we see at first are snigger worthy, but then once he has more interactions of the empathetic kind with Hunt and Kinnear, we find that he is one of the most sincere, kindest characters in the film, and we warm to him as quickly as his road trip buddies.Endlessly quotable, wonderful monologues that are about to be heartbreaking, but then Melvin would say something derogatory or make a facial expression to take you away from the heartache.Hence why the film never gets too sentimental, it always has that element of letting the dark humour take you away from the kindness of others.Still brilliant after almost twenty years, As Good As It Gets is almost just that.....A wonderful romantic comedy that smacks you in the face when you begin to get tears in your eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, a single middle-aged man who has quite extreme obsessive-compulsive disorder and also a rather unpleasant personality. Greg Kinnear plays his gay neighbor Simon, and Helen Hunt plays Carol, the waitress at the restaurant Melvin usually goes to. A certain event happens and the unlikely trio end up going on a road trip that is both very funny and also moving at times. This movie is very much character-driven, as the story is quite simple, and all three main actors are great and show how their characters change each other over time. Jack Nicholson makes Melvin Udall very unlikeable but also gives him some humanity at times, and it is hard to imagine anyone else playing the role. Although he can say nasty things, you feel for him at times because his disorder has a very big effect on his life. Nicholson definitely deserved the Oscar for this. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear also put warmth into their characters and make them feel very real, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is also very good and funny as Simon's partner. There are also some great one-liners that will make you laugh out loud and you will remember them for a long time after seeing the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as Jack Gets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Good as it Gets (1997): Dir: James L. Brooks / Cast: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich: Title provides an issue of challenge to its hero to improve himself. Jack Nicholson plays Melvin, a grouch unable to give compliment or love. He stuffs his neighbor's dog down a garbage shoot, insults a waitress, and limits his contact with people. His gay neighbor goes to the hospital after receiving a beating from a client's boyfriend, and his dog stays with Melvin due to suggestion from his dealer. Helen Hunt plays a waitress whose son is ill and Melvin pays the hospital bill just to get her back to work. Director James L. Brooks balances humour and drama although the ending is difficult to accept. Brooks previously made such high profile flicks as Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News. Nicholson is so crude, he's likable. Hunt faces both frustration and guilt. Can these two possibly form a romantic union as suggested? It is not easy to buy as presented here. Greg Kinnear does fine as a neighbor bewildered at Melvin's sudden change. Cuba Gooding Jr. is funny as Kinnear's dealer in what could have been subdued in the wrong casting. Skeet Ulrich plays a male model who results in Kinnear taking a beating. There are predictable elements but also many moments of great amusement. Themes of love to the lonely make it the best it could be. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully filmed drama-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No CGI. No special effects. No over-the-top action sequences. Just pure cinema. Acting: Jack Nicholson might as well be the best actor of the later 20th century alongside Meryl Streep. Having subtle OCD myself, I was amazed at the authenticity with which Jack Nicholson displayed his role. You kind of just end up saying the wrong things at the wrong time, display hatred towards the more or less normal and sort of abnormal aspects of life, and have an obsession towards cleanliness. Jack, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are the pillars of this movie. The talent which Helen brings to the table is unbelievable. Greg Kinnear does full justice to his role as well. You just feel like you've known a couple of people with similar traits all your life and that is exactly where this movie succeeds in balancing comedy with drama and realism. It isn't one of those lame Adam Sandler rom-com flicks. This movie just has a bit of everything, and keeps moving at a strong pace. You want to watch true cinema at the end of the day. This movie fulfills that duty.The Movie: Not one minute of this movie's runtime would you feel bored and just curious to just press the fast forward button. You feel like you're in the movie. Jack Nicholson is a legend. Truly. Helen Hunt joins the fun by bringing an equal amount of realism to her craft. She plays a loving mother who works as a waitress and is just looking for a male companion who would understand her situation and cater to both her son's and her own needs. Jack Nicholson is an author and an OCD infused character who goes to the restaurant where she serves and just does not feel comfortable if she doesn't serve him. Greg Kinnear's back story and how the three get connected and how the story moves forward is the basic crux of the film. Besides all these things, there are also a lot of beautiful themes that one must look upon, such as: A younger woman and an older man. Can they be romantically compatible? There are definitely more themes, but I don't want to give them away and end up spoiling the viewer's experience of the movie. Story, Screenplay and Direction:James L. Brooks definitely does justice to Mark Andrus's taut screenplay. It's like they both complement each other. There is not one wasted shot, and no wasted screen-time for any of the actors. It is just beautifully evened out. Hans Zimmer provides a fun-filled background score, which is vastly different from the scores he writes today. I didn't know that it was Zimmer's score until I went through the credits. John Bailey's cinematography is beautiful and makes you wonder if this really was a 1997 film. Overall, this is a wonderful film which has many recurring themes, and must be watched at least twice. I hadn't known that this was nominated for a couple of Oscars, and actually ended up winning two until I had finished watching the film. But then, I really felt that Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg should at least have been nominated for their work in the film, and was glad to see that Nicholson and Helen won an Oscar for their work. This was Jack's 3rd Oscar win with a whopping 12 nominations and Helen's first win and nomination. Just sit back on one beautiful day and enjoy this 139-minute film to its fullest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a famous but arrogant author. There is a reason of him being arrogant. But after some time you'll say that why the f*ck he just can't talk normal? Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) is a waitress in the restaurant where Mr. Udall takes his lunch. And he just wants to be served only by Carol, nobody else. Because she is the only one who can tolerate him. There is no relation between them right now. It's just customer and waitress. Carol got a son. She is single parenting her child and his son got a serious problem. So one day he got little more serious and she had to leave her job to take care of her son. So Udall has to get her back and he does. You'll see in the movie how he does that. There is one more main character in the movie, a gay artist Simon (Greg Kinnear) who gets hospitalize and this event sets the movie in motion. Life of Mr. Udall goes upside down after this. Now there are 2 events in this movie which shakes Mr. Udall's life. 1st is carol not coming to work and 2nd is Simon's dog being abandoned cause he is hospitalized.You'll love this movie because It's got comedy, romance, some drama too and most importantly Jack Nicholson being himself throughout the screen time of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit all the actors were excellent including Jack Nicholson and Greg Kinnear. However, it just completely bored me out a bit since it was 2 hours and I found that Jack Nicholson's really gave out too much jokes that you've heard it all before! At the beginning of the film, I actually thought the part were he shoved the poor dog into the trash box was honestly hilarious. I never honestly laughed out loud in my life. I can't really think of more scene's that made me laugh but definitely that would be memorable forever!I would actually like to have seen Cuba Gooding,Jr. or the dog more often throughout the film, they would've made this film work out for me!I would recommend it to people but I would not put this as one of my top 10 movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is an excellent study for anyone who has studied Mazlov's hierarchy of needs. Both of the main characters (Nicholson and Hunt) are hurting, way out on the charts. Hunt has not succeeded learning economic skills and lives at the edge of poverty with a critically ill son. Nicholson while successfully financially, is forfeit of any humanity skills. Both characters change during the movie, and each characters blatant lack can be filled in by the other. Many thought the age too different and Nicholson's character too weird. I disagree. I believe some viewers saw Helen Hunt, not a destitute waitress. Would a destitute waitress with a sick child be interested in a relationship with a prominent author with noticeable character flaws. You bet. Both Nicholson and Hunt did a wonderful job in this film. Greg Kinnear's portrayal of the gay character together with Hunt's provided a perfect contrast with the Nicholson character and I thought he was wonderful in the part, which was very different then anything else I'd seen him in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A misanthropic writer (Nicholson) finds inspiration to change for the better after falling in love with a waitress (Hunt) and fostering a dog for a neighbor who's been hospitalized (Kinnear). Nostalgic (look at the gas prices!) but also timeless, with an all around charm from the three leads plus the supporting cast consisting of Gooding, Herwick, Kennedy, Knight, Smith and Ulrich. The dosage of comedy is far more potent than the drama and romance, allowing for a chemistry that perfectly dodges anything too far-fetched or overemotional. The Baltimore and New York settings also add an element of class to this long-but-not-boring outing of proudly unusual friendships and love. Easily one of the best movies of the 1990s.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Merlvin Udall is one of most seductive roles by Jack Nicholson. and that fact is not only the result of splendid acting . Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are , in same measure, the tools who gives to Udall a precise, clear configuration. the result - a mixture of bitter romanticism and social picture, remind of every day crisis, the selfish in nice colors and a kind of soup for soul with a lot of spices. each of them does a seductive show. a film who reminds basic truth, who reflects the differences between people, who reflects personal problems in new light. a film about the importance of the other for define yourself. not great, sure. but interesting, amusing and, maybe, useful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes! This is a great movie. Not everyone will get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about isolated people showing each other, at different turns, kindness and ending up happier than they were. And it is a film about a writer, a far from empathetic character, starting the process of becoming a better person.This is really a film for persons who have had lots of quality time with, or been, someone like Melvin Udall - isolated, and socially, and emotionally unaware. Without that experience base, it's probably hard to care about.The rest of us will see mirrors in Melvin's words and the reactions of Carol, Simon, and others. You can cringe at some horrible things that he says, wince at his mistakes, nod at an unpleasant event he brings on himself, and again as he starts to get it.There's nothing close to a typical romance in this film. Melvin is not much of a prize. After Melvin sends a financial lifeline (of a sort), Carol realizes that he must have a crush on her. She's appreciative, but concerned about what it means having THIS guy interested in her. One can only wonder how many women have had experiences like this with socially and emotionally unaware guys.Carol spends part of the film impatient with him, wondering what's with him, and wondering what's there, and asking whether it'd be workable or not. One has to wonder how many women have found themselves doing this, over the eons.The other subtext is about the way that Melvin, Carol, and Simon all end the film happier than they started, after experiencing time together and each showing the other kindnesses.The way that these aspects of life are familiar to people, I think, is a big reason why the film ended up walking off with a couple of Oscars. It deserves them. It's not a film for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films that just wouldn't be the same without it's lead actors, well As Good as it Gets is one of those films. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars for Melvin Udall and Carol Connelly respectively. Udall should be a very unlikable character for all the offensive and despicable things he does, but it's because of Nicholson's charm and charisma that makes you root for him. Hunt does the same with single mother who just wants to provide for her sick son. It's an unlikely combination but one that turns into one of the sweetest romantic comedies of all time.The story is somewhat like Gran Torino in that it's a man who that finds everyone and everything around him to be annoying. Udall is racist, sexist, homophobic, and also has OCD. Of course, there's a lot more to Melvin than seen on the outside. He just has a difficult time showing how much he cares. Some of the sweetest and most satisfying moments of the film involve him complimenting the people he had spent the entire film hating. Greg Kinnear plays Simon, his gay neighbor, and has his fair share of quarrels with Melvin. It's really not till the road trip between Carol, Melvin, and Simon that the three really find their groove. It's three people all with problems but they each find a way to help one another. Sometimes they don't even realize what they're doing is helping but eventually they get there.As Good as it Gets is a bittersweet film about acceptance and dealing with your own problems with the help of others. The performances, script, Hans Zimmer's score, and directing are very good. It's one of Jack Nicholson's best.+Lead performances +Score +Bittersweet story +Ending 9.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson deserved the best Oscar (only just compared to Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting). Helen Hunt was Helen Hunt, really good comedic timing and some really deep dramatic moments but it seemed like she wasn't doing anything she hadn't done before. She was still good though. Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr were good as well, although Cuba Gooding Jr was a little underused I think.The plot doesn't really go anywhere. It is good and there is nothing wrong with it but there is nothing really right about it either. It is really a by the numbers RomCom in that it does all it has to do and that's it. No more, no less, It really is as good as it gets.The jokes are a little too far and few between, there are some serious moments that hold the movie down from being over the top romantic comedy and make the movie seem more real.The run time for the movie is probably the worst thing. At just over 2 hours it kind of over stays its welcome to me. Makes me wonder whether or not it may have faired better as a sitcom? Good for a viewing at least once just for the sake of Jack doing what he does best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of the typical Romance Comedies that we have been seeing for the last decade. I think it is a hard genre to crack as they can become predictable very quickly. HOWEVER 'As good as it gets' is most definitely an exception.Essentially this film is a combination of 3 actors and some layered and smooth writing. I say smooth because it rolls off each actors tongue and contains an element of poetry that doesn't cringe you out. What more can you want from a Romance film? This is a character based film that merges the naturalistic with the unlikely. It is the solid acting that makes the unbelievable narrative believable. You see 3 dimensional characters all develop in some way through the connections with one another. Simple. This wasn't a typical romance film because unpredictable it was and pretentious it wasn't.All in all a feel good, tummy tickling, bundle of delight. Romance/Comedy/Drama</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an actor Jack Nicholson is, of course we already know that. Unlike previous films he's been in, he plays a very interesting character that goes from unlikeable to likable, and only Nicholson can deliver a mixture of nastiness, and yet kind. Although Nicholson gives a stellar performance, he's not alone. Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, and the role that began his career for Cuba Gooding Jr., also give off great performances. It is a film any movie fan or critic should watch. However keep this away from small children due to the fact it has nudity and profanity which they should avoid. But for the mature audience, have at it. Because this dramedy is as good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is utterly brilliant as Melvin Udall - a man who learns to be generous simply by his adherence to his formula - charming, funny and quick-witted, whilst still emotional and pained by his disorder. Helen Hunt is delightfully memorable, giving a warm and open hearted performance as Carol. Greg Kinnear is also effective, but the little he has to work with in the script prevents him from achieving the same level of success as his co-stars. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Jill the dog are also scene-stealers.The chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt is magnificent, despite the age gap that is distracting at times, and Nicholson really glosses up some of the film's best lines. The script does feel padded at times - Kinnear's character feels like an afterthought at times, and the romance ducks and weaves for about 20 minutes too long - but As Good As It Gets is so open hearted and disarmingly charming that it is worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if this is as good as it gets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As good as it gets is without doubt the greatest romantic comedy of the last 30 years. And it will surely join such Classics as When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless In Seattle and An Affair To Remember in the hall of fame of the genre. James L. Brooks teams up legendary Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt in a duo which has warmth, honesty and tenderness rolled into it. Coupled with Brooks' perfect romantic timing, use of the well chosen score and you have one of the sweetest, most sensitive and heart warming movie seen in years. As Good As It Gets was in my view robbed of the Best picture and Best Director awards at the 1997 Academy Awards by a blockbuster called Titanic. And to further validate my statement both Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won respectively Best Actor and Best Actress for their performance in As Good As It Gets, NOT Leornardo Di Caprio or Kate Winslet. If you are for the over the top, over romanticized and somehow unrealistic love stories then you would probably think that Titanic is better. But, if you stop and think a little, after watching As Good As It Gets then your answer may not be the same anymore. Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will never truly understand how this film got all the way to the Oscars nor why it receives praises. The movie has its moments of sentimentality but they are few. For the most part, this movie is pretty much a misfire. Jack Nicholson plays novelist Melvin Udall, a misanthropic obsessive compulsive with a lot of venom. He has lunch at a Manhattan restaurant every day and insists on the same waitress to serve him. The waitress is Carol (Helen Hunt), a struggling single mother with a sick child at home and most likely the only one who knows how to handle Melvin. Suddenly, Melvin's world is turned upside down when he is tasked with caring for his gay artist next door neighbor's dog. The neighbor is Simon played by Greg Kinnear who is recovering from a violent burglary and then faces financial troubles after a failed art show. Okay I will cut to the chase and just say that the film suddenly turns into a road movie that leads to self awakening and blah blah blah. What's wrong with the movie? Fourteen years later I saw it again to see if maybe there was something I missed but no its still flawed and clichs. I still dislike this movie. It tries to be a comedy but every one liner from Jack Nicholson is a misfire. It tries to be sentimental but it is not sincere enough to pull it off. It tries to be romantic but there is absolutely no chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt. Jack Nicholson, well, he's Jack. This performance is not groundbreaking and its a role that he has played before under James L. Brooks: obnoxious bachelor with a heart of gold?somewhere. Helen Hunt is lovely and sometimes sympathetic but this is not a performance that was worthy of an Oscar (I am laying it out that Judy Dench was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar for "Mrs. Brown" and even Ms. Hunt would admit it). Greg Kinnear is actually the only character I prefer to have seen more. He gave a performance that was the complete opposite of his usual style. The film is unbelievable, forced, and underwritten. The characters are two-dimensional and the plot is mostly sitcom material that disguises itself as a drama. Also, who the hell would fall in love with someone like Melvin Udall?!?!</fullReview>

And bring these three up you have As Good As It Gets, a small film that is done so wonderfully by its leads Jack Nicholson as Melvin Udall and Helen Hunt as Carol. It's hard not to fall in love with these characters or their eccentricities and histrionics. Also to mention Greg Kinnear as Simon who does a pretty good job. Now what about the dog Verdell who too has shown good emotions and responded pretty naturally. Now, done with performances appraisal, now lets rip the movie with its further study.Screenplay is lethargic rather placid I must say and its a long drawn out for nearly more than 2 hours to convey a point and to express a feeling. Now, situations had to be fabricated to squeeze such feelings out of the characters and this is where I did not like it, like the road trip to understand each other or the act to have a doctor see Carol's son. These are a few overboard things in which is otherwise a pretty decent film. The direction is not so much there and rather unappreciable in adding up unwanted scenes here and there and making it a bit messy than needed. Now, having said all the above, dialog by Mark Andrus and James L Brooks is outstanding and thats what sets this film engaging though scattered and long. All other departments are just fine and have done their job rather commendably.I give it a 3/5 a good one for sure just and supreme acting and good dialog makes it a worth romantic comedy. I wish our Telugu or even Hindi Films are more subtle and simple like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As romantic comedies go, As Good as It Gets is near the top tier. It's funny, sweet, and compelling all at the same time, and these are the kind of films which allow me to enjoy the rom-com. This film is not perfect as some scenes drag on and it is a bit on the long side, but it's well-acted and the characters are a big strong point for the film itself thanks to the endearing performances by Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear.James L. Brooks film tells the story of what happens when an elderly romance author, a Manhattan waitress, and a gay artist come together on a road trip from New York City to Baltimore. It's an unlikely friendship that blossoms between the three.The acting is incredible. Jack Nicholson deserves his Oscar for his excellent, over-the-top acting. I have never big a big fan of Helen Hunt, but she gives an excellent performance here as the waitress who is trying to provide for her always-sick son. Also, Greg Kinnear was excellent as Jack's neighbor and I liked how he doesn't give an over-the-top performance to prove that his character is gay.Overall, As Good as It Gets is a pleasurable romantic comedy that is sweet and endearing. I can only really enjoy the very good rom coms and this is one of those. With a little more editing, this film could have been perfect. But thanks to the compelling performances of the three leads, this film is near perfection. It shows that anyone can love if you put your heart to it. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the characters. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. It is hard to describe life. Stories about mutants fighting wars in different galaxies, that is easy to describe; but writing about life, sometimes all you can say is, "It's about life." And so I award this movie 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a romance novel writer who has problems. He bullies his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). In fact, the first thing he does in the movie is to shove Simon's dog down the garbage chute. He's a petty angry horrible man suffering some OCD. He has to eat at the restaurant where Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) works as his personal waitress. She's a tough woman trying to get by with a sick child. When Simon is attacked in his home, Melvin is left to take care of the dog.Of course he learns to accept other people. He falls Carol and she saves him from a bitter lonely life. That's the basic storyline and director James L. Brooks adds the colors of a memorable performance by Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is definitely tapping into his sly mean-spirited self. Some of his action is funny, but a lot of it is too angry. I wish he had more vulnerability at the start to allow the audience to root for him.Helen Hunt is obviously way too young for Jack Nicholson. But there is something about Jack that he can certainly get a woman that age in real life. It's Helen Hunt that doesn't really fit. She isn't really the MPDG type. She seems to be too smart to get involved with that mess. Although it makes for a good movie.</fullReview>

The three start to become somewhat dependent on one another, against their own expectations.'As Good As It Gets' is one of those movies that I remember seeing the trailer of, but never felt the need to see. Just seemed like a boring rom-com with actors I didn't really care about. 'As Good As It Gets' is, in fact, an incredibly funny and quirky movie that was fully deserving of the Oscars that it won. The script is the strong-point of the movie. Issues of homophobia, racism, misogyny and countless other prejudices are touched with a sharp, cynical twang. Emotional moments are slapped in the face by cutting jokes, never letting the audience settle in.A script is only as good as the people who recite it, though, and there's a reason why Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars for their performances. Sure, everyone is else as just as good, but the two leads are magnetic. Nicholson does a perfect job of playing the grumpy Melvin Udall, and he never really stops being grumpy; and this works excellently in response to Helen Hunt's exhausted but ever-optimistic Carol Connelly. The chemistry between the two is top-notch.You could argue that, perhaps, that the film goes on too long. It's over two hours long, when ninety minutes would have been absolutely fine. That extra time allows the film-makers to populate the film with other slightly bizarre characters, all adding to the general acerbic aura of the film. However, it's two hours of excellent acting, breathing beautiful life into some excellently written dialogue. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You make me want to be a better man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Good as It Gets positions itself from the get-go as the romantic comedy to recommend to people who don't like romantic comedies. The first scene establishes Melvin (Jack Nicholson) as a cold asshole, the second reveals his OCD, establishing him altogether as a guy you wouldn't normally find in a romcom, while also getting people who are bummed about being forced to see the film on board. In the third, however, we find Melvin writing romantic literature, pointing out the direction of the film. Shot from behind some shelves, we are told that his sensitive side is hidden only deep beneath, but as the camera moves to the other side of the shelves for the next shot, we also know that this side will be uncovered eventually.The grittiness of the film is pretty much limited to Nicholson's unusually bad behavior and allowing the actors to curse, which is hardy enough to subvert genre conventions. Other than that, there's not much originality in the "unlikely love" trope or the gay supporting characters. But as always, just because we know A and B does not mean there isn't any fun to be had getting there.There's a really weird pacing to this film. As described above, the protagonist is presented very economically, as is his counterpart Carol (Helen Hunt), but then it feels like the film noodles around for like an hour, which only feels partly necessary for developing the characters and their relations further. In any case there is really no need for this film to be more than two hours long. Once the unlikely trio Melvin, Carol, and Melvin's gay neighbor Simon go on their trip, though, the film becomes a lot of fun. Comedies rarely make me laugh when I'm alone but both "I'm afraid he might pull the stiff one-eye on me" and something about "whether crabs were in season now" made me lose it. The film also delivers in the sweetness and romance department; "You make me want to be a better man" is one of the most heartwarming lines ever.I think one of the measures of success is if you want the lead characters to get together at the end of the film. As an incurable cynic, I wouldn't have minded if the only victory was the suggestion that Melvin's ailment was improving (by him forgetting to lock his door and finally stepping on some tiles), but the mere fact that I wasn't bothered by the happy ending was a small victory in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent!... But too long...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very well scripted with some really great one-liners; mostly delivered by Jack Nicholson; although there is one point where Greg Kinnear does a rather good impression. Both Jack and Helen Hunt put in great performances that were worthy of praise. My main niggle is that it is way too long; it could have easily been shortened by at least 20 minutes and that would have maybe given it a little more punch. Not that I was bored you understand, far from it, I just felt it would have benefited from being a little shorter. Enough of that; it's a very well made film with some excellent performances and a touching, well written, script. Well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very interesting movie in that it immediately establishes Jack Nicholson as a terrible person and then spends the rest of the movie trying to convince you he's better than you'd think. Nicholson is up to the challenge, being monstrous in the beginning and then slowly softening, but never flattening out, the rough edges. Hunt is equally excellent with his very convincing portrayal of a Brooklyn waitress, catching the spirit of someone leading a very ordinary life. Like most James L. Brooks movies, this one is quite amusing. It's also rather touching, so much so that I was willing to forgive it for its utter unlikeliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as It Get defines this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably my most favorite movie. The only difficulty I personally have Is watching the graphic beating of Simom. But I derived a somewhat relieving observation the last time I watched it. In the middle of the furor of the horrible beating of Simon, one of the thugs said excuse me to another thug as he passed by him. I thought that was hilarious and it softened the effect for me. I have seen the movie at least twenty times and don't remember hearing that before. I was wondering if the dialog was different in subsequent released versions. The part that helps make the movie so important is Melvin defending himself to Carol. He tells her about his medicine and his new resolve to take it. She makes him want to be a better man. That humanizes his recognition of his cold logical compulsive behavior. That he wants to do something about it is a tribute to him and a challenge to everybody else. Tthanks for the great "As Good as It Gets". Chet Ruminski</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had written this in 1997 when the movie came out, I would have said bizarre, weird, hard to follow, full of eccentric characters who I usually like. Sort of like my life during the late 60s. But not a movie I thought I would care to see again.But here it is 16 years later - a lifetime has passed, both for me and for this country. The film is comforting, a link back to how life used to be for many of us, those of us who chose to live in metropolitan areas around all kinds of folks. Where perhaps we ourselves fit in better - rather than a small town environment where everyone knows everyone else's business.The one character who is grounded is Helen Hunt's mother - especially with her comment towards the end about no relationship being sane. So true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great original movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always nice going to see a film that is original not only that but add comedy, a fresh story with just using a few characters no extra special effects or fluff. Its a great formula that creates a lot of beauty, warmth and emotion. The characters absolutely make this movie it was like they became the characters. This movie had a lot of warmth and overall goodness. Jack Nicholson had a great performance playing someone with ocd and a little on the bitter side. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear also played the parts perfectly and showed a lot of convincing emotions that didn't even seem like they were acting. The way all the characters played their parts it was hard to predict what was going to happen next even when you know what would be said or how they would act in a certain situation. The engaging and captivating story of a troubled insecure man, who then helps and insecure waitress and the unlikely bond they develop to being almost soul mates after some tribulations and self learning. Kinnear's character seems to be put in the position as a bridge and barrier between Jack and Helen. It is interesting that even with all their differences, they still share some of the same problems and those seem to bring all of them together. The one important message while seeing this was that regardless of the road blocks life throws at us that keep us from achieving happiness, there is still ways we can find to take a step forward and reverse our perceived misfortunes. This was one of best romantic comedies that has come from Hollywood and it is successful in entertaining the audience. Overall a sentimental romantic comedy that is really made better with the performance on Jack Nicholson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How good a romantic comedy can get ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a weird exhilarating feeling watching the compulsive obsessive Melvin Udall delivering so many insults, homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic, as if he allowed himself to express his personal grudge against the whole world. But I guess the character ceases to be detestable only on the account that he's played by Jack Nicholson, we can easily suspect that he was written with 'Jack' in mind for only he can elevate a curmudgeon to such a level of reverse likability, maybe because the eyes betray a touch of vulnerability that try to cover his expressive eyebrows. Yet, although it's not too hazardous to assume that by the end of the film, the inner goodness of 'Uncle Scrooge' will finally blossom, when the movie starts with Udall throwing of the neighbor's dog Verdell in the trash chute, we're left with mixed feelings.Thankfully, the relative vileness of good old Udall is compensated by the presence of one of the sweetest female characters ever written for a romantic comedy. Helent Hunt plays a sort of everyday 'Dorothy Boyd'. I wonder by the way if Albert Brooks took some inspiration from "Jerry Maguire" (I personally doubt it's a coincidence that Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as the neighbor's boyfriend) but it would be reduce Helen Hunt's role through a comparison, the movie glows out of her touching sensitivity. Provided she lives with her mother, her son suffers from a chronic asthma, so she doesn't have time to think for herself, her performance transcends the cinematic banality of her situation. She wonderfully plays the kind of women so constantly in a state of panic and anxiety that any relief could leave her with some emotional alter-effects. In a way, like Udall, she's also depending on habits that canceled off all her chances to find love, to even dream about it.The two characters are meant to be together, but I concede that's a feeling guided by movies standards. I doubt that a man like Udall would be with a woman the age of his daughter. Maybe an older woman would have fit the story, or a younger man, or maybe we shouldn't be too optimistic about what happens two weeks after the closing scene, but once the movie establishes the characters, and before they end up together, it's all about the human interactions, the ups-and-downs between two lonely hearts taken in a sentimental maze. Their relationship can almost be compared to these labyrinth games where you have to guess from which point to start to get to the end, only this time, you can't cheat by starting from the end, everything has to be done by the book and God, how hard it gets for these two, even by romantic comedies' standards.But if as a rom-com, "As Good as it Gets" delivers the classic material, as a human comedy, it's a wonderful exploration of the way different people can influence each other for the better, how love and friendship can be planted by the seeds of generosity. I insist on the human comedy term, because general romantic comedies rely on two main characters with foils meant to separate or reunite them. "As Good as it Gets" is enriched by the addition of the gay neighbor, an ill-fated artist painter who's beaten by one of his models' friends after a botched burglary. Greg Kinnear is Simon, a young man whose life totally falls apart and can only find hope through the help of the very guy who threw his Verdell in the trash chute. And Verdell plays a significant part too, would have he been shown in the poster otherwise?Verdell is the first intrusion in Udall's solitary life, but the cohabitations goes surprisingly well, Udall plays "Always Look on the Bright Side of his Life" (a priceless joke by itself) and the dog eats the bacon, at the end, Udall and Verdell acclimated to each other and Simon realizes that if the dog liked him, maybe he's not such a bad guy. Basically, the whole film consists on Udall revealing more generous sides of his personalities, but ruining everything at the most crucial moment. When he hires a doctor to take care of Carol's son, without any costs for her, he not only saves the boy, but also changes Carol and her mother's life. He asks nothing in return, except when the opportunity comes, to accompany him, while he's driving Simon to his parents. We suspect the trip will be pivotal for the three characters, but it's all in the way it happens and how Simon acts as a perfect buffer between Carol and Udall.And the love-and-hate relationship reaches a beautiful paroxysm during a restaurant dinner, when Udall makes such a despicable remark; he's forced to counterbalance it by a nice word. Carol begs for a compliment not because she's desperate but because the moment is too romantic to be ruined, they have to act as normal persons for once. After a confused monologue, Udall finds the perfect wording with the unforgettable "You make me want to be a better man", which is the "You had me at 'hello'" of the film, but more meaningfully. Yet we're so used to his personality that we expect the word too many. The relationship seems doomed unless Carol stops being obsessive of having a better man, and does her best to look on the bright side on Udall.You know how good "As Good as it Gets" is? It makes you realize how some romantic comedies were not as good as you thought. Naturally, at the end, the obligatory happy ending kind of belittle the whole originality reached by the film, yet the feeling is swept off by a total relief, to see finally these two tortured characters having a break, and enjoying a good time, we hope to be as long, or perhaps, as good it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Romcoms Ever Released On Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James L. Brooks directed this $50 million-plus romantic comedy entitled,As Good As It Gets,that features Jack Nicholson as a misanthropic, obsessive-compulsive novelist; Helen Hunt as a single mother with an asthmatic son; and Greg Kinnear as a gay artist. The screenplay was written by Mark Andrus and by Brooks as well.Dysfunctional, acid-tongued romance novelist Melvin Udall suffers from an obsessive-compulsive disorder and takes pride in his ability to offend. At a nearby cafe, the only waitress willing to stand up to his sarcastic tirades is Carol Connelly, a single mother struggling to raise her chronically asthmatic son. In Melvin's West Village apartment building, talented contemporary artist Simon Nye lives across the hall from Melvin. Simon is the current darling of the New York art world, reason enough to draw Melvin's verbal fire, but Simon's gay lifestyle is further grist for the novelist's malicious mill. These three New Yorkers, none of whom appears to have a chance in hell at finding true happiness, discover their fates intertwined because of the fourth complicated character in the piece, Verdell, a tiny Brussels Griffon dog . Melvin seems to have no friends or family, and he lives alone, working on his 62nd book. When Simon goes into the hospital after a brutal mugging, Melvin has to take care of Verdell, and the dog actually warms Melvin's cold heart to the degree that he sets up unsolicited medical care for Carol's son. Eventually, Melvin is cornered into driving Simon and Carol to Baltimore, and during a hotel stopover, Melvin confesses to Carol, "You make me want to be a better man." The trip becomes an odyssey of self-realization for all three. It's a mark of how magically written, directed and acted,it is that the viewer will end up loving this film despite knowing how haphazard, scatter shot and almost indefinable its charm is.Both James L. Brooks and Jack Nicholson, doing what they do best, combine smart dialogue and flawless acting to squeeze fresh entertainment value out of the romantic-comedy genre.Added to that,it is both funny and sad, the comedy was in the vein of Brooks' Terms of Endearment, except it was more eccentric and nuttier and in moments genuinely touching due to strong chemistry between Nicholson and Helen Hunt.It succeeds at many moments even while pursuing its doomed grand design.Overall,it is one of the best romantic comedies ever released on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would take a lot more convincing for me to believe that someone like Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) and Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) could ever get together for a feel good movie ending, but a lot of the picture does seem to work in redeeming these totally dysfunctional characters. Personally, I don't know if I'd have the patience for it.Nicholson plays his role perfectly here. Maintaining his humanity at a distance allows Melvin to be a curmudgeon most of the time, just because it's easier than making the extra effort to be a nice guy. I get it about the obsessive-compulsive business, it can be debilitating when one has to avoid sidewalk cracks and count each turn of the door lock.The best thing for me about this picture was watching the emotion in the actors' faces. Nicholson, Hunt and Greg Kinnear were all exceptional in the way they handled their characters. Helen Hunt probably had the most to offer in that regard, and I never appreciated her professionalism as an actress until I caught her here. I don't know about Verdell though. Who else thought that was one ugly pup?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie with Lots of Profanity!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melvin Udall is a misanthrope who works at home as a best-selling novelist in New York City. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological mysophobia. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly, the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior. One day, Melvin's neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop, is assaulted and nearly killed. Melvin is forced to care for Simon's dog Verdell while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol. When Bishop is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog. Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son (Jesse James). Unable to adjust to another waitress, Melvin arranges to pay for her son's medical expenses if Carol agrees to continue working at her previous restaurant in Manhattan. Meanwhile, Simon's assault and rehabilitation, coupled with Verdell's preference for Melvin, causes Simon to lose his creative muse. Simon is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills. Simon's agent, Frank Sachs, convinces Simon to go to Baltimore and ask his estranged parents for money. Frank offers Melvin use of his car for the trip. Melvin invites Carol to accompany them on the trip to lessen the awkwardness. She reluctantly accepts the invitation, and relationships among the three develop. Once in Baltimore, Carol persuades Melvin to take her out to have dinner. Melvin's comments during the dinner greatly upset Carol, and she abruptly leaves. Upon seeing the frustrated Carol, Simon begins to sketch her and rekindles his creativity, once more feeling a desire to paint. He briefly reconnects with his parents, but is able to tell them that he'll be fine. After returning to New York City, Carol tells Melvin that she does not want him in her life anymore. She later regrets her statement and calls him to apologize. The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon, whom Melvin has allowed to move in with him until he can get a new apartment, convinces Melvin to declare his love for her at her apartment in Brooklyn, where the two realize the depth of their personal connection. The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together to buy fresh rolls at the corner bakery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to this with some reservations, fearing that it was going to be yet one more movie to milk the theme of misanthrope redeemed by the power of love. And it was that, but it had enough unique qualities that it worked for me. I was sucked in by it. It flowed along nicely and held my interest.I found the characters to be believable and absorbing. Jack Nicholson has a tendency to go over the top, but I though he was masterful in his creation of Melvin. He seemed to have a real grasp on what Melvin was like. Some of the facial expressions he used when he realized he had screwed up were wonderful, and the fact that Melvin had to be beaten over the head before he knew he had screwed up I thought was much in keeping with the character. I don't think too many actors could have pulled this part off--to play a somewhat despicable character but make you care for him.The acting was uniformly good. I particularly liked Carol's mother.I like the way the movie showed the price some people have to pay for who they are and what they are. Even though the movie had a lot of humor, I admired it for presenting Melvin in a way that made you feel how difficult life was for him. I particularly liked the scene where Melvin asked Simon whether it wouldn't be a lot easier if he just liked women and Simon said "Do you think your life is easy?" and Melvin said, "I'll give you that one." It was a recognition on Melvin's part as to how hard it is to change what we are. So many times Melvin's compulsions put him in conflict with society and his own desires, like when he wanted to dance but couldn't, or not being able to wear the suit and tie offered him in the restaurant. Melvin's gradual improvement made sense to me. He had serious problems and probably was never going to be "normal," but isolation usually exacerbates such problems and positive social interaction helps.I don't believe the ending was necessarily a happy one. If Melvin and Carol were ever to have a long term relationship there was going to be some pretty tough sledding ahead.The fact that Melvin was wealthy and had some special talent led him to a better life. I just kept thinking of all the people who have problems similar to Melvin's who live in their private hells with limited ways out. Or was Melvin's life hell before he met Carol? He did make the comment about how meeting her had cut him off from his previous life and he couldn't get back. That would probably be pretty scary for someone like Melvin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There you are the title defines the film itself. I resorted to the thought that I should be seeing a film one of the best actors living nowadays had acted with. I have to site that Jack Nicholson's best performance I've seen so far was since "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". And I can't help grinning at thought of bringing the remnants of his acting trademarks which I saw in this film. Just creatively witty and this is the first time I saw Helen Hunt! She's just wonderful as well. It's indeed a bit off to imagine a grumpy, OCD writer, a troubled gay neighbor and a caring single mother would join and enjoy the full circle. It was really cool to see Nicholson do the part of bigoted, obsessively compulsive writer. Seeing and hearing Melvin Udall get to his clumsy attitudes amuses me, Nicholson is just cute for the part and he did it nicely. Helen Hunt has a bit of craziness and insensitivity there, but that's her character. The thought of hating it actually pulled through her acting skills. Greg Kinnear was also better. He did agreeably his role and it was splendid. The one impressed the most was the dog. It's funny, but considerably trained dog could have pulled the role. That was innovative. One thing lacking though is the part of Nicholson's character. I wish they could have emphasized more the background of his character's unlikely behavior. It wasn't only OCD that described Melvin's strange attitude but there was something else in there. I was thinking they could have focused on that side more deeply. The scene that struck me, it was only a moment but it was electric for me, was when Melvin was told to return the dog as Simon (Greg) was about to get better and wanted the dog back sooner. At that moment I saw how powerfully Jack Nicholson got into the character's deeply sad side. He was about to lose something that made him feel better. It was as if just the prior thought of it makes it painful for him. He cried! I almost cried seeing that! That was potent! I wish they could have brought a piece of that Melvin's side to Helen Hunt's character. But I realized later, the film went well probably without getting too much on that part. I've learned that a little of something so electrifyingly sensitive and catchy is best shown in seconds and in a single time only. As powerful as Jack Nicholson's performance at One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, this has to be his second most evocative performance. It should be understood that the film was more of a romantic comedy. Well I guess the little dramatic side of it makes it stands out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting perhaps too much, but from what I observed after watching this film, AS GOOD AS IT GETS is the kind of earnest Hollywood "crowd-pleaser" that no one used to mistake for art. But with its high industry and audience acclaim, you may feel like a cynic if you don't quite believe in Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt as a romantic duo. Like AMISTAD, the film skillfully preys on your emotional vulnerabilities. If you're like me, though, and prefer to respond to movies with ALL your senses and faculties--to free yourself to enjoy a movie on truer terms--it's all right to feel irritated.The movie has an idea, but it's a dippy one. Nicholson is Melvin Udall, a selfish, mean-spirited obsessive-compulsive who melts for a noble single mother named Carol (Helen Hunt). For an hour, writer-director James L. Brooks generously allows the actors to take risks with their characters, and the film gracefully glides between modest human comedy and affecting drama. However, Nicholson and Hunt don't match up, and once they hit the road with starving-artist Greg Kinnear, Brooks struggles to find a suitable tone. He doesn't succeed, partly because we're left asking why Carol should settle for such a caustic jerk.Look closely, and you'll also notice that Brooks treats Melvin more like a traveling sideshow than as a person (his anti-gay tirades are almost delightful character quirks). To Brooks, Melvin's acrimony isn't just benign, it's endearing. AS GOOD AS IT GETS is an insubstantial put-on, a sincere fakery of "human relationships." Yet Nicholson, in a teasingly churlish and amusing performance, misbehaves mightily. His eyes widen simply at the prospect of verbal combat.</fullReview>

It is its own film, not a blatant comedy yet not a drama, it fuses many genres together, and does so brilliantly. I went into this film not knowing what to expect, which sometimes I prefer as you can be nicely surprised, which was the case with As Good As It Gets. There was never a moment were I drifted off, my attention was completely focused for every minute of the film, and when the ending came I could not help but smile.I would strongly recommend this film to any film fan in general, as its a great piece of film making, but especially to any Nicholson fan, not to take anything away from anyone else in the film, but Nicholson shines brighter than the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"As Good As It Gets" is just one of those movies that makes you feel good, at least it does me. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt proved themselves to be deserving of those Oscars, while Greg Kinnear also gave an Oscar-deserving portrayal of Melvin's (Jack Nicholson) gay neighbor. I love this movie so much because it shows how when people come in contact with each other, the unexpected often occurs. The three main characters have these problems that they unsucessfully try to solve on their own, not realizing that they can help each other out. As stated by Melvin to Carol, "You make me want to be a better man." With amazing direction by James L.Brooks, this is a great movie. It has a lot of laughs, but really is very touching. It's a movie about real life for everyday people. Without a doubt, "As Good As It Gets" was definitely the best film of 1997 (despite the Academy's opinion). :)</fullReview>

The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner. I appreciated practically every element in this wonderful, delightful masterpiece of exemplary romantic comedy, in its indelible acting (Oscars well deserved), its whimsical, touching screenplay (This was neons above "Good Will Hunting"'s quality) and its comforting morale, that despite all of the great odds in life which prevent us from being happy, we can perhaps find it within ourselves to take that one important step in reversing our fortunes, in "stopping with taking pills" and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy, certainly the best film of 1997, and one of the greatest films of all time, "As Good As It Gets" succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'AS GOOD AS IT GETS' focuses on Nicholson's character Melvin, telling the story of how he copes with having an obsessive compulsive disorder, which is evidently destructive on the lives of those who surround him. Exhausting ritualistic patterns such as washing his hands in boiling water, forbidding anyone to physically touch him, are among just a few of his alienating habits. Aside from apparent intimacy issues, he is also a confrontational homophobic--suffice it to say that he doesn't appreciate living next door to Simon (played by Greg Kinnear) who is a gay artist. Upon following events, Melvin aspires to win the affections of Carol (played by Helen Hunt) who is a compassionate yet lonely waitress. Hesitantly she opens up her heart to him and discovers that beyond his appalling behaviour, is a man who is capable of demonstrating huge acts of kindness, who has sincere feelings for her.Despite having an emotional undercurrent the film should definitely be stamped as being in the comedy genre; there are many instances of notably hilarious material, in this positively shining script, especially in the classic scene, where Simon confronts Melvin, about throwing his beloved dog down a garbage shoot. Expect to be surprised by this film; the rarity of the magnificent script, combining with the multitude of talent in the cast, makes it magnetically engaging from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melvin is a romantic novelist who is a selfish manic compulsive who is rude and insulting to all he meets. When Melvin's gay neighbour is beaten up and robbed, Melvin agrees to look after his dog. The dog gives Melvin something to care about other than himself and his life is approaching normal until his regular waitress has to leave work to look after her asthmatic son and his neighbour wants his dog back. Melvin starts to realise that his life needs others for more than just selfish reasons.The big Oscar winner for Jack is recent years is enjoyable if you come to it knowing what to expect. The film is very sentimental but in a good way. The film is gently comic and amusing and the characters (although exaggerated) are winning and involving. The telling is a little long winded at times and the film could have been shorter but it is still enjoyable. It does tip over into sickly sentimentality at times and can be a bit syrupy but it comes with the territory.Nicholson is excellent and is the main reason it all works well. His un-PC Melvin is funny but also a character that you can hate and pity on several occasions. Kinnear is good because he is a solid understated character and not hammy or OTT like he can be. Hunt is good but is left with the majority of the syrup and sentiment where the other characters get more share of the laughs. Gooding Jr continues his trend of being good in over the top roles and is funny and happily avoids becoming a flaming gay stereotype.Overall this is a sentimental romantic comedy that is typical for the genre. The story wanders to it's point but the good cast, led by a great Nicholson, hold the whole thing together. A superior piece of sentimentality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Very Nice and humorous film boosted by excellent performances from Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, showing us that friendship and love is a part of anyone's life. This Movie is about a Grumpy Writer Named Melvin Udall(Jack) who lives on his own in an apartment,and does not have any friends, and lives his life very disciplined,about how he develops a friendship with his Gay Neighbour(Greg) and a love interest towards a waitress of the restaurant he goes to have his breakfast(Helen).The Portrayal of Melvin from Jack Nicholson is quite honestly ''as good as it gets'' and he also got an Oscar for this role along with Helen Hunt who portrays a mother trying to cure her child's sickness while trying to find happiness at the same time quite brilliantly. The Supporting roles from Greg Kinnear and Shirley Knight are also well portrayed. The Director does a good job making this movie into a very good movie with a very good cast. This movie is very good mainly due to the excellent performances from Jack and Helen, and funny and anyone can watch it and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson won an Oscar in "As Good as It Gets" for playing a slightly more outrageous version of the role Jack Nicholson almost always plays. Helen Hunt won the Oscar while playing somewhat against type and showing she's an excellent actress. There are really very few surprises in this film. The premise is on the far side of implausible but the viewer knows pretty well from the start how it's going to come out. The stinker (Nicholson) is going, against his will, to become the good guy and the put-upon single mom (Hunt) is going to get him although most of the time she can't stand him The gay guy (Greg Kinnear) is going to become friends with the gay-basher (Nicholson) and the dog-hater (Nicholson again) is going fall in love with the adorable pooch. Despite this predictability, the film is a lot of fun. Nicholson is a star because he's very good at being "Jack Nicholson." Helen Hunt, although slightly less of a luminary, always manages to display an attractive and sympathetic character. Whulke she's not a kid any more, she's still a very good looking woman. I have no idea of Greg Kinnear's sexuality but he fits the stereotypical "gay" role perfectly. He's a step beyond handsome, soft-spoken, artistic and in love with his dog. Together, the improbable trio (plus the cute little pooch) strike inflammatory sparks off one another in the beginning of the movie and eventually produce sparks of an altogether different variety. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a significant role as an agent of change by threatening to pound the stuffings out of Nicholson's misanthropic dog-hater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creator of the Simpsons tries his hand at movie making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was directed by one of the creators of the Simpsons and it was his first movie. It is a movie about relationships: between the women that you love, and between those that you just cannot stand. It is about those of us who must have things go our own way and cannot stand it when things go against us. In a nut shell, as Good as it Gets is simply a damn good movie. This movie explores relationships. It is centred around a man who is obsessive compulsive. He must have everything go exactly as he wants it to. He sits in the same seat in the same restaurant for breakfast everyday and has the same waitress serve him. He has a homosexual neighbour who he cannot stand because he is not normal. Everything of going the way he wants it to until his neighbour is beaten up and sent to hospital and his favourite waitress can no longer go to work because of the fact that her son is very ill. Jack Nicholson is nothing less that brilliant in this movie. I relate to the character in a way because I know that I have an obsessive compulsive streak and it was amusing watching him and knowing that these traits one experiences. But deeper than that, there is a little of the Simpsons coming out in this movie, the way something that is in all of use is exaggerated to a point where it is absurd. The movie is focused around Jack Nicholson's character because it is he who are we supposed to relate to, not the homosexual nor the woman. His self-centered, self-righteous, rude nature is something that is in all of us. He can never complement and there are many times when we could give a complement but all we really do is insult them. We need to remember that things change and that people have lives of their own. We need to remember that people do need to be encouraged once in a while. The truth is, when we laugh at Jack Nicholson's character, we are really laughing at ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a moving, sad and funny rom com that is actually well written and has great performances. i repeat , GREAT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News) directed this $50 million-plus romantic comedy, set in Manhattan. Dysfunctional, acid- tongued romance novelist Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), who suffers from an obsessive-compulsive disorder, takes pride in his ability to offend. At a nearby cafe, the only waitress willing to stand up to his sarcastic tirades is Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), a single mother struggling to raise her chronically asthmatic son. In Melvin's West Village apartment building, talented contemporary artist Simon Nye (Greg Kinnear) lives across the hall from Melvin. Simon is the current darling of the New York art world, reason enough to draw Melvin's verbal fire, but Simon's gay lifestyle is further grist for the novelist's malicious mill. These three New Yorkers, none of whom appears to have a chance in hell at finding true happiness, discover their fates intertwined because of the fourth complicated character in the piece, Verdell, a tiny Brussels Griffon dog (played by newcomer Jill, after a 15-week training program). Melvin seems to have no friends or family, and he lives alone, working on his 62nd book. When Simon goes into the hospital after a brutal mugging, Melvin has to take care of Verdell, and the dog actually warms Melvin's cold heart -- to the degree that he sets up unsolicited medical care for Carol's son. Eventually, Melvin is cornered into driving Simon and Carol to Baltimore, and during a hotel stopover, Melvin confesses to Carol, "You make me want to be a better man." The trip becomes an odyssey of self-realization for all three.Starring, Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich , Shirley Knight , Yeardley Smith , Lupe Ontiveros , Jesse James , Harold Ramis , Jamie Kennedy , Leslie Stefanson , Wood Harris.Directed by the superb director, James L. Brooks. who directed movies like Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News.Nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture, Original Screenplay, Original score, Film Editing, Actor in a supporting role Greg Kinnear, Actor in a lead role Jack Nicholson and Actress in a lead role Helen Hunt. it won 2 Oscars for both the lead actors.OK this has to be one of the best romantic comedies ever. its not like any other, weird plot, weird situations, unusual love. it has 3 main characters, Melvin is a misanthropic, obsessive-compulsive novelist who has his own sets of weird annoying rules, Carol is a single mother and works at a restaurant where Melvin eats and she only serves him, her son Spencer is suffering from asthma. and Simon is a gay artist with financial problems. i am not gonna go through the story details which u can at the first paragraph.Jack Nicholson won 3 Oscars till now, one for every decade. i haven't seen Cuckoo's nest but this one was so well deserved i mean just a superb performance. and he completely fits in the character. his actions his behavior is so annoying and really cold but that is how he is. u will laugh due to him in some places, at the others you will feel for him, somewhere you just would like to slap him and the others you will blame his condition. like so many shades, he pulled this character quite well which is great. superb and brilliant performance. on the other hand Helen Hunt gave the best performance of her entire career and probably on of the very best female performance to win an Oscar. she is just outstanding and her body language her expressions her crying her anger everything is so purely and lovely done. excellent performance. Greg Kinnear as Melvin's gay neighbor was quite nice but truly i wasn't very impressed by his performance. still he grabs your attention in some scenes where he pulls your heartstrings. overall great performances from a cast of a rom com.James L Brooks' last 2 movies were a disaster, but his first 3 movies as a director were just superb. he made this movie very well and quite appreciable. Screenplay of this movie was the very good thing about it because it was very well written. great story with so much dept in the characters and everything. complicated relationship of these unusual people in unusual situations in love, they try so hard to work it out which leaves us laughing, crying and feeling for them. good character developments with well told story. great editing and good score.this is one of my all time favorite movies. a deeply felt, moving, sad and funny bitter sweet romantic comedy. Must See.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly shallow comedy with very good laugh lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fairly shallow comedy with very good laugh lines, very well played by the actors. The deep problem is that Jack Nicholson's character, Melvin, is seriously sick and hates women, leaving me to wonder why Carol (played by Helen Hunt) falls for him -- and the only clear motivation is selfishness on both parts. She's the only one who tolerates his despicable behavior, and he pays for medical care for her sickly child. It's a funny movie, but it has some serious weakness in my view as to the characters' development. I would contrast Carol's behavior with that of Muriel's (played by Geena Davis) in "The Accidental Tourist." In "As Good as It Gets," Carol's love interest remains his sick, obsessive-compulsive self. In "The Accidental Tourist," Muriel and her son have helped her love interest grow into a relationship with her. I consider "As Good As It Gets" (a more telling title under my view) to be a Hollywood ending where old, powerful producers and directors get their way with young, attractive would-be stars.</fullReview>

The story enables one to see a character that has all of the advantages fail in every department, except having money. It has good drama and great lines, like "You make me want to be a better man". The movie shows several people at their worst and contains some logical plot twists that come out of nowhere, like what happens to the one Character near the end to enable him to go on with his life. The comedy of the movie seems to fail because it is all directed at picking on one character who is politically incorrect, like a Norman Lear television show. I really did not find many Norman Lear shows funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Good as it Gets is a light hearted romantic-comedy, starring two of the finest actors in the leading role, Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. Movie has nothing exceptional yet it is a delight to watch. Helen Hunt plays a single mother working as a waitress in New York, but sick of all that she's going through. And Jack Nicholson plays the character of a cocky OCD novelist, and both play it really well, so well that they won Academy Award for leading role. There was nothing bad about the movie, it starts, runs for 190 minutes and done. It's a simple romantic comedy which comes out almost every year. But As Good as it Gets is a perfect example of 'creating something out of nothing'. Look out for some really witty comments in the movie, by Jack Nicholson and Cuba Gooding Jr. Get your pop corn, and watch this one on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just the right kind of blend of Comedy, Romance and Drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking romantic comedy. It captured the late 90's feeling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was doubtful before watching this film because there was a lot of hype behind it and that's not necessarily a good thing. See, it won several Academy Awards in important categories, then MTV backed it with a small campaign, and finally, everyone talked about it.So, after some years of evading it, I decided to give it a chance and I found it to be one of the best romantic comedies I've seen. And believe me, I've seen a lot.What makes so great about it, is the simple but perfect character driven plot. Then, in order to make it work, you need experienced actors with a powerful on-screen charisma and the necessary histrionic quality to display a dramatic performance mixed with comedy.You got Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. Mr. Nicholson truly demonstrates he got the coolest attitude in the film business in these kind of movies. He's just a delight to watch. He carries on the whole movie with a character that came from Heaven. Helen Hunt plays a perfect equilibrium for him. Both get the movie to a new level in this sub-genre.I can only recommend this movie to anyone who is into quality 90's Hollywood cinema. You won't find that many clichs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious yet moving masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words cannot express how awesome this film is. Every time I see it I cannot help but burst out laughing and burst into tears in equal measure. Everything about it is perfect. The quality of the acting, the subtle yet purposeful direction and warm true to life visuals all help squeeze the most out of what is an incredibly touching script.The film is about how passion for things, and for the people we love help us overcome the problems that we face in our everyday lives. It is also about that when you love someone, you both have to face compromise to get it to work and that because of compromising stuff you thought you had to do you can be a better person because of it.Jack Nicholson definitely deserved his Oscar for his performance as Melvin, a crazy author who has OCD, by managing to make him totally believable. It could have been so easy for him to go all out nuts and overact, taking away the charm and the warmth from his performance that lets us truly feel sorry for and sympathise with his character.All the other cast members were exceptional as well, with the guy who played the gay dude doing especially well. His performance as the man who is the complete opposite of Melvin and wears his emotions on his sleeve is especially important to make sure the film works. Helen Hunt does pretty nifty too and so many scenes in the film make me smile just because of the expressions on her face.The best thing about the film has to be the writing though. The are times in other films when lines of movie dialogue are seen as being exactly movie dialogue, but in As Good As It Gets everything seems real. The words are how a real person would say things, not just silly sound-bites that are charged up with emotional language that fools you into thinking they are deep and meaningful. Everything just feels true and natural, which really helps the movie swallow you whole until you are deep inside its warm, snuggly belly surrounded by the reality it creates and feeling every last trace of emotion.What is also really important to get across is that the film is also absolutely hilarious! There are the immediately amusing one-liners that make you chuckle and smile, but the film also manages to do more than this, setting it miles apart from your average comedy that throws around random words and and "zany" situations. Since you get so involved with the intricacies and quirks of each of the characters, the biggest laughs you will get out of the film are by simple facial expressions or the odd emphasised word that lets you know exactly what the character is thinking.You should really, REALLY watch this film. It is a masterpiece. It only gets better on repeat viewings as well. At the risk of being extremely clich and cheesy, as far as romantic comedies go, it really is As Good As It Gets!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like Jack, this is a must-see.As Good as it gets is pretty campy, and that's what I like about it. I'm usually not one for romantic comedies, but this one stands out in my opinion.Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear have an intense on-screen chemistry. Cuba Gooding Jr. is flawless as usual. The acting, setting, music, cinematography is too good for this genre of movie.The big focus of the movie is on tolerance, acceptance, and sacrifice for greater things. All great themes that are important. That's one thing that a movie has to have to achieve an 8 or higher from me on this site. Importance. Is there some sort of learning experience to be had upon watching this film? For some - yes.I don't want to analyze this too much, I'll just leave it at this: It's quirky, witty, charming, and full of lighthearted fun that I need every once and awhile. I love those big booming heavy-hearted films, but on occasion I'll fall back into something light.This is one of those movies you can watch with just about anyone. It has some swearing and sexual references, which is the only thing that holds it back from being an extraordinary family-film. As much as I am impressed by it's ability to be light and whimsical, there are some dashes of darkness - which feels natural and realistic. It feels less a Hollywood fairytale (as most new romantic comedies are), and more of a modern home-hitter.I fall in love with Greg Kinnear's character more and more every time I see this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if you do as well :) Check it out, even if you're not a fan of romantic comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another sitcom-style comedy for adults from James L. Brooks.Like all of Brooks' films, this one is well acted and written and it's always entertaining, but it's also unchallenging and cinematically uninteresting, and always feels slightly sanitized, even when it's dealing with rough topics.Jack Nicholson plays yet another version of crazy in the kind of role that his later career has been full of. Helen Hunt was hot at the moment because of "Mad About You," and while it's inconceivable all these years later that she actually won an Oscar for this film, her experience in sitcom acting suits Brooks and his material well (though there's quite an ick factor in seeing her paired with someone so much older and lecherous). Greg Kinnear rounds out the principal cast as a gay artist, while Shirley Knight and Cuba Gooding Jr. appear in smaller roles.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melvin Udall is one of my favorite characters of all time. One of Jack Nicholson's best performances. One of the best comedies ever. Him with Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear made such a great trio performance. Melvin is an obsessive-compulsive, insensitive writer, Carroll the waitress; the frazzled mother of a son with an illness, and Simon; a gay artist with daddy issues. After Simon is robbed Melvin is forced to help him out and drags Carroll along into the fun. One reason this movie is great is the acting obviously; all of them are great. My reason is I love listening to Melvin's crazy philippics on everybody from the restaurant to the police. Even the dog is a wonderfully entertaining character in this movie. If you like Jack Nicholson (or any of these actors) or good comedy/drama watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting variation on Dicken's 'A Christmas Carol'. Nicholson, although playing an abrasive obsessive-compulsive is clearly channeling Scrooge, who ultimately has his world view changed for the better. Helen Hunt is good as the waitress who regularly serves him, while Greg Kinear plays a sympathetic gay neighbor. The film starts off with Nicholson mouthing obscenities at everyone. There's plenty of (somewhat nasty) humor as we watch Jack playing a grumpier version of himself. Gradually however, the film mellows into a gentle romance. Both Nicholson and Hunt won Oscars for their performances, which while good, certainly aren't award caliber.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

I love it because, my father suffers from manic depression, and I grew up in a house of domestic violence. I can associate the character of Melvin Udall with my father; because that is exactly how he was, poor at understanding what people felt, failing to reciprocate to what people wanted, throwing insults at innocent people, yelling and beating my mother. When I watch this movie, I feel my father is not the only one, there are lot of people, who live their lives in this manner. I have lived away from him for the last 4 yrs, and I have always hated him in the past. But after watching this movie, I forgive him for whatever he made me go through in my childhood.

A story so pure and great comes once every few decades. The story of a man who hates everyone and everything coming to grips with reality and becomes very nice and starts to see himself becoming part of the human race. The movie was so well acted it is like you can see the change in Melvin like it's for real. Helen Hunt was also great in this picture and so beautiful as well and her and Nicholson had this great chemistry that is quite rare these days in these type of films. Well acted, written and directed. It is James L. Brooks best film and Jack Nicholson at his best as well.

He was hilarious, his charactere was developed quite nicely from scene 1 itself. He very much carries his usual style but this time it was given different flavors. He looked relax compared to what he usually does. In short it was unbelievable that this guy can also work in a romantic comedy. Well talking of romance this movie had its own way of putting out. The lovey-dovey dialogues between Nicholson and Hunt were long but at the end they did leave a sweet taste on tongue and make you say yes these are "GETTERS". The chemistry between both is great too and performance wise also it looks as if they both are pulling each other's level up. Hence the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, from what I've seen so far, has never given a bad performance in his life. This is no exception to that claim. Even more, As Good As It Gets is a slight departure from his trademark screen persona, a snakily charming, confident, and dry man with a penchant for almost comically devilish eyebrow movements and sharky grins. Instead, here he is an older man with insecurities so overwhelming that he desperately hides it all underneath a wry and crude meanness that he jabs at nearly everyone he meets, harming them first before they can do what he fears out of a corrosive neuroses, which is that they'll harm his fragile ego first. He only begins to realize how much he yearns to be liked after so many unfortunate things happen to his neighbor, inadvertently causing so many fortunate things to happen to him, giving him a taste of how good life gets before things once again even out, making him want to become a better man.Helen Hunt's tremendously human performance stands out almost as far as Nicholson's, a feat that has since the 1970s been quite difficult to accomplish. To equal Nicholson's naturally upstaging presence is quite impressive. She seems almost as if she was born to play the waitress whose ill son is constantly on her mind but always keeps that winning smile on her face. She is very funny and deeply felt, imperfect and in such a realistic way.The film's breakthrough comes from Greg Kinnear, whose charm affects the sensitive role he plays, a homosexual painter, constantly under the heterosexual gun, often held by the nasty shell of the Nicholson character, and unfairly given the inarguably shortest end of the straw, yet always patient and accepting enough, until he reaches a point. Kinnear has an airy promptness and propensity for physical drama that make him a perfect counterpart for the other two stars.Something I find infinitely appealing about As Good As It Gets is its focus on the dog as a character. The dog is billed (as three different dogs) in the credits, and is developed as a character, as an interesting friendship grows between him and the Nicholson character, and grows into an adapter for the relationship between Nicholson and Kinnear.As Good As It Gets is one of the most well-written films I've seen recently. In it is hilarious humor, heartfelt character drama, and a chain of seemingly unrelated events with three different people rippling towards each other. Its extensive running time is due to its passionate development and concentration on these three very different people and their colliding lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is movie a *great* portrayal of OCD. I find it funny how many people who hated it called Jack Nicholson's character annoying. Then you've never dealt with someone with OCD. It does affect their personality it isn't just doing things over and over. And to see how Helen Hunt could overcome his shortcomings and see the true man behind the disease is awesome. If only people would watch this movie and then take the time to understand OCD. Its not something easy to deal with both for the person afflicted with it and their family and friends. Its great to see that Helen Hunt could overcome it and try to see the true man behind the disease!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this wonderful picture for probably the 6th time. Being a big Jack Nicholson fan, I am never disappointed by the fantastic job he does in this film. He sways between being a complete ass that you just want to punch in the face, to the most warm and loving poet the world has ever known. Greg Kinnear does a great job in his performance as well. The real standout performance is by Helen Hunt in my opinion. Some of the expressions she makes just touch my heart like no other woman ever has. I think the only portrayal I have ever seen that warms my heart as much is Donna Reed in "It's a wonderful life". When Jack drops the "You make me wanna be a better man" comment on Helen at the restaurant I bust out crying like a little girl with a skinned knee, and i'm not even gay. Helen's portrayal in this movie makes me fall in love with her every single time I see it. Don't miss this Oscar worthy picture. Films like this are a rare commodity in Hollywood these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since watching the best scary movie of all time (the shinning) and Jack gives the line here's Johnny I am and always will be a jack fan no matter what!!!.. I grew up in Troy NY where the movie Iron Weed was being filmed and a scene was right in front of my apartment I grew up in and I met the great Jack. Me and a good friend of mine got a chance to visit him in his trailer which was propped up in my alley way there I was having a beer with Jack and my friend he is such a great guy and believe me he is as weird in real life as he is in the movies. Anyway at that time, as we where having a cocktail with Jack I metioned to him it would be hilarious seeing you in a comedy movie because at that time he was only playing weird roles and scary roles. Jack kinda gave that look and the riddler grin and said maybe I will that sounds like plan... I know he did not do a comedy do to my saying so but as I predicted he came through and now seems he likes doing them. His one liners in as good as it gets is priceless. This movie was also has a great supporting cast Hunt is sooo charming and Kiner has that dry sense of humor that click's so well in this movie. If you have not seen this movie for what reason I do not know you have to see it. I know for a fact that when I am about 70 years old and I am watching this movie on my space age surroundsound I will always remember Jacks one liner that he said to me personally SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN SHAWN LUV YA JACK!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'As Good As It Gets' excelled in every possible way. The plot doesn't drive the characters, on the contrary, the characters drive the plot. Every thing that happens in the movie is because of the characters, and only the characters. Jack Nicholson is outstanding in his most perplexing role he has had to play up to date(a well deserved Oscar). Even tough his character is uncouth and eerie, his performance and vive he gives to his character makes him very likable. Helen Hunt, as well, is a delight to see in her Oscar winning performance. When she could have been annoying, sentimental, and rude, she was lovely and genuine. Hands up to Greg Kinnear! His performance made you like, care, and feel for his character, Simon. He doesn't overdo the emotions and reactions coming from a gay artist, but stays on the line. Finally, I'm not surprised at James L. Brooks' work. He is constant in his work and zesty films. I like that all his movies are always very real and white. 'As Good As It Gets' is one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

Love is a give and take thing, and you're never sure of where it'll happen just have to be open and willing to express yourself truly. I liked where they went out for rolls and he expressed himself. I'm a bit confused myself if "This is as good as it gets" maybe I had it already? I was with a wonderful woman just didn't see it at the time, we do have two wonderful children.

		<shortDescription>Not your usual "romantic comedy", but there are some "screwballs" loose here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this is really a romantic comedy, as some say, it surely isn't one the directors of that genre in the 1930's would recognise. It is a comedy of a sort. Checkov would likely think so, but don't expect to roll around on the floor trying to stifle guffaws. Perhaps a grin now and then may be in order. Almost every character, the mother of "Carol" is one exception, leads a life of desperation, but not "quietly". Even the dog looks rather desperate, and he isn't quiet either. "In the dark night of the soul" it really is three o'clock in the morning for these people most of the time. I can't recall chuckling even once, but still I was wryly amused. Probably this was a case of "enjoying" the other guy's misery. No doubt a human trait. The "thank the gods, I'm not like that" syndrome, eh? It may sound like I didn't like this movie, but that is not the case at all. The entire cast is fully up to the task of putting the story across, but I derived the most enjoyment from the broad spectrum of women characters, beginning with Helen Hunt, of course, but going down to the briefest of walk-on bit player glimpses. Where did the director find them all? My only cavil is that it seemed the editor was doing his best to sabotage the project. Maybe he was just being modern. Whatever, I owe the film a debt of gratitude for introducing me to Helen Hunt. She really brings "Carol" to life as a real person whom it would be an interesting experience to meet. With any luck, without the asthmatic son. You don't want too many complications, do you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is as good as it gets! It lost to the bloated Titanic at the Oscar ceremonies, but Helen Hunt and jack Nicholson deservedly won Oscars for their performances. The two leads generate a lot of chemistry; both give naturalistic performances.jack Nicolson plays Melvyn Udall, a man with OCD, and Helen Hunt,Carol Connelly, the waitress who encounters Melvyn, first as abrasive and humorless, second as obsessive, unempathic and egocentric, third as a love interest. Add in a sparkling Greg Kinnear as a gay neighbor whose relationship with Melvyn changes through the film.The movie hasn't dated since I saw it on main circuit, nearly 10 years ago. It manages to avoid a lot of sentimentality (wich typifies Terms of Endearment, James Brooks' "other" famous movie, for which Jack Nicholson won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar! Cuba Gooding Jr. gives excellent support to Greg Kinnear's turn as Simon Bishop.The script is witty, the dialog pert... in short, this film sparkles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as romantic comedies usually get? No, better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has forgotten how to do rom-coms properly nowadays. With a few exceptions (e.g. Hitch), they're all so predictable and awfully repetitive. Lucky for us, As Good as It Gets is not one of those films. It's smart, it's original and it's also very, very funny.The movie begins with the now legendary sequence where misanthropic writer Melvin Udall (a priceless Jack Nicholson) dumps his neighbor's dog, Verdell, down the garbage chute, telling the poor creature "This is New York, pal. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere!". This hilarious opening scene perfectly serves its purpose: to make it undeniably clear that Melvin is one of the most unpleasant individuals in the world. Apart from the dog thing, he spends his days avoiding people or insulting them. Not the kind of behavior you'd expect from a guy who writes romance novels, huh? Anyway, things change once Verdell's owner, gay artist Simon (Greg Kinnear) ends up at the hospital. From there on, it's up to Melvin to make sure the dog's fine, and on top of that, our antihero starts developing feelings for Carol (Helen Hunt), a single mom who works in the coffee shop he has breakfast at every morning. These unexpected feelings, which he has only known about through his literary works so far, are going to transform his life forever...As Good as It Gets has a concept which reminds of When Harry Met Sally: put two people, who would never go out together under the normal circumstances, in the same room (not literally, though) and see what happens. In this case, however, the story is made more interesting by the fact that its male protagonist is supposed to be beyond redemption. And Jack Nicholson does a wonderful job in making that man's craziness believable, but then again it's the kind of role he can handle with his eyes shut, isn't it? Hunt is also amazing, giving a career-best performance which was justly praised with a Best Actress Oscar, while Jack won his third "golden baldy" thanks to James L. Brooks'(yes, it's the director of Terms Of Endearment and executive producer of The Simpsons) charming film.So, is this movie as good as it gets? Considering the direction romantic comedy has taken in the past few years, I'd say it's better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had to see this movie a few times to really get what it's about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Brooks' humor and narrative is never simple.This movie is about the male vs. female psyche. It's not just a story about an obsessive compulsive guy with a gay, destitute neighbor who falls in love with a NY waitress.It's about the battle men have with themselves as their organized, logical minds are forced to function in a world of feelings and human female interaction. I can't help but think of the episode of Star Trek where Kirk is separated into a "Nice" Kirk and an "Evil" Kirk.Men are for the most part- logical, straightforward, goal oriented beings. The Jack Nicholson character represents the male mind in it's most raw and blunt form. It's this very same form that is forced to re-mold itself as something less straightforward in order to obtain what its ultimate goal is... namely, the love of a good woman.To me, the title "As Good As it Gets" refers to the idea that compromises need to be made from our default manner of thinking if we're ever going to find the love we so desperately seem to need. There's no such thing as a perfect relationship... it takes work and sacrifice. It's as good as it gets- yet absolutely worth going after.As for the production characteristics- the movie is a gem. Helen Hunt &amp; Jack Nicholson are sublime in the way they make their characters rich and real to an unprecedented extent in movie history. There's a scene between the two at dinner where Nicholson compliments Hunt at her request that is pure gold. The writing, performances and directing throughout the film is of the highest caliber to be found anywhere.I wasn't a big fan when I saw it years ago. Now I realize why there was a big deal made of it at the time. You need to read between the lines in this one- to see how beautiful of a walk through humankind it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you missed the Oscars in 1998, then you probably don't know that this film won several awards, including; best actor and best actress. And although the film itself didn't walk away with an Oscar, it should have in my opinion. Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson star in this unusual film about life, that's more true to it, than one might think.What is this film about? That's an answer that the viewer of the film would have to make on their own. Some people might call it a love story, while others may refer to it as a human piece. Meaning, it's basis is human thought, feeling and being. It's interesting, sad, funny and beautiful all wrapped into one star-packed motion-picture.Greg Kinnear is probably the best in the film, and I was so upset that even though he was nominated for best supporting actor in this, that he didn't win. He was so good, and very believable in his role. Jack Nicholson is good, but he plays himself. This is the last film that I actually enjoyed seeing Helen Hunt star in, and would say that it might even be her best performance to date, leaving aside 'Castaway', which was by far and away her best role ever, although that wasn't a lead role, this was.James L. Brooks, does a terrific job communicating the struggle between all of the characters, but frankly it was the kind of movie, that any good director could have done, and would have been able to achieve, in my opinion, the outcome that Brooks did.But, for the kind of drama that the film is, it is very good. I recommend it to anyone over twelve, and although I say such a young age, it's still a movie that adults will certainly relate to. It's a movie you should own, and certainly a watch or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AS GOOD AS IT GETS, to me, is a very funny, moving, romantic, and touching movie. It really moved me at times. I thought Jack (Nicholson), Helen (Hunt), and Greg (Kinnear) all gave dazzling performances as an obsessive-compulsive writer, single waitress, and gay artist. One of my favorite quotes of this film is, "Do you understand me, you crazy f***?" Also, I thought that Carol (Helen Hunt) and Melvin (Jack Nicholson) looked good in the attire they wore when they went out to dinner in Baltimore. In addition, when Simon (Greg Kinnear) yelled at Melvin when he came to his apartment, that really made me smile and feel good. If you ask me, AS GOOD AS IT GETS is one of Jack Nicholson's finest movies. In conclusion, to anyone who's a fan of Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, or Greg Kinnear, if you haven't seen AS GOOD AS IT GETS, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have now watched the film 3 times but not yet at the cinema. It seems to me to be better, more subtle and more thought provoking each time I watch it. Jack Nicholson, playing the neurotic Melvin Udall, is worth every plaudit the great actor has received. The first part of the film establishes him has a most unlikable character, so much so that when he starts to do kindnesses one feels disorientated. Helen Hunt as Carol the waitress in Melvin's favourite restaurant is an admirable foil to Melvin's battyness; calm, sensible, yet beset by worry about her son's illness. She establishes her part in the film with assured, entirely believable acting. Melvin takes on the unlikely role of pet sitter to gay artist neighbour (Greg Kinnear) Simon's dog (which we already know he hates). This unlikely happening is accomplished by excellent acting by all concerned not least Simon's unscrupulous male model . Carol (the only waitress that Melvin trusts) has to take time off because her son is ill. Melvin uses the considerable financial clout he wields as a successful author to employ a doctor (admirably played by Lawrence Kasden)to treat the boy. Carol, though grateful, suspects that Melvin's motives are less than pure. We, the audience, believe that Melvin only wanted to be fed but maybe Carol puts ideas into his head ...Meanwhile the counter plot of Simon having fallen on hard times leads to a visit of the trio to Baltimore and a chance for relationships to develop not always comfortably. Watch this splendid movie with a loved one but without interruption. With luck you will be moved to be kinder to all the human oddities who cross your path.</fullReview>

He has too eat food with plastic ware, sit on the same spot for breakfast, avoid walking on cracks from cement, and has to do everything five times(Wash hands, lock the door, five m&amp;m jars, sets of paper and more). After his neighbor, Simon(greg kinnear) gets his ass kicked by a couple of guys, he must take care of his dog, verdall. All of a sudden, Melvin is rejoiced and happy again, seeing that somebody actually cared for him. Another person is Melvin's life is Carol, a waitress(played by Helen Hunt); the thing with her is that she feels like a prisoner because her son has been sick since the day he was born. She is on to him every 24-7 without even catching a break. The only person who wants her to be free is her mother(shelly winters in her breakout role ever). One day after recovering from an accident, Simon has to go to Boston in order to get money from his parents to pay the medical bills. That is when the three main characters(simon, melvin and carol) get together on an odyssey that not only get to talk, but also feel more spirited and alive. This is by far the best film that I've seen Jack Nicholson in since Batman and A few good men. I rank this film # 16 on my top 20 list of best movies.4 Star Rating.Go see this movie.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson's performance as a psychiatric patient was very convincing.

Jack is fabulous as mean spirited author Melvin, providing us with drama and laugh out loud moments. He puts so much effort into his role and in returned we are left saying "wow". Helen Hunt is dramaticly perfect in her role, applying even amounts of drama and gags for our enjoyment. Greg Kinear and Cuba Gooding Jr. turned in well done suporting roles as well. THIS is the definate meaning of what a comedy-drama should look like. Everyone turning in convincing roles, heart stopping moments usually followed up by laugh out loud gags make As Good As It Gets a winner. 9.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best character-driven dramady in years . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS "AS GOOD AS IT GETS" is the best character-driven dramady in years. In this film, we see not only one, but three 3-dimensional characters, brilliantly played out by Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear.Most viewers agree the actors are brilliant in this movie, but some seem to be doubtful about James L. Brooks' direction and screenplay, which is funny since the actors' performances are linked with the director's direction in substantial degree. Nicholson and Hunt thanked Brooks' direction in their Oscar Award speeches.As to the screenplay, there seem to have a few viewers who didn't get Helen Hunt's character (Carol) -- how she could possibly love Nicholson's obnoxious character (Melvin), and why she changes her mind so often. It's unfortunate those viewers neglect some setups and subplots in the film that clearly explain them -- In the beginning, Carol is only nice to Melvin as she treats everybody so. She is, however, trying to find a man to help support her family; this is shown in the scene where her date leaves her after her ill son's vomit spoils his mood -- as he leaves, he says to her: "I'm sorry, but that's too much reality for a Friday night." At a time when Carol is most stressed out by her son's illness, Melvin is the only one who offers help, out of a simple need -- he just needs Carol back to the restaurant to wait on him, since he and all other waitresses don't get along. Melvin's help, however, means world to Carol, although at first she still tells Melvin that if he's trying to sleep with her (by helping her son), he can just forget about it. Knowing Melvin has special feeling for her, Carol has a big inner conflict, as shown in the scene in which she tries to write a "thank you" note for him, and fusses over the word CONSCIENCE as CON - SCIENCE. -- Subconsciously, she feels that she may be exploiting him (treating him better in return for his help). On the flip side, Melvin may be exploiting her (helping her son in order to get closer to her).Throughout the film, Carol has been irritated or angered by Melvin's obnoxious foul mouth several times, but every time she returns home, she would change her mind and gives Melvin another chance. Some people didn't get this, but it's quite simple and logical -- every time she returns home and sees her son, she thinks of Melvin as THE person who offers help in time of needs. To her, there is that positive traits in Melvin that she can appreciate.As to Melvin's character, he lives in his own very stiff world, and would only deal with the few people he likes (in this film, that's only Carol). His foul mouth is his way to shut out the people he doesn't want to spend time with -- and that's almost everybody, since he feels safe living only in his own world, and paranoid on things and people outside of his apartment. This is shown in his compulsive behaviors of washing hands excessively and locking the door repetitively. However, once he spends time with others ( forced or otherwise), he CAN learn to get along with and appreciate them. In this film, it's the dog and Simon. Again, he is not a bad person, just a man who wants to be left alone. His foul mouth is his defense mechanism, which roots so deep that he can't even control it around the only person he likes.In short, this is one of the most brilliant scripts with intriguing characters and a brilliant story. "AS GOOD AS IT GETS" is the best character-driven dramatic comedy in years. . . 9 out of 10 . . </fullReview>

The fear to change is probably the single largest mistake most of us make, and in due course, we miss the greatest thing about being alive. Melvin (Jack nicholson), realises so late in his life that he hasnt actually lived. If y'all haven't seen this one, hit the nearest video rental ASAP</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1997, "As Good As It Gets" manages to live up to its hype. The comic timing is impeccable, perfectly balancing drama and light comedy. The script is well devised and the stars couldn't be any more suited to their roles. The two (or three) leads shine here. Jack Nicholson makes a career breakthrough as a neurotic, grumpy, obsessive compulsive and cynical old man. He proves that he can excel equally at drama and at comedy. Helen Hunt also makes a career breakthrough and goes past the smiley sitcom character in "Mad About You". She is very convincing as the single mother cum waitress and rightfully beat Kate Winslet for the Oscar. While the limelight is aimed more at Nicholson and Hunt, Greg Kinnear does very well as a gay artist. Cuba Gooding Jnr. isn't really giving it his all but does OK anyway and makes good support. The brilliant script, the comic timing, the undeniable charm, the great performances and the overall enjoyablity add up to make "As Good As It Gets" a charming, cute and instantly likeable light comedy. It's a shame that the Academy Awards don't pay much attention to other comedies like this. I give it 7.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Acted, Depressing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting here is textbook by all three leads. Jack inhabits his role as an unbalanced loner, and Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear provide believable, understated support. I left the theater with one more expression in my vocabulary, which is the notion that maybe, this is "As Good As It Gets." This is a depressing thought, unfortunately, and that is the point of this film. The Hollywood-style redemption we all hope for and expect was only partially, conditionally delivered by this film. This film is a fine counterpoint to the pablum Hollywood typically serves up. Be sure to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is extremely lovable for many reasons. For one it doesnt rely on a big budget and million dollar special effects. Just great actors and great film makers. The cast is awesome. Especially the three main characters. The manage to be funny and believable at the same time and they do with such elegance. Especially good ole Jack Nicholson. The story isn't really complicated. I'm not even really sure theres an "official" story but in it Nicholson is a mean hearted scrooge type romance novelists who lives by himself in a apartment building. Greg Kinnear is Jack's gay neighbor who's an artist. Helen Hunt is a waitress at Nicholson's favorite restaraunt where hes always causing trouble. She also has a very sick son whos hospital bills she can't affored to pay. Sometimes in this movie you almost melt at how could it is. If you ever decide to see this movie I can guarantee you if your a human being with half a brain you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. I liked it a lot. I liked Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. They are both great at acting, but as a couple, I really don't think they go together good. But then there is Greg Kinnear, who does a decent job as the gay guy in the movie. I felt they all did a good job, but this movie was probably not worthy of the best actor/actress Awards.The supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight, Skeet Ulrich, and Jamie Kennedy. The movie is cute and amusing, as the humor is basic but bitingly sarcastic. There were some really original ideas that make this movie one for everyone to see. It is almost impossible not to laugh, but I really don't think I could say that, because there are some people who will find this not funny. See this if you're a fan of romantic comedies or dramas. This one is definetly worth a look. AS GOOD AS IT GETS gets 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson's Greatest Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films that poke fun at Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and/or other disorders and disabilities usually offend me but this 1997 Tristar Pictures release tends to make the viewer laugh with but never at Jack Nicholson's endearing performance as Melvin Udall, a man who suffers from OCD and has a bad attitude because of it taking his annoyances out on everybody and everything that crosses his path. He eats at the same restaurant every day (even insisting to always eat at the same table and bring his own utensils) and always insists to be served by the same waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt). Everybody in the restaurant and throughout much of the city can't stand him but Carol learns to get used to Melvin's sometimes snooty ways. It's by her surprising levels of tolerance for him as well as his having to temporarily watch his neighbor's (Greg Kinnear) dog that begin to inspire Melvin to consider taking a new lease on life and letting every major person in his life join in. Great performances all around. The two leads won Academy Awards (Nicholson for Best Actor and Hunt for Best Actress) for their performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Good As It Gets is a perfect work of art mainly produced by James L. Brooks. I believe that Jack Nicholson won his Oscar for this film by a long shot. This has had great debate of wether or not One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest was Nicholson's better film, but in my opinion As Good As It Gets is his best. Nicholson's blend of insults and sarcasm was brilliantly executed. I think the story of As Good As It Gets is absolutely fascinating! Everyone knew that Helen Hunt was going to win herself an Oscar and what better film could she have won it for, but As Good As It Gets. Hunt was wonderful as a single mom fighting to survive in New York with her sick little child. However, my favorite character of the movie is "Simon the fag" played by Greg Kinnear. I highly agree by far with Mr. Kinnear being awarded an Academy Award for his performance. Greg Kinnear was the person that made you want to cry in this film (because of his good acting). To wrap up the main cast, Cuba Gooding Jr, was casted as Simon's friend and supporter. Gooding Jr, was fabulous annoying Nicholson's character "Melvin" whenever the two characters collided. The bottom line is- As Good As It Gets was one of the many films the "Academy" agreed with winning the most important awards, which it certainly deserved. I would suggest that you rent this film if you want to laugh or feel good. As Good As It Gets is a great film of its time!</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson plays a person who suffers from a obsessive compulsive disorder to a tee. Its hilarious the way that him and Simon the fag, as he likes to call him, constantly bicker. Helen Hunt also did a great job playing the mother of an extremely sick young boy who is looking for a normal boyfriend who wont run out on her. This is a great movie to add to any movie library no matter what your tastes are. I keep it next to my "Silence of the Lambs" anthology and my original version of "The Mummy" with none other then Borris Karloff.

I saw it a third time and thought: 'Wow, that Helen Hunt sure is amazing'. The fourth time I was in awe of Cuba Gooding Jr. Last time I saw it (must've been the 41st time), I wasn't thinking anymore, I was being part of the movie.I can't explain the charm and wit of this movie, but it's a movie you can't ignore with a good conscience. (Is that con-science?).Melvin is an interesting character with interesting flaws, he's interested in Carol the waitress and mostly uninterested in everything else. He has his own interesting views on absolutely everything, and he's easy to dislike - at first. But then you succumb and you fall in love with Melvin Udall, the writer of fiction for women (with no sense or accountability).This movie goes from A to Z. It opens and it ends. No overdoing here, just simple movie-magic.*****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well decide on 'As Good As It Gets', wonderful journey of an Obsessive Compulsive novelist (aren't they all?) a restaurant waitress and an artisan neighbor. The film has beautiful character development right from the start, few subtleties encountered along its story line. It takes place in New York and creeps its way through the psyche of the 3 main characters. Scored with appropriate music to keep pace with the film, its full of laughs and cry's and intellectual action if that is what you sometimes prefer. I first saw this movie on the plane, piped through the intercom unedited. It does have some cursing and bias, so perhaps not a family film. Supporting cast members do a brilliant job. The DVD includes commentary with James L Brooks, and the 3 main characters, a great addition to an Academy awarded film (1997). 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I even considered watching this film for the first time, I was instantly biased because of the enormity of the casts talent; there's the monumentally charismatic Jack Nicholson (who would run out of fingers to count his Oscar nominations), Helen Hunt (who has a substantial collection of Golden Globes and Grammys), Cuba Gooding Jr. (who is the finest Actor of his generation) and Greg Kinnear (who's perfectly cast amongst the latter Hollywood greats).'AS GOOD AS IT GETS' focuses on Nicholson's character Melvin, telling the story of how he copes with having an obsessive compulsive disorder, which is evidently destructive on the lives of those who surround him. Exhausting ritualistic patterns such as washing his hands in boiling water, forbidding anyone to physically touch him, are among just a few of his alienating habits. Aside from apparent intimacy issues, he is also a confrontational homophobic--suffice it to say that he doesn't appreciate living next door to Simon (played by Greg Kinnear) who is a gay artist. Upon following events, Melvin aspires to win the affections of Carol (played by Helen Hunt) who is a compassionate yet lonely waitress. Hesitantly she opens up her heart to him and discovers that beyond his appalling behaviour, is a man who is capable of demonstrating huge acts of kindness, who has sincere feelings for her. Despite having an emotional undercurrent the film should definitely be stamped as being in the comedy genre; there are many instances of noteably hilarious material, in this positively shining script, especially in the classic scene, where Simon confronts Melvin, about throwing his beloved dog down a garbage shoot. Expect to be surprised by this film; the rareity of the magnificent script, combining with the multitude of talent in the cast, makes it magnetically engaging from start to finish.Even though I'm in great danger of becoming repetitive, I have to give some more adulation to the cast. Jack Nicholson gave us his finest performance, unsurpassed in the attention he gave to the complexity of Melvins' character. Helen Hunt is THE finest actress on our screens today. In giving everything her soul had to offer, the audience was able to see the sincerity of the pain Carol was experiencing. Whilst Helen gives you heartfelt raw emotion, she has an amazing aptitude to channel her talents for comedy too. Some of her scenes really did affect me emotionally, willing me to literally get hold of her and give her a great big hug--proving the impact she governs upon you.If you want to see one of the most superbly acted films of the decade, then look no further 'As Good As It Gets' is, AS GOOD AS IT GETS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bitter sweet romantic comidy which really portrays the gritty reality of true love relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a society which is gradually becoming more and more entrenched in PC (political correctness) here we have a drama which really goes against all the unspoken rules and codes of the typical romance movie as it puts a bunch of misfits together and shows us how being human is not all that bad. Well to begin with Nickilson's character as a reclusive neurotic hypochondriac (who just so happens to be a budding romance novelist if you can work that one out) and manages to offend every single person he meets. And what a supporting line up. A gay artist neighbor (who manages not to fulfill all the stereotypes) and a beautiful waitress who serves him lunch everyday but has no real social life outside of work due to the condition of her terminally ill son. What really makes this movie so enjoyable is Nicklsons scene stealing performance as a guy who seems to have a problem with everyone. One of the best lines in the film is in a conversation with his neighbor where he is seeking advice as he has finally realized the pain of love, his response to the advice is "I thought you guise where suppose to be sensitive, is this the best you can do". Nicklsons brash character has the worming quality that it breaks down the ridicules barriers that people build up around themselves and we always know what he says is what he means. The crux of this film is that you will never find the perfect partner but maybe this is as good as it gets to find someone you can be with despite all their short comings.</fullReview>

The story centers around three very different and unique individuals played by Jack Nicholson, in an Oscar winning role, Helen Hunt, also an Oscar winner and Greg Kinnear. Director James L. Brooks allows his actors to explore the quirkiness inside and what comes out in the process is pure magic. The chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt is divine and Kinnear gives grace and desperation to what could've been just another Hollywood stereotype of a gay male.

		<fullReview>AS GOOD AS IT GETSSTARRING: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr.There are THREE things i look for in a film in order to be good. 1. Entertainment Value, 2. Memorable Characters, and 3. A Good Story. "As good as it gets," has it all.The Characters are a main part in the film, because they are legendary. Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, a man with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (what i have), and he isn't the type of person you'd want to wake up with by your side. Simon (Greg Kinnear), the gay neighbor, is the type of person you would want to be friends with, or a person I would want to be with (Because i am a girl). Then there is Helen Hunt, who plays Carol the waitress, and Mr. Udall happens to be in love with her, but she has more things on her mind (like her sick son). Everything works out fine in the end, though.The story itself is one of the main reasons why this movie succeeded. Also, great performances by ALL cast members, especially Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. I think this film has a little bit Comedy, and little bit Romance, with a slight touch of Drama, and one hell of a cast to make this film complete.AS GOOD AS IT GETS has everything, and that is why it was one of the best film of the 90s, and was even better than TitanicMy Rating: ***** stars out of *****</fullReview>

We are immediately introduced to a crumudgen named Melvin played by Jack Nicholson.Melvin in short is a SOB. He is rude, racist, paranoid, homophobic, and just a horrible person. Our first introduction to him we wittness him taking his gay neighbour's dog running around and chucking it down the garbage chute.When Simon finds out (played by Greg Kineear) he decides to take a stand but is so intimidated by Melvin's antics that even when he tries to confront him he just breaks down. This also leads to a diatribe Melvin says to Simon that is so brutal that you can't help but feel bad but laugh at hystericaly.This is pretty much the pace of the film. All the characters have their shining moment. Melvin has several, Simon has many, and even Simon's lover played by Cuba Gooding Jr. has a great confrontation scene with Melvin telling him to lay off Simon.There is a reason for Melvin's antics, which isn't explained until about 1/2 way through the film, and that is he has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). In short this is a bit of a flaw cause it makes the viewer not sympathize with Melvin right away. Instead many people witnessing his antics may just end up hating him so much cause his behaviour is without reason, (walking in to the same restaurant every day, at the exact time, demanding to be served by the same waitress [Helen Hunt], bringing his own plastic cutlery, while bad mouthing everyone else in the place is a good example). When he finally gets kicked out by the owner all the patrons stand up and cheer. To some degree that may be the reaction some people watching this film may have by walking out of this film before its even 1/4 through. It's a testament to Jack's performance for creating someone who is truly an absolute unbearable person to witness. Melvin seems VERY real..But in short all these characters come together in the end out of bizarre circumstances and life changes for the better. It's an enjoyable film, with some great performances particularly for Jack's best actor performance, and Kineear's wounded likes of Simon.The film also has a very well trained memorable dog that is amazing in its personality. This dog even has better acting chops than most actors in films I have seen! The film does try to create a romance between Melvin and the waitress which is OK but gets a bit overlong (the restaurant scene is a bit lengthy), but still highly recommendedGreat feel good film.Rating 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful! The best Hollywood picture of last years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film greatly. It is extraordinary clever and witty with original, incredibly amusing dialogues. I didn't want any action in the movie: it was enough just to look at the characters and to listen to their speaking. Besides, it's very moving: background is highly dramatic, though on the surface you find the funniest comedy. The real life is like that, you know ? a short way from tragedy to the farce. The plot twists unexpectedly but so naturally that I never doubted the possibility of such events. Actors' works are outstanding. Jack Nicholson is the unique actor, he gives an unforgettable performer as Melvin Udall. Helen Hunt is excellent: expressive, spirited, and stylish. You feel every emotion of Carol and sympathize with her. Greg Kinnear showed all his abilities in the part of Simon ? the most convincing and likable gay character I've ever seen. I also admire Shirley Knight as Carol's mother ? perfect! My favourite moment is that at the end of the movie where she listens behind the door and suddenly pops out to explain that `normal boyfriends' don't exist. It was great ? so funny and so true! According to the story there is no such thing as `normal people' in the world, we are all crazy. So never mind being crazy ? life is just as good as it gets! Both of lead actors deserved their Oscars, however two awards are too little for such film. At least, screenwriter and director must have had Oscars. And why there is no special award for `the best animal in the film'? Verdel is an irresistibly attractive creature, and so talented! The film entertains you and touches your heart deeply, makes you smile, laugh and cry, but never depress or bore. 10/10 in every sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the Best Comedy Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great film. The combination of comedy and drama was very enjoyable. I think that this is my 3rd favorite Jack Nicholson movie, the first two being .....Cuckoo's Nest and The Shining. Helen Hunt always plays a good part but she was outstanding in 'As Good As It Gets', this is my favorite movie of hers. Also, Greg Kinnear is very strong support to Nicholson and Hunt, this is most certainly Kinnear's best movie.This is probably the best comedy/drama ever made, right alongside The Sting. The comedy is very funny, yet the drama stays strong also, most comedy/dramas either not enough comedy or not enough drama. James L. Brooks did a great job in his direction (a big step from The Critic).Cuba Gooding Jr. is also another reason to watch this movie. He is very convincing as Kinnear's good friend. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for their performances, which were well deserved. Jack Nicholson also proves that he is still as good an actor now as he was 30 years ago. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say enough about this movie, which is one of the best from the 90's. Jack Nicholson is absolutely hilarious as the cranky obsessive-compulsive Melvin. Helen Hunt proves that she can be a fantastic movie actress, as well as a TV star. Cuba Gooding Jr. is fantastic as usual. And can anyone honestly say that they didn't adore that dog?? "As Good As It Gets" is a sophisticated comedy-drama that will win over everyone. It's truly one of my favorite movies, and I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>among the best 3 movies of 1997, along with good will hunting &amp; l.a.confidential. this movie has 3 top artistes giving off their best. the story is simple, and yet so complex. the characters are out-of-the-world and yet so real. as good as it gets revels in this paradox.touching at the raw chords, a story of a man who cannot (or rather does not want to) reveal his emotions. helen hunt plays the woman that turns him around, the one person who makes him "want to be a better man". greg kinear plays a brilliant role as the gay friend. he would have bagged the oscars in most years, his tough luck that he ran into robin williams giving his career best performance in good will hunting.as good as it gets is funny, endearing, touching, dark, sad, cathartic, confusing and enlightening all at once. one of the modern masterpieces. the casting director deserves a special award for this casting coup. watch the movie for the brilliant performances, the arresting chemistry between these superstars, the heart-rending moments between them. this is one of the best movies of the 90s.A deserving 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie to see at any time: when you are sad it proves to you that life isn't always as it looks like, happiness can hide under different covers. Everything can look ugly and yet not be. The characters are fantastic and Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson are unbeatable. The mood of the movie switches so many times from laughter to cry and in reverse, and the final can tell you that life is worth living and though people can't change, because Melvin doesn't change in substance, can make themselves understood and more human the guideline of this movie is friendship in so many different forms that makes everything so real and credible that makes you go home or remain with a smile not necessarily happy but contented</fullReview>

I thought Jack (Nicholson), Helen (Hunt), and Greg (Kinnear) all gave dazzling performances as a crusty writer, a single mother-waitress, and a gay painter. One of my favorite quotes of this film is, "Do you understand me, you crazy f***?" Also, I thought that Carol (Helen Hunt) and Melvin (Jack Nicholson) looked good in the attire they wore when they went out to dinner in Baltimore. In addition, when Simon (Greg Kinnear) yelled at Melvin when he came to his apartment, that made me smile and feel good. If you ask me, AS GOOD AS IT GETS is one of Jack Nicholson's finest movies.

		<shortDescription>This is how you make a movie. This is Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with plot driven movies is that they are confined to the plot. Any and all plot driven movies (movies that rely on plot instead of character to tell the story) must stay within that plot. Jurassic Park must always involve dinosaurs. Bringing Out the Dead must involve ambulance drivers. Die-Hard must involve terrorists. This is not a bad thing. All of those movies I mentioned above are great movies, but they are plot driven. It is nice, however, from time to time to see a character driven movie. A movie with no gimmick, no real plot, only characters that tie it together. These movies usually have more than one main character, lots of dialog, and most importantly, they can go anywhere. The characters can jump in a plane and fly to Antarctica if the want to. It is this feeling of open-ness that makes such movies feel so good. As Good as it Gets is one of these movies. Because the movie is character driven, we feel anything can happen.As Good as it Gets has some of the best characters I have ever seen. There is no real plot. If I had to say what the plot was I would say it's about a crazy jerk who tries to change himself. But that doesn't even come close to describing this movie. One reason why I love this movie is that I can really identify with the main character, Melvin Udall, played with shear brilliance by Jack Nicholson. You see, I am a little obsessive-compulsive. Not enough to warrant medication, just enough to know I have it. As I have said before in other reviews, I love movies about crazy people. And Melvin is about as crazy as they come. I can really understand why he locks and unlocks his door ten times overtime he comes home. I can understand why he wants to have the same waitress serve him breakfast every day. Obsessive-compulsive people love routine and if anything gets in the way of their routine, they feel violated. They not only want everyday to be like the last, they need it that way.The acting in this movie is the best I have ever seen in one movie. The cast was perfect. No one plays a better lunatic than Jack Nicholson. The man is so good mer words can not express it. Helen Hunt is great as the cruel, stressful yet sensitive waitress. She deserves the Oscar for this and she has become one of my favorite actresses. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small part, but he works it beautifully. Greg Kinnear is great as the sensitive and confused gay painter. Even Yeardly Smith (who some of you may know as Lisa from The Simpsons) is good. That just shows how good James L. Brooks is. He assembles on of the greatest casts ever and he directs them with grace and beauty.Speaking of James L. Brooks, he and Mark Andus have made on of the funniest scripts of all time. This movie has some of the best one-liners I have ever heard (most of which come from Melvin). The dialog is great. This is some of the funniest writing I have ever heard.Example: Melvin- Never, never, interrupt me, okay? Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home and one week later there's a smell coming from there that can only be a decaying human body and you have to hold a hanky to your face because the stench is so thick that you think you're going to faint. Even then, don't come knocking. Or, if it's election night, and you're excited and you wanna celebrate because some fudgepacker that you date has been elected the first queer president of the United States and he's going to have you down to Camp David, and you want someone to share the moment with. Even then, don't knock. Not on this door. Not for ANY reason. Do you get me, sweetheart?The movie even reminds me of The Simpsons. James L. Brooks is a producer for that show (which in my opinion is the greatest show of all time) and As Good as it Gets is filled with the same sudden, jab to the head type humor of The Simpsons. No, there is no other similarity, it's just that both seem to have the same comic timing.In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movies and is definitely a classic. I normally hate softy romantic movies. The only thing is As Good as it Gets is anything but a softy romantic movie. Sure the movie has romance. It is, mostly, a love story. But it is NOT soft. It is very hilarious. Melvin is a cranky, brutally honest, meticulous, eccentric man and it is hilarious to watch him. I recommend this to anyone. It's a sweet, intelligent, deep, fresh, funny, and original movie that will continue to entertain me for years to come. Normally, I believe that every one has an opinion. If I like a movie and you don't, so be it. But, if you don't like this movie, well, I can say with APSOLUTE accuracy that you have no taste. Sorry, you don't.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Good As It Gets is definitely one of the best movies I've seen. This movie depends entirely on it's script and the performance of it's actors, and both were excellent. If there are people out there who doubt Jack Nicholson acting capabilities, I'd advise them to see this film. The way in which he portrays his character, a lonely and on the surface mean man suffering from OCD is just brilliant. The character was so real, and I really grew to like him during the movie. And then there's Helen Hunt, I don't care what other people say, she is a great actress and people who say she's not feminine are just plain crazy. I do not think she's the beautiful, but when you watch this movie, how can you not fall in love with her character? To me that is the proof she's is a great actress.And then there is Greg Kinnear, who also does a great job. This movie is just full of great performances.The story is funny, dramatic and romantic, it's got it all. The characters are so well written that they feel real, and I like them so much, that I wish they were. The dialogues are great and there is a lot I will not soon forget. ***** Spoiler (start)***** Melvin Udall: Where do they teach you to talk like this? In some Panama City "Sailor wanna hump-hump" bar, or is it getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey? Sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here.There are so many great scenes; Melvin and his interaction with the dog, and when he realizes he has stepped over the line by talking about carol's son. I also like his relationship with Simon, you can see him wrestling with the fact that he actually likes him. ***** Spoiler (finish)*****I'd advise this movie to every serious movie fan. For in my opinion; This movie is As Good As Movies Get</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TITANIC might have had the last laugh making the most money in 1997, but AS GOOD AS IT GETS bowed out with far more Oscars and respect. There are very little faults in this movie. With some crafty editing, flawless acting (even from a dog), and clever direction, AS GOOD AS IT GETS may probably end up being one of the greatest forgotten movies of the nineties.We are introduced to Melvin Udall, a romance novelist with an obsessive compulsive behavior and a rotten attitude. When his next door neighbor, Simon, gets robbed and beaten brutally, his friend Frank assigns Melvin to take care of his dog while he recovers.There is far much more to this movie than the causative incident. Helen Hunt 's role as Carol is just as equally well played as Greg Kinnear and Jack Nicholson 's. The acting is positively great. The screen writing is also just as superior. Some of the lines have had absolute positive effect on some of my friends throughout some troubled times ("what if this is as good as it gets?"). AS GOOD AS IT GETS relates to everybody, especially anyone who has a little Melvin in them. It is something that everyone can smile and laugh at.</fullReview>

As Good As It Gets is my second favorite movie of all time, just behind Jerry Maguire. That doesn't mean that it's the second BEST I've seen, but it certainly was the best film of the year, especially in a tough year. The Oscars were right on giving Nicholson and Hunt awards, I wish Kinnear had won. All in all this is a solid 10/10 film with it's charming humor and the times where you just want to hug yourself with delight. I recommend this to all film lovers.</fullReview>

Sounds too simple?Basically, they took some odd, flawed characters that have little to do with each other, and make a great movie by bringing them together through some very unique circumstances and poking fun at all of them, but bringing you closer to them as you go. Character development is a large part of the movie.I laughed at several scenes and felt moved in others. The funny scenes weren't corny and the heart-warming scenes weren't sappy. This movie is different than the normal movie, which is a big plus. The cast and their acting makes it all work. Probably the best all-around movie of 1997 in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater back in 1997 and just rented it again last night. It holds up pretty well and contains some fine performances by Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, who both won Oscars that year. The story is highly original in its choice of characters and their relationships all being intertwined as they are. Nicholson's character, while mean and hateful, cannot be disliked and as the movie goes on, you really start to feel for the guy and his illness. I know some people with similar behavior patterns and it's totally beyond their control, this obsessive-compulsive behavior. This movie is also laugh out loud funny, which was unexpected when I first saw it. If I had to add any negatives, it would be that Nicholson seems too old to be a partner for Hunt, something about it doesn't quite jive. Also, the last 30 minutes of the movie seem to drag, as you are never quite sure where it's going with the unpredictable plot - however it being unpredictable also makes it so enjoyable. To sum it up, I was glued to the screen, mesmerized by Nicholson's amazing portrayal of his character, laughing out loud quite a few times and felt appropriately warm and fuzzy while the credits rolled. Check it out, but definitely bring along your significant other! :)</fullReview>

I'm glad I did ,the story is one of those rare scripts that just rips out the heart strings let alone pluck at them.Nicholson's characters transformation from spit it like it is to sympathetic lover is compelling, and Hunt's portrayal of a Mother at her whits end with A+E doctors was played with the tenacity of any parent who has faced brick walls over their children's health problems. I admit I wept when she was trying to express to Nicholson how she couldn't work out how best to say thank you, and what she called a note of thanks, I'd have called an essay.Greg Kinnear plays the rejected by his parents gay man with true feeling and the resulting chemistry between all the main characters was a joy to watch. I would have no hesitation in recommending this film to anyone who has a wet afternoon to kill.</fullReview>

A genuinely funny and moving film, the outstanding script has just the right lines for the right moment.

		<shortDescription>It's Not Only As Good As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by right better than "Titanic", but not as good as "Good Will Hunting". The storyline is so appealing that it captured the my attention from beginning to end, except for the ending.The three lead actors, Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear, are brilliant. They all deserve Oscar, and they all would have gotten it, if only this movie was not competing against "Good Will Hunting". Greg Kinnear lost to Robin Williams, but he surely was his only true competitor that year.Well, what can I say? People in Hollywood still prefer big budget romantic movies with young actors instead of this kind of movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nitpicking but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie several times now and enjoy it more with each viewing. Nicholson lives to play these types of characters, so no suprise there. Hunt is good, but not great. The suprise is just how good Kinnear is as an actor.In a movie with a level of detail that we're reminded each time Melvin steps on a crack, none of the other characters want to know Melvin's story. What's up with that? He's dying to tell it in the car ride to Baltimore, but isn't given the chance aside from mentioning small snippets of his father's dysfunction that are immediately interrupted by the others (perhaps Jack did have a soliloquy in that scene but it ended up on the cutting room floor). Maybe its just me, but if I found a wacko like Melvin helping me and becoming a friend, I'd want to know his story. Granted neither Carol's nor Simon's stories are elaborated upon, but they're stereotypical characters and not the central focus of the movie anyway. Melvin's a certifiable crazy who's a bestselling romance(?) author and pianist to boot. I just wish this hole in the script was filled. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest with you, folks. I never liked Helen Hunt before this movie. But after seeing her play Carol in "As Good As It Gets", I was struck with a new respect for her. In fact, the whole cast of this incredible film is absolutely amazing. The script is fresh and real and it makes watching this movie a totally enjoyable experience. I recommend "As Good As It Gets" to anyone who appreciates watching interesting characters deal with their lives. This film is touching, funny, and well-crafted in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not as good as it gets, but certainly hard to beat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: possible spoilers! "As Good as it Gets" is definitely one of the best films of 1997; only L. A. Confidential and in some respects, Titanic, match this level of cinematic quality, though for entirely different reasons. While L.A. Confidential more clearly deserves the award for best plot, As Good as it Gets could arguably beat it for best writing and performances (in my opinion, it is a toss-up between the two). This film is not a big blockbuster which blows you away with superfluous special effects, but rather a slice-of-life story brought to film with fantastic, intriguing, and amusing writing and incredibly vivid, daring, and raw, emotional performances; and though perhaps the plot of "As Good as it Gets" was somewhat predictable, real life can also be, given the same assembly of characters and situations... But make no mistake, "As Good as it Gets" is well worth watching for the characters alone, as motley a crew of eccentric, on-going NYC survivors as you will find on the silver screen. All in all, it has to be said that this is a superb comedy with golden moments from Nicholson and Hunt, in particular the scene in which Helen's character receives the nicest compliment of her life. Though I had no inkling of who exactly Greg Kinnear was before I saw this film, his performance was so remarkable that at moments, I was stunned to have been so deeply moved by it. He is truly one of the most talented actors to appear in recent years, and should win an academy award before the end of his career. As a comedy, "As Good as it Gets" lived up to its most daring name in 1997, easily standing head and shoulders above the rest. See it. My rating: 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Script, but too long and predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James L. Brooks' As Good As It Gets is one of the better films of 1997, but I found it too be long and predictable. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as Melvin Uhdall, a guy who is a "horror of a human being". His one-liners are hilarious with that cynical smerk across his face. Helen Hunt plays Carol, a waitress that serves Melvin's daily breakfast at the nearby Manhattan diner. The predictability of the film is that we know that by the end, Melvin will be a good human being or at least changed for the better by Carol.The film has it's moments, though. And Jack Nicholson steals the show. This one of the three best films from 1997, and one that you may want to see, but it does get a tad exhausting.Won two Oscars for Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) and Best Actress (Helen Hunt).***1/2 /5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"an old house set on fire"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Chinese professor, Mr. Qian Zhongshu, had humorously commented on how old people fall in love -- "like an old house set on fire". And with that thought, the movie really kept me smiling and laughing with a warm understanding and touch for about two hours.Every gesture of Jack Nicholson came so natural but also refined and subtle - the way he spoke, stood, walked, placed his hands, made eye contacts. And of course, if not for Helen Hunt, an ordinary waitress could never be so...well...full of life, love, and you'll feel exactly like Melvin said, there is something worth your appreciation and admiration in every single thing she did, in every single thought she had... in how she was with Spencer and it's really something for being straight and good...actually I've already put it on my "most-romantic-movie-ever-seen" list.Another reason to watch the movie is Melvin's compliments on Carol. Guys should listen carefully and learn and keep in mind how to praise women next time. :) Well...probably some "tough" men would think "something is better left unsaid", but wouldn't it be best if something is said by somebody who is not used to speaking out his mind? Simon has it, "Don't sleep on it". Love is a precious thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film. It can get sort of long, but it's still great. This is one of those movies that contains a blend of drama and comedy. I enjoy Jack Nicholson's portrayal as the anti-social Melvin Udall. Another Jack Nicholson film I saw was "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." His personality is different in that movie than in this one. In Cuckoo's Nest, he was more open minded and showed his fellow inmates the joys of life. The one in Cuckoo's Nest would have probably made friends with Simon the gay artist. He would have been a lot more polite with waitress Carol Connely. To top it all off, he would have been a lot friendlier and would have made several friends. The Jack Nicholson in this film, however, would have been nasty to the inmates at the mental hospital. He would not have wanted anything to do with them. So do you think Melvin Udall will become a better man? Well, watch this movie and find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard As Good As It Gets was a great film, but then again, I was told Anaconda was a great film, so I didn't know what it was going to be like. The result of As Good As It Gets was very good indeed, actually, forget that. It was great!Melvin, played by an impressive Jack Nicholson, earns his crust, absurdly, writing cheesy romance novels, and lives as reclusively as he can in a Manhattan apartment. One of his obsessive rituals is breakfasting daily at a cafe where only salty waitress Carol (Helen Hunt) - a single mother with her own stressful woes - will tolerate Melvin's diatribes and sass him back.When Simon (Greg Kinnear), a gay artist who lives across the hall, is hospitalised, old misery-guts Melvin is coerced by Simon's agent (Cuba Gooding Jr.) into caring for his despised neighbour's ugly but endearing mutt and - you betcha! - bonding is soon afoot as the pooch wags its way into Melvin's corroded heart. Thus softened up, Melvin is reluctantly but irrevocably goaded into a series of grudging good deeds which are entirely motivated by self-interest but which inch him in the general direction of humanity and improbable but superb redemption. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Academy Awards for their memorable, brilliant performances, but the rest of the cast aren't bad when it comes to acting. Greg Kinear is excellent, Cuba Gooding Jr. is great as usual and a brief but impressive performance from Skeet Ulrich secures As Good As It Gets' supporting cast. James L. Brooks is also the perfect director for this film, his efforts to make this film great succeed. This dramatic but funny film is well worth a look.I rate As Good As It Gets 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a hilarious movie this is!! Seriously, this movie is one big fun ride. Jack Nicholson is giving an incredible performance as Melvin, a guy who seems to hate everybody but the waitress Carol, who can really melt his heart. The script is gorgeous, sometimes you are like: did he really say THAT??? The dialogue is so funny and the whole movie is very entertaining. So what makes this movie that good besides its' script and Jack's performance? Certainly the performances of Greg Kinnear and Helen Hunt. Greg creates an incredibly lovely character and he displays the emotions of his character Simon perfectly. I really wonder why Greg doesn't get more leads in movies, he is a very fine actor. I loved his "Simon". Helen is also convincing as a struggling single Mom who is one of the little people who dare to tell Melvin what they really think of his behavior. This movie is about characters and all the characters have been developed very well. That's what makes the movie work. It takes enough time to show the character developments and I really gotta say thatthis movie is pretty much as good as it gets!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepless the next door</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie!I saw it the other night on TV, after I enjoyed it n the theatres in 1998. Its contrast of fabulous comedy and human tragedy reminded me of 'La vita e bella' (Life is beautiful), IMO perhaps most important tragicomedy ever, although both handle comedy and tragedy in totally different ways and, of course, scales.What I liked particularly, was the idea, that people with problems like loneliness, depression, illness might get a new sight of life simply by recognizing, that others have similar problems, and leaning on each other.The acting was absolutely amazing and believable and the oscars well deserved, although as a Kate Winslet obsessed guy I like to think of Helen Hunt's oscar as being a bit of a concession due to Titanic winning some awards, this movie would have got in another year.If you would like "Sleepless in Seattle" rather realistic than romantic and with some more psychological depth, go and see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"As Good As It Gets" is another terrific movie from writer-producer-director James L. Brooks, the creator of "Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News". The great Jack Nicholson, who won his second Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for "Terms", won his third Oscar as Best Actor for his hilarious performance here as Melvin Udall, a mean-spirited writer who is hated by everyone and has a tendency to act weird and unusual (for example, when he walks down a street he avoids stepping in cracks by stepping over them). Then he begins to show off a nice side of himself thanks in part to two other people: his favorite waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) and his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). He also becomes attached to Simon's adorable little dog Verdell when Simon's art dealer pal (Cuba Gooding Jr.) forces Melvin to watch the dog after Simon is injured in a beating and hospitalized. Most movies simply don't get as good as this. "As Good As It Gets" is very well-written and directed by Brooks who sure knows how to make good movies. He's only directed four feature films in his career and three of them have been excellent (only his 1994 film "I'll Do Anything" was a dud). "As Good As It Gets" is also beautifully acted by the entire cast. Nicholson is perfect here and so are Hunt and Kinnear. Hunt has proven that she can be a great actress both on the small screen (as on her long-running TV show "Mad About You" which won her four Emmys) and on the big screen (she deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance here and she's very good in the current release "Pay It Forward"). Kinnear is also very good in this movie too (he was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar). The rest of the supporting cast from Cuba Gooding Jr. to Shirley Knight to former "Ghostbuster" Harold Ramis are cast to perfection in "As Good As It Gets". This is a terrific movie with only one minor problem: it runs just a little bit too long. Still, I loved it anyway. ***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

I found this movie to beengrossing and extremely funny. A well deserved academyaward for Jack Nicholson for a character that was tailoredto his style. Jack as probably the best character actor of hisgeneration. Helen Hunt was good, but I believe that herperformance wasn't Oscar quality. The only problems I had with this flick was : 1) Characterization of Helen Hunt's mother was shallow &amp;strange. Advising her daughter to go out and get laid ??!?(she is already a single mother). 2) The romance relationship between Helen &amp; Jack is unreal. Jack should have ended up with Helen's mother. All in all, the movie was outstanding. If it could touch anemotionally jaded person as myself, it has to be good.</fullReview>

The only two possible gripes i have with it is that the storyline progresses a bit too slow at times.

He takes this movie on his shoulders and carries it almost all the way through.I don't get Helen Hunt. She has her moments - her scenes with Nicholson as he tries to complement her are priceless - but she just doesn't have the emotional range to pull it off. She tries, but her high-profile scenes don't ring true. She was upstaged by Greg Kinnear for Christ's sake - and SHE was naked!Well directed for the most part - there are some pacing problems, and this movie falls victim to "great line" disease. Great pieces of dialogue are framed by clumsy directorial arrows pointing to us and it, telling us that what we're about to hear is great dialogue. Still, it IS great dialogue.

		<fullReview>"As Good as It Gets" is one of those really intelligent movies. It's light-hearted without being too much to take, and it has its dose of "reality for a Friday night". Jack Nicholson the obsessive romance writer, Melvin Udall, who lives in an up-scale Manhattan apartment across the hall from a gay artist, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) and his adorable dog, Verdell. Simon is beaten up by robbers, and Melvin, the pessimistic, bitter, complaining, obsessive-compulsive, and prejudicial shut-in, has Simon's dog forced on him, while Simon's still in the hospital. Melvin grows affectionate towards the dog, and the good in him begins to leak out. The story also centralizes around Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), a waitress at Melvin's only restaurant and who has a chronically sick child, Spencer. The story continues with the three of them traveling together to Simon's parents' house in the south of Baltimore. Melvin almost wins Carol over, but blows it. They come back to New York after the trip with Simon feeling a new sense of hope in his life, as well as Carol. The movie doesn't end there, but I don't want to give away the ending. I will say this, however. Melvin really is a good man on the inside, despite all of his short comings and sardonic remarks. The story is about finding yourself and love in your adulthood, and coming to terms with it. The only grievance I had with the movie was that it kind of went on for too long, but it's definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* * * ? (3? out of 5)As Good As It GetsDirected by: Albert Brooks, 1998A contrived feel-good vehicle obtains a life of its own by way of some outstanding performances. Helen Hunt is touching, tough and obscenely huggable as the down-and-out New York waitress who gets a helping hand from a seriously disturbed and obsessive-compulsive regular customer (Jack Nicholsen). Hollywood's favorite freak, Nicholsen, is on a delightful eyebrow-arching rampage in this standard romantic comedy by Albert Brooks (Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News). His performance may well be his best to date. The movie is not. Lacking both depth and needed working class feel, its low points are when Brooks lets the sappiness take control (Harold Ramis as a cartoonish Dr. Feelgood).However: As Good As It Gets wants you to believe that there's an innocent charm to life, and by staying slow-burning conservative and soberly delivering the goods, this is actually achieved. Amusing and sweet fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this film so much the first time I saw it, but now I adore it! As Good as It Gets is excellent, it has a great cast of actors, a funny script and a great director.This film is too hard to explain and If I told you what it was about you probably wouldn't enjoy as much. I just tell you something, think a repulsive, rude, crude and clean-cut man who writes romance books on a trip with two emotional dudes!!As Good As It Gets would definitely be on my Top 100 films. It is excellent!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'As Good As It Gets' is one of the most uplifting films I've seen in ages. It may not seem like it to start but if you watch the film through, then I can almost guarantee that you will be feeling better than you were when you started.Jack Nicholson is astounding as Melvin, the obnoxious and superstitious author whose change in character as he falls in love with the equally wonderful Helen Hunt is developed very well in the writing.On a less positive note, Melvin's homophobic attitude, especially at the beginning of the film may prove offensive to some audiences (i.e. my sister refuses to watch the film she found it so offensive). So before you watch it, I do suggest you take a lot of the things he says with a pinch of salt and try and stomach it.A very good film overall, definitely recommended8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, SCOTTMCON finally got around to seeing this one .. and he's a perennial Jack Nicholson, and a romantic.It is very worth your time; and very worth a Golden Globe Award or Oscar for Best Actor, Best Actress &amp; Best Film..This warm Brooklyn based comdey takes a close look at three human beings interlinked by their circumstances ... Jack Nichoson .. the writer ... Helen Hunt .. the waitress at his favorite restaurant (West Side) and Greg Kinnear as a painting disciple of Paul Cadmus living next door to Nicholson ... and recovering from a beating/mugging .. and worried at losing his home &amp; studio.Nicholson plays the New York literate &amp; cycnic to the hilt. His life is so shaped, so arranged that he becomes deranged at displacements Like his favorite waitress' day off..Helen is his favorite waitress .. he is at ease with her; he falls in love with her ; she thinks he's a little crazy but "worth an investment?"These people meet and share their lives in this fine human comedy bringng Hunt her Oscar and her transit from TV &amp; stage to the cinema.It is a Nicholson "tour de froce" .. and New York City and her people never looked tougher, kinder, friendlier, nor more real.Cuba Gooding Jr "cleans up" with a fine supporting role as a foil for Nicholson. All acceptbale New York manners apply ... and Nicholson behaves as if he's re-learning them. Hunt is a sympathy attraction as a table-waitning working mother whose looks, and sick son attracts the pennies and sympathy of Nicholson.Never selling herself short .. she asks her mother: "Why can't I have a normal boyfriend like everyone else? Someone who doesn't worry me about going beserk or losing control of himself?""That's what everyone wnts!" says Mom ...'They don't exist!"Roll and relax with this one .. and see if "macho" writer can spark and prompt people back to life and refine himself into love.Hat's off to the Baltimore weekend scene as Helen Hunt's character declares "My drink's folliowng me!" ..a comedic mannered interlude leftoevr from the days when a man or woman on the make didn't take her drink from the bar to avert "hustling".Hunt doesn't hustle. ..she just holds out .. the prize is human calculus!Give it Romance ... *****/5 &amp; *****/5 overall</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Sort of a Wonderful Slice of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What kind of movie is As Good As It Gets? There is no easy answer. It isn't a simple romance or road picture and doesn't have clear cut heroes and villains. It is a slice of life with people trying to deal with tough breaks and for the most part As Good As It Gets does its job well.As Good As It Gets begins by showing us a bigoted, rigid novelist played by Jack Nicholson. The main object of his scorn is an artist (Greg Kinnear) who happens to be gay and the only person who can tolerate our bigot is a waitress (Helen Hunt). Now the film gets into very heavy details about the problems of the artist and the waitress and how Nicholson's character could care less. This worked well for me because the performances were good, including a supporting part by Cuba Gooding Jr (oh, and the dog is cute too). Also, the script was well written and the pace felt right.As Good As It Gets brought up many topics and presented them in interesting ways. Can a bigoted person change? Does a single mother with big financial problems take money as a main consideration when looking for a partner? For a Hollywood movie the handling of these weighty subjects leaned more toward reality than fantasy. Still, the age difference between Nicholson and Hunt as well as the final scene take some strong suspension of belief. On a positive note, the style of the picture moved from drama, to comedy, to a road picture and landed as a romance shifting smoothly from one mood to another. Appreciating As Good As It Gets depends if you are not expecting a lot of action or a straight forward story. If you are willing to give the movie a chance and enter the lives of its characters then your effort will be well rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson at his best; an all-around great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I found it to be pretty entertaining, but nothing too great...a little over-hyped, but still worth the one watch.When later I gave it a second watch on a boring day, I fell in love with this movie. Nicholson's character, Melvin Udall, is easily one of the best, most complex, and funniest characters in movie history. Jack has to be given a ton of credit for acting this part, because few actors could pull it off.Helen Hunt was very deserving of her Oscar as well...as others have noted, she was so good that she didn't even seem like she was acting. The chemistry between Hunt and Nicholson was amazing, and without both of them in this movie, it wouldn't have been nearly as good.Rounding out the main threesome of the movie is Greg Kinnear, who also does an excellent job in playing the gay neighbor. He is great in the role of Melvin's victim, and shows a lot of acting diversity throughout the movie.As far as the story goes...the only complaint I see is that the romance is too unbelievable. It isn't particularly believable, but I think what saved that is the fact that...***SPOILER ALERT*** Melvin and Carol didn't get married or anything like that in the end. The guy kisses the girl in the end, and that's as far as it goes. They didn't bring it to some unrealistic level that's beyond the realm of possibility. As it stands, I don't think the romance of the movie is any less realistic than the character of Melvin Udall himself. ***SPOILER END***Overall, I wouldn't change this movie at all. Great characters, great acting, great story...don't take it too seriously, just enjoy it for the light-hearted script that it is, and you'll come out liking this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all...I really liked it. Now I must tell you that I went in to see this movie with a poor attitude, because I don't like Jack Nicholson movies (except for "A Few Good Men" and "Wolf"). Ever since I saw Jack in the "Shining", I have thought the guy was just too psycho. Well sure enough, I found that I now like a third Jack Nicholson movie and yes...this should be known as a "Jack Nicholson" movie. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear were great in their respective parts, but Jack carried the day. The movie was funny in a most offensive way, serious in a very sad way, and bizarre in a Jack Nicholson way. Jack plays a guy who is just rude and offensive to everyone he meets, you feel sorry for him every so often, but those brief milliseconds pass and you go back to thinking he is just a jerk....but then even jerks have the potential for changing. Now any one of you who like to rip on others or those of you who all know a person like that, then this film is for you, but if any of you are on the receiving end of a person like this, then you'll even appreciate this film, because guess what...he does begin to change for the better...so maybe there is hope. It is not surprising that Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Golden Globe awards for this film. You will definitely be glad you saw it, even if you are sitting there right now saying no way, well stop talking to yourself and go see it....you will like it. Bottom line...if you are looking for a great movie this month, then this is "As Good As It Gets".</fullReview>

It takes a humorous, yet realistic view of OCD and how it affects a person and those around him.

Nicholson is divine, and Hunt and Kinnear can almost match him. However, Brooks' Oscar-winning film offers one completely unconvincing romance, and therefore a lame ending.

		<fullReview>Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) looked like a true blue friend in this movie as he helps Greg Kinnear, but then suddenly falls for Helen Hunt.Though, I didn't like the beating scene; I mostly liked the scenes when Jack, Helen, and Greg go on a brief vacation to a nice place. But then Greg, too, falls for Helen, less than Jack does. Plus I didn't believe that Cuba Gooding Jr. starred in this movie, too. He should of appeared in more scenes, though. Anyway, what I can say is that this movie is like a brilliant lifestyle, a lifestyle which can be as good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As far as romantic comedies go, this is "As Good as it Gets"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throw out all of your `classics'. No Cary Grant movie can compare with the subtle beauty and outrageous humor of this gem. The plot seems more than a bit insane, but then again so does the main character. Melvin Udall (the incomparable Jack Nicholson) is a mean, obsessive-compulsive, old crank who's life is turned around by his gay neighbor Simon (the excellent Greg Kinnear) and his favorite waitress (the radiant Helen Hunt). This trio of actors perfectly fill out James L. Brooks and Mark Andrus' heartfelt screenplay. While the direction may not be breathtaking, Brooks' simplistic style is felt throughout the movie. Also Hans Zimmer's playful sweet score is a wonderful addition to this film, contributing to the mood without being conspicuous. However the characters and the actors that portray them are the real reason to see this movie.Nicholson's Melvin Udall may live on to be the most famous film character of the 90's. His disgusting sense of humor and bigotry somehow reconcile believably with his underlying sweetness and vulnerability. I guess that sort of thing just happens naturally when you are as talented as Jack Nicholson. Helen Hunt's Carol is a wonderful, subtle, beautiful character. Her natural charm, beauty, and humor is reminiscent of Meg Ryan, only better. Carol is a wonderful representation of the modern supermom that attempts to be as good a person as she can to everyone, and that makes her a little stressed out when it comes to relationships. It is no wonder that she touches the heart of Melvin because she touches the heart of the audience as well. Kinnear's Simon Bishop is the weakest of the three links, but he holds his own admirably. Kinnear's film career was saved by this movie and rightfully so. His monologue about seeing someone's humanity in just one instant is one of the movie's most memorable moments. He also provides a realistic, non-caricatured portrayal of a gay man.I will not spoil the story for those who have not seen it, but I will say that every time I see this movie, the wonderful, cathartic feeling that the ending provides is one of the most delightful movie experiences ever. In short, if you haven't seen it, then I suggest that you do as soon as you can. This is the greatest romantic comedy ever. It reaches out to the Melvin in all of us and tells us to open up, be ourselves, and most of all share your life with someone you love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I think this movie was pretty good. But it really got me thinking. I know it is a favourite Hollywood trick to cast a leading man with an attractive woman half his age as the love interest. This movie does not disappoint- Jack was 60 when this movie came out, and Helen was 34. Seeing as this movie was pretty good, and the lead male was double the love interest's age, logically, if a theoretical movie came out where the lead male's age was triple the love interest's, it would be even BETTER! Or how about quadruple? Or quintuple? Here's a pitch for a new movie. It's called "Better Than it Gets," and it stars Bob Hope and Natalie Portman. At first, they don't get along, because Bob keeps telling her how fat and ugly she is. But then, as a gesture of affection, he butts his cigar out in her eye, and she falls in love with him. How about it, Hollywood?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One persistent criticism I've seen of this film is that Hunt's Oscar for the role was a gift, that she didn't have to really work for it, that the role was too slight, yatta yatta yatta. But one of the things that made this an exceptional romantic comedy for me was a combination of Hunt's performance and a very different approach to comedy. Comedy, especially romantic comedy, has pace; it zips and zings along, you think of the classics like _It Happened One Night_. But this film does the opposite; some of its best moments, like when Melvin is struggling to come up with a compliment, or when Carol is trying to explain to her mother her attraction for Melvin, are filled with huge pauses. Lots and lots of space and time. And it's in these moments that Hunt really shines, showing that she's not dependent on the badda-bing pace of something like _Mad About You_ but has that mysterious something that used to be called screen presence, the ability to draw people in even when there's nothing happening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it came out two years ago and since then have been obsessed with it. Heck sometimes I even get mad at people that don't like it- its plain perfect! I really didd'nt like Titanic anyway and think this movie was cheated out of it's best picture oscar.How can it be so perfect you might ask, thats what i'll tell you.First off the cast couldnt be better. Jack Nicholson truly deserved his oscar as Melvin Udall, a compulsive writer that doesnt step on cracks, has to have the same restaurant and table everyday, closes and locks doors 5 times,and is prejudiced to everyone that is not him.Greg Kinnear is Melvin's gay neighbor Simon who decides to draw the street punk Vincent for an art show, and ends up having the punk's friends beat the crap out of him.So of corse as he is rushed to the hospital Melvin has to watch his (adorably) ugly dog Ferdel.So with that, Melvin begins to soften up - expecially around the waitress he loves Carol Connoly by Helen Hunt who also won a best actress oscar. Also in the cast is Cuba Gooding Jr. as Simons partner who has to threaten Melvin to get him to watch Ferdel. With Skeet Ulrich as Vincint, Shirly Knigt as Carol's mom who helps take care of her sick son,Harold Ramis as the doctor who will help her son, with Yeardly Smith and Lupe Ontiveros as Simon's friends. Also the music by Nat King Cole and Hans Zimmer is perfect. If you havent seen this you need to- fast!</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars (Actor and Actress) for playing their very different New Yorker characters. Jack (my favorite modern actor) is hilarious as an obsessive compulsive, and Helen (one of my favorite modern actresses) is the light of the movie as a waitress. The only thing that suprises me is the fact that Greg Kinnear didn't win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He is superb as a gay artist that gets attacked and is down on his luck. Take my word if you see one film from 1997, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson deserved an Oscar in this film for his portrayal of a guy who doesn't have the easiest of lives to deal with. He played him excellently well and Helen Hunt was also quite good. The movie wasn't a masterpiece, but it had some good lines and a sharp script. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...possibly Nicholson's best performance"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally give a 10 out of 10 rating to a romantic comedy, but As Good As It Gets couldn't get much better. In what is possibly Nicholson's best performance (and being a fan of performances in The Shining, Cuckoo's Nest, A Few Good men, The Pledge, and many more... I do not say this lightly), As Good As It Gets is not lacking to those who crave great acting, story, character development and humor. Nicholson and Helen Hunt were indeed Oscar worthy while Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight, Skeet Ulrich, and Harold Ramis are superb in their supporting roles. I have seen this movie countless times, and never grow weary of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film making at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of Jack Nicholson -- but this movie made me re-think his abilities as an actor.Of course, he does what he does best -- play a psycho (The Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) but this is a different kind of psycho -- one with a very human side.Mr. Nicholson plays someone with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) as if he were a victim of this illness for his entire life.From the moment early in the film when he walked into his apartment and counted the number of times he turned the lock on his front door (5) to the number of times he turned the lights on and off in his bathroom (also 5) I knew what his illness was.Helen Hunt as Carol Connelly has just enough edge to her character that you realize she is not perfect either. In her own way she has OCD also -- regarding her son and HIS illness.There are lots of cameos by well known actors in very small roles: Shirley Knight, Brian Doyle-Murray, Lawrence Kasdan, Harold Ramis, Danielle Brisebois and the ALWAYS entertaining but ever under-utilized Yeardley Smith (I KNOW it is her voice that keeps her from getting the major roles -- but I wish someone would really recognize her talents and give her a major role).I have always been a big fan of James L. Brooks, from his early work as creator of "Room 222" and "The Tracy Ullman Show" to Producer of Jerry Maguire, The War of the Roses, Big, Broadcast News, Terms of Endearment and Executive Producer of "The Critic," "The Simpsons," "The Tracey Ullman Show," "Taxi," "Rhoda," and last but definitely NOT least "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." His writing and directing skills (particularly in this film) amaze and astound me; he is truly a gifted artist.It is too bad this came out the same year as Titanic -- it is a MUCH better film and really deserved the Oscar for best picture of 1998.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the plot is unbelievable. So the ending's a shade too happy. So it's highly unlikely that two people that seem to bicker without interval will suddenly fall for each other. Right??? Actually, it's happened to me. But I do understand where the critics are coming from when they insist "NO WAY. Unrealistic that a pretty waitress twenty years Jack Nicholson's junior would fall for the crusty old obsessive-compulsive." But I don't like this movie for it's plot. I like it because, well, goll darn it, Jack and Helen are wonderful actors! Their Best Acting Oscars were richly deserved, and their talents are showcased in AGAIG. As a wannabe actress, I thought Hunt's crying scene was believable to the point of sheer jealousy (how DOES she do it?) And Nicholson's facial expressions--so many of them!--are, in a word, superb. Surprise yourself and watch it. Even if you're not crazy about the stars, Greg Kinnear's stellar and his dog, Verdel steals his every scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems to be a collision of some '30s weepie remake with Helen Hunt, a TV movie about a gay artist finding his dignity, and "The Man Who Came to Dinner". Pick a path, just one, please, and the very worthwhile star turns by Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt would be so more fulfilling. Hunt takes the measure of Nicholson's screen presence and matches it, commanding our attention by not calling desperately for it. That's enough to offset the meandering plot and road trip, even.One last comment, appropriated from elsewhere: In real life, when a woman over 20 years of age hears a man say, "You make me want to be a better person," her immediate response is "Good. Go away, become one, and then we'll talk." That this movie misses this point really is it in a nutshell.Rating: See it on an airplane. You can discuss it with your spouse/other and not disturb others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1997's best film (despite popular "Titanic" belief)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"As Good As It Gets" is just one of those movies that makes you feel good, at least it does me. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt proved themselves to be deserving of those Oscars, while Greg Kinnear also gave an Oscar-deserving portrayal of Melvin's (Jack Nicholson) gay neighbor. I love this movie so much because it shows how when people come in contact with each other, the unexpected often occurs. The three main characters have these problems that they unsucessfully try to solve on their own, not realizing that they can help each other out. As stated by Melvin to Carol, "You make me want to be a better man." With amazing direction by James L.Brooks, this is a great movie. It has a lot of laughs, but really is very touching. It's a movie about real life for everyday people. Without a doubt, "As Good As It Gets" was definitely the best film of 1997 (despite the Academy's opinion). :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While romantic comedies have been young lovers' territory (from When Harry met Sally to Sliding Doors), As Good As It Gets approaches romance from an older point of view. Jack Nicholson is suitably casted into this spitting, obsessive role, while Helen Hunt melts into her portrayal of Carol. Greg Kinnear, while not winning an Oscar, is also convincing while a brilliant supporting cast with Cuba Gooding Jr, Yeardley Smith and others keep the story going. Touching, sweet and at times funny, this romantic comi-drama is wonderful entertainment.</fullReview>

So, I was excited to see this. And, I was excited to see that Cuba Gooding Jr was in it. I thought he was outstanding in Jerry MaGuire. But, my wife and I ended up not seeing it until it came out on video. And, I don't know, maybe it was because we didn't see it in the theater, since I enjoy films much more in the theater. But, I must say that we were pretty severely disappointed. In my book, it goes right along with Cameron Diaz-- quite overrated. Granted, Jack has some of the funniest lines I've ever heard in a movie. But, there wasn't much else good about it. It was pretty sweet, but it just didn't do it for me. Cuba had what-- a whole five minutes of screen time. At the end, my wife and I were asking each other-- that was it?</fullReview>

The rash of criticism about 60-ish actors getting the 20-30-ish actresses is well-taken here, although I don't think anyone else could have done the part.

		<fullReview>I'm a big James L. Brooks fan, so I was anxiously awaiting this movie, and though I preferred the original title (OLD FRIENDS), that proved to be my only complaint. Brooks is one of the masters at combining comedy with drama, and he's also great at writing dialogue (the "noodle salad" speech is a highlight). I should also say though I'm not familiar with Mark Andrus' work, he obviously deserves credit for writing the original script, which Brooks re-wrote.A lot has been said about Nicholson, but let me just say this; I have friends who work with obsessive-compulsive people, and people who suffer similar disorders, and they said Nicholson captured what being an obsessive-compulsive is to a T. I also liked how gradual he changed, that his progress is slow, and that he still makes mistakes when he's unsure (like when Carol comes on to him and he asks her to sleep with Simon).There also seems to be a backlash against Hunt, and I for one would like to nip that in the bud. A single mom is the type of role that other actresses might use to call attention to themselves, but Hunt never does. And again, she concentrates on building her character gradually as well, and making her recognizable (the fact that the only way she can thank the doctor(Harold Ramis) who helps her son is to hug him, even though they don't know each other and he's obviously embarrassed). Finally, Kinnear gives his first really good performance as Simon. All in all, an excellent film!</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson gives one of the best performances of his career, Helen Hunt shows her deeper side than that viewed in Mad About You. But Greg Kinnear truly steals the show. After past career problems like A Smile Like Yours, Dear God, and Sabrina, this is definitely a career saver. He should have won best supporting actor for sure. Never before have I experienced a film like this and I doubt I ever will. But why people keep saying they couldn't stop laughing doesn't make sense to me.

		<fullReview>The Oscar nominations were well deserved in this one and the actor winners made for an excellent pair. The story entices slowly in the beginning, but Nicholson's wit and humour won't keep you waiting for long. It's a great film during which you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel the full range of emotions that the character Melvin, the seemingly hopeless obsessive/ compulsive writer feels and experiences with depth and intensity. There isn't enough I can say about this film, having been a fan of Nicholson's for may years, except that this may be his magnum opus. Newbe's Hunt and Kinnear were both definite Oscar calibre as well, and Cuba Gooding Jr. continues to impress, even here in a minor role. One of the three best films of 1997 in my opinion; get to the cinemas NOW while you can still catch it. Top rating (5 stars of 5) !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, this movie was a very enjoyable film to watch. I rank it with Pretty Woman, Roxanne, Sleepless in Seattle, The Goodbye Girl, etc. as other romantic comedies in the 9/10 category.It is difficult to say why any movie rates a 9 instead of a 10. Mostly it is just a gut feeling. In this case there are a couple specific weaknesses. 1) You have to be able to believe that a young woman (Helen Hunt) would become interested in someone as old as Jack Nicholson. More unbelievable is the fact that his character is anyone other than someone she would ever get interested. 2) The radical extremes from complete disdain to love and back and forth are too far fetched to be believed.Still the acting was sensational and everyone deserved all the credits they got. The characters were very interesting and it was easy to root for them. It was a feel good movie and that alone gets an extra brownie point from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insubstantial put-on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A goofy romantic entertainment like AS GOOD AS IT GETS is the kind of earnest Hollywood "crowd-pleaser" that no one used to mistake for art. But with its high industry and audience acclaim, you may feel like a cynic if you don't quite believe in Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt as a romantic duo. Like AMISTAD, the film skillfully preys on your emotional vulnerabilities. If you're like me, though, and prefer to respond to movies with ALL your senses and faculties--to free yourself to enjoy a movie on truer terms--it's all right to feel irritated.The movie has an idea, but it's a dippy one. Nicholson is Melvin Udall, a selfish, mean-spirited obsessive-compulsive who melts for a noble single mother named Carol (Helen Hunt). For an hour, writer-director James L. Brooks generously allows the actors to take risks with their characters, and the film gracefully glides between modest human comedy and affecting drama. However, Nicholson and Hunt don't match up, and once they hit the road with starving-artist Greg Kinnear, Brooks struggles to find a suitable tone. He doesn't succeed, partly because we're left asking why Carol should settle for such a caustic jerk.Look closely, and you'll also notice that Brooks treats Melvin more like a traveling sideshow than as a person (his anti-gay tirades are almost delightful character quirks). To Brooks, Melvin's acrimony isn't just benign, it's endearing. AS GOOD AS IT GETS is an insubstantial put-on, a sincere fakery of "human relationships." Yet Nicholson, in a teasingly churlish and amusing performance, misbehaves mightily. His eyes widen simply at the prospect of verbal combat.ERIC BELTMANN</fullReview>

Greg Kinner in my opinion was the surprise also he was wonderful and deserved his Best Supporting Actor Nomination.Now one thing I was puzzled with was Helen Hunt she was good however her character (Carol)was almost like Jamie (her character from Mad About You) and the hand motions and it just seemed that it wasn't the stretch that would give her an Oscar for. But that is my opinion.In closing this movie was a wonderful movie and Jack Nicholson is outstanding I can't really remember a movie he was bad in I mean he was wonderful in Mars Attacks!, Ironweed, A Few Good Men (YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!), Terms of Enderment, REDS, One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, can go on and on!

		<shortDescription>A comedy from the heart that goes for the throat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, and Cuba Gooding Jr. star in this James L. Brooks hit comedy, AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive novelist with Manhattan's meanest mouth. But when his neighbor Simon is hospitalized, Melvin is forced to babysit Simon's dog. And that unexpected act of kindness- along with waitress Carol Connelly- helps put Melvin back in the human race.It's refreshing to see that has faith in the fact that real people in real situations are interesting after all not some empty headed special effects films. Jack Nicholson turns in his best work since Cuckoo's Nest and Helen Hunt is also great.This film is just about as good as it gets</fullReview>

You better wait for Titanic II (if they will be able to make SUCH scenario).For others I say: may be As Good As It Gets is not the best movie of 1997 - I didn't watch all of them yet - but it is a perfect picture of perfect director with perfect actors, scenario, dialogues, humor and everything. And believe me, its Oscars are not such doubtful as Titanic's ones.Thanks to all who made this movie. I had a lot of fun and pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 hours and 18 minutes seems a little bit long for a movie which was essentially nothing more than an excuse for a few very good actors to deliver a few very good lines. Most of what you can get in terms of entertainment value out of this movie could be gained from watching the highlights of the best quotes.All of the actors did extremely well with their roles, and deserved their awards and nominations, and the screenplay had a lot of good lines but could have used a bit more plot. I enjoyed this movie as I watched it but had a sour taste in my mouth after it was over. This is a pretty good movie, but not as good as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought As Good As It Gets was the best film of 1997. It was smart, funny, and wonderful. Nicholson was great and definitely deserved that oscar, Hunt maybe could have done better but was very good, but the one who I thought stole the show was Greg Kinnear. He put on a performance that really wowed me considering his past films (A Smile Like Yours, Dear God, Sabrina). This touching and heartwarming film was definitely better than Titanic, and perhaps better than Good Will Hunting. Kinnear deserved the oscar, Reynolds , not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quirky and Complex Exercise in Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was very difficult to sit down and enjoy this film, in spite of the fact that I've enjoyed other films by each of the stars.The viewer is required to spend so much time paying attention to all the details in the hopes of getting a handle on the storyline, that I never quite cared if the characters in the film did anything, much less shared romantic or insightful moments.Credit must go to Helen Hunt, Jack Nicholson, and Greg Kinnear, since their performances were very good. But that's just it, they were so busy trying to act their parts, that they weren't given the chance to convey their character to the audience in depth.I myself don't enjoy movies that are merely demonstrations of acting ability, so I did not enjoy this film all that much. Like many films, it had its moments that I liked, but they were few and far between.Much too quirky for my taste, and I liked Michael (1996)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Several years ago, my wife watched "As Good As It Gets" and she told me she didn't like the film. So, I avoided it for years....and now I wish I hadn't listened to her. I loved the film---just don't tell her I said so! The film, to me, was perhaps a bit different experience than it would have been for the average viewer. As a former psychotherapist, I kept trying to analyze Jack Nicholson's character in order to understand the story better. He appeared to either have a variety of personality disorders--including an avoidant personality (where he pretends to HATE everyone and pushes them away to avoid being hurt), an obsessive-compulsive personality (or perhaps an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and probably a nice dose of either Asperger's or was just socially retarded. Regardless, this sort of person would NORMALLY live a very solitary and sad existence. However, the film manages to make it seem believable that a man like this could change...some...as well as find love. It's all very improbable but also very charming and sweet. And, later in the film rather oddly romantic. Additionally, the film is, at times, rather funny. Overall, a quirky and well-written film with some terrific acting.A lot of other stuff has been written about this multi-Oscar-winning film....so I'll just end by saying my wife is 100% wrong...but I still think she's terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed anyone could rate this movie below an 8, and from what I have read, those that have, wow, clueless to the highest levels.For those that review poorly, how often do you watch movies? Are we all to believe the Academy, which bestowed 7 academy award nominations for this film, have NO idea what they are talking about. Are we to believe the 8 star rating, out of 475 reviews, that 20% of the votes are the correct votes? Some of the reasons behind why this film is supposedly poor is HILARIOUS! Lets review a couple of the reasons..One guy writes.. Do you really think Helen Hunts boss would let her talk to customers for long periods of time? Answer: Yes.. Why? Because Jack Nicholson's character may have saved her sons life. I am pretty sure the manager could let her spare a little time to say thank you, and frankly, she doesn't spend that much time with him anyway. Someone else writes.. Jack gets kicked out and asked to leave, then he is back minutes later.. Answer: Well, it is NOT minutes later, and, again, I am quite certain Helen explained to her boss, hey, this guy helped save my son's life (He ain't that bad) and they give him another shot.. Do you people watch movies? It doesn't get better in the acting world. You are telling me you couldn't get that vibe that helen was loved in her restaurant? And, the best of all, people that wrote this movie is not funny? what?? I know from never even meeting these people, these are the people that only find movies like "Monty Pyton" and "Ace Ventura" movies hilarious. Any type of comedy that requires some thinking and they are long gone.Trust me folks, this is one of the best movies of the 90's, never mind 1997. Check it out for stunning acting...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that is driven by characters and thankfully the actors and actresses in this film do a good job so it makes for a nice comedy/drama film. Though I would say it is a bit more comedy than drama. It is also a film with more than a couple of uncomfortable scenes within it. You know the type of scene, the one that just makes you feel like turning the channel. The film's plot is basically a man with ocd and is a writer is doing his thing when he eventually gets called on acting a bit of an arrogant uncaring guy all the time. He gets forced a bit to watch his gay neighbor's dog though he can not stand the dog and he is forced to deal with the fact the waitress he has to have at a local restaurant has a son who is sick and in need of medical attention and she is not able to work at her job at times thanks to this. Though a funny thing happens, he starts to actually become attached to the dog and he does things that are not like the persona he shows the world. The movie is very good as Jack Nicholson is very great as Melvin, the man with the ocd. Greg Kinnear is also very good in his role as is Helen Hunt and Cuba Gooding Jr. It is interesting to see how Melvin changes throughout the film and the film ends perfectly as it does so simply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackson can't beat Udall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most films are weakened by questionable dialogue but redeemed by a great premise or resolution. James L. Brooks' 'As Good as It Gets' is quite the reverse: the dialogue is fantastic, but the audience can't buy into the premise for one second. I know, this has been reviewed to death, but I just saw it again when I was home last month and had to laugh all over. Nicholson should get an award for just standing still! His expressions in this movie are priceless. His interaction with Helen Hunt (who may well be one of the best actresses around) make this movie not only believable but also heart warming.Jack Nicholson, in one of his career's best roles, plays Melvin Udall, an obsessive compulsive romance writer who is a regular at the restaurant where Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) works. He insists that she always be his waitress, and she obliges-----not because she likes him, but because... well, the guy is crazy...Throw in Greg Kinnear in an outstanding performance as a gay artist, living within an inch of poverty and Cuba Gooding, Jr., his promoter. And let's not forget his dog! Kinnear makes the mistake of picking the wrong person for a model and gets mugged - badly - is hospitalized, beaten, broken and penniless. While he is laid up in the hospital who gets stuck with the dog but Nicholson - the last person in the world you should ever give a dog to! Love prevails, the dog wins out in the end. Nicholson is hooked and not only that, finds the dog gets him some brownie points with the ladies.1997 was a year that left film-goers a trifle loopy-headed-----Titanic was at the forefront of everybody's mind, and resultantly good art was washed out-----this is the only possible explanation for As Good as It Gets' snafuing Best Picture nomination. Nicholson and Hunt's Best Actor/Actress awards were, however, well-deserved. Despite Udall's snarky and bitter nature, Nicholson provides him with a humanity and resonance that few actors could. Greg Kinnear's prominence has risen since 1997, but his strengths still show here in his role as Simon the Gay Neighbor.However critics panned this movie for being totally unbelievable. I would have to agree-why would Carol fall for Melvin? Why does Melvin change his ways after so many years of acid-tongued insults? I don't know. I know people who disliked the film because Melvin was such a you-know-what. Personally, I love the evil retorts he hurls at any innocent bystander. Maybe it's a sick pleasure, but Nicholson's delivery is perfect and I couldn't help but laugh as he takes on everyone.The film does have its dull moments, but Jack's one-of-a-kind performance makes it all worthwhile. There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could've played Melvin better than him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanity in New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humanity in New York. Who would have thought! Such is the focus however, of James L. Brooks' new feature "As Good as it Gets" (co-scripted with story writer Mark Andrus).The plot involves three very ordinary people who are fighting the battle, against the world and themselves (mostly the latter), to get through a day at a time. Brooks and Andrus bring the three characters together, meticulously and lovingly moulding them into real people. It is this intricate, involved writing that makes the film so easy to relate to.Breathing wonderful life into these players are Jack Nicholson, in a typically superb, larger than life characterisation that is sure to win him a swag of awards; Helen Hunt, who probably looked to this role as her big chance to be taken seriously (and on this strong showing I think it's high time we did); and Greg Kinnear, whose own emotionally charged performance is a strong point of the film. Excellent in support are Shirley Knight as Hunt's incredibly dedicated mom and Cuba Gooding Jr as Kinnear's equally committed art dealer, Frank. Look out too for a pint-sized scene-stealer named "Verdell".Brooks ties it all up as only he can, presenting with characters that, though ranging from mildly irritating to severely annoying, you won't be able to resist.Saturday, March 7, 1998 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema</fullReview>

Helen hunt has done a great job. She really got into her character. Jack Nicholson as usual never, never disappoint. He's the man. The perfection in the character. He has given no chance of doubting him. No one, and I mean no one would have best suited for the role. Whenever he disappears from the screen you then wait for him to return as soon as possible. I did not get enough of him. That's why I said the movie was not long enough. And how could anyone forget Greg Kinnear the supporting man. He was also I thought best suited for the role. He has not overacted or anything like that as a gay. He knows what he's doing no doubt about that. And of course Cuba Gooding Jr. A small part but done with of course greatness. Three Oscar winners and an Oscar nominee what do you expect? Just watch the movie.</fullReview>

Nicholson is at his best at playing likable unlikable Melvin. Helen Hunt shines in the role of Carol. Also Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. support the fantastic movie."As Good as It Gets" is not a story of a neurotic person. It is a story of a human being who just want to be heard and understand. Through the character of Carol Melvin finds himself bewildered and wanting to change his ways just a bit.

		<shortDescription>One of Nicholson's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall for The Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while co-writer-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if this is as good as it gets?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'What if this is as good as it gets?' So asks Melvin Udall, a selfish, rude, and very OCD romance novel author. He spends his day doing exactly as he pleases, not caring in the least about others feelings or opinions. Except for maybe Carol Connelly, the waitress at the diner he attends every morning.Wonderfully realized and perfectly acted characters are the basis of 'As Good as it Gets', a brilliant and heartwarming comedy. Jack Nicholson captures the character of Melvin both hilariously and heartbreakingly, often at the same time. Helen Hunt masterfully relates the many different layers of Carol, giving one of the most realistic performances I think I've ever seen on screen. And then there's Greg Kinnear, in one of his best roles, as Melvin's gay neighbor who becomes his friend. The only person I didn't care for was Cuba Gooding Jr. His overacting felt out of place and annoying amongst these other masters at work.'As Good as it Gets' is all too often pushed aside as just a silly romantic comedy, but it's so much more. Melvin and Carol relate to each other in a moving and amazing way. He is selfish and rude, so much that she can scarcely stand to be around him for an entire evening. Yet in the same moments they are clearly soul mates intended only for one another. She is the only one who can put up with him, and he sees in her a beauty that words can't really describe. There are moments when you'll love Melvin and see the wonderful human being inside-yet seconds later he'll destroy that feeling by his stinging words. Yet Carol can put up with him. Carol can forgive him. Carol can love him.Much like their relationship the movie is hard to describe in words. See the movie. You'll understand a little better then. All I can say is that if this IS as good as it gets, then I'm happy. An hilarious and heartwarming film. 8/10 stars! Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melvin Udall and Carol Connelly's story deserves its classic--status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melodramatic compact comedy, by a director who knows his job, a honest craftsman. Sometimes it's slapdash, sometimes it's sharp; the impression, however, it's that the sharp side prevails.As Good as It Gets (1997)'s place is probably best defined by Nicholson's very obvious pleasure in playing this role.Nicholson's robustness and bold vitality are simply unmatched. And they are favored by the rather smooth comic of this film (for a counterexample, you might want to see his Anger Management, a very good comedy in its own kind, but nonetheless pedestrian, raw and barbarian).Three things about Mrs. Helen Hunt:she is extremely sexy; she performs exquisitely; and she looks delicious, incredibly well. Yet she is obviously limited?her character, as a matter of fact, IS obviously limited?as it should indeed be?she is here a waitress?while Nicholson isn't. There are Nicholson's wonderfully adequate inventions that enhance the film's interest. And his character suits him very well. I mean, this director needed indeed Nicholson for such a role.The script could be better; yet some lines are remarkable. On the other hand, this film was quite unpredictable for me. The story was nicely handled, and there is a fine feel of intelligence and keenness.Two more things:Shirley Knight does a very amusing role (she is good in "Desperate Housewives" as well);James L. Brooks is the director of another Nicholson cult--film:Terms of Endearment (1983).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film delighted on first viewing and has continued to do so every time I watch it (which is frequently!!). It has so much that is perfectly done, so where to start. There are three strands running throughout and three 'leads' in each story. The main line and that which is most interesting is Nicholson's character ? a writer with so many 'nervous ticks' phobias and prejudices both great and minor that they would make a pretty good film just on their own. Nicholson play's them for all he's worth which is considerable. Typical Nicholson but at his very best! The film is really about the blossoming of this Nicholson character goaded and teased in to becoming a 'human being' mostly by Helen Hunt (in her best performance ever for me) and to a lesser extent by Greg Kinnear (also acting at the top of his game). All three stories run concurrently and overlap throughout but each is fascinating and compelling in it's own right. Many things amaze about the film; just as each story can stand and make sense on it's own so each scene stands in own right and is a perfect and complete whole worth watching and thinking about. I'd like to end by paying tribute to the script that is enormously funny and so good that one nowhere finds an inappropriate or uncharacteristic word or phrase. All fits like a glove and of the hundreds of marvellous one liners here's two "?come in and try not to ruin everything by being yourself" and "The best thing you've got going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself" Try and see this movie if you haven't already done so.

James L Brooks has this habit of churning out hit after hit, and this film is no exception. Even though this movie is 10 years old, it still manages to successfully retain that feel good factor and it looks as if it hasn't dated whatsoever. The story revolves around writer Marvin Udall- an OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)sufferer and his attempts at becoming a better person and human being. at first, he is moody, aggressive, impatient, irritated and annoyed and often makes sarcastic remarks in the expense of other people. as the film progresses, Marvin changes as a person overnight and thus, these changes are ultimately as a result of the experiences and difficulties as encountered, shared and faced by Carol (Hunt) and Simon (Kinnear). Carol is a single mother, who lives with her mother and works as a waitress and of whom has to contend with looking after and caring for her sick son; Simon meanwhile is a gay guy who earns his living as an artist. However, his life changes completely after an incident where he is set upon and is physically beaten to a pulp by a bunch of vandals. Eventually,and in one point in the film, he ends up in a wheelchair and realises that his life is not going to get any better; however, when Marvin realises the errors of his ways after he taunts Simon and he, tries to hit back in retaliation, the events which follow afterwards lead to Marvin realising the importance of the good things that he has in his life.And that it is because of these two individuals in Simon and Carol, that they remind him that all the good one does, does indeed prevail over the bad in life. This is an excellent film that has a positive moral message running through it and that while it remains a comedy, the sentimentality is not too syrupy and not too sickly sweet, and yet at the same time, it is not underplayed in contrast to other romantic comedies throughout. It has the right balance of happy and sad moments, to a extent to which it is at an equal level playing field and keeps the story flowing nicely . Therefore, As good as it gets is arguably one of the best romantic comedies to have ever existed, period. It is absolutely pure magic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilariously touching movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really that interested in seeing this film when it first came out. I was 14 years old and not really that bothered about watching Jack Nicholson insult people and romance Helen Hunt. That was my immature and deluded opinion about this film ten years ago. Now I'm a big fan of Jack and I first watched this film three years ago. I have to say, I loved it! What I loved about this film is that it wasn't like all the other romantic comedies you watch. Boy meets girl, they like each other, they pretend not to, they go with other people, mishaps occur, and then finally they realise they're made for each other, and you see them kissing and hugging with the romantic city backdrop. This was different. That's why it's my favourite.Nicholson deservedly won the Oscar for his role as Melvin Udall, a writer of female romantic fiction who happens to suffer from OCD. In the extreme sense. I didn't think that in watching a film about someone with this undeniably serious complaint that I could find it so hilarious in places! The way in which he insults people wherever he goes and is obsessed with being clean and not standing too close to people just cracked me up! Helen Hunt (again a well-deserved Oscar for her-and being in the same year as Kate Winslet for Titanic, that was a tough choice for me) was wonderful as Carol Connelly, a waitress in the restaurant Melvin eats breakfast at, who is used to the way Melvin treats people and more than holds her own against him.Despite the 26-year-age difference, Nicholson and Hunt make an explosive pairing, the chemistry sizzled, and she proved she was more than a match for Nicholson in this film. The way in which her body language and dialogue conveyed that she both despised and felt compassion for this man was excellently conveyed by Hunt. I wasn't too surprised that romance blossomed for them despite everything, although many people may think it's too hard to believe for Carol to fall for Melvin, I was actually really pleased they got together, and the speech Melvin gives to Carol at the end had me moved to tears.Greg Kinnear is fantastic as the gay neighbour Simon. His little-boy-lost face when he realises he has been conned by burglars, and also when he realises his little dog prefers Melvin to him is brilliant-and I have to rewind that scene in which he says, 'You don't like ANYTHING, Mr. Udall.' and then turns and flounces back to his apartment in a completely feminine way. It cracks me up. Lots of little, subtle moments that make this movie special.I truly believe that Nicholson and Hunt were made for these roles, the film just would not have worked with two other actors. 'As Good As it Gets' is quite possibly the best romantic comedy since Sleepless in Seattle, and I give it eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Good As It Gets is a tremendous film. It has what all good films need, lots of memorable moments. I was reviewing the movie's memorable quotes provided by IMDb. Each one made me smile. Each one confirmed that great writing and great acting will never go unnoticed. The sheer number of noteworthy scenes gave me reason to pause and appreciate just how magnificent this film is.The film is about three characters; an OCD romance writer, a struggling waitress with a sick child and an out of work gay artist. All of these characters are flawed (that should be obvious). But that is what brings them together. Their problems compel us to watch. Some of their problems are self inflicted. Others are not. With some, there is a grey area. Their problems add to the humor; especially with Jack Nicholson's character. Their flaws make them unique characters in American cinema. While this collection of personalities might seem absurd, great movies not only make it work, but thrive.It helps to have great actors and great writing. Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear combine comedy and drama flawlessly. The rapore the three actors have is rare in movies. I was particularly impressed with Hunt and Kinnear. Both were relative newcomers to the big screen at the time of As Good As It Gets. But they were flawless and, paired with an icon like 'Jack', seemed to know exactly how to bring the most out of each scene.James L. Brooks has a history of great work, mostly as a writer. His greatest claims are probably the Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Simpson, two of the most successful television programs of all time. The writing in those shows is, at times, borderline genius. The quick wit and seamless flow are evident in As Good As It Gets. The dialog is quick paced, yet simple. We don't have to concentrate too hard, but we still grasp the subtle phrasing that makes this film special. Not a word seems forced or out of place. The delivery is perfect. This film is a well oiled machine; a Porsche.As Good As It Gets is a smart comedy. It does not insult our intelligence by making the comic scenes stand out. It doesn't go out of its way to say "you should laugh here". The funny moments do not surprise us; we laugh and then cannot fully appreciate the scene again. Most slapstick comedies are like that. As Good As It Gets makes us laugh because a well crafted line or exchange strikes us funny. It may not strike everyone, but most.There are enough serious moments to keep the film honest. Life is not all roses. Good comedies do not pummel us with one funny scene after another. We need to see something real; a sick child, an artist struggling to get by and failing. Make no mistake; this is a funny, funny movie. But it majestically takes us from funny to serious moments at the drop of a hat. It ads tension when needed, and then takes it away with a sly witty reply. Great comedies do that. Great movies transcend genre. They appeal to all audiences; to all types of people. As Good As It Gets is one of those movies.</fullReview>

It was a very unusual relationship between the characters, but with the excellent script, they worked well. I will watch this movie again, when I have time. Jack Nichols has one of them "lived in" faces, which makes it unbelievable that he actually chills out a bit, sometimes he does look a bit grumpy. I think thats all I can say. A+.

Jack Nicholson shows the talent that we all know is there and he does it without trying.. love ya Jack.

		<fullReview>There is no need to go into excessive or extensive detail here. Previous commentators have done that. I shall simply give my overall impression of this film. I was soon hooked, though. Once into it I began to care about these people, even the essentially bland character played by Greg Kinnear. Neither can disappear into the part as others can. I was always conscious that Nichlson and Hunt are Nicholson and Hunt.With his gruff visage and patented grumpiness and her quirky unconventional beauty, one always is aware of their identity. They play well against each other and well deserved their Academy Awards.Though I did not see this in a theatre, that is hardly necessary. (This is not Lawrence of Arabia.) I watched the edited for TV version, which doesn not diminish it in the intimate and close locations in which it is set, of which most are interior shots. Though set in New York, in this case, the setting is immaterial; unlike some other films (Barefoot in the Park, Klute, nd others), the New York sensibility is not needed.Though the language is somewhat explicit and coarse, it is milder than what can be heard on The Shield and in recent years on Law and Order. In Jakc Nicholson's case it is right in character.So enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Intelligent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"As Good as It Gets" is one of those really intelligent movies. It's light-hearted without being too much to take, and it has its dose of "reality for a Friday night". Jack Nicholson the obsessive romance writer, Melvin Udall, who lives in an up-scale Manhattan apartment across the hall from a gay artist, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) and his adorable dog, Verdell. Simon is beaten up by robbers, and Melvin, the pessimistic, bitter, complaining, obsessive-compulsive, and prejudicial shut-in, has Simon's dog forced on him, while Simon's still in the hospital. Melvin grows affectionate towards the dog, and the good in him begins to leak out. The story also centralizes around Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), a waitress at Melvin's only restaurant and who has a chronically sick child, Spencer. The story continues with the three of them traveling together to Simon's parents' house in the south of Baltimore. Melvin almost wins Carol over, but blows it. They come back to New York after the trip with Simon feeling a new sense of hope in his life, as well as Carol. The movie doesn't end there, but I don't want to give away the ending. I will say this, however. Melvin really is a good man on the inside, despite all of his short comings and sardonic remarks. The story is about finding yourself and love in your adulthood, and coming to terms with it. The only grievance I had with the movie was that it kind of went on for too long, but it's definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant comedy-drama with amazing performances by Jack Nicholson, Greg Kinnear and Helen Hunt. Jack Nicholson plays Melvin, a obsessive-compulsive writer who just can't stand his gay neighbour and all his "queer-friends" (as he likes to call them). Furthermore he hates his neighbour's little dog, who likes to p*ss all over the hallway. Then there's Carol, one of the waitress at the restaurant where Melvin is a regular customer. Due to his obsessive-compulsive condition, Melvin likes to be served by the same waitress. But because Carol's son is very ill, she quits her job at the restaurant (for a while). At least, that was the plan...So far the story of "As Good As It Gets". The acting is without any doubt very subtle and wonderful. Jack Nicholson is brilliant. He's wonderful in every scene he's in, as well as Greg Kinnear. Helen Hunt was very good as well, but I'd rather liked Helena Bonham Carter to win the Academy Award. I'm a huge fan of her, but of course these are just some personal reasons. Hunt gave an outstanding performance. Although I was very surprised with Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance in "Jerry Maguire", I had the impression that he was overacting a little at the beginning of "As Good As It Gets"...Furthermore I can tell you that there are many beautiful and funny scenes in this movie. For example the scene where Melvin is playing the piano and singing "Always look at the bright sight of life"! You should just see his face when he's singing! Brilliant! There's also the scene where Helen Hunt forces Jack Nicholson to give her a compliment. After a while Melvin finally says that line that is one of the most touching lines I've ever heard in a movie: "You make me want to be a better man." Truly an amazing movie! 9/10</fullReview>

Via this film, I fell in love in Helen Hunt (I wish I met her some day!). Her ability to show various feelings without words is excellent (and heart-breaking). Also Nicholson does his body language in a way only a master can do. Those two great actors had a good balance (too often one superior actor/ actress steals all attention). The happy end was not a surprise, but it was created with a sensitive way not having too much of sugar and sentimentality.

		<fullReview>There are few films that manage to be sweet and emotional without becoming cheesy and the Made-For-TV stuff. This one makes it though to become a heart felt movie with great acting (Obviously Jack but also Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jnr.) and excellent writing. Jack plays Melvin Udall, an author with obsessive compulsive disorder. In his local coffee shop, he shares a relationship with his waitress Carol (Helen Hunt). At home, Carol has a sick son and a neurotic mother. At Jack's home, he is always getting disturbed by his gay neighbor Simon and annoying dog Verdell. However, one day, Simon finds himself in hospital after being badly beaten. Melvin reluctantly agrees to look after the dog while Simon recovers and finds himself developing a relationship with not only Verdell the Dog but his waitress Carol. Eventually, these three find themselves going on a road trip together. Of course, it's hard to exactly explain this plot since there is so much stuff going on but once you'll see it, you'll understand just what a brilliant film it is. Oscar Winners Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Cuba Gooding Jnr give amazing performances but Greg Kinnear is a stand out here as homosexual neighbor Simon. The acting in this film is amazing. There's not enough good stuff to say about it. Better yet, the writing and directing is excellent. Fresh, witty writing and great directing makes a very good combination proving that there are some good films these days. -Critic-Guy</fullReview>

The performances of Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt turned just great the chemistry between the two was the best ever, both Oscar winners that were well deserved. I have to hand it to Jack time after time he proves he can take on characters with the most complex and odd behaviors just plain out crazy people. Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as writer Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive with one of Manhattan's meanest tempers. Melvin is to be helped along after his gay neighbor Simon (Greg Kinnear) is hospitalized and more unexpected kindness-comes along with waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) who helps put Melvin back in the human race. This film as you see in the end and really the whole time that a male and female relationship can be based on friendship and not sex and romance. It is the things we do for others that helps and makes our world seem better. Remember a friendship is important no matter what the age of a person or who they are. This is much the way the relationship of the characters of Jack and Helen can be described. Jack Nicholson also continues to get better with age his performance in this movie is a knockout! As Good As It Gets is a classic movie to watch just to feel important and see the great Jack at work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie truly is "As Good As It Gets"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie truly is "As Good As It Gets". Outstanding acting, bizarre, yet amazing plot, this movie has got it all! Jack Nicholson plays a marvelous role as Melvin Udall, a seemingly cruel, middle-aged man, who is a successful romantic storywriter. Melvin is extremely rude to his neighbours, especially to his gay neighbour Simon Bishop, played by Greg Kinnear. Greg is a remarkable actor in this film. In fact, Greg was nominated for best supporting actor, along with Nicholson for best actor and Helen Hunt for best actress. The film was nominated for best picture and best screenplay for the 1997 Academy Awards. Greg plays the role of a gay artist who is mugged while working in his home studio. During his recuperation he has to leave his dog in the hands of his spiteful neighbour. In Simon's absence an unlikely friendship grows between Melvin and his neighbour's dog. The story unfolds to show that this uncaring man can indeed have feelings for another being, in this case the dog. You also see that Melvin has feelings for someone other than the dog. He has a daily routine of going to a restaurant. He orders the same meal by the same waitress everyday. One day the waitress, Carol Connelly, played by Helen Hunt, misses work because of her son's illness. Melvin refuses to eat until Carol returns to work. He can't live out his daily routine without Carol. He finds that he needs her. He pays for a home doctor for Carol's son to get Carol back at work. But this only scares her. Eventually they all learn to love one another. The directing in this movie was reasonable. The director was James L. Brooks. This movie is a bit better than other movie that he has directed, such as I'll Do Anything (1994), Broadcast News (1987) and Terms of Endearment (1983). The plot of this movie is interesting. It is believable, but not likely to happen. As Good As It Gets is an original film. No film I know is similar to it at all. I doubt there is any chance of any sequel to this movie. The sound in the movie isn't really noticeable in the film. However, perhaps that is fine. If the sound were out of place, possibly it would have been more noticeable. That would be unpleasant. One sequence in this film that struck me as outstanding was when Nicholson went to the doctor for help. He had what is called obsessive-compulsive disorder. The doctor refuses to help him because he made no appointment. On his way out he passes through the waiting room. He stops and turns to everyone and say "Have you ever thought what if this is as good as it gets?" I figure that was a turning point in his life. He realizes that life might not get any better and he should live it to its fullest. The photography and camera angles contributed to this scene to make it perfect. The movie was filmed in California, Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York. It was noticeable that the movie was filmed in New York, because the location on scenes looked like New York. One scene in the movie had exceptional make-up. The scene where you see Melvin's neighbour Greg in the hospital after he is mugged. He is so bruised up. It looked so real. In the movie when Nicholson was walking on the sidewalk he would always make sure he didn't step on the cracks. This was because of his obsessive-compulsive disorder. He did this every time he went out. Eventually after taking his neighbour's dog out with him the dog started to do the same. This is considered a stunt. The stunt crew created a thin string fence above each crack in the sidewalk. The string fence was not visible to the viewer, but the dog would have to step over the string when walking over a crack. However nothing that occurred was that dangerous to warrant a major stunt scene. The editing in this movie was done fairly well. There are no noticeable mistakes. I'm sure special effects were used, but none were obvious in the movie. As Good As It Gets was produced and directed by James L. Brooks. Tristar Pictures financed and distributed the film. The film was successful.As Good As It Gets is a good comedy, has a good love story and great acting. It is not that much of a convincing movie, however it has wonderful writing and acting. It's a movie I would recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"As Good as it Gets" shows that comedies can have something more than laughs and silliness.Jack Nicholson (playing Melvin Udall, a very unusual man) and Helen Hunt (playing Carol, a very nice waitress and an ordinary person) really deserved the Oscar. I've already known that Nicholson was a great actor, but Helen surprised me. She's a wonderful and graceful actress; one of my favorite ones. Her character has the gift to change the life of a cold and boring man like Melvin. I think Greg Kinnear should have won the Oscar (he's much more better than Robin Williams).I can compare "As Good as it Gets" with another great comedy released recently - "Notting Hill". They both show you the disabilities and the joy of ordinary people (even if he is a maniac man, like Melvin Udall, or the most famous movie star, like Anna Scott - Julia Roberts - in "Notting Hill").I think this film wouldn't be very good with other actors, but it's a very human comedy and it had the attention it deserved.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie the first time I saw it because of Nicholson's performance. But the more and more I see it the less I think of it. Helen Hunt's character really is a flawed human being... she represents all the ideals of modern women, bossy, irresponsible and opinionated. Why she got an Oscar for this I know not. The movie certainly is not "as good as it gets". It actually is a drag. None of the characters have significant redeeming qualities other than Nicholson whose brutal honesty often gets him in trouble with the weak socially corrupt characters he is surrounded with. Really, if taken as a satire on American society it has some value as the citified corrupt characters who live in a world of lies, irresponsibility, and deceit soon find out... Kudus to the building manager.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a Romantic Comedy, this is As Good as It Gets!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Good as it Gets is a fabulous Romantic Comedy that is refreshingly original and delightful to watch. Jack Nicholson's abrasive but endearingly hilarious portrayal of Melvin Udall is wonderful, and his great, yet oddball type chemistry with Helen Hunt is one of the main reasons this movie works so well. I laughed very hard when Jack Nicholson would crack on Greg Kinnear's character, and make fun of him for his gay beliefs, or get jealous when he saw Helen Hunt hanging around Greg. My main problem with many of the romance movies now a days, they are all too predictable and they are basically the same old thing, with just a different storyline. As Good as It Gets refreshingly changes that trend with its creativity. The ending to this movie was one of my favorite things about this, it was just so cute and so cool to see something done so different, yet very romantic at the same time.Performances. Jack Nicholson is a revelation as Melvin. His grumpy Schitick is just a joy to watch in every way, and proves he can even do Romance well!. Helen Hunt is excellent as the love interest. Her vulnerable yet sassy show often captivated me, and her chemistry with Nicholson was consistently on the ball. Greg Kinnear is not a favorite of mine what so ever, but he did terrific here as the gay man. His whiny, yet wonderfully funny performance was great, I especially enjoyed his scenes with Nicholson. Cuba Gooding Jr. is great in support.Bottom line. As Good as It Gets deserves the recognition it gets, as it's truly a great romantic film. Hollywood needs to look at this movie more, and see what it takes to make a good Romantic Comedy. Highly recommended.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is described as a comedy that comes from the heart that goes straight for the throat,As Good as it Gets has it all.The film boasts a great storyline as well as fine directing from James L.Brooks.Another great thing about the film was the casting which was great for the film having actors such as Jack Nicholson,HelenHunt,Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Junior being part of the film.Jack Nicholson stars as an obsessive compulsive romance novelist by the name of Melvin Udall who doesn't appear very friendly.But after one of his neighbours,Simon Bishop(Greg Kinnear)is hospitalized,Melvin develops an act of kindness.Because of the obsessive compulsive disorder,Melvin maintains a daily schedule of events such as sitting on the same table at the same restaurant much to the chagrin of Carol Connelly(Helen Hunt).The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor-Jack Nicholson and Best Actress-Helen Hunt as well as being nominated for Best Supporting Actor-Greg Kinnear,Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.Overall,this film is As Good as it Gets!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven dramedy with overrated performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I find this film absurdly overrated. Another of director James L. Brooks' "dramedies" the result achieves no where near the success of Terms of Endearment nor even the middling charms of Broadcast News. Obsessive-compulsive author Jack Nicholson goes into a panic attack when the one waitress (Helen Hunt) he can tolerate at his favorite restaurant is missing time due to her ill son. He gets involved in her personal life and develops romantic aspirations for her. Meanwhile, the gay artist next-door (Greg Kinnear) that Nicholson lives to belittle is beaten to a pulp. In dire straits, he asks Nicholson to accompany him on a road trip home to beg for support, and Nicholson agrees so long as he can make Hunt feel beholden to accompany them in an effort to further his tentative romantic impulses. Kinnear is likable and one cannot possibly become invested in a road trip which will logically lead to him humbling himself at the feet of people who have spurned him in the past (whether or not that actually happens is irrelevant, it still is the initial goal of the trip). The biggest problem with the film rests with the depiction of the Nicholson character and the central relationship with Hunt. He is intermittently funny with his caustic remarks, but he targets everyone indiscriminately. Cutting humor can be funny when it is puncturing holes in pompous characters a la The Marx Brothers, but far less so when it is used to figuratively eviscerate a fragile battered man. Although Nicholson does end up helping people, it is usually a by-product of his own selfishness. Further, a romantic relationship between Nicholson and Hunt as presented here is ridiculous. Not only is Nicholson old enough to be her father (an element which is not even commented upon), but they legitimately seem to have nothing in common other than her tolerance of him. Her last-minute change-of-heart at the conclusion seems ill-advised and one can easily see her changing her mind again 5 minutes after the conclusion. The fact that Nicholson and Hunt have non-existent screen chemistry apparently did not deter filmgoers and critics. Nicholson can be a great actor, but in the decade prior to About Schmidt he was largely coasting on his laurels and continually reverted to playing a glorified nut. He does so for the umpteenth time here and for some reason watching him do this yet again prompted an Oscar win. Perhaps conceivable in a weak year, but when his co-nominees included Peter Fonda, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Duvall, Matt Damon for Good Will Hunting, and strong contenders such as Leonardo DiCaprio and the male leads of L.A. Confidential were overlooked altogether, the win smacks of laziness. I am not a fan of Helen Hunt. I consider her to be the most mundane and uncharismatic of the modern crop of critically lauded actresses. She is an incredibly boring foil for Nicholson. She is believable as a put-upon waitress, but far less so as his romantic interest or as an unexpected muse for Kinnear's artistic resurgence. She inexplicably won an Oscar against the likes of Judi Dench, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham-Carter ? all having a banner year. Ironically, both of the leads are out-acted by the dog next door. Kinnear, stuck in the all too familiar nice sexless gay guy role, provides the film's only natural performance. An overlong, unevenly acted and conceived mishmash that fails to gel together into a satisfying whole.</fullReview>

Carol ( Hunt ) a waitress single mother longing for something to happen to her life , and Simon ( kinnear ) a gay artist who find companionship in a way he never thought he could.This film works in so many ways , a first date movie or a Saturday night movie , or even as a one liner hit comedy.All the main leads are aceptional hence all the Oscar nominations ( which Nicholson and Hunt won , Kinnear missed out only to Robin williams , which is no defeat at all ) .This is one of very few films where we all can relate to some sort of emotion shown in this movie , whether it be a sad or happy moment this film has it all.The directing and screenplay are second to none as we follow the characters with a keen eye and wonderment , as all these troubled storys interlock and develop. and the directing allows us to follow the changes in the characters feelings and look on life.This film is a superb piece of modern cinema , well worthy of its critical acclaim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is "as good as it gets!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't often that a movie comes around which is the pinnacle of American Cinema, but in the uncanny case of As food As It Gets just such an event has occurred. The movie tells the story of Melvin, a troubled but brilliant writer who has mental problems. He isn't retarded, mind you, these demons are all in his head, and they force him to perform silly rituals and wipe many times. This condition has turned him into a mean fellow, and it is honestly one of the toughest experiences in American Cinema to follow him around on his "mean errands." Because he is mean to EVERYBODY! There is a mixed-race (a black and white) gay couple, just as happy and loving as they can be, who live downstairs, and he is M-E-A-N mean to them, calling them adverse and down-putting names and such. It's hard to watch because people should be treated as they treat people, no matter how gay. The director shows this brilliantly, however! I won' t "spoil" what ensues, but let's just say Cuba Gooding Jr., the "man" of the two, really has the last "laugh" here! ROTFL! But it isn't only the gays to which this man is mean. Every day he has breakfast (one of his rituals) at the same quaint little bistro downtown, where Helen Hunt is his waitress. Oh boy is he mean to her! It's like she can't do anything right! She is trying to raise a family on a waitresses salary, for gosh sakes, and all he does is give her "lip." CAUTION SPOILER The food is bad, the forks are wrong, etc. After her husband gets run over, she is left alone to raise her son, who can't breathe. Enough to drive anybody "crazy!" And lo and behold, just when you're thinking "oh no he's not!" the director throws Jack Nicholson into this not-so brady bunch! At first there is hell to pay but gradually they teach him how to let go and love a little. Then a little more. Then an art student beats the crap out of the white gay guy, which is a set-back, but not for long. In the end?well, you'll just have to see it to understand what a wonderful job cast and crew have done to point out that if though we're all a little "crazy" we still need each other to get by! Ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson can do no wrong. The man is a veteran of the profession, and he is constantly giving a unique, dynamic personality to every character he portrays. And this film is no exception. It introduces us to some very deep, very real people, with real problems, and weaves them together in a series of events that build them up and bring them together. And through it all Nicholson retains his magic, delivering a superb portrayal of a man burdened with chronic obsessive-compulsive habits. It is a very effective film, and the acting is no less than one would expect from the likes of Nicholson and Helen Hunt. It's an honest, emotional, and often sad film with which you're bound to find yourself sympathizing. It's a strong story, strong cast, truly a dynamic film with an offbeat sense of humor that everyone is likely to enjoy. I strongly recommend you see this movie, whether with friends or family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think people with severe social deficiencies are amusing - perhaps you fell about laughing at "Rain Man" - then "As good as it gets" is just the movie for you.Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder is not funny,millions of people suffer from it in one form or another and I sincerely hope no decent and reasonable human being would dream of laughing at their symptoms. However,in the cinema,cloaked by anonymity and the herd instinct, audiences rolled in the aisles as Mr Jack Nicholson misused his considerable skills to caricature all the most obvious outward signs of this distressing illness.Shame on him. And shame on Mr Gregg Kinnear and Mr Cuba Gooding Jr for adding two more stereotypical gays to an already overcrowded field. Only Miss Helen Hunt escapes admonition in another role that could easily have slipped over into clich as the single mother. She is so good she doesn't deserve to be in this movie. I can see why the Academy liked "As good as it gets",it has three flashy performances heavily flavoured with the ham it delights to reward so regularly,the prestige of Mr Nicholson's name and the gold - plated production values of an Aaaron Spelling TV soap of the 1980s. But it is ultimately an empty vessel making a lot of noise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AS GOOD AS IT GETS, is a fine portrayal of a man, Melvin Udall (played marvelously by Jack Nicholson) with a debilitating condition that restricts his daily life and interactions. From the beginning of the movie we can tell that Melvin is somewhat off. He uses a brand new bar of soap every time he washes his hands, he wont step on cracks when walking down the street, he brings his own silverware to restaurants and he is obsessed with cleanliness. Also Melvin lacks any control over social grace and tact, such as being very self-entered and blurting out rude comments that most people would refrain from. He compulsively engages in these activities. He is bound to his daily routine, which include going to a certain restaurant, being waited on by a certain waitress Carol (played by Helen Hunt), and ordering the same meal. Melvin is a classic example of Obsessive Compulsive disorder, and it can even be argued that he also has an Obsessive Compulsive Personality disorder. The movie starts to take shape when his routine is disrupted when "his" waitress does not show up for work one day. You can see his agitation. He becomes very rude to the new waitress and rudely tells her to get Carol so he can eat his food and go along with his routine. Melvin attempts to contact Carol at her home and even pays for her sick son's medical treatment just so she can get back to work and Melvin can get his routine back. This behavior may seem extremely excessive for the normal person, but for Melvin this behavior is a necessity to satisfy his compulsion. Melvin has his moments of kindness that show a kinder more sensitive side, but for the most part Melvin comes off as a completely insensitive asshole, however even when he does come off this way you get a feeling that he really wants to be a nice guy, he just can't control his compulsions to act in a socially acceptable way. In one scene Melvin blurts out to Carol "I'm going to die, you're going to die, and by the sound of it your son is going to die pretty soon too." Now immediately after saying that Melvin knows that he has done it again (saying something inappropriate, even though he meant no harm), upon Carol's retort which was much less harsh that Melvin deserved, you can clearly see Melvin's anxiety from his remark and he immediately shuts up and promises Carol that he will never talk about her son again. Melvin is a perfectionist, it is immediately apparent when the inside of his apartment is shown. His place is immaculate, everything has its place and nothing is out of order, we get another glimpse of this when he is packing for a trip he is taking with his gay neighbor Simon (played by Greg Kinnear) Melvin has all his music planned out for different situations during the trip, and his bag is packed in an overbearing sense of orderliness. These characteristics that Melvin displays throughout the movie account for his diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive and probably a diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder.This movie has a comedic edge to a very real condition. I found the movie to be very entertaining and Jack Nicholson's performance hilarious. While Melvin's case seemed to get better upon beginning his relationship with Carol, most people's recovery is not that rapid some people do not respond that well to drugs at all, and in some cases people need to undergo brain surgery to correct their OCD condition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, i didn't know if I should put this film in my best of the year category, I liked it alot, but I wondered if Titanic would go over it. It didn't, so I put this film in, and well deserved. The film is directed by Oscar winning director James L. Brooks (of Terms of Endearment and The Simpsons TV show fame) and stars Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt (Nicholson won his third Oscar for this and Hunt won her first). The story follows a bitter old scrooge (Nicholson in his usual perfect self) who is also a romance novelist (his line "I think of a man, and I take a way reason and accountability" when describing writing women is classic), but through a series of events including a cute dog, a gay artist (Greg Kinnear is endearing in this role), and a waitress with some problems (Hunt), he becomes a little better. Conventional to be sure, but it is definately a winner in laughs and romance. That's comic veteran Harold Ramis as a doctor. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always loved this movie. It's a romantic comedy without too much of the sappy love stuff and an overload of the sarcastic, cynical, funny stuff. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as a victim of OCD and love. Every line he spits out is quotable. He's somehow charming and slimy at the same time. Every interaction he has with other characters just makes his character better. All of Melvin's interactions with Simon and Verdell are a riot. Melvin has a sweet spot with Verdell that he can't seem to have with any human, even Carol, and a critical nature towards Simon. He is so judgmental, but can't stand to have the tables turned on himself which is true to life. That's probably what I like most about this film- it's a true depiction of life, perhaps a bit dramatized, but life is never easy. People are never simple. We are all complex. We all have our OCD ticks and our sick kids, but somehow we all have other traits that make us bearable and necessary to the rest of the world. It gets better, because we can't always be low.

		<shortDescription>A comedy that will please every heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Good As It Gets is a truly magnificent feel-good comedy that through a detailed look on its three main characters is able to draw viewer's attention right from the very first moments. It's full not only of brilliantly clever laughable sequences, but also of so many realistic notions and situations, which can actually happen in anyone's life. From the creative mind of the great James L. Brooks comes a story that contains so many wonderful and unexpected twists, combining for an on-screen relationship that no one will ever suspect.Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is an obnoxious, pedantic, obsessive-compulsive (there are many other adjective that obviously come to mind about his persona) writer, who doesn't give a damn about nobody else's feelings but his. He leads a life of pure selfishness, devoid of any friends, lovers or partners. He loves to make fun of his homosexual neighbor and artist, Simon (Greg Kinnear), and his cute little doggy named Verdell. Already in the first scene he shovels this adorable puppy down the waste chute. Even though he knows that everybody actually hates him, the thought of it doesn't really concern him. Following his every day routine (the hilarious strolls around New York City, when he omits chewing gum on the pavement) he eats breakfast at a nearby diner, where he orders only through one particular waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt). And all those activities would probably never change, if it weren't for a few sudden events that took place and turned his peaceful life upside down. First of all, Simon is hospitalized after he becomes a victim of an unexpected assault and Melvin has to take care of his dog (discreetly forced by Simon's friend and art dealer Frank). Second of all, Carol has to stay in at home and look after her sick son that one day. When Melvin comes to the restaurant and sees that she isn't there, he is so frustrated and angry that?he arranges a private doctor and full medical care for Carol's son, just so she can get back to work and serve his meals. A bit eccentric, don't you think? On top of this Simon realizes that he doesn't have any more money and has to take a trip to his parents' home in order to ask them for a loan. And who would drive him there? His good old buddy Melvin. He also asks Carol to come along, and she does so feeling a bit indebted to him. And believe me, totally hilarious and surprising things happen as the three unlikely pals travel through the country in a fancy convertible. Melvin suddenly decides that he has to get a hold of his true feelings and maybe finally let them out. Carol realizes somewhere on the way that Melvin can be really cute when he tries to, so she might actually give him a chance after all. Simon finds his true calling once again, which ends up making Melvin a little jealous. And what finally comes out of this very interesting threesome accounts for many heartwarming laughs, which is what a great comedy should always be able to do.Jack Nicholson is simply brilliant. Even though he plays a really nasty character, his performance is exactly the opposite. One is able to find some deep emotions in this seemingly emotionless man. He plays this part in a fresh, convincing, and utterly enjoyable manner in every single scene. No one else would be more appropriate for that role.Helen Hunt in a Oscar-deserving role as a woman, who wants to get something for herself this one time, after all those years spent on looking after a son. She simply lets go of every problem that's been troubling her and goes with the flow to find a greater meaning in her peculiar bond with an older, but certainly handsome, man.Greg Kinnear is a hilarious addition to the group, with the very persuasive performance as a very gentle and subtle guy, who has to go through a series of bizarre adventures just to find a real sense in his art.All in all, As Good As It Gets is one of the finest comedies build up on an analysis of completely different character traits, which, when put together, combine for a fantastic and lively cinematic experience. Clever and joyful dialogues, well-structured story and the mesmerizing passion coming out of the remarkable cast merge beautifully to create a top-notch comedy that everyone should watch at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James L. Brooks' mammoth flop HOW DO YOU KNOW (2010) has again put his prestigious laurels of an Academy-winning director into a precipice, after his grotesquely mawkish SPANGLISH (2004), spanning his entire 30 years career, he has only directed 6 films so far, half of which are mediocre drosses (said two films plus I'LL DO ANYTHING 1994), lucky AS GOOD AS IT GETS is not among them, and has truly extracted the top form from its stars Oscar-winning stars and Verdell the little doggie. The "impossible pair" setting is always a most common yet compelling stunt in a rom-com, while usually male plays a dominant part, and female part takes some moral advantage to keep the balance as equally as possible to avoid any sexism accusations. So in this storyline, Jack Nicholson's unmarried compulsive writer resembles Shelton Cooper from THE BIG BANG THEORY, maybe we could divine Shelton's senior life like that, his own routine cannot be breached and he maintains nonchalant towards the people and happenings around him, Helen Hunt's single-mother waitress with an ailed kid, has the worst case scenario at hand, but clearly is the best woman in the planet with all the carefully-embellished merits, could be even the muse for the destitute artist, which can be a smart move to get approve from the most of the female demography. Then a third factor is Greg Kinnear's gay artist, which may seem to be the weakest among the trinity, but as the representative perspective from the minority group, his mayhem serves as a more evocative agent to be viewed as the rosy prospect of gay right even in today's time. The performances are marvelous, for Nicholson, maybe not his career-best, but suffices all the accolade he received for his wacky but arresting antics, and his third Oscar win is fairly acceptable; Hunt is on the other hand, adding more intimate revelation and vigor to her ostensibly soppy role, I have no grudge towards her win (but my pick is still Helena Bonham Carter from THE WINS OF THE DOVE 1997); then Kinnear, whose career-best has emerged too fast and a comeback seems to be a rather long shot now. Virtually all the achievements should be owed to its script, very resourceful and operative, as for the director work, Mr. Brooks' journeyman dexterity has no mistakes but surely is not a novelty in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is one of the best actors on the planet, that is pretty obvious. He has such a smart alec and creepy charisma to him that you really can't look away when he's on screen. The actor has done a variety of terrific performances, from Jack Gittes, to R.P. Mcmurphey, to Jack Torrence, to Warren Schmidt, to Frank Costello. But one of his best work came in 1997, when the actor won his third Oscar for As Good As It Gets.In this one, Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, a grouchy Manhanhattan-ite who just does not understand people. But that all sort of changes when his neighbor Simon(a terrific Greg Kinnear) is brutally beaten in his home, and Melvin is forced to take care of his dog. He also begins to change when he meets a nice waitress(Helen Hunt in her Oscar winning role) who has a sick son.As Good As It Gets is a wonderful romantic comedy. It's truly a one-of-a-kind. The dialogue is funny, and not just funny, painfully funny, and charming. The performances from all three deserve Oscars. Kinnear is the only one who went home empty handed, and he shouldn't have been.There are plenty of moments when you really question what is going on in Melvin's head, and those are truly the most interesting moments of the film. James L. Brooks has always had a talent for charming over audiences, and here he does his best work, making lovable characters that are three-dimensional.It's an utterly delightful film that should not be missed. Funny, romantic, awkward, and unforgettable. It definitely is up there with Nicholson's best performances. My favorite is R.P. Macmurphey, in which Nicholson plays a man who is pretending to be insane to escape from prison. But isn't pretending to be insane what Nicholson does best? A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A funny film about a obsessive compulsive writer, Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), living in Manhattan who hurls racial, homophobic and personal insults at anybody who encounters him. His life changes one day when his gay neighbour is viciously attacked and his pet dog is given to Melvin to look after. Melvin grows to care and love through his caring of the dog, which opens doors of romance and life experience for him.I saw this film years ago and found the performances of Helen Hunt, Greg Kennean and Cuba Gooding Jr stimulating and great.The film is funny, thought provoking and sweet in a neurotic way, as it explores the depths of human insanity in relation to the search for romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good things about this movie: the characters are well developed, I couldn't find a single inconsistency in their actions and reactions. The story and plot are quite original, showing a natural daily that happen in everyone's life. Some performances are good, but I disagree with those who say these performances are extraordinary. I think they are just average or a little above. Bad things: Jack Nicholson's character is too annoying in my opinion. He speaks too slow and distributes gratuitous rudeness words to everyone around. I know the movie is supposed to show the routine of these three or four main characters, but it gets boring once nothing much really happens. The plot is so weak that we feel it's never gonna reach a climax, so I could turn it off and never see the ending-- and not even caring about it. Also, they didn't need to film 139 minutes of footage, there are many unnecessary scenes that wouldn't compromise the movie's story or quality. I don't have anything to say about directing. It's normal, not good and not bad. All in all, don't even bother watching this, only if you are really curious like I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'As Good As It Gets' is about a man, Mr. Udall played by Jack Nicholson, with a social disorder that offends almost every person he comes in contact with. He makes rude and offensive comments and has no control over himself. He meets a waitress, Carol Connelly played by Helen Hunt, who is able to tolerate most of his behavior. She is not afraid to put him in his place when he steps over bounds with her. Mr. Udall comes to her restaurant where only she can serve him. He is rude to other customers if they are sitting in his spot. He finds that he is very dependent on her service and goes to her home when she stops coming to work. At first this is scary to her. Mr. Udall finds that Carol is home with her sick child and sends a much needed doctor over to tend to her child. She accepts reluctantly but only because her son's condition is pretty bad. Mr. Udall asks for a favor in return and this puts the two of them on a road trip. They go through some ups and downs and discover more and more about each other.The theme is centered on Mr. Udall and the emotional effect he has on people. He is such an abrasive person that it is unbelievable. He says outrageously offensive things to just about everyone he comes in contact with and he shows little to no remorse. Mr. Udall is lucky that he finds someone who is able to tolerate most of his behavior. Jack Nicholson plays the part of Mr. Udall perfectly.Mr. Udall's gay neighbor, Simon played by Greg Kinnear, brings out some of the good in Mr. Udall. It starts with Simon's dog, Verdell, who starts favoring Mr. Udall over Simon. This sounds impossible in theory but it happens. This is when the story starts to show a good side to Mr. Udall.This movie is like the movie "Citizen Kane". Both have a plot based on memorable characters. Charley Kane and Mr. Udall are both characters that made quite an impression on many. They are not individuals who are like everyone else. Both stand out in many different ways.The close up angles are used with great tasted. One example is when there is a close up on Verdell and Mr. Udall and it gives a lasting impression. The sound effects are great and add to the emotional effects of the story. The director, producer, and editors have done a wonderful job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny and well-written; directed by James L. Brooks...Jack Nicholson is at the top of his game in AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Melvin Udall (Nicholson)is a set-in-his-ways cranky, insulting obsessive-compulsive novelist and as bitter as they come. His life passes like clockwork, eating his breakfast at the same diner, at the same time with his own eating utensils. The 'crackpot' is waited on my the only waitress willing to serve him...Carol(Helen Hunt), who has her own personal problems to deal with. The two somehow form an awkward relationship that turns to romance. When his neighbor Simon(Greg Kinnear), a homosexual artist, is robbed and beaten, the very bigoted Melvin reluctantly agrees to care for his small dog. Each of the three struggle with individual tragedies and progressively a bond is formed. This you might say is a serious comedy and Nicholson is superb with his expected insults. Also in the cast: Cuba Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight, Yeardly Smith and Skeet Ulrich.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With 363 preceding comments at this time, everything which can be said about this film is undoubtedly included somewhere among them.I would add that Jack Nicholson's performance is among the best of perhaps the finest actor of our time. The two primary co-stars, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear provide equally-competent, engaging performances, along with Cuba Gooding, Shirley Knight, and everyone in the remaining supporting cast.It is a very long movie, nearly 2-1/3 hours in length - but so enjoyable it seems like one of those shorter hour-and-a-half films. This is a true test of a completely-enjoyable presentation - and thankfully, the producers didn't try to cut its length to conform to a more normal movie theater show schedule.The entire story, all of the characters, and their relationships with one another, one-on-one or in some sort of grouping, entertain without pause or exception during the entire film."Melvin" and all his cohorts are a group you're not likely to forget.{Some of the folks on this site have characterized Helen Hunt's character/performance as "annoying." Ms. Hunt is not my favorite actress, but while agreeing her character here was annoying - I would add that I feel this was a necessary, understandable component of her character. Here was a waitress, living with New York expenses, commuting from one borough to another, and with a son with a bad case of asthma, hospital emergency runs, etc. (I have family experience with such asthmatic-triggered emergencies, although thankfully, without her character's financial and insurance problems.) All of the circumstances surrounding her life and work would certainly provide this sort of comportment. Further, since most of her character's displays of an "annoying" demeanor were with Melvin, a rich, neurotic individual, obsessed with self-centered trivialities, she couldn't logically avoid being impatient and less-than-empathetic to his seemingly (to her) relatively petty frustrations.}</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 3 Best Films of 1997...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A richly textured character study wrapped inside of surprisingly original story, AS GOOD AS IT GETS was a striking and emotionally charged motion picture experience that will take the viewer through a myriad of emotions and find them trying to catch their breath and collect themselves as the credits roll. This unusual story revolving around three disparate characters who IRL would probably never cross paths except for the fact that two of them live in the same building and one of them hangs where the third works. Jack Nicholson won his third Oscar, giving one of his most dazzling performances as Melvin, a sexist, homophobic, anal-attentive, germophobic, anti-social writer who it seems has been living a fishbowl existence which has brought him to the belief that the earth was put here to serve and accommodate him and his needs. Marvin finds himself accidentally involved with Simon (Greg Kinnear, who should have won an Oscar), a sensitive, gay artist who lives in Marvin's building and becomes part of his life when Marvin is forced to care for Simon's dog after Simon gets beaten up by some thugs through a set-up by a sleazy bisexual con-artist (Skeet Ulrich). Helen Hunt won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Carol, a workaholic waitress with a sickly son who is Marvin's favorite waitress at his favorite restaurant. Any more details as to how these three people's lives intersect would spoil one of the most entertaining and delicious stories that was also nominated for Best Picture of 1997. A one-of-a-kind motion picture experience that must be seen to be savored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd swear JACK NICOLSON was playing himself, he's so on target with his character (Melvin Udall), a quirky, misanthropic writer who thumbs his nose at everyone with sharp wisecracks, delivered in that dull monotone he perfected so many movies ago. When he isn't shoving a cute dog down the incinerator chute or avoiding stepping on sidewalk cracks, he's just about the rudest patron any waitress (HELEN HUNT) could expect to meet up with. His eccentricities even extend to bringing his own silverware to his favorite restaurant and insisting that only one particular waitress serve his meals. Poor girl.But the opposites attract clich seems to be at work shortly after they meet and gradually learn to tolerate each other before romance enters the picture. Meanwhile, Nicholson finds time to be rude to his gay neighbors, GREGG KINNEAR and CUBA GOODING, JR. who share the same floor in his brownstone apartment building.When it's all over, there's an uplifting, feel good feeling about the whole thing, despite the nastiness of Nicholson's character which is almost always played for laughs. All the players are excellent and each have their special moments. Nicholson and Hunt went on to win well deserved acting awards for their offbeat roles.A cheerful, wacky look at those strange creatures called human beings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is my all-time favorite!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is wonderful for many reasons: the acting, the writing, the score... to name a few. 1997 really was a good year, with pure classics, as L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, The Full Monty and this one...It's a mix between a romantic comedy and a drama... and that does it very well. As the film goes on, we enter the minds of the different characters and see all the different points of view as how to live your life. Because that is what this movie is all about: LIFE.The story is quite simple but the dialogues are priceless! Funny, clever, witty, meaningful, with a really great message. It's all about the three main characters (Nicholson, Hunt &amp; Kinnear) in their interactions with each other and how they evolve throughout the movie. It has to be the movie with the most memorable quotes I've ever seen! I love sarcastic humor, and this movie has plenty of it!!! Just pure gold! But don't worry, it is not offending at any time!Now the acting... certainly the highlight of the movie! Let's begin with Jack Nicholson. Where shall I begin? He totally OWNS the show! He steals the whole screen! No doubt about it! His character is a very difficult one: an obnoxious romance-writer with OCD who's searching for meaning in his life. The thing is... he's a horrible human being, a total b@st@rd! I think he says more or less 40 obnoxious things during the whole movie! Nevertheless, you end up liking him, very much... I won't say why because it would be a spoiler... Nicholson gives his most perfect performance, in my opinion. Sure, he was excellent in "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Terms of Endearment"... but this is his best role. A strong, misunderstood, obnoxious, yet-sensitive character. I just love this character! Probably because he makes me think about myself...Helen Hunt was also very good as a single-mother waitress always worrying because her son is very ill and she can't afford the treatment that could save him. She was really moving, in her own way, yet quite funny sometimes! Her monologue about loneliness is absolutely heart-breaking.Greg Kinnear is a big surprise! In all the movies I've seen starring him, he only plays womanizers with almost no brain. Here, he plays the neighbor of Jack Nicholson, a gay artist whose most important thing in the world is his dog! When he thinks his life is perfect, something happens that will change his vision of life, as well as Nicholson's character's (I won't say more...) His performance is very subtle, heart-breaking, almost perfect... and as I already said, the dialogues are priceless!! And he's not the clich of a gay man. He's not fooling around all the time with his hand lifted and sobbing every time someone tells him something bad... No!! He's just a person who happens to prefer men and is very sensitive... Another reason why I love this movie... no clichs, just something likely...Other supporting roles to be noticed: Cuba Gooding Jr. (always good!!), Shirley Knight (not bad at all!!), Skeet Ulrich (only 5 minutes, but good!!) and Yeardley Smith (ditto!) All in all, the performances make this movie a must-see, and as the writing is great and the directing quite nice, it's a WINNER!! It's not the common type of romantic comedy! you won't see the leading man charming or macho... you won't see the leading girl over-sexy or faking disinterest in order to get attention... You won't see crazy supporting roles... well... not too crazy at least! lol.It's so much more than that! It's a real review of life; a guide of life; a homage, should I say, to life. Absolutely wonderful!! It will make you think about how you should act with other people, and how to make yourself a better man... and entertain you at the same time!!! Which is why we go see movies... entertainment!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Proof Nicholson Is America's Greatest Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is further proof that along with Robert Deniro, Jack Nicholson is America's greatest living actor. If you need proof, then pay close attention to the final scene in the film where Melvin tells Carol how he truly feels about her.Very few actors could have pulled that scene off as well as the master, Mr. Nicholson. He deserved the Oscar he won for the performance, and if I was a betting person I would bet anything that Jack will win an unprecedented fourth Oscar before his career is over. He is just too talented.If you ever need proof that Jack is the greatest living actor, watch his movies and see how many times he "steals the movie" away from the other actors (Batman, A Few Good Men, The Shining, etc). There is the proof.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many great things about this film that it's hard to list them all. First is an intelligent script. There's great dialogue in this film, reminiscent of the best of the 30's, e.g. The Thin Man series. A great script is no good without great people to deliver it, and this movie was perfectly cast. Here we see the true star quality of Helen Hunt. There are few actors who can share a screen with Jack Nicholson and have the audience watch them instead of Jack, but she is one. Greg Kinnear is flawless as the artist neighbor, and does a spot-on Nicholson impression,too. Cuba Gooding, fresh from Jerry Maguire, is superb in a small supporting role. Harold Ramis as the doctor and Shirley Knight as Helen's mom are, as ever, perfect. Even Skeet Ulrich, playing a thoroughly detestable character, does a great job. As Good As It Gets is more character study than romantic comedy, although there are certainly plenty of laughs. There are also plenty of tears, and just plain pangs of sympathy.

		<fullReview>How they managed to make this movie so great I'll never know. They took a rather disgusting character and somehow made him sympathetic and I don't say that because he has mental problems. There doesn't seem to be any kind of resolution to his problems at the end of the movie either. So why do I think it's so great, simply because of Jack Nicholson. Yes, he is somewhat of a ham but in this movie he captures every emotion so perfectly. From paralyzing fear to extreme happiness. He certainly deserved the Oscar for this one.Helen Hunt also got the role of a lifetime. Her Carol is your basic tortured soul, but she never loses her sense of humor either. Greg Kinnear has the most difficult role. He used to be a newscaster for E! so the camera was not new to him at the time, but to start with such a strong performance is incredible. His role requires a lot of crying but he somehow pulls it off without hamming it up.Like many have written on this site it's the characters that make this movie and over the years James L. Brooks has formed a lot of relationships with prominent actors. This is the third time he and Nicholson work together. Even Yeardley Smith of the Simpsons make an impression in a small role. So what more can you say - this is an actors picture and I'm glad that it beat out Titanic in in both nominations and wins in the actor category.Sadly, Nicholson and Hunt haven't really made a worthwhile movie since so I have a suspicion that winning Oscars doesn't really feed your prolific-ism. Nicholson has only made two or three movies since this one and Hunt even fewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is almost as Good as it Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the most interesting studies of relationships ever captured on screen. The characters are perfectly formed, the interplay is seamless, and as the characters grow on each other we grow with them.Jack Nicholson(in his most complicated role) is Melvin Udall, an obsessive compulsive romance novelist.He is very anti-social and just wants to be left alone. Enter Carol Connely (played with gusto by Helen Hunt) a waitress whom the obsessive compulsive Melvin needs to wait on him every morning. Both Nicholson and Hunt won Oscars for their roles and their interplay is breathtaking. I enjoy nothing better than to see two actors in exceptional roles working together, and as Good as it Gets is a perfect example. We see their excellent chemistry working throughout the film unlike in say, Silence of the lambs where Foster and Hopkins only had a few scenes together.Then we meet Melvin's gay neighbour, Simon Bishop who is hospitalised after he catches people breaking into his home.Simon's dog is sent to stay with Melvin and perhaps the most interesting relationship develops between the two.The rest of the film is the developing relationships between the characters and how they come to care for each other as well as us care for them.I will not spoil all the bizarre and touching events that take place in this film but rest assured there are many. There are moments where your heart will skip a beat. Such as when Melvin says to Carrol with more sincerity than Sting, you make me want to be a better man.Cuba Gooding Jr has a small role in this. Watch out for the very funny scene where he forces the dog on Melvin. There is also a small appearance by Yeardly Smith (the voice of Lisa Simpson).The one down point in this movie is that the romance novelist side of Melvin's character is never explored, which is unfortunate since you cannot add such a bizarre feature to a character like this and not explain it. The director could have taken an extra scene to convey this characteristic.Nonetheless, this is a film you can't not love. For each person there are different moments you will always remember and there is no one who will be left untouched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'As good as it gets' is tragic comedy about a writer Melvin (Jack Nicholson) who is afraid of germ-infection from other people and other places. At the beginning of the film we see him being hostile against his gay neighbor and his dog, we also see him having lunch at the same restaurant where he always wants to be served by the same waitress.The Jack Nicholson character stands pretty much central from the beginning of the film, but that is going to change when the other two leading characters start to develop. The waitress Carol played by Helen Hunt has a very sick son and he is in desperate need of medical help. Melvin is prepared to offer this help in a kind of way by submitting a doctor for him. Here fore he asks of her just to keep serving him at her restaurant.The third leading character Simon who is a painter gets harassed early in the movie. Simon ends up in a hospital and is threatened to lose his apartment because of financial depths. From this point a relationship begins between Melvin and Simon.At a certain point in the movie the three characters make a trip to Simons parents for financial support. Here all the characters really melt together and some good scenes come along. The acting of all three parties is great. The dialogue is pretty decent and the story shows little flaws.Of course the outcome of the movie is predictable and a Hollywood ending can't lack from the film. But overall I still highly recommend this movie. Final grade 8/10</fullReview>

Get it at Amazon.)Brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and cleanly directed, this strange and wonderful tale is one of the best romantic comedies ever to hit the silver screen. Helen Hunt, as an unmarried thirtysomething waitress with a asthmatic five-year-old boy, is exquisite. Jack Nicholson, as a weird and mean obsessive compulsive writer named Melvin Udall, is even better than he usually is, and he is one of the great actors of our time, and even Greg Kinnear in a supporting role as the sensitive gay guy next door is outstanding. Of course I love impossible love, unrequited love, love that takes decades to culmination. This is a case of impossible love come true. Eat your heart out Nora Ephron! And you too Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But I couldn't help but think, considering the principals, how impossible it really is on another level. But never mind, in fact, all the better.James L. Brooks, who directed and who, along with Mark Andrus (from his story) wrote the script, is to be highly commended. The concept of an obsessive compulsive, self-centered (almost autistic) older guy, set in his ways beyond anything normal finding love is just wondrous strange. And a patient and caring, under-achieving, under-appreciated Manhattan waitress in a house dress, finding not just love but somebody who really knows who she is and what she's worth is also just wonderful.Wonderful, yes. A wonderful movie to lift the spirit. But As Good As It Gets is more than that. The dialogue is sharp and witty and big-city sophisticated and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The underlying statements about relationships and love in urban America are subtle and thought-provoking. So much is said beside the point. Yes, off to the side we find some street hustlers juxtaposed with someone sensitive, and we see how irrelevant they are and how he overcomes them and this brutal thing they have done to him. And off to the side we see again how irrelevant is the homophobia of a man lost in prejudice and self-hatred, and how it changes when he becomes aware and when he learns to love.The ancient rule in comedy, from the Greeks to Shakespeare to the musical comedy of the stage to the romantic comedies of the silver screen, has been young and attractive principals overcome obstacles and live happily ever after. Here we have obstacles of the most tiring sort, obstacles not of class or race or family, but of psychological problems, stuff straight out of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders--although to be technical, the symptoms of Melvin Udall are a cornucopia of psychiatric delight. The bitter, cutting, hateful insults that he showers on everyone, even his most devoted admirers, seem more characteristic of Tourette's Syndrome than of a obsessive compulsive disorder. But never mind. It works. In fact everything works in this movie, from the adorable little dog whom Melvin loves ("A dog...a blanky-blanky dog!" who has captured his heart he tells us in amazement), to Greg Kinnear's character's friend (Cuba Gooding) trying to act tough, to Shirley Knight in a bit part as Helen Hunt's character's mother, to the cute little boy with asthma.However--and this is a big however--this movie is not for everybody, which accounts for some of the nasty reviews below. But ignore them. Trust me. This is a wonderful movie, although perhaps not for those who are homophobic or 13-years-old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Great Dramady - best of 1997</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since it's so much easier and more fun to write about bad movies, I was almost not going to say anything at all about this one - there's simply nothing wrong with it. A quirky, irreverent feel-good-drama if there ever was one, this movie does it just right. From the incredible Nicholson and Hunt performances and the excellent script, to the cute side jokes and perfect music, this movie is 10/10 all the way. Nicholson haters might want to skip this, and some might prefer the plastic people usually displayed by Hollywood, but for a believable film about real people, with laughs aplenty, a great story, character development and all, go rent this. Now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just one of my favourites of all time (although i've just seen it 5 minutes ago). I love the human nature in the movie - the way everybody treat each others, i love every character , . the acting of all the actors was great !!!!!. i've never known anything about Jack Nicholson before , except that he's a big actor. So the first time i see him acting is in this movie . everything he did is unique and wonderful !!! actually , I'm sure that his job in this movie is one of the best in the history the last thing i wanna say is that i was very surprised that i've been beaten by this kind of old-age-love (sorry i don't mean to offend , my line here kind of Melvin Udall's :P ). i think every teenagers of America or Europe needs to see this movie at least one to know some other aspects of life , besides sex and drugs !!! P/S : i wanna say thanks to the MIRC so that i can get this wonderful movie !!! i rated it 10 !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating comedy-drama (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest hits of 1997 and garnering Jack Nicholson yet another Oscar, "As Good As It Gets" is a fascinating comedy-drama. It might be perceived as bad taste using mental illness as the basis for a comedy, but the premise works wonderfully in a story that explores the nature of being both nasty and nice.In modern-day middle-class New York city, Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a writer of successful romantic novels. He also suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which means he eats in his favourite restaurant using only plastic cutlery, does not walk on cracks in the pavement, and keeps everyone around him at a safe distance through a barrage of obscene insults. He is gradually brought out of his shell when his gay artist neighbour Simon (Greg Kinnear), is viciously attacked and robbed in his own apartment. The artist's manic art dealer Frank (Cuba Gooding Jr.) forces Melvin to look after Simon's dog while he's in hospital. Elsewhere, Melvin develops a close relationship with Carol (Helen Hunt), a tough-talking waitress with a disabled young son...The film's main strength is it's four leading actors, who turn in some fabulous performances to make the film work. Nicholson has been well-cast in the role of Melvin. In the hands of any other actor, Melvin would be repellent. Nicholson lends the part his customary charisma and presence to make the part endearing, sympathetic and scabrously funny. He develops a good onscreen partnership with Helen Hunt's Carol. There is a fine psychological (if not necessarily sexual) chemistry between the pair, and their inevitable coupling works well because of it.Greg Kinnear is on fine form as Simon, who loses then rediscovers his love for his art. What's interesting about the character is that his homosexuality is simply a trait, rather than the dominating facet of his personality. In Kinnear's hands the character is subtle, touching and believable throughout. Cuba Gooding Jr is maniacally slick as art dealer Frank, but he is a little underused, his presence being sorely missed during the last third of the film.Director James L. Brooks keeps the tone of the film consistently lighthearted without being patronising. That said, some overly cute scenes with Simon's dog could have been clipped out. He and fellow writer Mark Andrus have developed an interesting tale with several plot arcs that are fascinating to watch. As Melvin and Carol gradually soften up, Simon assertively toughens up.The film chides Melvin's defensive nastiness, but at the same time mocks minor characters who are naively or superficially nice. These include Carol's busybody mother, forever prying into her daughter's business; Simon's ridiculously sentimental Spanish nurse and most memorably, the cloying receptionist who unwisely asks Melvin what he thinks about women. The film advises that we must never repel others, but must always approach them with sincerity and respect.To conclude, this is an interesting movie that looks at how seemingly different people can learn to understand each other and does so with streak of scathingly honest humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this film for the second time, one really gets the impression that it's particularly well-balanced. It's a simple romantic comedy told on the matchstick pillions of the most sophisticated of urban stylism - the nature of the New Yorker. Plus it's also, unostentatiously, a Jack Nicholson vehicle.But his performance is the model of the justly Hollywood A-lister: entirely what you'd expect from the last umpteen movies, but without the complacency and plenty of new ideas. The disdain for political correctness is delivered in character (an early, in-yer-face jibe at a Jewish couple makes one's heart stop before you asphixiate with laughter) but he doesn't lose sight of the project.Kinnear and Hunt are great company for this story, but the virtuosity cup in this ensemble goes to Mark Andrus' screenplay, which serves up the one-liners without turning the story into a mosaic of little sketches. My only worry is that of many others - Nicholson's Melvin is just too old for the Carol Connelley that director James Brooks and Hunt give us, and our imagination is constantly tested to buy it. I did though 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>jack, you outdone yourself in this tearjerking comedy drama mushed all into one movie. with the awesome performances of the gay artist, helen hunt, and cuba gooding jr., they all sold their parts to the fullest extent. melvin, jack's character, was a grump almost the entire time, until he met and fell madly in love with the waitress that almost always serves him his breakfast. he seems to have his heart in the freezer, and then, when helen comes with breakfast, he sets the heart out and lets it dethaw for the longest time. i found it charming how he tries it so hard to impress her, and even though it isnt that flattering, it kinda is since he is used to doing what he wants to do, not what women want him to do. the gay artist had to have hit home with the crying, (**SPOILER**)when someone attacks his work and him, leaving him to rely on the support of melvin. melvin really is a great guy at heart, but has it all bottled inside. jack does an outstanding job as the hardened soul, who learns to love like beast from beauty and the beast, only jack was not one about appearances. Love, can be found by all people, cranky and lovable. this movie really makes love be the best thing on this world. congratulations on a influential movie that changed this girl's views of love!

		<fullReview>Just watched this again on NBC (tv) and was amazed how great a showcase this is for actors who KNOW how to act! I had seen this at the movies when first released in 97--and liked it a lot. Then saw again on VHS (remember that? hee!)..But,it's been a few years-----still, even on tv, with bleeps, cuts &amp; commercials, this movie is super! Jack, of course, is excellent....However, the real reasons to see this film---are Helen Hunt &amp; Greg Kinnear (both have NEVER been better!)--except Kinnear has come close with "Auto-Focus" and even "Stuck On You"----dunno WHAT happened with Helen! No matter....IF you want to see an absolutely fantastic character-driven movie--that combines laugh-out-loud comedy with heart-tugging humanity--THIS is a film to check out! (P.S. The dog is GREAT too!)</fullReview>

I approach anything she's in with a certain amount of caution...And even though this movie rubs up dangerously close to chick-flick status, the saving grace in this entire movie is Jack Nicholson and his flawless timing and execution. The man is most definatly the ultimate acting machine. For me it's always been a toss-up between him and Deniro, but you know what? Lately Deniro is becoming too one-dimensional...how many different ways can you play "Jimmy Conway" anyway? By contrast, Nicholson is not afraid to take on different roles and regardless of the material, the man fills the screen with his presence. In THIS movie, virtually every line he has leaves you off-balance, appalled, and delighted all at the same time. This movie should be mandatory viewing for anyone after the age of 15...if for no other reason it shows how wildly off-the-road some lives can become...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Um...I Disagree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, not with all of this review. Just some. I believe that it is indeed a comedy, because life is one unrelenting comedy. If it weren't, if we couldn't find the humor in even the worst situations or people, then we'd all just put guns to our heads. Also, as Carol's mother states after Carol bursts out with, "Why can't I just have a normal boyfriend?! One that doesn't go nuts on me!" "We all want that. It doesn't exist." That is precisely the point. Melvin, while he is, admittedly, flawed, as we are all in some way, gave Carol a solution to the one thing that probably weighed on her heaviest of all: a doctor to help her ailing son, to make him feel a great deal better. So no, Carol won't be rushing to the doctor every other midnight with Spencer. And Melvin probably won't ever become a sensitive poet who wears a cardigan and cries when he sees a sunset. But Carol has given him a reason to improve as much as he can. Thus, they have both helped out the other for the better, and they are no longer in it alone. So I don't believe this is a tragic movie at all, but instead one that should inspire hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>can't get any better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can hardly get any better. I must have seen this movie more than four times and every time is as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it. It's such a great movie. And it's all about Jack Nicholson-he is the man what can I say. Such an actor. I don't think that even DeNiro or Pacino could have played this particular character as flawlessly as Nicholson. This was an Oscar performance from top to bottom and of course he got it.The message that this movie sends is that love is the best cure for any kind of disease-it can come at any time, place and age to heal you and give you a new life. Even for a "crazy f***" like our hero love helps. The only shortcoming of this movie was that money was also involved. But I guess this is life: everything comes at a price. And probably the easiest and sometimes only way to get love is to buy it. C'est la vie. Great supporting performances from Greg Kinnear, Helen Hunt and Cuba Gooding Jr. and especially Greg Kinnear. Not to forget the dog yeah, he was one of the main contributors to the beauty of this masterpiece. There is no way one could go wrong with this movie, no way. You gonna love it. This one is in my top 10 list. 10 from 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: potential spoilers ahead.I don't like most hollywood movies. Especially hollywood romantic comedies. Urgh.But anything with Jack Nicholson is a masterpiece, since I want to have sex with him. No, but really, this film is unusually meaningful for Hollywood. And oh that adorable dog should have been nominated for an oscar.Charming performances all round. Greg Kinnear is well suited for a gay role, (no offense). Helen Hunt is quite good as well. And Jack, with his enormous scruffy eyebrows, and chillingly charming smile (that only makes sense to me, don't worry about it), is at his best here.Anyway, I can personally relate to this movie, which is why I enjoyed it so much. I am an asshole. Very much like Melvin (Jack Nicholson) is here. I also meet people (not a certain one just yet) that make me want to become a better person. I haven't made much of an effort as of yet, but I know what I want to do. Yes, I'm a very confused human being, much like that last sentence.As Good as It Gets is probably just that, in terms of Hollywood romantic comedies. I don't think I should even call it that. Because it isn't sappy, it isn't a chick flick, and it's one of my favourite movies of all time.</fullReview>

He seemed to play back some of Nicholson's mugging to him. Man, I'm a hardboiled cynic, but I really crave this movie: its just too funny. Hope Lange as Mother really outdid herself, too. Freaking everyone in the film commands the screen and frankly, those are the kind of performances required when you have Jack in a movie. Otherwise he just chews the scenery to shreds, leaving you with only his indelible performance in the aftermath (a la "A Few Good Men"). Helen Hunt is actually good in this movie, her only worthwhile cinematic performance since that Girl Quarterback movie and "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" (Man, is that a great movie, but I digress...)Also, a reprise of the waitress-abuse which fairly launched The Jack in "Five Easy Pieces". Consistency, consistency.What a happy ending! What a nice guy Melvin turns out to be. He's so bad, that it has to turn out good, just to lend balance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who always hated Jack Nicholson (despite my grudging admiration for his great talent), I refused to even acknowledge that this film existed, never mind watch it. How things have changed! I have now watched it five times in a row. In fact, I think you can't appreciate this movie until you have watched it over and over.I cannot fault one scene, one actor, one line or one piece of photography. How sad am I???Helen Hunt is a pure joy to look at, her facial expressions say much more than words can ever do. Jack Nicholson is his usual brilliant performing self in a role which I suspect gets near to his own character. Greg Kinnear as 'Simon the Fag' is wonderful and Cuba thingy shows all his talent in the little cameo appearances he gives in the film.The dog of course (Fridell? Frodel?? whatever) which starts off being a strange unattractive being turns into a star - any creature who can make Jack Nicholson say "awww" in a mushy tone must deserve an Oscar.All the stars deserve an Oscar. Watch it again all you people who disparage the film. You must catch every line, every nuance, every glance in order to appreciate this wonderful, feel good film. And if you think I must be one of those slushy sentimental women who love a good weep, then think again. Mr. Udal has nothing on me when it comes to sentimentality!</fullReview>

As Good As It Gets, now this movie was touching, brilliant, funny, deep, and definitely Best Picture worthy. The performances by Nicholson as the O.C.D. diagnosed romance novelist; Hunt as the slightly neurotic whiny waitress and Kinnear as the sad, gay artist are great. Though I don't think that Kinnear did as good as Robin Williams from Good Will Hunting, he came very close.Cuba Gooding Jr. did well too, but I don't think it was one of his greatest performances.

		<shortDescription>As Good As It Gets: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nominated for seven Academy Awards and winner of two, As Good As It Gets is really as good as it gets. It has biting and sarcastic humor, sincere and poignant drama, and plausible romance (let me tell you, I bought Helen Hunt falling in love with Jack Nicholson more than her and Woody Allen in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion.) Directed by The Simpsons producer James L. Brooks, it really makes you laugh.Nicholson is Melvin Udall, a curmudgeon in his 60s who is also obsessive-compulsive. He has to lock his door, he flips the light switch five times, he can't touch anyone else, he can't step on cracks, and he repeatedly uses new bars of soap. His gay neighbor Simon (Greg Kinnear) is a painter who loves his little dog Verdell. Every morning, Melvin goes to his favorite restaurant, where only Carol Connely (Helen Hunt) is able to put up with him.While having somebody pose for a painting, Simon gets beaten and needs someone to look after Verdell. The only person left is Melvin. Of course, he can't show it, but he soon falls in love with the dog. When her son's illness causes Carol to miss work, Melvin doesn't know what to do. Soon they all bond and, as the song says, they `look on the bright side of life.'Upbeat music (which should have won the Oscar) makes this movie even greater. It's impossible not to tap along. Although not playing during all of the serious scenes, it really is great music that makes you feel good, which is what this movie is: a feel-good movie. Sure it gets heavy-handed at times, but it IS a comma (comedy-drama). As I mentioned before, it's biting, sarcastic, and hilarious. You can't go much without laughing at something Melvin says to either Simon or Carol and their equally wise wisecracks back. Also, I could tell that, at times, Nicholson was improvising, and that made the movie even funnier.Another Oscar that As Good As It Gets got screwed out of was best original script. It really had touching moments thrown in with the superb characterization and humor. You could sincerely feel good about any one of the characters, even Melvin. Nicholson, in this role, reminded me of his later role in About Schmidt. While I'm on the topic of acting, let me say Nicholson was amazing. He tried to keep his tough-guy person still with him, but he let go that he loves doing commas. He was excellent, proving that, once again, he's not finished with us yet! Hunt also deserved her Oscar, with crying that puts, well, actual crying to shame. Kinnear was also great, and so was everyone else, especially Cuba Gooding Jr.I would highly suggest seeing As Good As It Gets before long, because it is a great movie!My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 on appeal for strong language, thematic elements, nudity and a beating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Picture of 1997. By far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1998 was one of the most controversial years ever as far as the Best Picture Oscar winner, but I think that this is only because Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love, the two front-runners for the award, were both such tremendously spectacular movies. There was a similar situation the year before, in 1997, with the rivalry between Titanic and As Good As It Gets, it's just too bad that the Academy chose to give the award to Titanic's ticket sales rather than the sheer earthquaking quality of As Good As It Gets and the fabulous talent within it. Thankfully, the Best Actor and Best Female Actor awards were given to the stars of As Good As It Gets, clearly showing that the Academy realizes that the content was in As Good As It Gets, but chose instead to award the financial purging and pretty pictures and sparkly oohs and aahs that were in Titanic. The Oscars, it becomes clearer and clearer, are entirely a commercial event and have little to nothing to do with furthering film as an artistic medium.1998, then, may be seen as something of an apology, where the Academy tries to show that they know about good film beyond goofy romantic set pieces like the joke that Titanic has turned out to be, but unfortunately in 1998 they awarded a worthy film but had to also turn down another equally worthy film. Like I always say, though, movies are not a stratified medium that releases one great film every year and a lot of pretty good movies every year so that the Oscars can be neatly distributed and we can all go home smiling, which is why I don't involve myself too much in who gets what Oscar, but rather watch the Academy Awards for entertainment purposes and, most of all, to develop a list of the quality films that I missed during the year. I wish people wouldn't get so freaked out about it and just enjoy the show, because it is quite often these same people that go out and pay full ticket prices for crap like Big Momma's House and Gone In 60 Seconds and the Scary Movies and whatnot. We have a consumer responsibility people! These trashy movies keep getting made because someone keeps buying tickets to see them! Who are these people??But I digress. As Good As It Gets, as the title refers, is just about as good as human interest dramas get. I have read reviews complaining that Melvin (the mentally flawed character played flawlessly by Jack Nicholson) is a man who it is impossible to like or love, whose compulsive, antisocial behavior is sad and disturbing, neither cute nor funny, to put it in the words of one of these unsatisfied reviewers, Christopher Brown, my colleague and good friend. Quite the contrary, however, Melvin Udall is a man who suffers from obsessive compulsion, severe antisocial tendencies, and whose interaction with the world, like Vincent Gallo's Billy in Buffalo '66, is limited to harsh insults intended to harm. I think it's true that the character is presented in such a way that he doesn't seem to realize how hurtful his statements can be (such as in the diner scene when he makes a touchy comment to Carol (Helen Hunt) about her son.The major flaw of the film is that the plot boils down to a fairly familiar formula, in which the man who hates everyone he comes into contact on a daily basis softens and ultimately grows to accept everyone from women and children to his gay neighbor's dog. Given the fact that the film is peppered with high priced Hollywood movie stars (Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding, Jr., etc.), it's obvious that it's not a cheap production, so the crowds have to be pleased to some extent, but even the rather conventional path that it follows to the end is made into a tremendously enjoyable ride because of the quality of the performances. You can clearly see the difference between where the money goes in a movie like this and a movie like Titanic. You can either have enormous special effects and fancy cinematic trickery dumbed down by wooden performances, as was the case in Titanic, or you can have a movie that takes place in a familiar setting and is bursting with Oscar worthy performances from top to bottom, as in As Good As It Gets.That being said, I am willing to forgive a little bit of bending to the crowd-pleasing formula, which is something that I generally hate more than anything else because it is so rarely done right. Most producers (Jerry Bruckheimer) try so hard to please so many different people that they end up pleasing no one at all. In this film, the conventional formula is the price that we have to pay to see the quality of the performances and the story. Clearly, no one but Jack Nicholson could play a character like Melvin and still be liked by the audience, so his character is a success despite the callousness of him as a person. I can understand that there are a lot of people who may have been put off by a purely superficial look at the movie, maybe they couldn't look past Melvin's insults or maybe they weren't satisfied by the ending, which left very open the possibility that the future would hold more trouble like we had already seen up to that point in the movie (I felt this way myself, to a certain extent), but there can be no denying the enormous quality of the film and it's inarguable superiority to Titanic. As Good As It Gets is such a fun movie that it's almost hard to see how anyone could not like it, unless maybe they were in bad mood when they watched it. If you are one of these people, I would advise you to watch it again and pay close attention to Melvin's character throughout the film. You may be able to profit from his lessons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies over the past several years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Nicholson movie I remember seeing on the big screen and was very impressed with it. Both he, Hunt and Kinnear give incredible performances in this wonderful comedy about relationships and overcoming our disabilities or whatever holds us back. For Hunt it is having to care for a sick child. Kinnear as we learn had a falling out with his father years ago, being beat up and fitting in as a homosexual. Nicholson has to deal with obsessive compulsive disorder and for the most part being a jerk. All the characters come together neatly in the end in this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar nomination? Give me a break!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anything "As Good as It Gets" should've got nominated for a Razzy! Jack Nicolson plays a cumdurgeon who has obsessive-compulsive disorder and is a real demon around his neighbors until he finds love with a waitress (Helen Hunt). There's absolutely nothing amusing or original about this movie. And the Monty Python song in this movie wasn't no reference, if anything it was an insult to Monty Python!Jack Nicolson is such a talented actor! Why did he and Cuba Gooding Jr. waste their talents on this trash of a movie? Another reason why I dislike this movie is because of the homosexual stereotypes, and it makes obsessive-compulsive disorder look like a joke. Thank heavens Titanic beat this movie at the Oscars. The only likeable character in this movie is the dog! Steer clear away from As Good As It Gets. See some of Jack Nicolson's and Cuba Gooding Jr's other movies. This is the second worst movie of 1997 next to "The Devil's Advocate".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best comedy ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies ever, and probably the best comedy ever, this film has it all. It has great acting, a great script, very sophisticated characters, and overall, it is a very good film. Jack Nicholson at his best (definately deserving the oscar he won) and Helen Hunt at her greatest (also deserving her oscar), and Greg Kinnear is a great actor in it also (deserving the oscar he lost.) Other good performances come from Skeet Ulrich, Cuba Gooding JR, and Yeardly Smith. What I'm trying to say is, THIS FILM SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Titanic was not very good and didn't deserve the oscar. I don't care if Titanic won everything else it won, just not best picture! As Good As It Gets definetely swept the whole world of comedy over and showed film makers a new meaning of the hilarious movie genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than TITANIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Jack Nicholson fan. His performance in THE SHINING is awesome. I was skeptical if he could play in a romantic comedy/ drama. He teams up very nicely with Helen Hunt in this well-written romance.The opening scene in the movie immediately sets up what a loathesome person Nicholson's character is. James L. Brooks (the director and co-writer) did a masterful job in showing you that you will be watching a person who is not well-liked. I did think Nicholson's obsessive compulsive disorder was skipped over too much.This movie had warmth, alot of great scenes and segments (the whole segment at the Baltimore restaurant is wonderful), and a nice uplifting ending. It deserved the Oscar for best picture more than TITANIC. I highly recommend this movie(especially with a date).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bears striking similarities in story and character to THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as it is deftly written, acted and directed. However, I cannot help but be surprised at the striking similarities it bears to THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1988). I have never heard anyone compare the two films despite how close they are. Both are about well-to-do writers, played here by Jack Nicholson and in "Tourist" by William Hurt. In both films the writers meet a young single mother who is not very well off financially (Helen Hunt here and Geena Davis in "Tourist). Both mothers have a young son, and in both films the son is sick and the writer helps the mother out financially to take care of her child! Also, in both films the writer fall for the young mother. If that is not enough, both films contain dogs who do lots of funny tricks and are often the center of attention! These cannot be coincidences and since I have never heard or read about the similarities, I thought I would bring them to attention.</fullReview>

However, the love story with Helen Hunt does not work -- it is neither touching nor humorous -- Nicholson's character is just too unappealing.

		<fullReview>What 's all the fuss about ? This is one of the most mediocre films I have ever seen . See it for yourself and judge . The characters wereextremely underdevelopped . The script had many flaws . Instead of having a solid story and characterisation , the movie relies on SkeetUlrich 's naked ass and some wannabe dramatic quarrels between Nicholson and Hunt which fail miserably , like in the restaurant . Anyway Jack Nicholson gives a solid and satisfying performance and that is a major pro . He is not over the top but he plays his anti social character tactfully . Unfortunately Helen Hunt is AWFUL !!!!!!! Yes you read right awful , terrible and irritating . I can 't believe how bad performance this was and I really don 't think this is the writer 's fault . She competes Holly Hunter in "Copycat" for the worst performance in film history . Cuba Guding Jr has a brief cameo and somehow steals the show with his dynamic personna . If there is a reason to watch this film it is indisputably Greg Kihnear . He manages to create soul and emotion for his character and he is the only lead whom you care about . You are heartbroken when he is beaten savagely and you care for his fate . Apart from Kihnear the film hasn 't much to offer . I am shocked with these positive commentsand with the 7.7 average rating !!! If you want a good social characters comedy , watch the REAL BLONDE with Mathew Mondine . This film gets a healthy 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot figure out what all of the fuss was about. How this mediocre film won so many Oscars is one of the many Hollywood mysteries of the '90s. The script was poorly written, the characters not well developed, and the overall tone just hard to tolerate. Nicholson's obvious psychiatric problems should have been the focus of treatment. Why a seemingly smart woman such as the character portrayed by Helen Hunt wouldn't more vigorously suggest this is beyond me. Treatment would at least have shortened this unfunny "comedic" film. Don't see this film unless you want to be bored... If this is as good as it gets, no more movies should be made. It could have gotten A LOT better than this if only the script were better.</fullReview>

Nicholson and Hunt won well-deserved Oscars. Kinnear holds his own throughout and was also Oscar-nominated. James L. Brooks' direction and screenplay are only above average, it's the actors that make the material work.

Greg Kinnear- dull as dishwater. Cuba Gooding Jr. was thrown in for no other reason than to give the film some brief instants of energy, but even that energetic performer can't pull off such a feat.

		<fullReview>Helen Hunt is brilliant in this movie. As good as Judi Dench and Helena Bonham Carter were in their Oscar-nominated roles of 1997, Hunt was every inch their equal. Her role was by far the most difficult of the film.Nicholson basically just played himself, and did a few obsessive-compulsive tics every now and again for variety. If you're a fan of his, you've seen this before.Greg Kinnear did an okay job, but his character was largely ignored by the screenwriters -- I never felt as though I were allowed inside his mind the way I was allowed inside the mind of Hunt's character. The only way we even know that his character is gay is because everyone keeps talking about how "gay" he is -- it's a character trait written in to annoy Nicholson's character; he could have been a saintly Jew or a saintly black man. The fact that he's a saintly gay person is largely inconsequential.But...Hunt's performance is easily worth the price of the rental. The movie gets two stars; Helen Hunt gets four.</fullReview>

Oh well, let's see, maybe it will get better..After 25 minutes watching: - do you really want to finish watching this? Should we pick another movie?After 40 minutes: - really??? Every single scene seems fake and horrible acting! How much worse can it get??After an hour: - how much longer should we torture ourselves? Holy cow! It's another hour of this insanity! Someone, please, rip my eyes off!!Anyway, we somehow survived through the entire movie with numerous breaks.. Then I decided to check IMDb rating for this movie thinking it would be one of those top 100 worst movies ever. Imagine my surprise when I saw that on IMDb it had the rating of 7.8!!! I seriously don't see how this movie could get 5.0.. If you are thinking about watching this movie, avoid it! Even Nicholson couldn't save it.. Giving 2/10 for the little doggie's acting skills, which exceeded skills of those renowned Hollywood actors and actresses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good As Jack and Helen Can Get!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"As Good As It Gets" ranks as the best Jack Nicholson movie in ages, and it is a pretty nutty comedy, too. Considering the crap that Nicholson has appeared in lately, "As Good As It Gets" is easily the most memorable film that he has starred in since the 1980s. Talk about stinkers and sinkers, specifically "Blood &amp; Wine," "Mars Attacks," "The Crossing Guard," "Wolf," and "Hoffa," were as disposable as they were objectionable. Top heavy with multi-dimensional characters, "As Good As It Gets" generates its crisp plot from the recurring collisions that occur between flaky characters. Uneven, often predictable, but consistently entertaining at 138 minutes in length, "As Good As It Gets" unspools like a long, leisurely situation comedy. "Terms of Endearment" writer &amp; director James L. Brooks spices up this superlative comedy with several politically incorrect one-liners and charms some scintillating performances from both Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear. The cutest performance belongs to a scene-stealing pooch, an adorable Brussels Griffon doggie that resembles a "Star Wars" Ewok.Mark Andrus co-wrote "As Good As It Gets" with Brooks. The plot details the back and forth relationships between two Manhattan apartment dwellers, novelist Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson of "Batman") and gay painter Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear of "Sabrina") and woebegone waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunts of "What Women Want"), a single-parent mom who befriends Bishop but spars constantly with Udall. Brooks and Andrus take their time laying out and setting up the action about two guys, a girl and a dog. At times, "As Good As It Gets" seems indulgently slow, but the characters and their dialogue are rewarding and the ending is definitely worth the waiting. While Brooks and Andrus are developing their storyline, they criticize HMOs, debunk homosexuality, and invigorate a moth-eaten May/December romance with a gutsy vitality that most mainstream Hollywood movies shun.Nicholson shines as middle-aged romantic novelist Melvin Udall. He is somebody Archie Bunker might initially like if Melvin got chummy enough with him. But Melvin doesn't appear to like anybody. His quirky behavior qualifies him as obsessive-compulsive. He lives a strict, regimented life. He scrubs his hands with a fresh bar of soap every time, brings his own plastic utensils when dining out in restaurants and hates to step on a crack or a line in the pavement. Clearly, Melvin is a classic Nicholson character. He is as insidious and snide as Randle P. McMurphy was in the 1975 Oscar winning film "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" and Billy Budduskey in Hal Ashby's "The Last Detail" (1973).Nevertheless, far from being a stereotype, Melvin is allowed to evolve and change as a character as he interacts with Connelly and Bishop. Trouble enters paradise in the Andrus and Brooks' script when Vincent (Skeet Ulrich of "Scream"), a gay street hustler posing for Bishop, sets him up for a robbery. Not only is Bishop robbed, but the thugs also nearly cripple him. It is not often that Hollywood shows queers battling queers. When Bishop's lover Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr. of "Boat Trip") puts him in the hospital, Frank convinces Melvin with threats to take care of Bishop's fuzzy little dog Verdell. Surprisingly, Melvin and the Verdell develop a friendship. When Melvin isn't letting the mutt get the best of him, he romances Connelly and helps her with her son Spencer who is bed-ridden.Indeed, "As Good As It Gets" gets rather sappy. You know you're not watching a typical Hollywood opus when an older man gets the younger woman without getting her in the sack. Bishop, the gay character here, redefines traditional homosexual behavior. "As Good As It Gets" is ideal fare for moviegoers who prefer unusual but sentimental flicks with solid performances, especially from Nicholson, Kinnear and Hunt, sizzling dialogue, and against-the-grain messages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson took home his third Oscar for "As Good as It Gets", playing grouchy Melvin Udall, who becomes friends - if a little unwillingly - with single mom Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) and gay artist Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). With Nicholson in the role, it's pretty much guaranteed that the whole thing's gonna be neat. Especially that line about how to write women really well. I can't believe that "Titanic" defeated this for Best Picture (actually, my favorite 1997 movie was "In &amp; Out"). But, at least Nicholson and Hunt won Oscars...there was a reason that Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't nominated for an Oscar for "Titanic". All in all, "AGAIG" is a comedy classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be somewhat under-rated as I expect it deserves to be in the top 250 but for some reason it doesn't quite cut it with the voters out there. I cannot understand why, reason be it that Helen Hunt puts a little too much sentimentality into her role that it comes off as unrealistic, or maybe Greg Kinnear isn't a convincing homosexual, I surely could expect any of these reasons to give less the score. Maybe some witless fool thinks that Kate Winslet should have won the Best Actress Oscar for Titanic, instead of Helen Hunt. All these maybes yet it all comes down to one thing. Is the film enjoyable? Yes is the answer, it surpasses this goal with flying colours. That is why I simply cannot comprehend a feasible reason to why it is not given a decent rating. Jack Nicholson is on supreme form. he uses the other actors like a drug addict uses cocaine, he sucks them in, he takes their surroundings and their feelings and gives a response or an expression that is brilliant, and that is so accurate that it is astonishing to think anyone could do this. It is a performance that is also hilarious, slow-paced yet a rather enlightening talent that makes me want to watch it over and over. James 'The Simpsons' Brooks directs with flair too, as he doesn't aim for the heart-felt close ups or the excessive camera shots of their surroundings, like what James Cameron tended to do for Titanic, he simply shows the stars in their most basic forms moving around and doing what would normally be likened to a soap opera. And that is this films defining characteristic. It tries to give off an atmosphere that says this is reality, this is realistic and it does it fantastically, except for the prolonged breakdowns that Helen continually goes into. I think that is why I give it a nine. I think it is a great film, except for the seldom moments of unrealism mainly conveyed by the 1998 Best Actress Oscar . But overall I think Jack makes the film come alive, and that certainly makes for enjoyable viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My comments will contain some SPOILERS, so anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie should not read past this paragraph. Jack Nicholson in 'As Good As It Gets' is just about as good as Nicholson gets, and this is a superb movie overall, smartly written and filmed. It is the kind of movie that is very good on first viewing, and is even better on subsequent viewings, after you know the basic story line.Udall (Nicholson) is a successful author, but in his 'normal' life is not very normal at all -- an obsessive/compulsive personality, fastidious washing of hands with fresh bars of soap, bringing his own plastic ware to dine, avoiding touching others, and never stepping on a crack -- and nearly always managing to say exactly the wrong thing. His neighbor is a gay artist (Kinnear) with a little dog. After a beating and hospitalization, going broke, and an unsuccessful road trip to ask his parents for money, Udall gives him a spare bedroom. His waitress is played by Hunt, who has a sickly boy, and Udall provides them with a good doctor, just so she can return to work and be his waitress. His grander motive is her companionship. Near the end, after her saying it would be best if she never saw him again, he went to see her anyway, they took a 4AM walk to the corner bakery, as the movie ends we see him stepping on the brick pavement -- 'cracks' -- and not minding. He was letting her help him become a better man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand the raves this one got. The relationship between Nicholson and Hunt is unconvincing, unlikely, improbable, incredible, unbelievable, and any other synonym you can come up with. It simply doesn't ring true that she could possibly tie up with him after the wretched treatment he dished out to her. And as their relationship is the main line of the story, that doesn't leave much else. I gave it a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sick relationship of a sick man - NOT a love story!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignoring my initial disgust of the usual 50+ year old man w/ the 30 yr. old woman... I hope no one thinks this is a romance! What Hunt's character does is trade a dependent child for a dependent adult. She obviously needs to feel like she's taking care of someone. Not to mention, that the other half of it is still probably gratitude over what he did for her son!!!! Did you notice how all his "compliments" to her were about how good she made HIM feel/be?? [Not to mention you can't cure obsessive/compulsive behavior with love - even with the pills he was taking that's probably not enough. Also, they seemed to imply that he was an asshole because he had this disorder - now, it may exacerbate his tendency to share them w/ people but he was obviously thinking these racist, homophobic, anti-semitic remarks - &amp; that has nothing to do w/ a disorder!!]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some admirable intentions in trying to develop some original non-cliched characters that interact over an unusual plot line. Partly successful, but the weighty presence of Nicholson actually hinders the director's intentions.

		<fullReview>I tried to like this as much as everyone told me I had to. I came into the film thinking that not liking this movie condemned me to be lumped into the group of people who only watch Adam Sandler movies. I left it thinking that it's the people who watch Adam Sandler movies who looked at this and saw a work of art.First of all, let me say this: it's not that bad. It's a fairly well made movie. But it shouldn't be an Oscar-worthy film, it shouldn't be the 55th best movie of all time (according to IMDB voters) and it's not worth all the hype. Helen Hunt's and Nicholson's performances are overrated-in fact, if anyone deserved an Oscar for this film, in my mind it's Greg Kinnear.Let me defend my statement that Nicholson's performance is overrated. I have the feeling, and this was confirmed by others who told me about the movie, was that the idea of Melvin Udall was that as you gained insight on his condition, you were supposed to feel sorry for him, or at least root for him to get the girl. Nicholson supposedly opened the mind of someone inflicted with OCD so we could understand. Well, as much as I love Nicholson, I hated Melvin Udall. The longer the movie went on, the more I rooted for Helen Hunt's character to just move away and not leave a forwarding address. My read of Nicholson's character was not, first and foremost, a sick man: it was a total b******.Now, I know the idea of his character was an anti-hero who finds redemption. But I couldn't root for him, so he wasn't an anti-hero; what's more, at the end he wasn't redeemed-in fact he was rewarded for bad behavior. (I'm sorry, but OCD patients are not required to be offensive. Some of the behavior, such as locking the door and bringing one's own silverware, are true to OCD people. But finding any offensive remark to make about another person has nothing to do with OCD and everything to do with just being a caustic person.) He was still the same jerk, he just found someone willing to put up with it. Hooray for him.What I'm basically trying to say is that the movie didn't work for me-I feel that it fell short of its goal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching or Tragic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are we bothered at the end of the film that nothing is really resolved between Melvin and Carol? Melvin will still be an obsessive compulsive and Carol will still be taking midnight trips to the hospital with Spencer. I find that to be an incredibly tragic element to the film. The fact that both characters found each other is touching, but Brooks structures it to show us that while there are happy endings, there's still reality.The brilliance of the film also lies within the simple fact that this is not a comedy. While Nicholson has many snappy one-liners and insult jokes at the expense of Greg Kinnear's Simon, the film is still as tragic and as deep as one of Shakespeare's sonnets. When Nicholson learns that Verdell is to be taken away from him, he's lost something that he has grown attached to and for a man in his position, it is loss at the deepest level. Verdell represents harmony for Melvin. Melvin is in harmony with the world when Verdell is around. There is a kinship between Verdell and Melvin that is quite lovely, but also quite tragic. As the film progresses, Carol represents harmony, thus their strong relationship emerges. Both Melvin and Carol are two lost souls searching not for the right answers, but for a place to start the search for the right answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How Titanic beat both this and L.A. Confidential for Picture is unfathomable. There is more romance in the line I quoted from As Good As It Gets in the subject line than Titanic has in the whole of the movie. This film has more (and better) quality performances from its cast (even the bit roles), a better script, equally good or better production values (save for special effects) and will likely stand the test of time more solidly than Titanic. Jack Nicholson chews the scenery (so what else is new?), but the character is off-the-wall in the first place. Helen Hunt gives the performance of her career. The script is intelligent, funny, tender and biting-a solid piece of work. Big overblown epic beats solid character study most of the time, sadly. Well worth seeing. Most recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cranky misogynist, an adorable dog, cute female lead, and a gay neighbor combined to produce a boring, disappointing piece of junk. I rented this for my late wife, who loved Nicholson, and I knew something was wrong when she sat stone faced through it, just as I did. Most of the film I could see what was coming down the track, but rather than surprise me, Brooks kept the train on schedule. Both wife and I got to the point where we did not want to see Nicholson redeemed, but we weren't spared.....and his redemption seemed so sudden, so 'hey it's time to be Mr. Nice now.'Of course we had that scene so beloved of directors: three people sitting in convertible, motoring down the highway with the top down, doing a sedate 35-40, and holding a normal conversation instead of trying to shout over the wind. 27 years before this excretion, Nicholson played the young Jonathan Fuerst in Carnal Knowledge, growing into a unrepentant middle age Lothario. Why didn't Brooks leave him that way? But don't blame the writer and director; it is the age which can't stand such heady fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loathe this picture. I'm not even sure I watched all of it. Jack Nicholson's character is set up as an obnoxious oaf merely so that everyone else in the movie --- blacks, gays, whatever stereotype came to mind --- can take shots at him and still appear virtuous. If this were a made-for-TV about a man with Melvin's afflictions we'd all be expected to have a little compassion and the people who abused him would be the villains, but here he's just a fish in a barrel. Really, if you paid big bucks to live in a decent apartment building and there was a dog pissing in the hallway wouldn't you have a right to be angry? But in this film it just makes him a bully who picks on cute little animals. And Helen Hunt (a fine actress, don't get me wrong) gets to once more trot out the sanctimonious bitch persona she's built a career on. Honest to god, I'm getting mad just writing this review. Over and out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully scripted comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James L Brooks conjures up a glorious dark comedy with a bravado performance from Jack Nicholson and a wonderfully sentimental Helen Hunt that rightfully won Oscars and is a complete joy to watch and laugh and maybe even shed a tear or two.Opening with Jack Nicholson's Melvin treating his neighbour's dog with no respect whatsoever and seeing his immediate uncaring action delivers the tone for some dark no holds barred comedy.Greg Kinnear's protagonist Simon is gay, which Melvin is always keen to mention. Where there has been a heavy stamp on homophobia in recent times it hasn't stopped films and TV shows ruling it out, Little Britain and Scrubs often include such ideologies which provide laughs and thankfully, this film knows it is taking the mike and respects the boundaries of sexual orientation without demeaning the character. The stand up at the end shows that sexual orientation is insignificant to a person anyway. Like Dogma, you can accept it seriously or not, and it is simply brilliant to not take it seriously, it is more enjoyable to take it as a comedy, not a drama.Bar your gay jokes there is some wonderful comic acting from the stars to gain some chuckles. Nicholson's honest blurbs are hilarious, Hunt's bluntness with Melvin is charismatic and though his character can be annoying, Kinnear brings a slice of depression humour to the picture.Sex, romance, bullying, robbery, dog bashing, obsessive compulsive disorder, racism and in general any ordinary situation like ordering food gets a full out comic depiction that is simply great. In a world that is confounded by rules it is great to see some people like to break them.The plot itself keeps itself interesting through some cheeky styling of character development. Melvin is a cynical uncaring man and through a reluctant helpful act starts to learn the foundation of good will.Hunt's Carol is also given a working over through some tough speeches of honesty and integrity that generate the soft side of the picture.Her son with the illness is very touching and the improvement in time may well make you cry owing to some carefully thought out dialogue and scripting. From laying in bed, to attending school to playing football this slow progression of health to happiness is well and truly heart warming.Nicholson is fantastic giving us that glorious knowing too much grin and Hunt is a shining mum figure and the supporting cast add some extra ounces of comedy and drama.Brookes provides us with a glorious selection of scenes depicting the hard nature of OCD that all work out to make this a perfect orchestra of a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems to have missed its mark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curmudgeonly Jack Nicholson softens to his world in this lovely piece of dramatic drivel. I'm not into dramas so I can't say I enjoyed this as much as most who would bother to review it. Aside from that, however, I find this well written, affectionate, and in possession of heart and soul. Helen Hunt is sweet and natural in her portrayal, but then again, I usually DO like her.This work is entirely story driven, and, as a result, spends a lot of time on character development, story enriching sub-plots, and an elevated overall execution of the dramatic element. Nicholson is as good in the dramatic roles as he ever was. His adroit dramatic talents are what make his horror/action attempts so good.This movie is supposed to teach you that love and matters of the heart should rule the day. For me, though, it seems to have missed its mark. It seems to me that without money, the "miracles" of this film could not have taken place. So rather than teaching that heart is the answer, it teaches that money is the answer, for without money, nothing Nicholson's character wanted to do for ANYone would have been possible. Otherwise, it was moderately entertaining.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"As Good As It Gets" does not take the standard romance/comedy approach as it is almost a drama; very thoughtful and puts value on developed characterization. However, it occasionally drops down to the standard romance/comedy level. It is flawed by clichs and some cheesy and kitschy scenes. Parts of the movie are very funny (favorite line is when Melvin introduces Carol to Simon: "Carol the waitress, Simon the fag") and Jack Nicholson's performance is great.It's a good comedy and is worth watching. The IMDb-rating is a bit too high. If you expect to watch a movie that deserves a score of almost 8, you might be disappointed. If you expect a standard chick flick this movie will surprise you in a positive way.Better than standard comedy/romance --- funny! *** 6.0/10 ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I racked my brain trying to decide whether I liked it or not. It has confused me for years, but finally I have figured it out. Thank you Mr. Nicholson for helping me with my dilemma. So here it goes, the movie SUCKS!!! Jack Nicholson is great (as always) and saves it. So you might applaud the fine performance by Mr. Nicholson, but realize the movie is annoying and repetitive. If you remove all the unnecessary parts you will have a movie that lasts about 45 minutes. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are OK but without good ol Mr. Nicholson this movie would'nt even be a good chick flick. Only Mr. Nicholson could be as rude as he is, tell a lady that her son is going to die and yet be able to date her at the end. Where in the world do you find women like this? Maybe this a gift that only Mr. Nicholson has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why people like this movie, it's the most uncomfortable movie of all time. Not one scene in this movie clicks, all the actors look like they are expecting someone to come out of nowhere and start blasting away with a shotgun at any second. There's this one scene that's so stupid and hammy, it's when Greg Kinnear is sitting in his apartment and these thugs come in and suddenly Kinnear starts saying: "oh no, oh no" repeatedly. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. How could he know they were going to beat the stuffing out of him? In another scene, plain-faced Helen Hunt is arguing with her mother, and suddenly Hunt says "what do you want mom? What do you want mom?" There is no basis for her verbal attack on her mother, it comes out of nowhere, the movie just keeps switching around all over the place like some twitchy drug addict. Then when Lisa Simpson sits down with the flash cards to talk to Kinnear, the whole scene between them is so clumsy and ham-handed that I'm convinced Brooks went to McDonalds and told everyone to just keep filming while he was gone, and that it would turn out all right.There were a couple of things in this movie that were just too precious, the fist one being Hunt's date. They go back to her place and start to get romantic, then her son has an asthma attack or something and her date gets all turned off and leaves. HELLO? Didn't she think for a minute and say "oh, I have a kid" before they agreed to a date? Or maybe she's in the habit of bringing home strange men, I don't know. Another thing that annoys me is when Hunt runs down the sidewalk yelling Melvin's name to get the cab. It doesn't make any sense, there are cabs everywhere in NYC, and as far as I could see it wasn't rush hour. Why did she run all the way down the sidewalk just to get his cab? And how would she even know that he was getting a cab in the first place? So stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one actor that has done a very good job in almost all the movies he ever played in, than it must be Jack Nicholson. He's one of the most constant actors I know off and with this movie he proves his many talents once again...This time he is Melvin Udall, a cranky, selfish, extremely rude and obsessive-compulsive writer who hates everybody and everything, especially his homosexual neighbor with his cute little dog. When his neighbor has been brutally beaten and needs to be hospitalized, Melvin is entrusted to the care of the dog he hates so much. His entire life is turned upside down and to make things worse: the only waitress who tolerated him at the only restaurant where he eats his daily breakfast, needs to leave work to care for her sick son, making it from then on impossible for Melvin to eat his breakfast. All this makes him realize that perhaps he needs others for more than just selfish reasons...Of course you could say that this is yet another sentimental, romantic comedy / drama, like we have seen so many more before and in a way that is true. But it is mainly thanks to the cast's and especially Jack Nicholson's excellent performance, that this movie is lifted above the average in the genre. I'm sure that there aren't many actors who are able to make Melvin a person who you love to hate at first, but who also has something likable about him. Jack Nicholson is one of those actors and he really did a very nice job in this movie. But next to the excellent acting, I must also admit that the story was well-written and that the humor worked perfectly. Sure it is all quite predictable: It's the typical stuff of people who are each-others opposites, but start accepting and even liking each other in the end. But the thing is that it works very well this time and that's all that matters to me when I'm watching a movie. Somehow the writer and director have found a way to make it all more than just bearable or watchable. They have made a fine comedy out of it and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stand-out film in many ways, but ultimately unnecessary ; I recommend watching this once, but repeat performances may seem paltry. All elements of film are here in good form; good acting, good structure, good angles, whatnot. But, in the end, a romantic comedy is just that, and there's nothing here you haven't seen, save perhaps a wider age difference between leads, which is by no means that rare in Hollywood these days anyhow. Good performances, especially by minor players like Cuba Gooding, Jr., light up this film. Helen Hunt, however, is a sorry excuse for Oscar winner in her role. Not so much that she made a lot of mistakes, but the role is a simple one that anyone can play. There are no stretches, no real grit, and certainly no punch. She's as interesting as her apron.All things considered, a good film, but not exceptional. It effects the soul like an after-dinner mint: refreshing, but brief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but sends confusing messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the 2004 Oscars over, I decided to take a look at some movies in the past that had won multiple Oscars. One of those movies was "As Good As It Gets." I knew that both Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt had won Oscars for their performances. Yet at the same time I didn't know what to think of their romantic pairing, and I only knew the basic plotline. What I saw was a decent movie that often got lost and confused in the messages it was trying to portray.First of all, however, this movie was a comedy and did often succeed in being humorous. Also, Hans Zimmer did an excellent job of scoring the movie with a score that matched both the humorous and dramatic aspects of the movie. I was impressed, furthermore, by Hunt's and Nicholson's performances, as I feel they did their best with the material that they were given with which to work.Nevertheless, I felt that material was sometimes a little weak and too often lost in its own complexity. The characters were made to be very complex, and they are seen to be intricate as they change and progress through the movie. Yet the changes they go through often seem rushed and out-of-character. Plus, the message that each event sends to the viewer often gets lost from the screenplay to the actors to the screen. However, the advantage of these often confusing complexities is that they do not cause mindless pleasure, but instead provide thought-provoking cinema.Altogether a very good effort.Final Grade: B+.</fullReview>

The fact thatSimon Bishop cared so much about his face after he was assaulted alsobothered me. The most troubling is the subtext of his artistic expression. Drawing attractive, potentially sexual, young men leads to danger, physicaland emotional harm, and maybe death. But drawing someone of theopposite sex, such as the scene where he draws Carol, is liberating, andunlocks the secret of his artistic self. In the end, Bishop gets to be alone, and another gorgeous, young woman hooks up with a scraggly, old man. Yes, I hope everyone has noticed that this film just wouldn't work inHollywood if a beautiful young man hooks up with some old hag.

		<fullReview>Films that exploit mental illness as a comic device make me very uneasy. As Good As It Gets is no exception. The Jack Nicholson character, reclusive writer Melvin Udall, is a deeply disturbed individual in dire need of his medication and some intensive therapy. His compulsive, antisocial behavior is sad and disturbing, neither cute nor funny. Director James L. Brooks co-wrote the script, which insists that Melvin Udall's sickness is merely a lovable quirk. The romantic comedy, which never rises much above a sitcom mentality, consistently throws plausibility to the wind. It is a stretch to believe that these characters would ever speak to each other, let alone take trips together, share rooms and become romantically or buddy/buddy involved. The likable Helen Hunt, a refugee from network television, steals the show and has even scored with Academy voters. Jack Nicholson resorts to his familiar mugging as the obsessive Melvin. Greg Kinnear, another TV transplant, has been inexplicably honored by the Academy for his functional but less-than-exceptional portrayal of the gay neighbor, Simon. What happened to the rest of Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s role? Don't Baltimore hotel bathrooms come equipped with doors?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An A for Effort"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy acting is difficult, but not nearly as much as comedy writing. For that reason I tend to give special appreciation to comedy efforts. We need laughs in our lives, and I certainly want to encourage projects in which humor plays a part. "As Good As It Gets" features comedy, along with drama and romance. Jack Nicholson heads a hard-working cast in a script that tries hard to be successful. It has some humorous moments, some emotional ones, and some bland ones. Part of the difficulty is in the calculation of timing by the director (and editor). Generally the style is "slow moving comedy" and it works a little more than half of the time. How one reacts to this depends on the individual; for myself, I found it generally interesting, laughed often, and became aware of its duration. So I personally give it a slightly above average score, and a hearty "A" for the sincere attempt at creating a light entertainment with some subtle dramatic nuances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Terrible as Possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Badly written, badly plotted, badly directed. I felt truly sorry for the unfortunate actors condemned to work with this ultra-dorky material. If it was supposed to be funny, it wasn't. If it was supposed to be appealing, it didn't. There was nothing sympathetic about any of the characters, and they managed to be supremely uninteresting at the same time. I was bored rigid by these cardboard characters. I cannot believe anyone outside America finds anything redeeming about this mechanical disaster. There is some kind of a popular culture gap as wide as the Atlantic between those who enjoy this kind of film and those who don't. Some very great films have been produced in America, but the majority, I would say about 80%, of them have had European directors. Oscar is a very eccentric fellow, and this time he amazed me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'As Good As It Gets' is a romantic comedy film about the circumstances that bring together three unlikely people: a man with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mother, and a homosexual. Each of the characters have their flaws, and they learn to work together and work out their criticisms. That is the basic summary of the film, although that does not do it any justice because a lot of what there is to enjoy about this film is in the comedy and the characters. This is a funny film, but it is also emotional and touching. Comedy and good characters make this film and they save it from being total rubbish. Good, but it's not great. It's almost as good as it gets.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if this is as good as it gets? (spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers herein***This movie is trademark Jack. Jack Nicholson stars as an utterly self-centered man diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder who has his world topsy turveyed by the abnormalities of the human condition. He noted this well in a stampeding visit to the psychiatrist's office: "How can you diagnose someone with an obsessive compulsive disorder, then act like I have some choice about barging in here?"The script, written by James L. Brooks and Mark Andrus, is wonderfully littered with one-liners like this one. Of course, with Jack, who acts like an obnoxious pig that makes you want to punch his lights out, makes this movie all the better. It's something like a love/hate relationship - you hate the guy, but no one else could possibly do it any better. That's Jack, and that's why he fits the role of Melvin Udall so perfectly in this film.To add to the fun of portraying our psychotic human condition, we have Mad About You star Helen Hunt who surprised me with her rendition of Carol Connelly, a middle-age mom who is totally flustered about things like not being able to get any - not really the most important thing in the world (especially with her ailing son), but nonetheless important to her. Plus, she's even more worried that the man who she's attracted to is the one that annoys every single person on the face of the earth. She's confused, and not willing to give in to such a blasted notion of having any romantic interest in Melvin. Carol yelps "Why can't I have a normal boyfriend?!? Why can't I have a normal boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me?!?" I'm sure this situation speaks to many people in many types of different scenarios, and brings up a solid point: How open-minded are we to those we interact with on a daily basis?In addition, normality is something lacking in this film - or is it?. In this film, you have the OC Melvin, the single parent, the gay neighbor, the dog who gets thrown in the trash bin, along with parents who don't support their gay son. This film is in many ways a real world depiction which makes the situations emotionally sound and genuine and quite realistic. Both Hunt and Nicholson show no cheap emotions; they're not normal, and they're not supposed to be (which is very difficult to pull off for the duration of an entire film). Yet, both show why they won Best Actor Oscars; they're believable and effective in their roles.It carries the theme of stubbornness to change. Melvin doesn't like it. How often do we not like change? It carries the theme of truth. Melvin pushes the envelope, even though 'technically' there's nothing wrong with what he's doing - he's painful, but honest, and only someone like Jack Nicholson can succeed in testing that delicate balance. Of course, society backs against such a radical stance. How often does that happen to us? It carries the theme of love as well. Carol is the only waitress willing to open up to our self-centered Melvin, and how this transpires, you'll have to watch for yourself.Life is beautifully depicted in this film. Next time you watch it, ponder Melvin's question: "What if this is as good as it gets?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie for children with a few kibbles thrown in for adults. Jack Nicholson is reliable, as usual, and Helen Hunt is surprisingly appealing, but their performances are torpedoed by a plot that is lifted from Walt Disney's most saccharine nightmare. Where to begin? We start with a guy suffering from OCD, played for laughs, and played very well too. Nicholson is a misogynistic, anti-Semitic homophobe, and an amusing one. He has nowhere to go but up. And the movie is basically the story of his rise up the ladder to what the rest of us consider "normality." First the dog. Any movie with a dog, especially a cute, curly little thing, immediately prompts any reasonable person to envy the misanthrope who lives alone and likes it. This beast is unbearable, with disproportionately large black eyes straight out of a Walter Keane painting, who actually manages to produce tears when he seems about to leave Nicholson for another keeper. Even Disney wouldn't have dared that. Next the gay artist and his friends from across the hall, the gay guy who is bashed and sent to the hospital, whom Nicholson eventually comes to accept. Half-way up the ladder now, folks. Finally, the woman, the waitress he's been hassling at the restaurant, the woman with the seriously ill child at home. Nicholson reaches the top of the ladder when he tells her, "You make me want to be a better man." Finally the nightmare is over. It did well critically too, as well as with the public. And when Nicholson is on screen, you don't want to take your eyes off him. But the movie falls into a certain, increasingly commonly encountered class: the garish, in-your-face, about-something-important class that really doesn't have much to say. Brooks is only one of several directors who really aren't trying to produce anything else. Ron Howard, Penny Marshall, and Rob Reiner are others. They're more like made-for-TV think pieces than features. (Brooks was a writer and director for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show.") The films are colorful, sprinkled with obscenities and innuendos, filled with choker close ups as if the director had forgotten for the moment that he was shooting for the big screen rather than the small, spiced up with set-pieces and windy speeches that spell out whatever kibble of information the film carries. There is never a moment's doubt about who and what is good or bad. The endings are happy. Everyone wants a happy ending and they get nothing if not wish-fulfillment in these movies. But -- despite itself -- this movie and the others like it raise a quite serious question: Exactly how dumbed-down are American movies going to get?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This looked really fresh in 1997, but the story of cantankerous, people-phobic writer who manages to charm both a waitress and a gay male neighbor isn't the touching look at "ordinary lives" that it once was. Hatred and hostility in the world has now made Jack Nicholson's leading characterization less funny and more despicable (he calls the gay man's friends "fudgepackers" and insults the waitress almost continually). Helen Hunt gives more here than she ever did on her TV-sitcom "Mad About You", but her Oscar-win for Best Actress came for just one really astounding scene (at her restaurant when tells Nicholson off); the rest of her time on screen is spent exercising actorly tics (faraway smiles and pungent remarks). Greg Kinnear, as Nicholson's neighbor, does well with a shallow, insulting role, and poor Cuba Gooding, Jr. gets lost in the shuffle as Kinnear's business partner. The film is long and windy--it's full of comedic hot air--and the second-act transformation of several characters is done without much thought or insight, yet a great deal of Hollywood-ized superficiality. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Torpedoe Intended to Sink "Titanic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The epitome of everything wrong with Hollywood: We're to believe that Helen Hunt's character would fall for an obsessive compulsive, much older Jack Nicholson. Only in La-La-Land.This film fails on so many levels...down to Helen Hunt's in-and-out Brooklyn accent. What could, and with all arguments should have been a dark drama, instead, under the direction of James L. Brooks, decides to compete in the genre of "Romantic Comedy." Going for all the laughs, we're expected to believe that a waitress, who has an asthmatic son, is going to endear herself to a person who everyone hates waiting on...so much so that she decided to take a road trip with that person, accompanied by a gay man, who is the neurotic's neighbor--who has nothing to endear himself to the obsessive compulsive, other than his fairy jokes and insults. Oh, sure, Jack insists on taking Helen's kid to the hospital, but, outside of that, who cares? More unbelievable than Madonna playing a virgin, this film forces us to suspend our disbelief too many times for any free thinking individual to take it seriously.Sure--Hunt and Nicholson walked home with Oscars...but, look at what they had to compete with. And, where is Helen Hunt anyway? Now that the overrated "Mad About You" has become Trivial Pursuit fodder, her career hasn't exactly taken off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the story is contrived, not even slightly realistic, nor is it beleivable that Carol the waitress would be in the least bit attracted to Melvin. However Nicholson turns in one of his most unforgettable performances in years. His neurotic, self-serving, obsessive compulsive behavior is amazing to watch. His crass comments and facial expressions are brilliantly acted. I suppose Helen Hunt did the best she could with what she had to work with for her character, but nobody flip-flops that much in one movie. One minute she hates him, the next she loves him... Yeah, sure the guy is sick and he needs help. But he's a total jerk! It must have been a really weak year for female leads for her to have won. Greg Kinnear deserved to win best supporting actor more than Helen Hunt deserved her best actress award. I also enjoyed the too few scenes with Cuba Gooding, one of the most charismatic young actors going. Nicholson however carries this thing on his back. Another well deserved Oscar for Jack!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huge Emotions Interpreter-director's another relationship-rally goes wrong in one detail and with that in everything: Jack Nicholson's mean and racist s.o.b. is GENUINELY sick person, having compulsive neurosis disorder or something like that. Not so much though that he'd be permanently committed or that Helen Hunt's good-looking (and seemingly sane) thirty-something waitress wouldn't fall for the bastard. He's been the way he is 50 years or so, he have had some treatment, seen shrinks etc, so he's not going to improve. He is and will be sick in his mind in the most unbearable way. But Hunt's character just couldn't do better. Very believable. But in the end, and putting it all together, I guess the movie's real message is that even an ignorant and disliked hetero male still succeeds in this world of ours over single-parent mothers and homosexuals. At least Nicholson's character seems to be economically stable and even "satisfied" by he's own standards. He has the privilege to safely assume in his state of mind that everything bad is always other people's fault and period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Golden Globe nominated writer/director James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment), this is quite an interesting romantic comedy drama. Basically, Melvin Udall (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Jack Nicholson) is the homophobic bigot who insults everyone, lives alone, makes a living writing trashy novels, and suffers obsessive-compulsive disorder (e.g. over-checking locks, walking over gaps in the pavement, using plastic cutlery instead of ones provided, etc). His life is turned upside down, when both his gay neighbour Simon Bishop (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Greg Kinnear) is beaten and hospitalised, and his friend Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding Jr.) entrusts his dog to Melvin. In addition, the only waitress at Melvin's local caf that will tolerate him, Carol Connelly (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Helen Hunt) must leave work to care for his son Spencer (Jesse James) who is suffering asthma, so it is impossible for him eat breakfast. To get her back to work, he gets Dr. Martin Bettes (Harold Ramis) to make house visits, but also actively working to be part of Carol's life. He gets the real opportunity when Frank convinces him to take Simon to see his parents in Baltimore, as well as Carol. There are moments in this road trip, and a dinner, where he seems to have Carol getting more attracted to him, but his attempt to control his emotions and social interactions are what split them for a while. Simon has a revelation from his depression by drawing (he's a painter) Carol in the nude, and Melvin does eventually convince her of his feelings for her, so quite a happy ending. Also starring Scream's Skeet Ulrich as Vincent Lopiano, Shirley Knight as Beverly Connelly, The Simpsons' Yeardley Smith as Jackie Simpson, Lupe Ontiveros as Nora Manning, Ross Bleckner as Carl, Brian Doyle-Murray as Handyman John, Missi Pyle as Cafe 24 Waitress, Scream's Jamie Kennedy as Street Hustler and Lawrence Kasdan as Dr. Green. The critics say that Hunt is the reason to stick with the film, and not Nicholson, both are worthy Oscar winners, personally I think Nicholson is the reason to see it. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Hans Zimmer, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor.

		<fullReview>"As Good As It Gets" had been praised as one of the better films of 1997. Not much competition really, as the other critically acclaimed hits of the year (Good Will Hunting, Jerry Maguire, The Full Monty and Titanic) had all proved to have been over-hyped rubbish too.Well, there's no denying good performances from Jack Nicholson and Greg Kinnear. But that's really 'as good as it gets' (sorry - couldn't resist). Helen Hunt's character is distinctly unlikeable, as is Cuba Gooding Jr's. Both not really establishing who they are and what difference they make to the story.Taking the idea of a central character suffering from a compulsive-obsessive disorder was a nice idea, and although Jack pulls it off well, I couldn't help but think that someone like, say, Woody Allen could have done it better, and he could have made more of the dialouge and plot. I really didn't care about the blossoming relationship between Hunt and Nicholson. Nor feel sympathy for Kinnear after his accident. The most likeable character was surely the dog.A plotless, annoying, boring, un-funny, waste of 138 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not the type to be easily offended but this film left me nearly in tears at its sheer heartless bad taste. Jack Nicholson does his best, but the script is atrocious - it sets up a series of black-humour situations and tops them off with typically cheesy har-har Hollywood punchlines. I winced all the way through. For example: Greg Kinnear's character goes through a series of horrible ordeals: he is beaten up for being gay, his relationship falls apart, his career has ground to a halt and he is facing bankruptcy in addition to being in considerable pain from his injuries. He tries his parents for help - they reject him. Where does the gag go from here? Even his cute little dog chooses a stranger over him! HA! Big laughs from the audience - watch the mutilated gay guy lose everything he loves! Now that's comedy. </fullReview>

Did he have his oats first for breakfast ? Or is there a deeper 'Freudian' meaning to Jack wanting his bacon? Deep questions from a questionable film.The waitress Helen Hunt. Oscar ? Whoever heard of a waitress getting an Oscar ? She should have spoke only when spoken to.She should know her place ? If Jack wants his bacon he can just ask instead of it being thrust in his face.Now it is obvious that Jack the writer(I know this because he has reams of paper stacked in his flat)is somewhat socially dysfunctional. He also is a bit of a Howard Hughes with his neat bathroom and fussy washing of hands. Maybe Jack should have played Hughes in the 'Aviator' instead of the 'boy' Di Caprio ?I really think he should have been really nice to the dog and thrown the 'Gay' down the waste chute. Either that or given the dog his bacon and taken the 'Gay' for a walk with the dog's lead.What I missed was the US style canned laughter so I would know when to laugh or that a particular line is funny. Helen Hunt seemed a nice enough 'Convent Educated Girl' but did Jack know that she went like the proverbial rabbit. This could be a good Wallace &amp; gromit film ?Some people must have really enjoyed the film judging by the comments but there again some people enjoy the flavour(?) of Budweisser Beer?(US version).Q:Where did the idea for this film come from ?A:The restaurant scene from 'Five Easy Pieces'</fullReview>
