		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's gloriously entertaining film, `Topsy-Turvy,' offers a wise and witty slice of musical theater history. Set in 1880's London, the movie chronicles the extraordinary personal and professional relationship between two giants of the 19th Century entertainment world, lyricist `Willie' Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan. The screenplay, wisely, chooses to pick up the tale not at the very beginning of their collaborative career - tracing its rise and fall as many biopics would do - but rather at the point where the team has already garnered international fame and success but seems of late to be experiencing a bit of creative stagnation. Sullivan, tiring of the seemingly trivial nature of the librettos they've been producing, wants to break away and embark on his own to produce a work of more `weighty' merit. Gilbert, on the other hand, delights in his success and, although bothered by comments in the press that his work has begun to repeat itself, initially resists Sullivan's plea that they abandon their hitherto winning formula.Thus, the conflict between the two men of creative genius plays itself out against the fascinating backdrop of a deliciously recreated vision of the theatrical world of a hundred-odd years ago. Just as important to the film as the two main characters is the rich assortment of secondary players - theater proprietors, company actors, wives, lovers and parents - who swirl around the principals and provide a colorful tapestry to match the exquisite art direction and costuming that adorn the film. In addition, Leigh incorporates clever references to some of the technological marvels just making their appearance at the time: telephones, reservoir pens and luxury hotels with baths for every room!Leigh's pacing is admirably unhurried and relaxed. So rich is the detail of his vision that fully thirty-five minutes elapse before the two lead characters even have their first scene together. In addition, the inspiration for `The Mikado' - ostensibly the centerpiece of the film's plot - doesn't strike Gilbert until well into the second hour. Yet, the film never falters in interest, least of all when Leigh devotes long stretches of footage to showing us the actors rehearsing their parts or having us eavesdrop on some behind-the-scenes salary negotiations or discussions of artistic differences. This is the real triumph of the film: Leigh opens up a world to us by letting us see the fascinating nuts-and-bolts aspects of the creative process to which we, as members of a theatre audience, are rarely privy. He also is not afraid to linger long over many a beautiful reproduction of the musical pieces themselves. Leigh can count his film a success in that it makes us want to rush out and catch a performance of one of these operettas ourselves.The film would not be the splendid success it is were it not for the dazzling performances of its amazingly large cast. Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner are perfection as the good-natured but often antagonistic partners, never playing the humor too broadly or violating the spirit of elite British gentility even in their most conflict-laden moments.Indeed, it is this very quality of quiet subtlety that permeates every aspect of `Topsy-Turvy' and that makes it the wholly satisfying and entertaining film it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film, yet I have a hard time understanding many of the comments other viewers have made. I never liked G&amp;S all that much, thought they were rather light weight stuff. Never liked the late Victorian era much either. Kind of a dull time, I thought. Musicals are definitely not my thing.Yet this movie struck me as one of the greatest I have ever seen, right up there with Greed and Citizen Kane and all that lot. I suppose it's because I like period pieces, and I think it's damned difficult for anyone to draw an accurate -- or even an evocative -- picture of any time that is not their own. This movie does that, and it never even appears to strain so much as a single hair to do so.In the end, this movie is deeply *humane.* Like many another Mike Leigh epic, the characters here are drawn in the round, flaws and talents all on view, just like real human beings. And he likes them all, even the stinkers. Likes them well enough to paint them as they are, not as cardboard figures.If you like your characters pre-digested and redrawn larger than life and your plots full of twists and turns, you might find this movie tame. If you like people, you'll find it fascinating, funny, and true as gold.And why do I rate it so highly? Because it hangs together so perfectly, all of a piece. It's luscious to look at, delightful to hear, and sweet as candy without ever once becoming saccharine or cheap.Some reviewers complained you had to "already know" something to enjoy this movie: the music, the time, the language, the whatever. I say, all you have to know is human beings. If you find them interesting, you'll love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, a brilliant film.Topsy Turvy captures Gilbert and Sullivan in the midst of a turbulent period in their partnership. Desperate to be taken more seriously as a composer, Arthur Sullivan attempts to renege on the Gilbert and Sullivan contract with the Savoy Theatre. While his partner William S Gilbert struggles to come up with something new to write about. Each man, in a sense, is longing for individual acclaim but they are trapped in an entity neither one can shake. The fame of their collective energies has taken on a life of its own and the theater crowds want more.The film is mostly the story of a theater production of the Mikado, one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most famous operas. Director Mike Leigh, notorious for writing on the go, has structured a play within a play to a great delight. Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner are brilliant as Gilbert and Sullivan, and Tim Spall has a wonderful turn as one of the actors, Mr. Temple.Their is more here than just two playwrights. The entire cast is seen as more than just pieces of a production. From choristers to administrative personnel, Topsy Turvy is alive with characters. One of the best is Gilbert's long-suffering wife Kitty. Bereft of children and saddled with a husband who doesn't show outward affection, Kitty (Lucy) could be a two dimensional afterthought. However, her pain at being childless is wonderfully played by Lesley Manville. It is clear they love each other but neither is capable of articulating that love, very odd for a man who writes for a living.Filled with humor and grace, Topsy Turvy is one of the best films about acting and a beautiful embrace of all things theatrical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Martin once talked about he and John Lennon once having a drink in a British pub. One of the regulars went over to the jukebox and selected "Yesterday." Lennon sighed, turned to Martin and said, "Don't suppose anyone's going to put in 'I am the Walrus?'" Martin went on to suggest that as frustrated as Lennon was of Paul McCartney's "Granny Music," he also couldn't deny McCartney's talent and the ease with which he came up with unforgettable melodies.One senses the same kind of rivalry between Arthur Sullivan and William Gilbert in Mike Leigh's "Topsy-Turvy." Gilbert and Sullivan were both famous for their hilarious musical comedies in the mid to late 1880s, especially their early hits "H.M.S. Pinafore" and "The Pirates of Penzance." But the film takes place later in their career and things are not boding well for the duo. Sullivan (Alan Corduner) is growing increasingly frustrated with his collaborations with Gilbert, because he feels he is not growing as a composer. "I'm growing tired of these soufflés with Gilbert and his topsy-turvvydom."Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is feeling the crunch himself. His latest production with Sullivan has resulted in questions concerning Gilbert's creative spark, as in whether he has one. If that isn't enough, the Savoy Theatre tells the frustrated Sullivan that he and Gilbert are contractually obligated to one more show. Gilbert presents Sullivan with an idea. Sullivan responds that the idea sounds like a remake of an earlier play.Then inspiration comes from the most unlikely of places. A Japanese Exhibit is being held in London and Gilbert's wife, Kitty (Lesley Manville) forces him to accompany her. Reluctantly Gilbert goes and, reenergized, he picks up a souvenir Samurai sword. He meets with Sullivan again and tells him his idea: "The Mikado." Thus is born Gilbert and Sullivan's last hit play.The next half of the film deals with the backstage politics and adventures that go with putting on a production. It is here where "Topsy-Turvy" goes into full gear and really begins to shine. Broadbent and Corduner also shine in their respective roles, as well. And it is here where I really paid attention to Leigh's characterizations. The two never had a very friendly relationship and Sullivan was openly bored with Gilbert's silly plays. I always took it for Gilbert being a really witty and good-humored man, and Sullivan being a snob. But Leigh has Sullivan as a fun-loving hedonist and Gilbert being unpersonable and sarcastic. He uses humor as a weapon. The film forced me to look at the two of them in a new light, and more importantly, I bought it.But Leigh's real achievement is in presenting his supporting cast as three-dimensional characters. There's Richard Temple (Timothy Spall) who plays the Mikado and suffers near-betrayal at the hands of his mentor, Gilbert. Actresses Jessie Bond (Dorothy Atkinson) and Lenora Braham (Shirley Henderson) personify the reluctant acceptance of wearing a kimono with no corset. Leigh brings the same care to this period drama as he has done for his smaller ensemble pieces.And care is what "Topsy-Turvy" is all about. As much as Sullivan may frown at Gilbert's wit, he still wants to create the best possible product he can. There's a great scene where Gilbert is explaining "The Mikado" to Sullivan and Sullivan is truly enjoying the story. He's got such a look of glee on his face throughout the scene. Corduner does a great job of contrasting his Sullivan with Broadbent's Gilbert, especially in his scenes with the orchestra as he patiently explains the score with his players.Broadbent, on the other hand, is an absolute joy as Gilbert. Gilbert may not be a likable character, but he knows what he wants and he is good at what he does. He may be short with everyone and unbending, but he gets results.Leigh shows a clear love for the theatre here, and the details are amazing all the way from the theatre set to the costumes, nothing is out of place. He also keeps the action moving in the film which totals almost three hours but never feels like it. That's very hard to do.To be honest, I thought Leigh was jumping on the "Shakespeare in Love" bandwagon, but the films couldn't be more different. "Shakespeare in Love" celebrates love burgeoning creativity. "Topsy-Turvy" deals with the love of creativity itself and shows how people of different temperaments and tastes can still get together and produce greatness.Topsy-Turvy ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victorian England refracted through Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was introduced to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan in my very early teens under the auspices of the parents of one of my friends. They took us to Falmouth on Cape Cod to a place called Highfield, the summer home of the Oberlin College Players. They specialized in G&amp;S and other light operettas.I learned to appreciate G&amp;S, but I never became a fanatical devotee, even with the historical context patiently explained to me by my friend's mom. (It was similar with Shakespeare. The language could be a barrier rather than a gateway.)The audience in the theater where I saw Topsy-Turvy was filled with devotees. You could hear their delight as they viewed the actual performances of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's work in the film. The director, Mike Leigh, through skillful editing and camera work, does an excellent job of photographing a stage presentation, certainly one of the best I've ever seen on film. He uses closeups, and though the actors are using an exaggerated, theatrical style, somehow the G&amp;S material has never been clearer to me; and I've seen at least a dozen G&amp;S performances, including two D'Oyle Carte productions (Pirates and The Mikado), the present-day descendant company of the Savoy Theater depicted in the film. People who have never seen G&amp;S before will appreciate their work here.Most of all, the film is very much about the highly contrasting personalities of William S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, the former emotionally restrained, the latter a hedonist. Leigh allows us to get to know them quite well and a host of other characters too, though G&amp;S are first among equals in this excellent, ensemble cast. Among the supporting players, I found Shirley Henderson to be increasingly interesting as the film progressed, and I felt rewarded when she was the central character in the last two scenes of the film.The period settings, manners, and speech are very accurate and detailed. As presented here, the Victorian era seems physically stifling, with people leading their lives in the close quarters of dressing rooms, offices, restaurants, living rooms, and bedrooms. Even more stifling is the emotional inhibition masked by correctly blustery forthrightness. Toward the end of the film, there's a revealing and poignant scene between Gilbert and his wife which makes this all very clear, and what also becomes clear is how important theatrical presentations were to people then as a means of expressing themselves in a culture which sanctioned few quarters to do so. It's one of the best examples of Mike Leigh's direction.The G&amp;S operettas were, of course, a commentary on Victorian times. In the film, you can see why they were so wildly popular. In that period, I think so many people were so restrained and distant from their own feelings that even the, to us, mannered and wordy G&amp;S operettas were a breath of fresh air in Victorian England. The few occasions when Leigh breaks out of consistently claustrophobic medium shots and closeups are when he gives us a wide view of the full, theatrical stage.Topsy-Turvy is about how Gilbert and Sullivan refracted Victorian England through a proscenium arch. Mike Leigh refracts it again through the camera lens in a way that allows us to see ourselves in our times by looking at G&amp;S and their operettas in theirs. This is a long film (over two and one half hours), and given the subject matter, not to everyone's interest, though it's far more than the specifics of the period and the material. I found it to be my favorite film of the year thus far, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This period film is unique in that the writer/director chose not to invent some contrived plot to push the movie along. It is as if we are simply witness at crucial points during normal goings on in the lives of Gilbert and Sullivan during the late 1800's. I found it fascinating and was not aware of the length (almost 3 hours) during the picture.If you have ever been in a musical, have a love of theater, or have any interest in the 1800's, you must see this film. From the superb acting, to the set design (amazing accuracy), to the technique - this film is a gem to behold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sumptuous Cinematic Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TOPSY-TURVY, director Leigh's spectacularly entertaining look at the lives and times of the nineteenth-century British duo that gave the world such musical treasures as The Pirates of Penzance and HMS Pinafore. Leigh's film finds G &amp; S in 1884 at a creative impasse following the disappointing reception of their new flop operetta, Princess Ida. Sullivan (Allan Corduner), tired of writing music for the increasingly trite and repetitive librettos of Gilbert (Jim Broadbent), wants to give up their lucrative partnership and write "serious" grand opera. But when an exhibition of Japanese art and culture travelling through London inspires Gilbert to begin writing The Mikado, both men see the opportunity to create something unique and extraordinary. Praise for this stunning film must extend from top to bottom, beginning to end. The music, of course, is wonderful and ever present. The costumes, sets and cinematography are exemplary in their attention to atmosphere and detail. Leigh's script and direction not only bring the period to life, but make it crackle with drama, wit, and social comment. And the performances are fabulous, notably the magnificent Broadbent as mercurial Gilbert; Corduner, warm and charming as the more sweet-natured Sullivan; and Leigh regular Timothy Spall (SECRETS &amp; LIES) as a veteran actor fearful that his big number may be cut. This is quite simply one of the most vastly entertaining, joyous and fascinating films ever made about the creative process. I actually saw it twice within a three-day period and wasn't bored for one second of either viewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a violinist who has done a lot of theater shows and have seen lots of theater rehearsal.For me this film has everything - the scenery is more lavish and beautiful than I've ever witnessed anywhere. For me, the interest _is_ the behind-the-scenes view of the actors. The fact that Allan Corduner (Sullivan) is actually a musician (not just miming the piano work) is a real plus. The scene of the recital of his "Lost Chord" was a marvelous musical moment. It captured the atmosphere of an old-style home recital, with earnest artists and elegant surroundings. And the rehearsal scene with the trio Grossmith (Koko), Barrington (Poo-bah), and Beauville each singing why they can't chop their own heads off is a marvelous view of what rehearsal can and should be like. Everyone has learned their words but now we're refining the artistry. The director assumes the viewer is well versed and doesn't beat him over the head. I feel honored that I am being treated as an intelligent watcher. When Gilbert says to Beauville, "I've gone to great length to give you triplets..... so let's do it again and let's ....'trip'", and they do, and it really works, I get the feeling that they live in and understand my world. Every moment of the film has for me a beauty.The snippets of the other G&amp;S operettas are astounding. The wake-up scene in The Sorcerer is probably only a minute long, but each word and glance is well chosen, and everyone is in perfect character. Like the cliché, "Every bride is beautiful.", every man and woman in this cast is beautiful.Another remarkable moment in the film is Temple's "Mikado Song" when he dances, and the aftermath where Gilbert cuts the number and it then gets reinstated by the chorus men and women cornering Gilbert in the stairwell. My experience is that people in theater really do care for each other and they wish each other well. When someone does something of artistic merit, they know it, and want it to be displayed.Almost every moment of this film rings true to me as a musician, and I treasure it. I can start this video at any random spot on the tape and find something to enjoy for 10 seconds or for another hour.Because much of the film centers around Mikado, anyone who has ever worked on Mikado as an actor, crew, or musician will find much to enjoy. For someone who is not at all familiar with that operetta, I could understand them feeling that they can't see the continuity-- because the director has chosen not to repeat things. You will see this part and that part in preliminary stages of rehearsal but not again later, so if you saw the behind the scenes work, you won't see the 'finished product' except in the case of "Three Little Maids."I was left wishing that this cast actually had created a full length version of Mikado, but alas I don't believe they did; all this work was for the sake of this film and it's not a documentary of an actual living repertory group.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of much love and craft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a big fan of opera (of the comedic variety or otherwise), I chose to watch this movie as a period piece, hoping to see a lot of eccentric characters putting on even more eccentric theatre. That was easy, since the trailer for the film points in that direction entirely.What I didn't expect was a thoroughly entrancing inside view of the Victorian theatre. Not to mention comprehensive. Everyone is covered in this - from the stage boy through the chorus through the leads and producers and assistant directors. The telling of the complex relationships between the directors (Gilbert and Sullivan) and the leads is particularly poignant - whether dealing with the actors' considerable egos or their individual popularity among the chorus, nothing presented doesn't ring true.I loved everything about this movie. It's a great story, told wonderfully by all involved. It is truly a film of much love and craft.And I expect I'll be attending the next run of the Mikado next time it comes to town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artfully Constructed and one of the year's best films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said here regarding the brilliant costumes, art direction and acting. The one thing I would like to point out is the misconception many have had about the script itself.Several comments here have claimed that the film is "clunky" in that several scenes apparently added nothing to the film. They also said there was no character development. I think these people need to realize that the depth they seek is contained in the very scenes they wished excised. Which show us all of the different aspects of these characters' lives.While appearing to be unimportant, empty or simple these many scenes reveal incalculable depth and character insight. The rehearsal scene for just one example, while seeming initially to be a little comedic scene shows us the nature and attitude of both the author and the actors involved in their creative processes.The performance scenes are also not superfluous as some have wrongly asserted. We can see the characters we have come to know and how they deal onstage with the problems we know they have in their lives: through expressing themselves in their art!!!In addition the scenes are not arbitrarily strung together but all contain a subtle cause and effect throughline. Sometimes these are reversed as when a cause is revealed only after we have repeatedly seen the effect (as in the revelation of Grossman's illness). Many of the scenes which people have called "tacked on" at the end (like the stunning scene between Gilbert and his wife Kitty) are in fact set up in the earlier parts of the film if you pay close attention and are in actuality a natural progression of these relationships.Even the very last scene when the leading lady sings is there to show us her identification with the song she is singing and therefore an indirect relationship with her lyricist and composer. This film needs to be seen more than once to appreciate how well constructed it truly is</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gilbert and Sullivan are a successful musical team writing their shows for the Savoy Hotel in London. However Sullivan is tired and is suffering from ill-health. During a bad bout he resolves to no longer write for the Savoy with Gilbert but instead to recover in France and then to strike out alone and write a grand opera. Gilbert meanwhile, is showing signs of fatigue ? coming up with plots that use the same devices to the same ends. However the two are contractually obliged to continue their relationship, a prospect both seem ill at ease with until Gilbert takes an afternoon off at an exhibition of Japanese culture, sowing the seeds of inspiration for The Mikado.I honestly had never even heard of this film until the television premier in 2002, if you had told me Mike Leigh had made a film on such subject matter I would likely have laughed down my sleeve at such a suggestion. However I gave this a watch despite the fact I know little (or care little) for the works of Gilbert and Sullivan and worries bout the fact it was 160 odd minutes long! However the plot is sufficiently well delivered to take those who only know a little about the pair to keep up. By taking the snapshot of the Mikado to show their relationship the film takes away what could have been a rough, sprawling epic ? the snapshot works much better. The weaving of the production into the narrative, rather than all at the end, means that both sets of fans will be happy ? there is enough music to please those who came for that, but also enough plot within to drive the film.Leigh does very well, mixing humour and telling drama with the music of the show. The production of the film (and the production!) are both very good and the detail is fine. The cast are all excellent. Broadbent is good as the straight-laced Gilbert and his chemistry with the enjoyable Corduner works throughout. The support cast are all good in singing and non-singing scenes ? I was surprised to see Spall carrying the tunes so well!Overall this is a good film but I doubt that Gilbert &amp; Sullivan will be much of a draw even now that it is on TV. However if you have the chance to watch it then you should push through your reservations and give it a try ? it is engaging and humourous enough to overcome a lack of knowledge (or interest) in the pair's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creative genius is a fickle creature. It is rare (some might say impossible) to find artists working in concert who don't experience the aptly termed "creative differences". Indeed most collaborations, whether the result of clashing egos (Simon and Garfunkel), divergent visions (The Beatles), or plain old hatred (Guns 'N Roses) eventually self-destruct. Therein lies the dilemma for the operatic duo of Gilbert and Sullivan. After nearly a decade of uninterrupted commercial successes their career has reached a crossroads: their latest effort is doing poorly at the box office due to a combination of lackluster reviews, and a vicious heat wave. Sullivan (Allan Corduner) exhausted and in ill health, repairs to the continent to rejuvenate himself and upon his return informs Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) that he has grown tired of the repetitive and unimaginative nature of their operas. Sullivan has decided to devote his remaining time, however long, to serious music. After stewing about the revelation for several hours, Gilbert agrees to accompany his wife to a Japanese exposition in the hope that he will find some peace. Instead he experiences an epiphany: he will write a new opera set in Japan. The question is can he convince Sullivan to score it?Director Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies) is legendary for his attention to detail. He requires his actors not only learn their lines, but create a history for the character: their favorite foods, hygiene habits, and literary choices. Consequently he elicits unique performances from his cast. This film is no exception: Broadbent's stoic, sensible, and dignified Gilbert is simultaneously witty and clueless, while Martin Savage's performance as the pompous, manic, substance-abusing diva George Grossmith is eerily familiar (shades of Robert Downey Jr.). Leigh also goes to great efforts to create both a pleasing and authentic visual experience: from the sets, to the backdrops to the costumes, he does an excellent job of recreating the Victorian era. Unfortunately Leigh's microscopic view is also his undoing.I enjoyed several aspects of this film, but there's just too much of it: with a runtime of 140+ minutes, Leigh spends so much time dwelling on the minutiae of the characters and setting that he forgets about the substance. Little if anything happens in the first hour and a half of the film (one of the reviewers sitting behind me fell asleep) and by the time the film finally hit it's stride I was checking my watch to see when it would be over.If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan fan, you may enjoy this film. But mark my words: wear comfortable clothes and don't go for the big Coke unless you have a titanic bladder. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Leigh would not be the first name that springs to mind when presented with a biopic of Gilbert and Sullivan. Possibly Anthony Minghella, or maybe Ang Lee, but never a director only known for gritty, unremittingly depressing working-class drama. However, in 'Topsy-Turvy', Leigh has not only directed, but written, a fine piece of period comedy-drama.Leigh, it transpires, has always loved Gilbert and Sullivan and the love shows in his highly polished script. It not only exploits the music and words of the great nineteenth-century operettists but retains a feeling for the wit of their work throughout. W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is more than annoyed at suggestions that he is becoming unoriginal and Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) rather tired with working with him. He wants to produce great music and is uninspired by Gilbert's latest libretto.A chance visit to an exhibition of Japanese customs and produce stimulates Gilbert to write 'The Mikado', one of his most witty works (and, it seems, Leigh's favourite). After a lengthy vacation, Sullivan is willing to write the accompanying music and rehearsals begin. This is where Leigh's brilliance as both writer and director shines through, creating enormously entertaining and dramatic scenes while underlining the partners' unceasing perfectionism. A cast full of Leigh regulars, headed by the dreaming Corduner and wonderfully cantankerous Broadbent, are marvellous, with Timothy Spall and Kevin McKidd stealing the show as a pair of complete 'luvvy' actors. It is Shirley Henderson (also excellent in Michael Winterbottom's 'Wonderland') who gives the film a real emotional centre, however, as a widowed actress slowly turning to drink. Leigh's past, it seems, has not entirely been left behind.</fullReview>

Leigh really goes into detail in this movie. There were some interesting behind the scenes stuff as well as full musical numbers.I recommend it to musical theater fans because the costumes, musical numbers, and other aspects of theater were well played out. However if you know nothing about musical theater or hate it. I would stay away. It is way too long for the average joe. Few movies can get away with being so long.

		<shortDescription>The Legacy of Gilbert and Sullivan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in the summer of 2000. This movie means a lot to me because it made the Gilbert and Sullivan operas a keen interest of mine. I had always been somewhat intrigued by the G&amp;S style since I first saw a production of The Mikado. This movie inflated the interest and today I know all the G&amp;S operas by heart and a great deal about the history of the Savoy Theater and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. In this movie there are great performances all around, especially from Jim Broadbent who personifies W.S. Gilbert almost exactly how he was in real life. The movie was so detailed, I was convinced that the characters were actually in Victorian England. Now, having a thorough knowledge of Gilbert and Sullivan, I still enjoy watching this movie and relating it to the whole Gilbert and Sullivan Legacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's NOT too long--and you needn't love G &amp; S to love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's true that I've always loved Gilbert and Sullivan--I don;t think there are more than one or two better lyricists in the English language than William Gilbert--I think there's a wider audience for this film than just Savoyards. The fraying relationship between two gifted artists whose partnership was commercially successful but who lacked personal affinity is an old one (Lennon-McCartney? Lerner &amp; Lowe) and the performances and writing focus on this nicely. Jim Broadbent especially is a wonderfully expressive actor who shines as Gilbert. Anyone interested in how theater has changed over the years--and how it has remained the same--will find a trove of fascinating things here, definitely including--SPOILER ALERT--the fact that drug use and dependency is hardly a new phenomenon. The dynamics of a theatrical company might well interest even those with little or no background in that business, it seemed to me. For those who care, there are plenty of lovely G &amp; S bits and pieces to enjoy. Last and far from least, the relationship between Gilbert and his wife is, by turns, funny and touching--and Mrs. G's final long speech is a tour de force of writing and performance. Just writing about this film makes me want to see it again, soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My only complaint about this film is that it seems a little slow in the beginning. As the film goes on it gets better and better and the end is entirely worth the somewhat slow start.I was blown away by the voices in this film more than anything else. Having heard several version of the Mikado I thought I knew what songs I wanted to hear and what ones I hoped would be skipped. When I saw that "A More Humane Mikado" was in the movie I was less than happy. Timothy Spall is now ranked among the three bass singers who I enjoy listening to.Be warned that while I found this movie to be a treat my younger brother and sister found the parts they did see less than entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful look at the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Topsy-Turvy is the latest from British writer/director Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies), telling the story of famed operetta collaborators W.S. Gilbert (lyrics)and Arthur Sullivan (music) during the time directly before, during, and after the production of their famed The Mikado. A fan of much of their work, especially The Mikado (I've performed it twice and know every note of every song), I was actually quite excited to see this film. All in all, after three hours and a bit longer, I emerged with a sore back, but, at the same time, the memories of a great film in my head. Leigh's rich visuals are warm, vibrant, and full of color, a style of direction which is a large departure from his usual fare. Actors Jim Broadbent (Gilbert) and Allan Corduner (Sullivan) obviously did their homework in researching bring their characters to life. They do so with pinpoint accuracy here, demonstrating their quirks, whether Gilbert's monotone delivery laced with biting wit, to Sullivan's constantly smoking, party boy manner. What made this film so great, was its refusal to turn into a biopic (a failure of 1999's Man On The Moon). Instead of showing famed scenes well known from G&amp;S history, this film, rather, in the best sense of wording, is an 1800's slice of life piece. It's loosely centered upon The Mikado, but mostly looks into the inter-personal relationships between those that work together. Perhaps a little cutting could have saved me a trip to the chiropractor, but, hey, if that's the largest problem, you can't really complain. Be sure to catch this on video, as it's not going to get past most arthouse theatres. It's a shame too; these luxurious visuals deserve to be seen on a large screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Very Model of a Modern Major Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TOPSY TURVY (3+ outta 5 stars) What an amazing change of pace for writer/director Mike Leigh! Instead of his usual slice-of-life peek into the lives of the English working class, this time he sets his sights on telling the tale of the famed writing team of Gilbert and Sullivan. This film tells the tale of one of the lowest points in their career... their latest musical was not a commercial or critical success and it looked like they had done all that they ever could as a team. Suddenly... out of nowhere... inspiration strikes and they embark upon probably their greatest work, "The Mikado." Those only familiar with Leigh's stark tales of modern day life will be amazed at how well he handles a period drama... and one filled with dazzling musical sequences as well! After seeing this movie you'll wish that he would have just gone ahead and filmed the *whole* "Mikado"! The actors do a tremendous job of bringing to life these characters, the unknown as well as the famous. You don't need to be a big Gilbert and Sullivan fan to enjoy this movie... but I guess some familiarity would help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, Rapture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Topsy-Turvy" refers to the world constructed by Gilbert and Sullivan in a series of operettas. Though all the shows are distinct, with only a few cross-overs (such as the return of HMS PINAFORE's Captain Corcoran in UTOPIA, LIMITED) the world they construct is as individual as the world created by Dickens or Wodehouse (closer in the spirit to the latter).This movie concerns the writing and staging of Gilbert and Sullivan's most beloved operetta, THE MIKADO. The period style and costuming is sumptuous and the world created is delectable. Apparently they did not want the period to look too lived-in, apart from a few scenes set outside the theatrical world.The big question first: Is the movie worth watching for genuine G&amp;S fans? Yes! The best thing about "Topsy-Turvy" is the music. The tunes from THE MIKADO are good, but added in are snippets of the rarely heard PRINCESS IDA and, as the end credits roll, an inexplicable instrumental "Climbing Over Rocky Mountains" from THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE. Anyone who delights in Sullivan's music will have a toe-tapping good time.What about the person who is not yet a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, or who never heard of them? Well, backstage movies about shows being put together always have an appeal ("Forty-Second Street", "The Band Wagon", "Noises Off" . . .). However, this film is not necessarily chronological; and it inter-cuts scenes of the completed MIKADO with scenes of the show's development, which might be confusing. And many references are made in passing, without any explanation, that will be explicable only to G&amp;S scholars. Ignore them. Just enjoy the music.The story, such as it is, is easy to follow. Gilbert and Sullivan have labored long to produce comic operettas for D'Oyly Carte, including HMS PINAFORE and THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE. Gilbert and D'Oyly Carte want the shows to continue, but Sullivan wants to write "serious" music, including a grand opera. Sullivan is tired of Gilbert's absurd plots (and he's also tired of Gilbert as a person).Then, after visiting a Japanese exhibit in London, Gilbert gets the idea for an operetta set in Japan, THE MIKADO. It's so good he easily wins Sullivan over (lots of drama could have been squeezed out of this, but apparently the process was just as easy as presented).Then the cast is assembled and "Topsy-Turvy" becomes a backstage story of assembling a professional show, opening all sorts of little dramatic whirlpools in the lives of the cast and crew -- especially lead single Leonora Braham (Shirley Henderson), who is on the verge of losing her job from drink; and Richard Temple (Timothy Spall), who plays the Mikado himself, but whose big number (about all he really does in the show) is cut just before opening.In telling the story, the movie-makers prefer to follow the legends. Gilbert claimed he was inspired to write the piece by a Samurai sword falling from his wall, and this is depicted in detail. Jim Broadbent's wordless performance as the idea comes to him is a wonder to behold. Was it true? Who knows, it makes a good movie; and Broadbent is superb as Gilbert, especially in that moment of ideation.On the negative side, the movie presents the lead comic singer, George Grossmith, as an addict with a needle in his arm. Though rumors did suggest such a thing, no evidence is extant. This presentation seems unnecessary as they already had the minor subplot of Leonora Braham's struggle with alcohol.A few red flags: Though Gilbert was a stern, domineering, litigious man in real life, peremptory with his collaborator, the theater management, his singers, and just about everyone else, I don't know that he treated his wife this badly. He wasn't a heartless scoundrel (he died trying to save a woman from drowning); he just liked things to go his way, especially if money was involved.And the worst thing of all for a Savoyard -- the movie treats the beloved Jesse Bond as a bit of an idiot. Whatever other liberties the film makers took, their treatment of Jesse Bond is quite unforgivable.There is also an unnecessary lapse into nudity. It's not done in an erotic way and the nudes are quite unattractive. Yet that scene could well have gotten its point across without resorting to crudity. What would Gilbert have thought? Still, overall, the performances are excellent, the production values are first-rate, and the singing, as done by the actual actors, was probably about that good in real life.SPOILER ALERT! Apart from the few advisements above, "Topsy-Turvy" might have been a feel-good movie if they had ended it with the end of THE MIKADO itself. Instead, it tacks on a few more scenes of the domestic Gilbert and Sullivan at the end that drag one down from feelings of sheer euphoria. Nevertheless, they do bring Leonora Braham back at the very end with "The Sun Whose Rays are All Ablaze." Wonderful.If you like G&amp;S, go for it. If you like backstage stories, try this on for size. If you want to see a slice of Victoriana on display, this is for you. It's worth the price of admission for the music alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie filled to the brim with girlish glee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most Mike Leigh movies, this one appeared award-laden in 1999 (Best Actor for Jim Broadbent at the Venice Film Festival, Oscars for Make-Up and Costume Design). Unlike other Leigh movies, this isn't a slice of contemporary London social realism but an account of the English comic opera writers (and, arguably, fathers of the modern musical) WS Gilbert (Broadbent) and Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner), from the first night of 'Princess Ida' in January 1884 to the triumphant return to form at the first night of 'The Mikado' a year later.Their successful musical partnership appears to have come to a halt when 'Princess Ida' is unsatisfactory to Sullivan and it closes after running into a heatwave. Gilbert is inspired to write the lyrics for a Japan-set opera after visiting a Japanese exhibition in London. This re-energises the partnership.But the plot isn't really the thing here. TOPSY-TURVY has layer upon layer of good acting. Every character is distinct or odd or larger than life. There's not a dull or uninteresting performance from a supporting cast which numbers Lesley Manville (Mrs Gilbert), Timothy Spall, Kevin McKidd, Martin Savage, Shirley Henderson (as members of the D'Oly Carte opera), Andy Serkis (as the choreographer) and Ron Cook (as D'Oly Carte, the opera impresario - a sort of Victorian Cameron Mackintosh). But top honours do go the two outstanding leads: Corduner is suave and laid back as Sullivan and Broadbent's WS Gilbert is, by contrast, grumpy, critical and loud.Leigh triumphs in the evocation of life in London in 1884/85: there are the latest inventions such as the fountain pen and the telephone; over oysters actors discuss the news of the death of General Gordon at Khartoum; Gilbert's painful visit to the dentist; the staff at the Savoy Theatre overdressed in Victorian finery during a summer heatwave.A corpulent (it's around two-and-a-half hours long) film but one full of things to enjoy. Highlight has to be Spall singing 'A More Humane Mikado' (which Gilbert cuts).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that before I saw "Topsy-Turvy", the only exposure that I'd ever had to "The Mikado" was the Goldie Hawn-Chevy Chase comedy/thriller "Foul Play". But now that I understand the opera's origins, it's something to talk about. In a way, this movie almost seems more like a look at Victorian England, but everyone does a good job here. As Gilbert and Sullivan, Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent are in top-notch form. For a while there, we sort of thought that Mike Leigh's movies were kind of slow, but "Secrets &amp; Lies" disproved that and "Topsy-Turvy" affirms him as a great director. So see it. You might just feel like performing an opera after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film that goes into great detail about the lives of Gilbert and Sullivan and about what goes into the production of "The Mikado". We see the people and activities that occur backstage, as well as the work on stage. Sullivan has tired of Gilbert's formulaic librettos and decides to retire. Gilbert is inspired by a Japanese exhibit that was visiting London and conceives "The Mikado". Sullivan loves this new libretto and the pair of comic geniuses are back at it again. The magnificent, joyous music is an amazing driving force for the film. A general reaction, after the two-hour-and-forty-minute-long film was "Why did it have to end so soon."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Victorian Death in Venice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with Death in Venice, Topsy Turvy is like a long painting being executed in front of you. Slowly, lovingly a description of its time is drafted out in one long mural with uniquely appropriate music in the background - and yet that is the music that is the key to the direction. Few words of consequence are spoken. The director (Mike Leigh) like a painter relies on his art and craft - unsaid playlets hinting of repercussions, promises and threats. Was Gilbert's marriage unconsumated? Did he seek his sexual release with East End prostitutes? What were the consequences of Jessie's injured leg. Why end with Yum Yum's solilique? Also like Death in Venice - however long the film is - it poses as many questions as it provides answers.The cameoes of Timothy Spall and Alison Stedman are - to use a cinematographic term - fantastic!! This is one of the best British films ever. It has ten points from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Topsy-Turvy" is a decent film, but it failed to convince me completely. To be fair, I have to say that I'm not really interested in films about musicians or the victorian theatre. That said, I still think Mike Leigh (of whose films I've only seen the Palme d'Or-Winner "Secrets and Lies" so far) has a done fair job. The cast was worth seeing(especially Gilberts and Sullivans alter ego Jim Broadbent and Allan Coultier, but also Timothy Spall) as basically Leighs account of the "culture clash" between Far East and West is both respectable and entertaining. Since you also get a fine cinematography for your money I could understand to a certain degree why New York's film critics were so in favour of this picture. But yet it has some flaws: Leigh could have easily shortened the first half at least a bit without doing the plot too much harm, but even the more important second part of the film is simply too explicit: he shows us more of these rehearsal scenes for example than we actually need to see. To me, a film has to be really good and moving on forward in order to justify his length (though Topsy-Turvy is with 160 minutes not as long as upcoming movies and I'm not sure whether to look forward to "The Green Mile" and company or not). Don't get me wrong: I'm basically open to most issues film directors wants us to participate in, and I like classical music and this film doubtless has certain appeal. Eventually the fans of the famous duo and of operas will appreciate this one at most, others should decide for themselves if they give "Topsy-Turvy" a chance. verdict: enjoyable</fullReview>

And the truths explored are universal to every aspect of modern show business -- theater, film and television. It should be standard viewing at every film, theater and communication program.

		<shortDescription>Most Insightful Film Concerning Musical Production Since Amadeus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before film in the 20th century, the primary means of experiencing grand entertainment was music theater, known universally as "opera", an Italian word meaning "many works". Opera was regarded as a fusion of all the arts (hence "works"), including the visual arts (the sets), literature (the libretto/story), and music (orchestra, chorus, singers). All these elements were combined to create the only large-scale theatrical experiences available at the time. In the 19th century on the continent, Rossini, Weber, Verdi, and Wagner were the masters of their versions of the art-form. Nearby in England/Britain of the late 19th century, the most popular collaborators were Gilbert and Sullivan, respectively the librettist and composer of "topsy turvy", or so-called "light opera", a sub-branch of opera more suitable to the tastes of the English-speaking world than the tragic grand opera of the European continent. "Topsy Turvy" the film concerns the up's and down's, the in's and out's of the duo regarded by both music scholars and music lovers alike as the instigators of what will eventually become musical and Broadway theater."Topsy Turvy" takes us into the world of "light opera" of 19th-century London at the Savoy Theater-Hotel which sided on the humorous over the maudlin, favoring witty plots over morality tales. Gilbert and Sullivan's operas centered on exilirs, sorcerers, pirates, and princesses with humorous love-triangles and predicaments, all the while making subtle comments about English society. Instead of the tragedy of Italian, French and German Opera which involved Shakespearian monarchs and doomed lovers dying in the last act, light opera always ended on a happy chord with rather ingeniously amusing libretti.The present film features Jim Broadbent as Sir William Gilbert and Allan Corduner as Sir Arthur Sullivan, both of which offer exemplary performances as the kings of topsy-turvy. The film begins with one of their few pieces which achieved only moderate success by their standards, Princess Ida. After the Princess' run, a revival production of their earlier opera The Sorcerer is put into play. However, the creators and the owner of the Savoy, D'oyle Carte, determine they need a much bigger hit than Princess Ida. The trouble is, the dynamic duo is at an impasse. Gilbert has written a new libretto concerning a magic potion set in Italy but Sullivan resists the work, feeling it rehashes old formulas, similar to an elixir and a lozenge of past productions. He fears his own contributions are starting to repreat themselves. From the outset, it appears the duo may never collaborate again.By chance, Gilbert and his wife learn of a small community of Japanese who have moved to Knightsbridge in London where they sell Japanese culture to the English who are unfamiliar with Asian culture. These include music, theatrical performances, and artifacts. They take in a musical and theatrical performance, probably Kabuki Theater; Gilbert also acquires a Samuri Sword. Through a chance incident, which is apparently historically accurate, Gilbert conceives the idea for a new play, a piece which will become the duo's biggest success and their most enduring work."Topsy Turvy" is a wonderful time portal into the late 19th century world of theater, its sensibilities, its ethics, and its dynamics. The world of actors, musicians, and producers are an eccentric lot, not always easily dealt with, and this film provides much incite into their world. In addition to Broadbent and Corduner who should have been nominated for Academy Awards, honorable mention goes to some of the supporting cast, particularly Timothy Spall as Richard Temple, one of the most talented actors of the Savory who was the original Mikado. Spall could have easily been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Also Ron Cook as D'oyle Carte, Lesley Manville as Lucy Gilbert, and Martin Savage as George Grossmith also deserve strong accolades. This is the best film of such a subject since Amadeus in 1984.</fullReview>

The performances are, to a man, excellent. Then, there's a wonderful sense of respect for the era throughout, no matter how insular and bizarre the Victorians are presented. Somebody did a lot of homework, even capturing the Victorian upper-class fascination with all things French, despite England's traditional hatred of the nation. Highlights: Broadbent as Gilbert, every scene; the costume fitting, male and female, for 'Mikado'; the rehearsal for 'Three Little Maids' with the Japanese consultants'; and the stunningly beautiful rendition of 'The Sun Whose Rays..' at the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The supreme example of a movie about show business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is the supreme example of a film about show business, as enjoyable as Singin' in the Rain but with much greater depth in the portrayal of the characters and in its description of how the work of show biz gets done. Possibly you have at least to be able to tolerate Gilbert and Sullivan to enjoy this movie, but if you have any interest in backstage dramas that are both moving and believable this is the film to see, the apotheosis of all those movies that arose from the seedbed of Broadway Melody. For once we get account both plausible and entertaining (and informative) of how creators of the arts actually do their work, though we learn much more about the words (Gilbert's work) than about the music (Sullivan's) and a good deal about the business that goes on to produce a musical show, in this case the first performance of The Mikado. The film is stage-struck and yet never loses a kind of social realism, recognizing that to put on an operetta requires the support of many people who are normally invisible. In this sense Topsy-Turvy is especially humane and even democratic in its sympathies. This humane perspective is evident in the very opening, when the screen shows what it takes to get the auditorium of the theater ready for a performance. This opening, rich in red velvet, has a kind of simple grandeur and prepares the way for the much more developed scenes later in the film when Gilbert and Sullivan negotiate with the management of the company over ticklish questions involving the conflict between contractual obligations and the presumed spontaneity of artistic creativity. These scenes in the office of the D'Oyly Carte company are intense, wonderfully acted, and full of revelation and subtle humor, but so is the rest of the movie, with its willingness to acknowledge that it's imperfect people, not plaster giants, who produce the shows we love. Gilbert and Sullivan are both quirky and sometimes unpleasant. Both, for instance, are vain, though in quite different ways. Sullivan is a vivacious,gregarious, strutting bon vivant, Gilbert shy, frequently embarrassed,and remote, an artist full of satire and yet seemingly out of touch with everyone, especially himself, and when, at the end, he tries to talk with his wife on a night of triumph the film has the courage and grace to avoid every cliché and to focus on the moving complexities of their marriage. And with all this wealth, the film offers many splendid scenes from The Mikado itself. There are no other show-biz movies nearly as rich and human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the second time. It's actually quite a complex, many-layered affair. It is about the fascinating talents and contrasting personalities of Gilbert and Sullivan, but it is also about the creative process and the artistic temperament.There are a number of little subplots that give us an idea of what a cast member's life might be like, someone who was regularly performing in Gilbert and Sullivan's light operas. The movie is has plenty of backstage drama. In addition, there is the larger portrait of the United Kingdom in its Victorian glory, through lords and ladies dressed in their finest, through grand hotels, opera houses and the like.So we get a look at two very talented men as they expressed the time and place they lived in. The words coming out of Gilbert's mouth are clever, ironic, downright funny at times....and not just his librettos and lyrics! It's a very good screenplay. Sets, lighting, design, costumes--all absolutely stunning. Don't miss this movie. Finally, Sir Arthur Sullivan's music is hauntingly beautiful in places. Timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about Gilbert and Sullivan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Topsy Turvy" is a film by Mike Leigh.Allan Corduner is Arthur Sullivan and we meet him at the time when he has become tired of recreating the formula which has made successes for himself and W.S Gilbert(Jim Broadbent).Sullivan believes that he must go it alone and write a serious work because it is 'expected 'of him.As they suck on sugar lumps their creative partnership begins to dissolve before our eyes.The 'as smooth as'D'Oyly Carte arranges a business meeting so that they might solve the problem and their working relationship deteriorates even further. The scene where Ron Cook as D'Oyly Carte presides over there break up is excellent supported by a strong performance from Wendy Nottingham as Helen Lenoir trying also to mediate between them.Lucy Gilbert(Lesley Manville) suggests to W.S that they should go to view an exhibition.He returns inspired to write the synopsis for "The Mikado"-- Sullivan is impressed. This film is rich in detail and performances enriched by historical research. Jim Broadbent has never been better as the emotionally constipated Gilbert.The rest of the cast-- Timothy Spall as Temple,Lesley Manville as Lucy,Allan Corduner as the charming and charismatic Sullivan,Kevin McKidd as Lely(Hysterically funny in the scene with the costumier played with humourless flair by Jonathan Aris!),Andy Serkis as the masterfully quirky choreographer John D'Auban,Martin Savage as the tragically talented George Grossmith and lastly Ms.Shirley Henderson in a stunningly beautiful,poignant and understated performance as Leonora Braham -- are all excellent.All that said: it is Mike Leigh we have to thank for this richly memorable film that stays with you long after the credits have rolled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a few possible prerequisites for enjoying this rather specialized movie - 1) you are an aficionado of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, &amp;/or 2) you have an interest in the theater and its workings, &amp;/or 3) you have a historical interest in Victorian England. If you fall into any of these slots, don't miss this entirely captivating film, now out on video, which captures more effectively than any other I've seen the flavor of late 19th century Britain, from dress to manners &amp; speech. Fans of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan will find that the movie is extremely accurate regarding the historical details of their partnership. My one quibble is with the quality of the operetta excerpts that are shown actually being performed - they are extremely wooden and unhumorous, which is unforgivable for G&amp;S operetta (would that the late D'Oyly Carte Company had been involved with the stagings). Broadbent and Corduner are near-perfect as Gilbert the librettist and Sullivan the composer, not only in physical resemblance but to what we know of their personalities. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie &amp; highly recommend it to those in the 3 listed categories; others will doubtless fall asleep in the first 20 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent moments of acting. Film in need of vista &amp; editing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Segments of the film are memorable. The scene where Fanny (played by E. David) smokes with Sullivan, or where Goodwin (Played by Mr. Savage) learns his lines under Gilbert's oversight, or where Goodwin rehearses with his peers a song with Sullivan at the piano are excellent. What hampers the film is the exclusive use of interior scenes. After three hours, this leaves the viewer feeling overly restrained. Several films segments cover too much of a particular stage scene. All are well done, but the film would be better if these scenes were edited. The flavor of the troops acting would not be lost with these scenes being much reduced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a superb portrait of the Victorian era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance this movie may seem like a biographical treatment of Gilbert and Sullivan; it is actually a representation of a bygone age, employing the figures of William Schwenk Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan to counterpoise the contradictions within the later Victorian period. Sullivan (in Allan Corduner's performance) is the sensation-seeker, Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) the cerebral eccentric. Both are virtuosos as composer and librettist/director respectively, creating comic masterpieces unparalleled since Aristophanes. Broadbent's performance in particular marks this actor as one of Britain's very best; but the design work got the Oscar awards and nominations, and rightly so. Mike Leigh's script and direction are taut and convincing. The scenes set within the Savoy Theatre in London are as authentic anyone will ever see in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Look at Creative Genius at Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Topsy-Turvy" follows a very similar trajectory as "Shakespeare in Love" of spending considerable time getting us familiar with the creators and actors of a theatrical piece then watching how gradually the magic of the theatre takes over and a masterpiece is created that is greater than the sum of its parts. I hadn't expected to see quite so much in the beginning of Princess Ida, but the point Mike Leigh seems to be making is that there's a reason you don't see Ida so often, that it's not Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's best work. and then compares it to "The Mikado."I loved seeing a scene rehearse of "The Mikado," complete with nutsiness from the actors, then we get to see the final staged version.A surprise is that the movie doesn't end with the curtain coming down on the success, but then we see how success affects the participants. I have no idea of any of the historical accuracy.While I enjoyed the whole three hours, one of my favorite scenes just focuses on Broadbent's face as Gilbert, as he gradually gets the idea for "The Mikado." It's wonderful to see the source of inspiration then see what genius does with that.(orginally written 2/5/2000)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Color Feast for the Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's Film "Topsy-Turvy" takes the viewer into the topsy-turvydom world of William Schwenk Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan. Two names who will forever be linked together as Gilbert and Sullivan. The film is an inside look at the creative process of making a comedic operetta. The audience sees the desires and woes of all the characters. An interesting fact is that Mike Leigh's films take a year to produce. He has the actors improvise and adlib around their characters. Thus producing a well rounded character who's 3D instead of a flat character with no charm. With this process the audience falls in love with the characters and cares for what happens to them.This film is a color feast for the eye, each scene is carefully laid out. The make-up for the productions of "The Sorcerer", "Mikado", and "Princess Ida" will take your breath away. The costumes are phenomenal and will stun you with their beauty.Each film has a character who the audience can relate to, my favorite character in the film is George Grossmith played by the talented Martin Savage. His comedic genius and professionalism really round out his character. His singing ability really brings out the charm of the characters he plays. His King Gama is delightful and will surprise you with the appearance of Mr. Savage.If you love music and color then sit back and let Mike Leigh take you into a world of Victorian age of topsy-turvydom that will leave you breathless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the relationship between Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, the story, everything about the movie. Except it doesn't end at the right point for me. We see the triumph of the Mikado, and the aftereffects it has on everyone, and then the movie sort of dies. The pleasant glow you have experienced gradually dies away, until just when you think you can't bear it much more, it ends. That being said, I still highly recommend it. Overall, a very good movie that just overstays its welcome by about 5 or 10 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendid film--it gets better each time I see it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father used to sing me to sleep with Gilbert and Sullivan songs, so Topsy Turvy was a must see for me. I've seen it twice, once in the theatre and once on video. The first time I was overwhelmed by all the details and missed a lot. I found the pace slow. Still, I liked it well enough to want to see it again. The second time, at home on video, was far richer and more engaging. The leisurely pace became an indulgence. I think this film is in a category uniquely its own--the brilliant and affectionate re-creation of Victorian life of the 1880s. The performances are subtle and distinctive and, of course, I love the music. I'm going to watch it again before I return it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I really wanted to like this film. But I don't really think I can fully recommend it to just anyone. I think you have to be a really big fan of musical theater -- and quaint Victorian operetta at that. I enjoyed the film's amazing recreations and all of the performances. But the musical selections were so extended that I was very aware of just how long the movie was going on and on. And believe me, I'm a big fan of musical theater. But from everything I had read and heard about this movie, I was expecting even more behind-the-scenes scenes. This, for me, was a case of expectations being set way too high. Consider me disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Their Masterpiece Operetta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1884 William Schwenk Gilbert came up with the idea for a new operetta which he took to his partners Richard D'Oyly Carte and Sir Arthur Sullivan. It was about a lozenge or a drink which if taken could change the party digesting it into any person he or she wanted. Gilbert had ideas about how to develop this idea into a full story, but as he outlined the idea he was told by his partners it would not do. His only alternative was his first "medieval" Savoy Opera. In 1882 Lord Tennyson had created a verse play called THE PRINCESS. It, like all Tennyson's plays, was politely successful because of their creator's popularity. Like his fellow poet, Robert Browning, Tennyson was a good poet but a third - rate dramatist. THE PRINCESS dealt with a princess running a school only for women. Gilbert, no feminist, saw some possibilities for a spoof. So he created PRINCESS IDA, taking Tennyson's basic work and twisting it into a satire on education, feminism, and medieval romances. There would even be a dig at Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory in the song "The Lady and the Ape". In retrospect it looks odd that Sullivan and Carte accepted it - it was a two act operetta with a prelude (today it is known as the only three act Savoy Opera). Reading it, even with allowance for predominant views of women in 1884, it is hard to understand why they felt it was suitable or would be popular. My guess is that the medieval background appealed to Sullivan's desire for a grand opera work.PRINCESS IDA ran about eight months. Given that from 1877 to 1884 the average Savoy work ran a year and then some, this was a flop (it remains something of a flop even now - revivals of PRINCESS IDA are less likely than any of the completed operettas except for THE SORCEROR, UTOPIA LTD., and THE GRAND DUKE). Sullivan actually was better in doing his share in this work than Gilbert was than in any other of their works but THE GRAND DUKE - Gilbert's heart really wasn't in PRINCESS IDA. As a result of this, and Sullivan's knighthood that year, Gilbert was in a weak position.His first offer was to let Sullivan do an operetta with another writer (Bret Harte was mentioned, interestingly enough). Then he offered the lozenge plot. Sullivan refused it again. He wanted a plot with real people and real situations. Actually that Sullivan said this at all shows how little he ever understood of his partner. Gilbert was not a realist, but went to town spoofing logic.At the behest of his wife, Gilbert went to Knightsbridge, where a model Japanese village was exhibited. He found it fascinating, even buying a Japanese ceremonial sword as a souvenir. It was hanging on a wall in his study, where Gilbert was racking his brains for a new idea, when it fell. Gilbert walked to it, picked it up, and began thinking. And theatrical history was made as a result.TOPSY-TURVEY follows the story of how Gilbert presented Sullivan and Carte with their greatest work, THE MIKADO, or THE TOWN OF TITIPOO (to give it it's complete title). It gives more details of the lifestyles and problems of both men (Gilbert's poisonous relationship with his mother; his failure to have children with his wife; Sullivan's relationship with Mrs. Ronalds - his American born lover). It looks more deeply into the lives and problems of Jessie Bond, George Grossmith, Rutland Barrignton, Richard Temple, and the other members of the cast and orchestra. As such it is more detailed than THE GREAT GILBERT AND SULLIVAN was, but it only concentrates on the year 1884 to 85. While all the performances are on target, and touching in their ways, Jim Broadbent as the stern but reliable dramatist gave his first film performance of international stature. He captures the lack of nonsense in the everyday Gilbert, the thorough craftsman of plays and productions standards (watch him when he rehearses Grossmith and the others - he fully knows the effects he wants). He missed out the Oscar that he was nominated for in 1999, but would get one a few years after for IRIS. His reputation is firmly established now.Oh, about the lozenge plot. Over the years after 1885 Gilbert brought it up again and again in 1887, 1888, 1889. Each time he was shouted down. When the partners went their separate ways briefly after THE GONDELIERS, in 1890, Gilbert approached Alfred Cellier with the idea. Cellier said yes. Sullivan finally produced his opera, IVANHOE at this time. It ran for four months, and then fell into oblivion. Gilbert and Cellier's THE MOUNTEBANKS ran for about as long as PRINCESS IDA did, and since it was not a Gilbert and Sullivan work that was terrific. It can be revived on occasion. Gilbert had been right about the lozenge plot after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading the IMDb comments about TT, one could easily get the impression that Leigh's 1999 movie is a "cinematic feast" or an "experience of dazzling majesty" or some such crap. Seriously now, the comments on TT range from pretentious to wannabe pretentious, not much else aside from that. Having seen the movie, I realize that the discrepancy between what is written about it and how it actually plays tends to be... enormous. Maybe too many pompous film buffs/fans feel that they MUST enjoy an Oscar-awarded movie, or that any costumer cannot be criticized lest one risks appearing an uneducated/tasteless fool. Personally, I couldn't care less how I appear: THIS MOVIE IS DULL. That's the empirical truth I'm talking about here, mind you... (But of course...)TT is one of Leigh's weakest films. His fall from grace (at least to me) started with "Secrets &amp; Lies", a surprisingly dry drama, devoid of laughs, and all his movies since then have been disappointing to some extent. The acting is as good as in most of his films, but it's the numerous and tedious musical numbers which induce boredom, plus a lack of humour. Not to mention the marathon length - nearly 3 damn hours - which is simply too long for a movie where so little happens. TT is well-cast, though, and the visual quality is excellent. However, would you watch a nice painting for nearly 3 hours? You would??... Well, then, knock yourself out with this sleeping pill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not the film you think it may be ? hunt it out, and spend three enjoyable hours getting away from it all.I have long been a huge admirer of Mike Leigh's films ? the brilliant, award-winning English director who eschews the Hollywood system and refuses to make films that will uplift you or tells stories with conventional happy (or sad) endings.He makes films that show us 'slices of life' in England, mainly working and middle-class people ? sometimes good people ? often bad ? but always with gritty reality. He never holds back, and occasionally he makes us feel very uncomfortable as he peels away the layers of quasi-polite behaviour and we see the real people underneath.He shows us the love, the hate, the greed, the jealousies, the selfishness, the egoism, the misery, the depression, the generosity, the kindness, the cruelty that lies beneath the surface in our so- called civilised society.Leigh's films never have scripts. This is one of the reasons he tends to use the same ensemble of actors, film after film. The first part of Leigh's filmmaking process is to get the actors together for several weeks prior to shooting. He gives them the outline of the 'story' and their characters and they improvise the scenes together until he is satisfied. Leigh and his actors have totally perfected this method, and it was only relatively recently that I discovered that all the dialogue was improvised, as so convincing is the end result.Topsy-Turvy, his 1999 masterpiece, is very different to many of his films. For starters, it contains a lot of wonderful, unabashed humour. It has none of the depressing realism of "Vera Drake", a story of a 1950's back-street abortionist, or the depressing story of a family living in a council flat, ("All or Nothing"), or the revelations of what lies under the surface in a middle-class family over the period of one year, ("Another Year"), or even "Happy-Go-Lucky", an upbeat, funny film that ultimately turns out not to be not quite so happy.You don't have to be a lover of opera or Gilbert and Sullivan fan to enjoy this film, but you do have to love music, because music and live theatre is at the core of this enjoyable romp through the life and times of Victorian theatre; in particular, what lay behind the scenes at the Doyle Carte opera company, who had exclusive rights to these ever-popular and amusing operettas.We join the lives of Gilbert and Sullivan when they are already very rich and successful. Sullivan ? who pens the music ? has become concerned that they are starting to repeat themselves, and refuses to write the score for Gilbert's latest libretto, even though he is contracted so to do.Gilbert, brilliantly played by Jim Broadbent, is a clever man who writes very funny librettos, yet in real life he is a somewhat controlling person, full of heavy sarcasm and with a fragile ego. He is furious with the critics who dared to criticise his latest offering. All in all, he is not a very nice person.By contrast, Sullivan, who is equally well played by Alan Corduner, is a fun-loving, amiable hedonist, who dreams of writing a great grand opera.The relationship between the two is very stormy, especially when Sullivan refuses to fulfil his contractual obligations. But after a visit to a Japanese cultural exhibition in London, Gilbert came up with the idea of The Mikado, arguably G&amp;S' finest operetta. He uses Japanese characters to poke fun at the Victorian establishment and this tour de force becomes an outstanding success.At just under three hours, Topsy-Turvy is a very long film, but it needs to be that long so that we can enjoy the many renderings of G &amp;S's 'songs' and also to give the ensemble cast the time to develop their roles and become real believable characters.The film is a riot of fun and we get great insights into how the Victorian theatre functioned. We see the lives, loves and vices of the people who inhabited it, and some wonderfully amusing vignettes, such as rehearsals where the demanding Gilbert directs the hardworking and exhausted performers while Sullivan conducts. We also get glimpses of the other side of Victorian London ? its street women and its beggars.There are many excellent cameo performances by members of the ensemble cast. Pride of place goes to Timothy Spall as the comedy Tenor, but there really are no bad performances.The film is also full of colour and wonderful Victorian costumes. The staging of the performances are so cleverly done, you think you are part of the audience.Topsy-Turvy garnered two Oscars, and it deserved more ? but we all know how difficult it is for a Mike Leigh film to break through to the Hollywood establishment.My only tiny gripe is that as great as Broadbent was, there were a few times when he reminded me of his character, Harold Zidler, in Moulin Rouge. But that's no great sin as Moulin Rouge was also a great flick.Trust me, Topsy-Turvy is not the film you think it may be ? hunt it out and spend three enjoyable hours getting away from it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>grand theatrical epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1884 London. 'Princess Ida' opens at the Savoy Theatre. Composer Sir Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) is terribly ill and convinced the cause is working with Gilbert. Playwright Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) reads the scathing review of him as king of topsy-turvydom. The play wilts in the suffocating summer heat and shuts down. The duo is desperate to come up with a new hit. After Gilbert and his wife visit the popular Japanese exhibit, 'The Mikado' becomes theatrical history.This is a grand detailed Victorian costume piece with exhilarating scenes. It is a bit long especially for movie goers not in love with the British wit costume dramady. The start is tough as the various characters struggle in a cross current of self-obsession. The Japanese exhibit after an hour is enchanting. One can see how this otherworldly affair captivated Gilbert. Then the movie has a goal and a drive to the end. This is a great film but the start could be trim down especially for people not in love with this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film because a friend recommended I see the films of Mike Leigh. Otherwise, I doubt if I ever would have watched the movie because I am not a fan of the music of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan...nor are most people today. Now I am NOT casting any aspersions at the men...it's just that their style of music is out of date and the movie is not the sort of thing most folks would choose to watch...and I am sure that despite great reviews from the likes of Siskel &amp; Ebert, the film didn't make a lot of money simply because of the subject matter. Unless you are Sideshow Bob or some other die-hard Gilbert &amp; Sullivan fan, you probably are not the target audience...but I must admit that it was an exceptionally well crafted film. The film is the story of the making of the team's most famous operetta, "The Mikado". It follows the team from the beginning through the first performance of the play and featues A LOT of footage from the play itself. While this might sound dull, it actually was pretty interesting--particularly seeing the actors trying to play the Japanese characters as if they were Brits! Overall, finely made, extremely well acted...but about a subject about which I am completely indifferent. I am giving the film an 8- -not because I loved it but I must recognize it as a very well made film...one that shows great love and respect for the subject matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Topsy-Turvy (1999): Dir: Mike Leigh / Cast: Jim Broadbent, Allan Corduner, Timothy Spall, Lesley Manville, Eleanor David: Absolute hilarity dealing with two significant personalities in the business of theatre. They are known as Gilbert and Sullivan and this is to be their biggest play yet and director Mike Leigh envisions the whole experience. He is backed with tremendous art direction and exquisite production but the film's biggest strength lies in the strong chemistry between Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner as the leads. Leigh previously scored acclaim for Secrets and Lies. Broadbent as Gilbert is the writer, and Corduner as Sullivan composes music and their art is legendary. They have their differences but it is their opposites appeal that string the production together. They are backed by an array of colourful supporting characters. Timothy Spall plays an actor who steals much of his scenes, and Lesley Manville plays Gilbert's wife whom he is cold towards. She is childless and longs for motherhood. It all comes full circle with the result of the collaborated hard work. Eleanor David plays Sullivan's mistress, which plays contrast to Gilbert's marriage relationship. Leigh pulls off a masterpiece that examines the personalities behind famous British theatre as well as create entertainment and humour. A triumph in production and the personalities that brought it to be. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Topsy Turvy Joyride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact this film has had a hard time recovering its cost ($20Mill) is not really surprising, mainly because it is too good for general commercial audiences. But over the years, it should garnish rewards as an oft viewed and sort after 'cult' movie of particular sorts. Again, I must thank a good friend who took the time to recommend this to me and also admit that I otherwise may never have discovered it.Director Mike Leigh and Director of Photography Dick Pope must be able to think as one or maybe Leigh leaves the important cinematic decisions to Pope, while he perfects the all important people and places works. Whatever their method of collaborating it certainly creates super special results! Rarely does a motion picture look and flow as magnificently as this...sets, locations, costumes, editing, casting, acting, music, lighting, writing, all first class.Mike Leigh tends to be of that Cassavetes school of cinema verite style movie making, often letting the plot develop itself during rehearsals and actual shooting, this can disconnect some audiences and often leaves me cold (except in the case of Wenders: "Paris Texas" where it all miraculously falls into place!) but with 'Topsy Turvy' he seems to have a reasonably tight script, and regardless of the long running time it all tends to merge smoothly, without dragging. I'm wondering if the English running (time listed as 160m) had extra footage that perhaps explained certain scenes a little better than the American version I saw at 154mins. A couple of examples would be the close ups of a medical condition on Jessie Brown's leg that isn't explained to the viewer (only later research enlightens) Also Lenora Braham's 'little problems' seem glossed over in a vague manner during a lengthy interview situation. Could these and other little oddities have been due to post production editing? Some will be appalled that I prefer my Gilbert and Sullivan without Gilbert, but Carl Davis' marvelous orchestral play-out over the end credits may help to understand this. Thankfully, several great CDs have been released over the years featuring instrumental favorites from these melodious works. Others who venture to stay with this terrific film to the finale, may even find themselves enjoying G and S performances like never before. The worst aspect of movies about real personalities comes within the degree of supposition writers 'dress up' their characters with. I'm not sure Mr Leigh is being all that kind to Mr Gilbert in his treatment of Gilbert's serious remoteness with his lonely wife during a compelling bedside scene (letters suggest otherwise) but who ever knows with folk who have long left us? Jim Broadbent (a Quaker educated atheist) is a triumph as Gilbert and Corduner shines as the amiable but perhaps a little amoral Sullivan. Leonora Braham nicely played by Shirley Henderson makes for a scrumptious Yum Yum and it's fitting she has the final soliloquy before moving into her wonderfully moving moon song. Not for all palates, but delicious for those with a taste for quality. So much more that could be said but...spoil yourself, see it! I hear the Criterion DVD release has been re-mastered.

		<shortDescription>Fine, but I expected something more special from Mike Leigh, who has long been one of my favorite directors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this being wildly praised when it was released in 1999 (actually in early 2000 in America). I'm not sure why I never saw it, as Mike Leigh was a huge part of my early cinephilia (Secrets and Lies in particular, but also Career Girls, which has unjustly been forgotten), but, now, in 2013, maybe it's quite easy to see why I skipped it, and why its popularity seems to have faded a bit: it's really a one off. Mike Leigh is one of the great social realist directors. Topsy Turvy, a Gilbert and Sullivan biopic, is absolutely nothing like the rest of his work. And while I think it's cool for a great artist to challenge himself with a one-off, Topsy Turvy comes off as little more than well done awards bait. There's nothing personal in it. Anyone could have directed it. One has to wonder why Mike Leigh did it. Was he just a huge Gilbert and Sullivan fan and he wanted to make it, or was he just a director for hire? Well, he wrote the thing, so one assumes it was a pet project. He doesn't do anything notable with it, though. Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent play Sullivan and Gilbert respectively, coming off a couple of disappointments after the huge hits of The Pirates of Penzance and The H.M.S. Pinafor. Sullivan wishes to be a serious musician and is getting sick of scoring the trifles of Gilbert. He proposes that they break up, especially after Gilbert introduces him to his new concept, which sounds like a retread of his older stuff. But then Gilbert visits a Japanese exposition in London and the idea of The Mikado comes to him. I'm no Gilbert and Sullivan expert, but I am familiar with their most famous three. It'll probably be an unpopular opinion, but, honestly, I think all of their stuff sounds pretty identical. I love The H.M.S. Pinafor, which I bought first (though I heard Pirates of Penzance first). I liked Pirates, which I bought second, but, by the time I bought The Mikado, I was quite bored with them. Anyway, the best thing about this movie IS the music, even if I'm not an enormous fan of it. It looks great, of course. It got several Oscar nods, but only technical ones. The performances are good, but nothing spectacular. As is common with Mike Leigh films, Timothy Spall steals the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A jolly works outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we see an actor in a particular role, it is always tempting to believe that they are giving us something of their souls, even though the definition of a good actor might be someone who seems to be doing this, however different the character from themselves. When an actor, like many of Mike Leigh's regulars, frequently appears in films of a certain type, the temptation is stronger than ever. So to see such people suddenly appearing, not in a contemporary tale of the lower-middle classes, but in a sumptuous costume drama, comes as something of a shock. It's as if the cast has taken leave of their normal selves, and are suddenly pretending to be Victorians; and gives the film the feel of a works outing. They certainly seem to enjoy their little holiday, attacking their parts with relish. Against the rich, theatrical backdrop, the understated Ron Cook, in the role of D'Oily Carte, is particularly good.Soon, however, one stops gawping, and starts to notice the little details that mark this indelibly as a Mike Leigh film. Scene composition, personal mannerisms and dialogue all have that quality of ordinary oddness that marks all his work: soon one is laughing, and in places it's affecting too. It's not Leigh's deepest or darkest work, but I'm still a big fan. What anyone sees in Gilbert and Sullivan, however, is quite beyond me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**To put this comment into context, I'm a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan devotee. For my money, William Gilbert was one of the finest lyricists the English language ever knew. This explains, in part, my delight at this film. This said, however, I think Topsy-Turvy should appeal to a wider audience than the G &amp; S fans out there. For one thing, there are elements, some comic, some touching, in the story that will affect many film lovers. For another, the acting is first-rate. Jim Broadbent, especially, is wonderful, scoring every possible legitimate comic point with his delivery of the kind of witty lines for which Gilbert was deservedly famous. The performances of several other actors are scarely less notable, such as the characterization of George Grosmith, who created the light baritone comic leads that are probably the best-known roles in the G&amp;S works. POSSIBLE SPOILERS---The study of the personal conflicts and tensions betweeen Gilbert and Sullivan is, I think, fascinating in itself. Arthur Sullivan always yearned for acclaim as a serious composer--and never got it, probably because his music, melodious though it is, lacked great depth. For me, the climactic scene of the film, and one that justifies its enntire length, is the shatttering monologue by Gilbert's long-suffering wife, who--if we acccept the notion that the story is based on fact--must have led a highly frustrated life, being married to a man as sexually repressed as he is portrayed. The scene where she recounts her dream is stunning. (END SPOILER) There are many other lovely touches, including a fascinating glimpse into the world of nineteenth century musical theater, so like our own in some ways, and so strikingly different in others. Last, but not least, there is a generous helping of some of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's creations. This may not count for much with some movie-goers, but it might possibly make some auience members into converts. I want to see this again, some time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that my knowledge of G&amp;S is quite limited. I have performed some music from HMS Pinafore, and that's about it. By the way, if you want a plot synopsis, please read another review. Anyway, this film intrigued me from the moment I heard of it, but never watched it until I saw it on sale at Blockbuster Video for $4.99 USD. This is a lengthy film, so be prepared for a 160 minute time investment.It is a gorgeous costume drama, and from what I saw, unabashedly accurate. There is one scene where Gilbert attempts to have three cast members walk in the proper "Japanese style" by brining in three Japanese women. The choreography used before the cast members observed this "authentic" behavior was stereotypical and quite embarrassing. I have no doubts that this is exactly how the English would choreograph such a number (not unlike a caucasian American would choreograph African Americans dancing in the 20s)What is most interesting about this film is what it doesn't tell. There is innuendo all over, from a suggestion that perhaps Sullivan was bisexual (note the scene where he is spending time in the dressing room with one of the actors and him describing a boy as "very lovely") and the suggestion that Gilbert never went to bed with his wife (the scene where she describes an opera where a woman climbs up a ladder and sees women carting empty baby carriages).As many reviewers have said, one feels the urge to go out and see these operas after seeing the gorgeously filmed snippets. But in the end, I don't really feel that I know that much more about G&amp;S than I did in the beginning. The film is certainly worth seeing, and I find it thought provoking, but I am also wondering why? I suppose I am looking for some grand reason to tell the story, something more triumphant and dramatic. But in the end, it is merely a snippet of history, a story of two men and their inspiration for one of the great operettas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant study not only of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan -- their relationship to each other as well as their loved ones, households, performers, and theater management -- but of the musical theater itself. Focusing on the Mikado, the movie takes us through its genesis, rehearsals and performances. It has been noted that for the individual singing roles director Mike Leigh chose actors who could sing rather than singers or who act. Well, to this listeners ear many of their performances in the Mikado are among the finest recorded.The movie is not without its minor flaws such as the scene between Gilbert and his father, but this is a minor quibble. Mike Leigh has developed an ensemble of actors on whom he relies and they have once again assumed new, unaccustomed roles with great insight and depth. Who would have ever guessed that the Timothy Spalling of Secrets and Lies (among other roles in Mike Leigh films) could handle the singing role of the Mikado so convincingly?</fullReview>

The film is not just for those already initiated in Gilbert and Sullivan. Indeed, I knew very little beyond that they were behind H.M.S Pinafore and Pirates of Penzance. In education and enjoyment, this film goes beyond cinema, and into the realm of a living history lesson.Every detail in the film resonates with accuracy and care. Never before have I felt so drawn into a film: you truly feel as if you know these people by the time the credits roll, and miss them more than can be imagined. No punches are pulled when detailing the various foibles in these lives. As real people, they demanded respect. As history, they received it. In this, I believe Mr. Leigh was on the right track.If there are any faults to be found, I honestly could not see them, at least none which make a difference. Without a doubt nor reservation, one of films very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan will love this; those (like myself) who aren't devotees of the pair will still find this an enjoyable look at their work on their opera "The Mikado."The first half of the movie, dealing with the near break-up of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan drags a little bit in places but is still enjoyable. The second half, dealing primarily with the behind-the-scenes work as "The Mikado" goes into rehearsals leading up to opening night is wonderful and offers a glimpse at how such performances were put together in 1885.The music throughout the movie, not surprisingly, is superb. Allan Carduner as Sullivan and Jim Broadbent as Gilbert offer strong performances in the lead roles and Martin Savage in the role of the actor George Grossmith is quite good. All in all this is very good entertainment. I rate it as a 6/10. Fans of the team would probably go for an 8 at least.</fullReview>

Some of the darker issues touched are quite poignant, but - in contrast to many others - the movie thankfully never becomes preachy about these issues and refuses slick resolutions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Congratulations to Mike Leigh on this wonderful "slice of life' movie of a period in the lives of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan. His attention to detail is amazing, many memorable shots of colour and scene formation, some like oil canvases in their perfection. I am a G&amp;S fan so this helps in the overall enjoyment of the movie. The personality differences between the two principles were legendary and he has captured this and all the back stage preparation that contributes to the final perfect "froth" of an operetta. I also liked how he drew us into the personalities of quite a few of the more minor characters and did not hammer us over the head with some quick resolution. Just people's lives, some injured, some with destructive addictive habits, some with longing and frustration - very moving in most cases. In the last scene, I was moved to think that we all get to sing our song, whatever that song is, and then it is over and it is all too brief. I saw this one in the theatre about a year ago and last night on DVD and Mike's comments are self deprecating - all this fuss for the making of a film about a little operetta. But what movie making: we take a chapter out of a life and put it under a lens and derive some consolation in that our lives are not that bad, perhaps, or how can be make them a little more meaningful. Bravo Mike, you are one of the leading lights of today's film makers and this one brings you to a new level. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turvy Quibbles, But Overall Topsy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard Topsy-Turvy was a brilliant masterpiece. Well, well. It was far from such high standards, but Topsy-Turvy was satisfying enough.For nearly a decade, Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and Sullivan's (Allan Corduner) collaborations have delighted and entertained the English. But, Sullivan has become disilliousend and longs to create more "serious" music. The two reach a creative impasse, barely able to agree on anything. It's only when Gilbert's wife drags him out to a Japenese exhibition that the exposure to a different culture sparks the inspiration for what will eventually become one of their biggest successes, The Mikado.Many people will say Topsy-Turvy is boring and trashy. But, I disagree. This critically-acclaimed gem, is, yes, over-long and reasonably lazy at 154 minutes, but Topsy-Turvy is a treat on the eye, with marvellous costumes, breathtaking set pieces and delicious make-up. However, the best thing about this memorable and historical piece of work, is, surprisingly, the two actors who portray Gilbert and Sullivan, Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner. I have not seen any of their work until this one, and their two astounding performances made me want to see more of their work. I actually believed they were Gilbert and Sullivan, which is pretty amazing.Two spellbounding performances in a film which may have some turvy boringness about it, but always manages to bite back with topsy moments of hilarity.I rate Topsy-Turvy 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

If there is a criticism it is that it has longeurs sometimes (the bit with Gilbert's father seems bizarre) and perhaps 20 minutes could have been chopped with no ill effect.Perhaps it is a mark either of the stability of the British state or perhaps more likely British taste that 'The Mikado' staged by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company was still being performed in a brilliant new production at the Savoy Theatre in London as of January 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enthralling film about the genesis of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado", I rate it a strong 8 of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody even vaguely familiar with "comic opera" recognize the name of the team, "Gilbert and Sullivan", but how many of us know much about them? This film fills that gap, and does it so well and so interestingly.Set in 1886, London and France, the G&amp;S team was a bit "stuck" and becoming unpopular after many great successes. The audience and critics were becoming tired of Gilbert's "topsy-turvy" librettos, where someone's world was turned upside down by virtue of a magic potion, or other supernatural gimmicks. Sullivan refused to compose for him anymore, until quite by accident Gilbert hit upon the idea for the Mikado.There was a Japanese exhibit in London, and Gilbert's wife took him there. He bought a souveneir Japanese sword, mounted it above the door, and while pacing to and fro, trying to come up with an idea, the sword fell to the floor. He looked at it, inspired, and began writing the "Mikado." It turned out to be a huge popular success, and G&amp;S continued as a team for several more years.What makes the film so interesting is the thorough treatment of the musical and acting rehearsals, the changes, the use of real Japanese women to show the actors how Japanese women really walk and behave. Although there are ample excerpts of productions of the Mikado and a couple of other earlier G&amp;S comic operas, the real story is development of their characters, showing the complexities of their various relationships, and how they approached their arts.At 2 hours 35 minutes it definitely is long, but it never feels long if you are a fan of music and stage productions. The DVD picture and sound are first rate.None of us really know how the actual characters behaved, but I can't give enough praise to Jim Broadbent's portrayal of Gilbert. A real fine performance.</fullReview>

He should have been nominated for an Oscar. I suspect the reason he wasn't is because they couldn't decide if he belonged in Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor. In any case, his performance is better than Jude Law's in Ripley and head and shoulders above Sean Penn's in Sweet and Lowdown, so it doesn't matter which to put him in anyway. The performances of the musical numbers are good to excellent. Recommended if you like musicals, highly recommended if you like G &amp; S.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Japanese equivalent of Hear, Hear, Hear!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're often too hard on Arthur Sullivan. It's true that he came to think that Gilbert's style of operetta was beneath him (and he was wrong to think this). It's also true that he was a snob. But it's wrong to infer that he thought Gilbert's style of operetta beneath him BECAUSE he was a snob. He wanted to be the next Mendelssohn or Handel, not for social reasons, but because the Italian symphony and "Messiah" really are greater achievements than "The Mikado" - and obviously, this says very little against "The Mikado". Perhaps Sullivan DIDN'T have it in him to soar any higher, but it's a little harsh to expect the most lauded composer in England to KNOW this. And anyway, why ARE Sullivan's operetta scores so good? Precisely because he was ambitious. If he hadn't been the kind of person who longed to write symphonies and grand opera, if he had been the kind of person who COULD have been content to churn out operetta after operetta and nothing else, his operettas wouldn't have been as good. In George Orwell's words: "The kind of man who would write the same book twice couldn't have written it even once."(Another thing often forgotten today is that Gilbert was no different. HIS ambition was nothing less than the revival of English theatre; he longed for recognition as a serious playwright; and in some moods he, too, thought the Savoy operettas were trifles that distracted him from what he ought to have been doing.)The thing I like about Mike Leigh's film is that it doesn't present us with the standard view of Sullivan the snobbish rainbow-chaser - Leigh may very well hold this view, but he doesn't force it on us. He presents the history honestly.I love the way Leigh is willing to accept the feeblest of excuses to cut away to the Savoy Theatre and show us some number from "The Mikado", "Princess Ida" or "The Sorcerer". Leigh clearly thinks that no excuse is too weak, and he's right. Speaking for myself, I would happily have sat through twice as many musical performances, but I'm aware that Leigh had to limit the film to three hours or so: I'm sure he made the right choice. (I AM a little disappointed we didn't get to hear all of "This Helmet, I Suppose..." from "Princess Ida". It was stodgily staged and Leigh merely wanted to show us performers and audience wilting in the heat - fair enough - but if we'd been allowed to watch the whole thing it would have dawned on more of us what a marvellous musical parody of Handel it is - not Handel as he actually was, but the mummified Handel the Victorians knew.)Visually the film is a delight. More than a delight - it makes the Victorian age seem fantastic, but also modern. When D'Oyly Carte presents Sullivan with a spanking-new "reservoir pen", and Sullivan says, "What a clever invention, whatever will they think of next", I found myself thinking, "By jove - it IS a clever invention." If I'd thought "How quaint", Leigh would have failed. In addition Leigh has somehow managed to pull a neat, self-contained, perfectly proportioned film out from somewhere in the middle of the dramatically messy Gilbert-and-Sullivan saga that lasted from "Thespis" to "The Grand Duke". -Oh, and W.S. Gilbert is just adorable. Yes, he snaps and snarls at everyone around him (that opening song of King Gama's in "Princess Ida" - the first staged number we see - is, most people think, Gilbert's self-portrait) but he justifies it by being truly funny; and, it slowly dawns on us, he's not a bad man.It helps if you're familiar with Gilbert and Sullivan's work. Carl Davis has fashioned a score out of Sullivan's music and he draws mostly from works written AFTER the film ends; very often the choice of tune is dictated by the lyrics, which are absent - as when the tune from "When You Find You're a Broken-Down Critter" accompanies Gilbert's tooth-ache. There's endless fun spotting things like that.</fullReview>

There is an old 50s movie about them with Robert Morse as Gilbert and it is not very good but fun to watch.

		<fullReview>One of the ten best movies of 1999 (and that was one good year, mind you)Topsy Turvy tells the story of Gilbert and Sullivan's writing of the operetta "The Mikado." It is also one of the wittiest movies I have ever seen.What makes this movie great is not only the biting wit that resonates throughout the movie, but also the fabulous art direction. It is simply one of the best looking movies ever made. The movie contains many songs from various Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, each masterfully staged in a way that just isn't done anymore.But I think the best part of this movie is the insults delivered by the main character. Not that the insult itself is so great, but it is always preceded with a compliment (i.e., I love your work, but . ..).This is one fabulous movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good movies.</fullReview>

Essentially it is an account of the genesis of that very successful but very lightweight opera, `The Mikado', first performed in the Savoy Theatre, London in 1886. The production problems were not out of the ordinary; the show was well financed and almost everybody involved were consummate professionals who had been working together with great commercial success for years. About the most dramatic thing that happens is the chorus successfully persuading Gilbert to reinstate the Mikado's song `Let the Punishment Fit the Crime' after he had decided at the dress rehearsal stage that he didn't like it. Gibert is at the center of the film as the ideas man who is having trouble finding a new idea. He is a shy, introverted, fussy and short-tempered person with a well-developed artistic ego. Sullivan is more straightforward ? plenty of musical ability, not vastly temperamental, a taste for gambling, a substantial sex drive (or `an eye for the ladies' as they put it in those days) but, alas, handicapped by ill-health. The third member of this most successful partnership was Richard D'Oyly Carte (`Oily Carte'), the theatre manager, ably assisted by his wife, Helen Lenoir. Apart from meetings with the D'Oyly Cartes we see G &amp; S together only when Gilbert is giving Sullivan a run-through his latest storyline, and perhaps this is the main contact they had. Gilbert directed the production concentrating on the delivery of the words and Sullivan concentrated on the orchestra. The cast and orchestra were fitted together once Gilbert had finished. Considering their names are now inseparable it is ironic that their lifetime relationship, though mostly cordial, was rather distant.This was an odd choice of material for Mike Leigh, previously noted for grim portraits of the English working class, but he manages to evoke interest in a large cast of characters, not just the principals. There is a strong feeling for theatre as group endeavour, not just as a vehicle for directors, star actors and the authors. He treats us to several `Mikado' songs so we get to see the product as well as the process. This is offset by a fair bit of both Gilbert and Sullivan's private lives. In Gilbert's case his upbringing by warring parents helps explain the difficulty he has with adult relationships, including that with his wife. Sullivan, unmarried, has an elegant mistress who comes to him ostensibly for singing lessons, but there's not much remarkable otherwise. The source of his musical genius remains undisclosed.The performances are all excellent, though Jim Broadbent as Gilbert is a stand-out, and it's a rich production which is easy on the eye. But like a warm bath it has a tendency to make you doze at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to love about Mike Leigh's blissful epic about the creative process. This film miraculously manages to be literate and heartfelt at the same time, while allowing for plenty of wit and poignancy. Leigh is so in tune with these characters emotions, nothing is left out. By the glorious conclusion of the picture, one gets an idea why these performers do what they do. The passion for art (whether it be Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operettas or, you know, clay sculpture) is what burns intensely in this movie. I'm saddened that some may judge this film as pretentious or stuffy; true, some of the characters are very egotistical, but the tremendous heart of this film is almost impossible not to be carried away by.The whole cast is brilliant, especially Shirley Henderson as the tempermental Leonora. A triumph for writer/director Mike Leigh, who has made one of the very best films of the 90s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. What a good film! Mike Leigh shows how talented he can be. The main focus is on the tempestuous partnership between Gilbert and Sullivan. But along the way we get to know the impresario, the actors off-stage, cutting edge technology circa 1885 (the telephone, the electric bell). There is a lot of extremely funny stuff in this film, along with a nuanced look at life in Victorian times that feels very accurate. And one scene between Gilbert and his wife that is very powerful and very sad.Everything about this production is first-rate.

		<shortDescription>Never mind the why and wherefores...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you DON'T mind the "why and wherefores", this is a great film for Gilbert &amp; Sullivan fans. I enjoyed this movie tremendously, at least what it showed. If you like G&amp;S, which I DO, this movie gives you "tastes" of a few fun productions, even if it did show how similar and "stale" their Operettas had become at one point. So, too, the working relationship between the two collaborators was very interesting and well portrayed. The acting was exceptional.But Writer/Director Leigh put in too many unanswered sidesteps and some enigmatic dialog, so the viewer, even after 2 hours and 40 minutes, was left wanting those answers. Not in a good way, like when you don't want the story to ever end, but in an unfulfilling way, like you missed something, even though it wasn't you who missed it, but the film. And the last 15 minutes of the movie raised more questions, as if the movie had another hour to explore the answers. Perhaps if Kevin Costner had been the director, it would have. (In that respect, I'm glad it was Mike Leigh at the helm.)It's also interesting to note the film was uncomfortable to anyone a bit claustrophobic. The interiors were all tight and cramped, even the auditorium of the Savoy Theatre seemed dark and small. The few exteriors were dark alley ways with camera angles purposely avoiding showing any light at the end of the tunnel.As I said, I enjoyed this movie, and initially, in the "after movie buzz", wondered why it didn't have a wider release, like other successful period pieces of late. But then, in retrospect, I conclude the movie, while wonderful in its imagery, and interesting in its history, is not really that well constructed, and does better as an "art film", attracting its audience in a more deliberate manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOPSY -TURVY is the new film directed by Mike Leigh that tells about the possible creativty that took place behind the English opera the MIKADO. Before they became the most successful opera writers in English, William Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) did have their difficulty. Sullivan's musical score was there, and showed promised, it was Gilbert's lyrics and plot that didn't work that much.Gilbert would always come up with a topsy-turvey style plot, where there would be something usual that turns into the very unusual. Gilbert's ideas of a opera would involve a magical coin, or watch or some kind of a object that's magical. This is what makes Sullivan irritated, he's tired of writing a musical score that deals with some sort of magical object. This causes a heated dispute between the two artists. And to make matters worse, their plays are doing horrible profits, since they barely make any at all. It isn't until Gilbert's wife, who convinces Gilbert to accompany her to a Japanesse culture exhibit, that Gilbert gets the idea to write his classic opera. From there on, the viewer watches the pressure and trouble that Gilbert and Sullivan go through to make thier masterpiece. They show the different personalities of the actors, one who is a single mother who drinks, another actress who is concerned about her looks and appearance, then the comedic actor who's hooked on morphine, and the star tenor who's depressed because his solo number gets cut from the musical. In a Altman-like way, the viewer does get to know and understand what these people go through to perform and rehearse. I did enjoy TOPSY-TURVY in a theatrical sense. Leigh does a great job showing the viewer the behind the scenes look at a theatrical performance. There are great song numbers, dancing, costumes, and acting. Jim Boradbent and Allen Corduner are both great as the song-writing duo who have their similarites and differences. And the acting from the huge supporting cast makes it worth while. But I personally thought that it was going to be a comedy, since it's advertise as one, but it wasn't. It was more serious than anything, but it still does work as a film. The only flaw of this film is the pacing and length. It does move very fast at parts, then it slows way way way way down to a snail's pace at other parts. And I don't mind length of a film, as long as it keeps my intrest, but there were a few scenes that could have been dropped to keep the pacing good. But it is worth watching, especially for those who are intrested or plan on going into performing arts for a living. For others who aren't, I'm afraid that this one be your kind of a film. **** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somewhat slow but worth watching if you're a G&amp;S/Musical fan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie a lot and quite obviously the editors and directors did also...maybe a bit too much. They seem to have been such great fans of their subject that they had trouble being objective about their work. Given the chance I would have edited out somewhere between 30 to 60 minutes and been much happier with the result. There is much in here that is difficult to add up to the whole. Some scenes, like one involving actors and their attempts to get a raise, seem contrived and are not integrated into the theme of the movie-just an aside to be mentioned and dropped. One protracted scene involves Gilbert coaching the actors on dialog. While whimsically interesting to anyone who has participated in live theatre it becomes almost as tedious as actually sitting through a real rehearsal. Pieces of operettas seen in the movie were well done but often left me wondering why the particular scene was included. Historically, much has been made of the difficulties that Gilbert and Sullivan had in working together but this was almost apologetically ignored. The most disturbing omission, however, was the total lack of inclusion of the part that the sharp and biting political satire of Gilbert played in the popularity of his librettos and especially in the Mikado which slowly becomes what focus there is in the film. I would highly recommend this to anyone with real historic interest in theatre musicals and Gilbert and Sullivan. Just be sure to have a very comfortable seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed every minute of it, but the R rating is a shame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Topsy Turvy is long; its plot is a bit disorganized; it has too many loose ends; but I enjoyed every minute of it. If you like Gilbert and Sullivan, or have never heard of them you must see this film. If you hate G &amp;S you should see it anyway because you obviously enjoy being miserable.I have just two complaints, one whimsical and one serious. The whimsical complaint is that I wish the lovingly produced scenes from G &amp;S could expand into full length productions. Having assembled a fine cast, sets and costumes, why not film the whole work, complete with audience, orchestra and back stage shots. I'd buy them as a multi-volume DVD.The serious complaint has to do with the "R" rating (in the U.S.). As far as I can tell this rating stems from one gratuitous brothel scene and perhaps a couple of expletives. What a waste! Otherwise this would be a stupendous family movie. I find it bizarre that Topsy Turvey, which dwells on the creation of musical comedy, is rated "R" and Cider House Rules, another fine film that, however, dwells on abortion and incest, gets "PG-13." I hope Mr. Leigh had the sense to film the brothel scene without the nudity and will consider releasing a PG version of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a G and S fan I now feel I know so much more, not just about the 2 men and their operettas, but about the era in which they lived. The authentic period detail drew me into the smoke-filled, stuffy and cluttered rooms, and by the end I too was sweating with the cast in their claustrophobic changing rooms. The plot took a tad too long to start unravelling, but I soon found it totally absorbing. I was driven to despair by the constant indignities silently suffered by the womenfolk, and the pomposity and verbosity of the men (a bit like G and S lyrics) aroused murderous tendencies in me. The music and singing was a sumptuous feast. It was fascinating to see the birth of the Mikado, from concept, through research, to the first night. The acting was superb, right down to the back row of the chorus, and the audience almost cheered when esprit de corps won over managerial decisions and the Mikado's song was reprieved. I imagine this mirrored the real life scenario of the making of the movie. It was as if so much research and loving attention to detail had been made that no-one could bear to waste it and very little was allowed to hit the cutting room floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was interesting watching Mike Leigh (whose last two films, "Career Girls" and "Secrets and Lies" had an intense focus on the lives of "ordinary" working-class people) take on the task of expounding on the larger-than-life legends of comic opera, Gilbert and Sullivan, without losing his special gift for being able to peel open his protagonists in front of us. Large or small, it makes no difference, Mike Leigh knows how to make movies!In its depiction of the seamy underbelly of the theater world, it reminded me no small amount of "An Awfully Big Adventure", a 1995 film most memorable for Hugh Grant playing the heavy, in which a young innocent, taken with the theater world is somewhat deceived and disillusioned. But Mike Leigh does it better, not only without making us hate the characters, or the world they live in, but bringing us to root for them and appreciate their triumphs.I'm not a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, or of comic operas, or of musical theater particularly, but it didn't matter. I had a good time anyway. Mike Leigh brings us a well-written story, with plenty of drama and personality and comedy of its own. The Mikado is just a little bonus, if you happen to like that sort of thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long movie that won't seem too long -- _IF_ you like Gilbert &amp; Sullivan music, "the theater", film biography or period pieces, and/or if you don't drink a large Coke through the movie.This is an absolutely first-rate movie--well cast, well-acted, great scenery, beautifully filmed, great music but, unless one has some link to the subject matter, it could be boring (see comments in some other user reviews). "The Mikado" has long been a favorite for me (my only G&amp;S recording) and I enjoy it whenever a classical FM station plays excerpts. I sing in an Episcopal choir and am familiar with Sullivan's hymns ("Onward, Christian Soldiers" is his best known); in all of his church music, I hear strong echoes of G&amp;S light opera music.The movie is a slice of life dealing with the sometimes prickly G&amp;S collaboration, a bit of their lives and quirks, the theater (and culture) of that time, and the genesis of "The Mikado". I found it fascinating to see how disagreements were expressed and handled then -- it's such a contrast to how they're often expressed today. The movie spurred me to read biographies (online) of both Sullivan and Gilbert, and while the screen play used a minor amount of poetic license, it was extremely minor. Did you know that Gilbert was the first to be a director (as in the modern sense) of a stage production? I think movies usually can give only a quick abstraction of life and background. This does not bother me. I just want those personality traits to be congruent, to see a realistic interplay of those traits, &amp; consistency between the characters as they're shown and their backgrounds. This movie is okay on that score with me -- and my experience as a clinical psychologist with an especial interest in family makes me pretty picky. It would have been interesting to see a little more of Gilbert's family background, but we do see that -- for him, as for many -- he carried that background with him so that he remained tortured, carrying that pain into many of his relations (including his marriage). It is quite true-to-life that, having grown up with distant parents and not feeling loved, one common result is to avoid having children (for fear of passing on that pain?). It's similar to what Christopher Marlowe had Mephistopheles speak when he replies to a question from Dr. Faustus, '.... for where I am is hell and where hell is, there must I ever be.' The episodes showing "The Mikado" were great and the music superb. (I do prefer my record's version of "the moon &amp; I" to the one in the movie; the movie's version is just a little more strident than I like.) I'd even have been happy if my bladder had to endure another half-hour of music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inherently disappointing about success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is 1884 and the famed musical team of Gilbert and Sullivan is about to break up because they have run out of new ideas. How they save themselves by staging a completely different light opera, 'The Mikado', is the subject of the engrossing film, "Topsy Turvy", which, at almost three hours, will either bore you to death with repeated musical numbers or will enthrall you with the completeness of Mike Leigh's historical recreation. The whole gamut of how a production is staged from the nuts and bolts to the final climactic triumph are here, much like "Shakespeare in Love". We see men as well as women who demand their corsets, rehearsals in which the leading man is more apt to quarrel with the playwright than act according to script, an especially funny bit of micro-managing in which the drunken director is superceded because his 'Japanese' maids aren't Japanese enough, and an as-respectful-as-possible mutiny by the chorus when a well acted Mikado number is cut out. "Topsy Turvy" further explores the lives of those whose talents glorify the stage - George Grossmith (Martin Savage), the highest paid actor who, nonetheless, feels he deserves more because he has to support his drug habit, Leonora (Shirley Henderson) the forlorn and neglected actress and unwed mother who must battle her alcoholism, and Arthur Sullivan (well performed by Allan Corduner) who vacillates between sickness and self-pity and the vigor of playing his triumphant music even as he carries on an affair with a married woman right in the noses of high society England. But the strength of this film revolves around the indomitable William Gilbert (superbly acted by Jim Broadbent), a gifted writer, a stage technician par excellence, and yet a man who is left wanting. Even as he glows in his success, he wonders why it brings with it an inherited disappointment. Even as he has a lovely and supportive wife (well played by Lesley Manville), he doesn't dare share the same bed nor a loving intimacy left wanting due to an embittered relationship with his mother. Even as he feels no sympathy for an impending breakup with his long suffering partner, yet he swallows his pride to do something more daring and creative than he could imagine. "Topsy Turvy" is ultimately about mortal men and women with failings who immortalize themselves by succeeding in what they do best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be fair, I was one of a group of five people seeing this film. I loved it, my wife liked it, one couple sort-of-liked it and one woman disliked it intensely. But I'm the one writing the review, so the hell with them.It is about 2 hours 35 minutes long (stretched to three hours by twenty minutes of commercials and trailers -- what in god's name was the management thinking???) So it does actually require that rare commodity, an attention span.Jim Broadbent was magnificent as Gilbert. He is shown to be irritable, gruff, unsentimental... and a brilliant writer/director who knows what he wants to see onstage and is determined to get it.The scenes involving the staging of The Mikado are the best in the film and, for those who have performed in musicals, wonderful proof that Nothing Ever Changes... the chorus members singing off-stage who, until their cue comes, silently mouth the lyrics along with the leads; the post-show notes where everybody in charge has to speak while all the actors want to do is go home; the actresses defying the director in the matter of costumes and thinking he doesn't notice. All very familiar.It is very much a film for theater people. I don't know that the general audience would soak up all the details that are lovingly included; sly references to Laurel &amp; Hardy and Groucho Marx (none of whom had even been born yet) abound, but I don't think the average audience is going to get them.However, there is always the scene with the French whores with the rouged nipples. Quite a few in the audience perked up when they were on.This is a wonderful movie with a top-notch cast. Just know that it's two and half hours long; don't drink a large coke during the previews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The timing of this movie for me was very interesting, since I first heard about it as I was rehearsing the role of Nanki-Poo for a local production of The Mikado. Naturally I rushed out and saw it as soon as it hit Seattle.The verdict: it's a superbly acted, lushly produced, and beautifully filmed treatment of the genesis of The Mikado. I was thoroughly entertained. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have problems - for example, the whole bit of Gilbert's sword falling off the wall is *very* apocryphal. It's a neat story, and it's interesting visually, but it just plain didn't happen. Gilbert's coldness toward his wife seemed thrown in simply as a way to contrast Sullivan's philandering. I don't know much about historically accurate performance practice, but quite frankly, I didn't particularly think their "production" of The Mikado was too much to write home about. In addition, Richard D'Oyly Carte's contribution to the process was severely minimized, and in reality, he had his hands on everything that happened under the Savoy's roof.Still, there's a more significant problem, and I think it's the same one that hits movies like Noises Off! - if you don't understand the source material and/or the types of people involved, you're not going to "get" the movie. I saw this with a friend whose only previous exposure to G&amp;S was half of one of my Mikado performances, and he was bored out of his mind. That's fine with me, I got all of the in-jokes and had a wonderful time, but I don't think Topsy-Turvy achieves the same kind of universal appeal that something like Amadeus manages to hit - at least not in the States. In England, where G&amp;S are national treasures, it'll probably have a bit more resonance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Topsy-Turvy is an excellent film that just misses greatness. The basic historical facts should make for a "can't miss" movie--the collaboration between William Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan to produce the wonderful G&amp;S operettas. Topsy-Turvy concentrates on the first production of the "Mikado," but there are excerpts from some of the other operettas as well. The theatrical scenes are wonderful. Even better are the scenes of Gilbert working with the actors to transform his words and Sullivan's music into a living, breathing production. However, the movie is too long. The setting up of character takes forever. (Well, about a half-hour, but it seems like forever.) There are casual subplots--actors then as now had various emotional, social, and medical problems-- but these generally lead nowhere. There is a scene of gratuitous nudity that belonged in another movie. None of these problems is monumental, but taken together they drag down the production. Still, I am glad I saw Topsy-Turvy, and would recommend it. (For G&amp;S aficionados, it is a must!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare film exposé of the creative process.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of feeling for much of the second half like a less accessible version of Forty Second Street, Mike Leigh's new film must count as his best. Blessed with sumptuous sets and a 'made to be filmed' slice of 19th Century cultural life, he has worked his special magic in making an enormous cast of unpleasant characters seem wholly lovable. Best of all is Jim Broadbent as Gilbert directing a simple scene in a rehearsal room. There has been no better filmic representation of the joint creative process since La Nuit Americaine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Topsy Turvy" had several great dramatic moments - Gilbert (great performance by Jim Broadbent) faces the opera troupe, they are unhappy about a cut he made in the text of the "Mikado"; the secret behind Grossmith's (Martin Savage) "illness" is revealed; D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook) hires the cast for the new opera, stepping very carefully and skillfully about the large egos of his players. The movie also contains breathtaking moments of musical theater, such as the first excerpt from the "Mikado" and the closing scene of the film. Why, then, was this work not fully satisfying? First, it only 'gets going' once the fateful visit of the Gilberts to the Japanese exhibit takes place. Much of what happens up to this point drags on, as if Leigh wanted to make sure we got all the background necessary before we are considered "ready" to see his movie. Second, there are too many side stories that go nowhere. The relationship between Gilbert and his parents (including the odd scene with Gilbert's father) is presented but not explored; the pain of Gilbert's wife (Lesley Manville) is "tacked on" at the end with no dramatic development. There seems to be a bit too much here, and in spite of the length of the film, potentially-interesting material does not get developed properly. Still, the movie is a marvel to the eyeand the ear, and in spite of the "pale spots" it is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie about a topsy turvy world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing about the Mike Leigh movies I have seen is that you cant really tell from the performances who they are about -- all the characters here, from Gilbert and Sullivan to the boy who makes stage calls seem like real people, with real lives. The movie is about a web of relationships, not a main character. It is also a topsy turvy world -- Gilbert and Sullivan seem to toss of these lighthearted entertainments, but in truth, they and all the other characters struggle with great tragedies and challenges. As the film winds down, one thinks it is another story of pulling together a hit, like Shakespeare in Love, or countless backstage dramas, however well done. But in the closing scenes we are reminded that not only the Mikado, but this comforting illusion are fiction. Movies like this (and American Beauty, for example) are more like books than they are like much of the fluff in popular movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but why make it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything in TOPSY TURVY is excellent -- acting, directing, cinematography, music -- but it all begs one lingering question: why bother making a movie when there's no story?TOPSY TURVY focuses on a segment of the lives and work of Gilbert and Sullivan, theatrical collaborators who didn't like one another and were of opposite dispositions. This would set the stage for a blisteringly funny story, but weirdly TOPSY TURVY only occasionally brings the two together on screen. Instead, the film flits among several characters, including the Savoy Theater's producers, chorus members, actors in the troupe, but never finds in them a compelling intention upon which to build a story.Although the writer-director, Mike Leigh, clearly loves the life of the theater, TOPSY TURVY never attempts to be more than a sentimental postcard of a long-gone theatrical era. You may find yourself, like me, admiring the wonderful acting (especially from the film's leads, Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner) and the precise production design, but checking your watch and praying that they would all just hurry up and get it over with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just didn't feel it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then, a film comes along that, for whatever reason, be it a detail of story, an interesting setting, or a personal connection, makes me want to love it even before I get a chance to see it. When I don't love it, it's among the most disheartening of experiences a moviegoer can have. Such was my experience with Mike Leigh's "Topsy-Turvy", a film that springboards from a wonderful premise, but, in the end, just falls short for me.W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan composed some of the most beloved comic operas of all time, from "The Pirates of Penzance" to "H.M.S. Pinafore", but as this film opens, Sullivan (played with nice dry good nature by Allan Corduner) is at his wit's end. He's tired of writing "trivial souffles", and he wishes to compose serious music. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent, who seems to be going for the gold medal in stuffiness) is made even more gruff than usual by Sullivan's decision to end the partnership, but a visit to a Japanese art exhibit sparks his flagging creativity, and he comes up with the scenario for "The Mikado", a Japanese-themed work that once again excites Sullivan about the partnership.Or at least I think it excites Sullivan. Sadly, we never really get to see Sullivan's reaction to the concept, or indeed much of the spirit that really goes into putting on a play like this. There is plenty of time (practically the film's whole middle third) devoted to the nuts and bolts of constructing a show, and it's all done with great verisimilitude and is often quite compelling. However, there was one crucial thing missing from this whole enterprise: passion. I never got the sense of men and women in love with the theatre. I have done plays myself, and I know what grueling, brutal work it can be. But there's always that passion and respect for the work that keeps one going through the rough patches. I never felt that during "Topsy-Turvy". Here, I got the sense that most of the actors and actresses were doing this for a living because it was slightly preferable to being fishmongers or prostitutes.Of course, working with W.S. Gilbert probably didn't help their spirits any. If this film is to be believed, Gilbert was a hard-shelled, obtuse, all-but-inflexible and wholly unapproachable character who snaps at everyone at the slightest provocation, takes every compliment with a whole barrel of salt, and even prefers wandering the disease-ridden back alleys of London to attending the premieres of his own works. Because of this, we can get no real sense of the collaboration that existed between Gilbert and Sullivan; indeed, in their scenes together, Sullivan often seems afraid that Gilbert is going to jump down his throat and pummel him to pieces. I don't know whether I want to blame this on Broadbent or on Leigh, but someone needed to at least try to make Gilbert someone we would want to watch for three hours.Mike Leigh is a filmmaker I've always admired more in theory than in practice. His method of creating a script through improvisation with his actors is an interesting and well-intentioned one, but the films that result don't often grab me like the critics tell me they should. Call me uncultured or base, but I guess I just like my films to feel more like films. "Topsy-Turvy", which would wisely have been handled with a little Gilbert-and-Sullivan color, suffers from this method, with many subplots about the actors in the production and Gilbert's relationship with his wife tossed in like afterthoughts and then undeveloped. Many of the most important events of the story occur offscreen, and the whole thing is tied up with a musical number that explains nothing.Still, even with all of these problems, there is a lot to recommend here. The physical production itself is always sumptuous and inviting, especially a surprise considering the contemporary realism that has marked Leigh's other works. Aside from Broadbent (the jury is still out on my opinion of his performance, and will likely stay there), there is great work from Corduner, Kevin McKidd as a vain star of the play, and the fetching Shirley Henderson as a widowed singer doing her best. The real star here is Carl Davis, the composer who adapted Gilbert and Sullivan's work for the film. Indeed, the musical numbers are really a highlight of the film (I've loved "Three Little Maids From School" ever since they sang it on "The Simpsons"), and if all of these actors are doing their own singing, bravo to them. And even though the final song, "The Sun Whose Rays", brings the film to an inconclusive end, it's a beautiful tune nonetheless, and Henderson performs it quite touchingly.Anyone who regularly reads my reviews on this site knows that I am always the hardest on the films I have the highest expectations for, even if I liked them. And I liked "Topsy-Turvy". I honestly did. But I was ready to love it. And therein lies the problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Topsy-Turvey was definately fun. The style of the movie was fun, entertaining, covers a fun and entertaining subject, but the film was too long for what it offered. The other issue I had with this film was a few random scenes where we are supposedly getting some character developement, but what we really get is scenes that come out of no where and tell us nothing. One character has a brief scene showing some drug addiction, but it comes so late in the film, and so randomly that it means little to the viewer. One of those films you'd rather watch at home in the comfort of your own sofa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rich, detailed, extravagant tribute not only to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's peerless work, it's a tribute to the creative process and theater in particular. From the opening credits, the magnificent Savoy Theater is presented to us at a pace that prepares viewers for an enormous treat. Non-linear in form, the film consists of a series of vignettes that have a powerful kick--often with a great deal of humor thrown in--that builds emotionally to poignant finale that holds the audience breathless. While complaints about its length seem like petty grousing (do folks complain "There's too much good food on the table"?) and the form is vintage Leigh, there's a magnificent depiction of the creative process. The performers (Mr. Broadbent leading all) are simply magnificent. The generous musical interludes account for the long running time. And every moment is adorned with great affection for the frailty and petulance of humanity. One of the great films of the 1990's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great period piece by Gilbert &amp; Sullivan lover...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be in the minority by admitting that I never took part in a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operetta during my high school years, and definitely in the minority when I freely admit that I've never even seen a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operetta in my half century of living. So Topsy-Turvy is my first real exposure, and it is a healthy dose. A good dose. Mike Leigh has done well creating the 1884 world that these two legends inhabit. The film opens with a capacity theater audience enjoying Gilbert and Sullivan's latest creation, Princess Ida. The audience is appreciative, yet something is missing. Sullivan senses it, as does a London critic--they have grown stale, the operettas have lost their creative thrust. Gilbert doesn't see it; he wishes to continue along the same path of Topsy Turvydom with the tired motif of the magic potion. The partnership nearly collapses. A miracle will be needed to save it. This miracle occurs as Gilbert's wife drags him to a Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge. Gilbert becomes inspired, and begins to create The Mikado. This is where the film also takes off and does its best work. I really enjoyed the scenes that show the thoroughness of the preparation--Gilbert's meticulous detailed work with the actors and their lines and having the Japanese ladies demonstrate proper Japanese walking style and fan technique, and Sullivan going over the music with the orchestra. Bruised egos and company camaraderie are clearly demonstrated when Gilbert decides to cut a song from the program, which happens to be the only major song that an aging actor has.Leigh obviously understands the theater, and obviously loves Gilbert and Sullivan. Perhaps a bit too much, as he was loathe to cut down on the musical numbers, some of which are performed in their entirety. This makes the movie drag, and at 2.5 hours long may be a bit long for non theater or Gilbert and Sullivan fans. The film could be tightened some more with a few cuts of subplots that lead nowhere, as in the case of a scene with Gilbert's mother that really doesn't add to the story. But these are small quibbles for a very worthwhile movie. It is stunning visually, and Leigh lets us view backstage theater preparations as few films do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The men and the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Topsy-Turvy unfolds before you, the trials and tribulations of putting on a show in 19th century England is not that much different from making a movie in 20th century Las Angeles. Gilbert &amp; Sullivan have hit an impasse in their works. Gilbert seems to be stuck in a rut in which all of his stories center around a magic item that sets the stories in motion. Sullivan feels that he can't write anymore light operas and tries to write a grand opera. The trouble is, these two work too well together and apart, they can't exist. After a visit to a Japanese exposition, Gilbert begins to envision The Mikado. Once that happens, the movie delves deeper into the backstage life of a play. The actors don't like their costumes, the way the three little maids walk isn't acceptable to Gilbert as is three of his actors incorrectly pronouncing words and delivering lines without the proper intonation. Pretty much what goes on in the world of film today. Mike Leigh takes his time and lets the actors shine in their roles. The film also features music from a few of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's works including The Sorcerer, Princess Ida and of course, The Mikado. You might find yourself humming the music as you leave the theater. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few words about film length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading all the comments already posted in this forum, I felt it neccessary to include my own views about "Topsy Turvy" and about film length in general. I found "Topsy Turvy" to be completely enjoyable, a funny, warm and evocative romp through Victorian England. I personally know very little of Gilbert and Sullivan, just their most famous songs and relatively little of even these, but it's still good music and funny lyrics, so even if you weren't previously a fan there's no reason not to enjoy the wonderful stagings in the film. As well, Jim Broadbent is fantastic as Gilbert, the supporting players are all magnificent, the costumes and sets are extraordinary, and the pace is more up-tempo than one would imagine from a 2.75 hour film. In short, I felt that the film may have dragged a bit, and a few of the asides to supporting characters may have been better off cut, but overall this is one of the year's most enjoyable pieces. As for film length in general, too often when people are bored in a movie, they cite the reason as "it was too long." This is almost never accurate. I'm sure everyone at one time in their lives has really loved a movie that was nearly 3 hours. Was "Lawrence of Arabia" too long? It was over 3 hours. What about "Gone With the Wind"? It pushes 4. The fact remains, there is nothing inherent about a 3 hour movie that makes it drag. What makes some movies FEEL too long is when they are poorly PACED, when there is too much talking or lingering camera work and not enough to keep the viewer entranced. Hitchcock had better timing than any director in history, so his films always seem like they just started, even when they're over. "The Thin Red Line" is an example of a long film that seems extremely long because of its poor sense of pace. Therefore, "too long" is really a silly thing to accuse any film of being, certainly the well-paced and thoroughly entertaining "Topsy Turvy," which I think is Mike Leigh's biggest achievement so far.Lonnie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A British NASHVILLE (in a season full of millennial Altman wanna-bes), the best backstage musical since ALL THAT JAZZ and the best movie about show biz since THE KING OF COMEDY, Mike Leigh's account of the making of THE MIKADO is pure joy from start from finish. A no doubt personal account of the pains and ecstasies of the creative process, a gorgeously written plunge into the heated ponds of Victorian language (with its thrilling mix of total precision and excess), an Altmanian mosaic and a Leighesque analysis of a stage production as metaphor for a society, TOPSY-TURVY, like THE MIKADO, seems to have impish invention spritzing out of its pores. Nothing even in Leigh's extraordinarily distinguished run from NAKED through CAREER GIRLS prepared for the dazzlement and the thick, multiple layers of this movie--and a word should be spoken for the cast, a theatrical ensemble of a calibre unseen since THE RED SHOES.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First the good news: so far as his storytelling is concerned, Leigh has gone out on a limb here, and I'm glad he did it. One expected a straight double-biopic; but instead we get perhaps a dozen real people, each with clear virtues and weaknesses, each with concerns and modes of living that are by turns familiar or alien. The acting is uniformly memorable -- some scenes apparently improvised, and brilliantly.But alas and alack! Leigh (or his music director) has made a terrible botch of the music -- all but a few numbers are virtually destroyed by impossibly slow tempi. There is really no way the actors can do anything to give the material the necessary lightness. It may seem hard to believe if you've never heard it done properly, but if the Mikado were really this dull, how could have it been such a success all these years?In sum: see it for the acting, or if you already know you like Gilbert &amp; Sullivan.

		<shortDescription>A Fabulous and Wonderful Account of Gilbert and Sullivan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film ran two hours and forty minutes (not uncommon for the 1999's) and it NEVER seemed long; it was over all too quickly. It is a fabulous account of Gilbert and Sullivan and their timeless light operas - and of the backstage struggles that were a part of the creative process.The best of earlier films on this subject was "The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan", 1953, with Robert Morley, Maurice Evans, and Peter Finch as D'Oyly Carte (who managed their theater) - all superb actors. It focused on the conflicts between the writer (Gilbert) and the musician (Sullivan) especially over the latter's desire to write more "serious" music instead of what they were doing. That dispute is indeed part of "Topsy Turvy" - but there is much more.This film centers around the moment when a disillusioned Sullivan, disappointed with his current collaboration with Gilbert, determined to move on to Grand Opera. Only Gilbert's brilliant idea of presenting a libretto with a Japanese theme - "The Mikado" - convinced Sullivan to stay on and work on what would be their timeless megahit.But where "Topsy Turvy" becomes unique and extra-special is in its various scenes and scenarios of backstage life with the various members of the cast and crew. These are presented in a fast-moving style moving from person to person, the the little nuances of it all were shown with great and fascinating detail.The cinematography and art direction are magnificent. The musical numbers sparkle. The direction is excellent with special attention to the humor of Gilbert; laughter was heard regularly in the theater where it was playing, and this made it different and even better than the 1953 film. The cast was very good with Jim Broadbent as William Gilbert and Allan Corduner as Sir Arthur Sullivan. Ron Cook played D'Oyly Carte. They, and all supporting members, did a fine job throughout.This is now the best Gilbert &amp; Sullivan movie on film, and beyond that it is a human film with humor, sadness, and vulnerabilities. You don't have to know a note of their music to enjoy this great film.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the privilege of seeing Topsy Turvy at the NY Film Festival. This was a departure from Mike Leigh's usual fare in terms of subject matter but his signature regarding actors (that he works with them for many months ahead of time improving and developing characters) shows here as it has in his others films. The richness of the acting work cannot be copied. You are able to see the entire history of a character when an actor utters only a few lines. It makes most other acting I see in films seem pallid by comparison. There was nothing here that you haven't seen before (artists struggling with a block of sorts) yet everything in the film feels new and fresh. The scene where Gilbert visits a Japanese exhibition isn't a surprise in and of itself. You know that he will be inspired to write the Mikado but you enjoy making the discovery of this new world with him. The film is visually stunning. The sets and costumes are breathtaking. It is also exciting to watch a period film where you feel like it is actually taking place in the time when it is filmed. While some might find the film long, I would use the word leisurely. The film is such like eating a great meal with 8 courses instead of 4. And while I am not necessarily a Gilbert and Sullivan fan, I throughly enjoyed watching the scenes from the Mikado. I have been a Mike Leigh fan for quite some time but this film certainly dazzled me and solidified my admiration.</fullReview>

The film also has a very nice flow, a nice kind of pace that gives the film some breathing space between the musical performances and allows them to have that much more impact.

		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made. Definitely in my top 5 of all time. If you love the theatre, then nothing could be more gripping; you will feel like a voyeur. If you are not a theatre person, then chances are you will be bored. The details, the accuracy of the tales, etc. It's all there. There really isn't a lot to say. Broadbent's greatest performance which says a lot since he has given dozens of great performances. There are those who can simply savor the lushness of the period details, but if you become wholly absorbed in what is happening, it is impossible not to be very moved. There are a few scenes of such deep insight into human behavior that it is almost tempting to look away. The movie must have cost a fortune and I am sure it was not successful at the box office so those of us who love this must be eternally grateful that it was made. And made by people of such intelligence and precision. Give this one ten more years and people will remember it as the last great movie of the 20th century. And it is nothing short of great. A true epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intellectual Treasure Trove.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A departure from Director Mike Leigh's usual less snooty subjects, this historical comedy is an entirely different facet of his intellectual sensibility.The story recounts an historical spat between Gilbert &amp; Sullivan. Unlike most historical films which are content to offer little more than costume, Leigh cleverly turns our preconception about the Victorian Age on its head. Thus, while Victorian society at large may have been staid, Gilbert &amp; Sullivan &amp; company are quite fast. This is a much more sophisticated interpretation of Victorian history. recognizing contradictions. But this is only one minor example of what is going on. Much more could be said about this film, pending further viewing. In this way, by brilliant innovations, he brings the characters to life for us as real people, larger than the historical context, not stock figures. But while they are not merely Victorians, nevertheless they are Victorians and there are insights into that historical condition as well. Very charming was an incident with an actress changing from stage costume to street clothes. To all appearances, she is dressing in reverse. The requirements of the street are vastly complicated, involving multiple undergarments and contrivances and great labor, much greater than thecostume. Much of the material involves backstage views of rehearsals, giving us a feeling for theater-life then as well as theatre-life in general. While we are considering the life and character of the cast, we are incidentally enjoying many complete excerpts from actual Gilbert &amp; Sullivan.Running 2 hours and 40 minutes, this is a film which requires enough composure on the part of the viewer to sit back and absorb a vast pageant of sights and ideas. You might want to be sure you are in a receptive frame of mind and have 2 hours and 40 minutes to spare. Quite an amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true five course banquet of acting and music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my experience, I've found that when a writer also directs their film, it seldom works.Here is a true exception.The best way for me to compare this movie to others, is by comparing it to a meal, with a normal three act movie being the equivalent of fast food.Topsy Turvy, however, is a full blown banquet, with each dish prepared with loving care and served up with a large helping.Even the language, "Don't you know" feels authentic, along with the topics, such as General Gordon of Khartoum, or the minutia of taking a biscuit home for the family rather than eating it right then and there.Gilbert and Sullivan, along with many other peripheral characters are brought to life through a clever script and brilliant acting.The writer has provided us with a window into an imperfect world of many dimensional characters, each struggling away at their individual goals, whilst battling their own, mostly hidden, demons.We also are provided with a cutaway of the theater, showing how those glittering, seemingly effortless performances are based on weeks, if not months of long hours of sweat, rehearsal and toil.Then there is the music.As a Gilbert and Sullivan fan, I have a number of videos/recordings of The Mikado, and the music in Topsy Turvy is equivalent, if not better than any of these. On top of that, the movie also provides performances from some of the other Giblert and Sullivan shows - a real treat.This is an underrated classic, but isn't for everyone - some people will always prefer takeaway!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo, Mike Leigh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spectacular Mike Leigh film about famed composers Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and the impetus behind one of their best-known works, "The Mikado." The film portrays Sullivan as a carefree party boy with aspirations to be a more serious composer, tired of the lightweight fare he and his partner churn out. Gilbert (played in a tremendous performance by Leigh regular Jim Broadbent), on the other hand, is still committed to the breezy entertainment he's become known for, and Broadbent gives a somewhat heartbreaking look into the mind of a limited artist who's genuinely in love with his own creations and doesn't understand why everyone else isn't also. Intercut with scenes of the men's lives are scenes from "The Mikado" itself, with some of its more popular numbers performed in their entirety.Lesley Manville gives a quiet and lovely performance as Gilbert's lonely wife.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional, though perhaps somewhat flawed introduction, to the wonderful world of G&amp;S.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose on first viewing, Topsy-Turvy might seem like an odd choice for director Mike Leigh, who's previous films, such as Meantime, Life is Sweet and Secrets &amp; Lies have looked specifically at real life archetypes, struggling to survive from day-to-day in the here and now. One scratch beneath the surface however will reveal a multitude of hidden depths that very much tie in with the themes of Leigh's early works whilst simultaneously demonstrating his strong understanding of character development and situations within the confines of a broad, ensemble narrative. Like the majority of Leigh's work, the film moves seamlessly from light comedy to moments of subdued tension and great pathos, whilst the focus of the film remains constantly with the characters and their varying relationships; with Leigh, as ever, favouring the stories presented by said characters and their associates, as opposed to the more obvious conventions of the biographical story at hand. Some have argued that Leigh's approach to the proceedings have turned Gilbert &amp; Sullivan into caricatures, whilst also allowing the story to descend into a mire of fanciful farce. However, Leigh, like all great filmmakers, understands the notion of intertextuality, and sets about constructing his film so that it draws on the same visual and verbal characteristics as Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's very own work, resulting in a film that is vibrant, colourful and, above all else, a great deal of fun.As a result of this, the film can be enjoyed on a number of levels. Firstly; as a biographical look into the working relationship of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan during the conception and production of their celebrated comic-opera, The Mikado. Secondly; as a bittersweet character study, with Leigh creating the film in such a way that the whole theme, setting and back story can be seen as secondary to the drama at work between the characters. Thirdly; it is an analysis into the creative process, with Leigh offering an impeccable and seemingly accurate chronicle of life in the theatre and of course, that always interesting notion of films about the creative process (Day for Night, Ed Wood, Le Mepris, 8 ?, etc). Some viewers have found the story to be slight and disengaging, though I'd imagine this is from people who are unfamiliar with Leigh's films and his individual way of working (beginning with nothing and having the actors improvise their characters until the story and relationships develop) however, having said that, the use of the Mikado as a framing device is well handled, whilst the shifts in time (with flash forwards to the performances, whilst Gilbert &amp; Sullivan create) and the inclusion of scenes from other G&amp;S operas, the Sorcerer and Princess Ida, means that the film works well as an introduction into the work of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan for those who've never experienced it (though surely everyone is familiar with such work as the HMS Pinafore and the song, Three Little Maids?). On top of this, there is that above-mentioned visual design that creates the world of the film (which is easily as beautiful as the similarly decadent, though overblown Moulin Rouge!) and the performances from all involved, which evoke both the real lives of the people documented, as well as offering compelling portrayals that engage on an interesting, narrative, level.The cast is a true ensemble of British acting talent, featuring Leigh regular Jim Broadbent as the strict and somewhat insular Gilbert - who is content to trot out the same plots, characters and themes, though feels deflated by critical misunderstanding - and the equally great Allan Corduner as the spirited yet slightly egocentric Sullivan, who feels trapped creatively by Gilbert's limited scope and overbearing vibratos. Added to this, we have an impeccable supporting cast, including Timothy Spall and Kevin McKidd as the pompous lead actors, Shirley Henderson as the alcoholic female lead, Ron Cook as the manager of the Savoy Theatre - who is left with the task of trying to re-unite Gilbert &amp; Sullivan after their initial fall-out - Eleanor David as Sullivan's American mistress and the great Leslie Manville as Gilbert's long-suffering wife Kitty. Manville and Broadbent go to great lengths to portray the strained relationship between Gilbert and Kitty with a believability and depth, whilst the heartbreaking scene towards the end of the film in which Kitty manages to metaphorically convey all her inner-pain and desperation without Gilbert even realising is easily my favourite scene in the film (and ranks alongside other great scenes of Leigh-related-drama, such as the argument between Nicola and her mum in Life is Sweet and the penultimate confessional between Penny and Phil in All or Nothing). Added to this already starry cast, there are great cameos from other Leigh regulars such as Alison Steadman, Andy Serkis, Katrin Cartlidge, David Neville, Mark Benton and Dexter Fletcher, who all bring a comic savvy and wry believability to the often-neglected (though all-important) background action.Though Topsy-Turvy isn't a film for everyone (it's perhaps ten-minutes too long and demands a great deal of concentration in order to pick out the details) it is greatly rewarding; offering us a humorous, intelligent and interesting story with believable characters and some glorious cinematic design; all run through with that Mike Leigh world-weariness and the impeccable performances that are, on the whole, synonymous with his work. This film is a brave and bold departure from Leigh's usual blend of social-abstraction and, as a result, deserves to be evaluated alongside he other masterworks, Life is Sweet and Naked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As another previous commenter has stated, that this movie might be of limited interest. I can see that, as it took me a while to get around to it.That said, this movie is just outstanding, and Jim Broadbent's (Gilbert)performance is simply titanic. You start out thinking he's a jerk, but by the end, you cannot get enough of him. He has never been nearly this good, and he has been PLENTY good many other times.The craftsmanship of this movie is outstanding. Practically every scene bears re-watching. The love and detail that went into making "T-T" is evident from the first scene. Making it must have been hard work, but it also must have been the most rewarding thing a lot of these actors ever have been associated with.There is at least one scene (toward the end) that is difficult to watch because it is so suddenly and unexpectedly close to the bone emotionally, after a number of scenes of comedy and triumph. But I think it added further depth to the movie.To paraphrase Dr. Johnson clumsily, "If one is tired by 'Topsy-Turvy,' one is tired of life."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Topsy Turvy, Director Michael Leigh.. Starring Jim Broadbent, Allan Corduner, Leslie Manville, Ron Cook, Dexter Fletcher, Sukie Smith, Wendy Nottingham, Roger Heathcott, Stefan Bednarczyk, Geoffrey Hutchings, Timoth Spall, Francis Lee, William Neeman...Music From Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas including The Mikado....1999 Director Michael Leigh brings to life the world of Gilbert and Sullivan's musical theater scene in 1880's London. British actors Jim Broadbent (Harry Zidler in 2001's Moulin Rouge, The Professor in 2005's Narnia) and Alan Corduner star as the illustrious English librettist/compose team Gilbert and Sullivan who composed comic and energetic operettas which would later evolve into today's American musicals. The strength of this film lies in the exquisite cinematography which vividly depicts the time period. The overall look of the film, from the costumes, furniture to theater and home interiors, are accurate to the historical period. The plot of this film is drawn from the actual account of how Gilbert and Sullivan's most famous opera "The Mikado" (about satirical feudal Japanisme) came to be made. After the failure of "Princess Ida", a Mediveal fantasy-opera, Gilbert and Sullivan were determined to make their greatest, most talked-about opera, and one which would save them financially. They were under contract with Richard D'Oyle Carte Opera. D'Oyle (Ron Cook)gives them a few days to come up with a great opera. Conflict ensues between the two musical geniuses. Arthur Sullivan wants to break away from the partnership to compose serious works of classical music. It was the Mikado that reunited them and saved their carers. The rest of the cast are doing superb acting, especially Leslie Manville as Gilbert's smart wife. The movie is rather long, and quite talky, but enough time is given for us to dwell in this fascinating world of make-up, music, theater, and enough time to experience the process of putting on an opera- from casting, to rehearsals, to costume-making to research for the concept of a "Japanese" theme. The rest of the cast are actual Gilbert and Sullivan operetta singers. In London, more than in America, Gilbert and Sullivan continues to remain popular musical theater. English Canada is also well known for its Gilbert and Sullivan tributes. This was a time in England before World War I, when Queen Victoria was still reigning, and when the British where happily engaged in their middle-class to upper-class lifestyle within the city, not knowing that the imperialism they were spreading would create conflict. It's a film that appeals to theater-lovers, historical movie lovers and Gilbert and Sullivan fans. It's a pleasure to watch and the finale, in which after a lot of chaos, everything comes together beautifully, is moving. A great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully made film without a plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superbly scripted, acted and produced account of the Gilbert and Sullivan creative partnership. Jim Broadbent gives us a compelling portrait of Gilbert, a seemingly dour and unhappy man, who nonetheless produced some of the best comic writing of his day. Allan Corduner also shines as the brilliant but hedonistic and slightly erratic Sullivan.The costumes and sets are all evocative of the age and the script teems with often hilarious observations from the very strong support cast - notable among whom are Timothy Spall and the inappropriately named Martin Savage.However, there is a big problem with Topsy-Turvy - a lack of credible narrative flow. Situations emerge in the plot which need resolution, but are subsequently ignored. An example occurs early on in the film, when Gilbert witnesses the mental breakdown of his own father (a stunning piece of acting from Charles Simon). After the scene has taken place, no mention is again made of the event - or the effect it would have had on Gilbert or his family.More seriously, during the first third of the film, we are led to believe that its central theme will be how the G&amp;S partnership solves a fundamental problem: Sullivan's refusal to write music for any more comic operas. He states quite emphatically that he is not interested in the script that Gilbert has written, nor will he be in any similar work. The partnership appears to be at an end.Gilbert then writes another comic libretto which Sullivan promptly gets to work on without complaint or even comment! The tension is unresolved, are we are left feeling confused, our questions unanswered.In summary, Topsy-Turvy works brilliantly at the detailed level, but the "big picture" is incomplete. To sit for two and half hours through a film without a plot is, in the end, somewhat tiresome.</fullReview>

"Would you and your friends please be so kind as to supply me with a list of ten movies of the past twenty years that, in your estimation, are not "trash" or "crap" and, therefore, presumably more entertaining and more watchable than TOPSY TURVY. I would find such a list fascinating, and, should it prove to be valid, grateful beyond words."I am well aware that there is such a thing as divergent tastes, but, at the moment, I'm afraid that I feel these scurrilous comments would smack of (to quote mister Temple), "not knowing your arse from your elbow". I have only read the first nine pages of reviews and, therefore, should someone else have already addressed this situation, I am sorry, but I could not wait to state my protestations. Until I have been shown the error of my ways, I shall continue to watch, at least a few more times, the entire movie with great delight and reverence. Love it. Love it. Love it. I feel much better, now. Thank you for your attention.</fullReview>

There was certainly quite enough happening, with enough sense of forward movement, to keep me almost spellbound for the full length of the film. I thought the evocation of Victorians in Victorian London was truly excellent - all too often Victorian England is seen as a screen on which to project our own feelings about that era - feelings which are often clichéd, ill-informed or ill-considered. This film transcended that; it gives one what I think must be as convincing and three-dimensional a picture as we will ever get of what it was like to be Victorian.

I was about to type that I like Topsy Turvy as much as Oklahoma. But I see Oklahoma has an even lower rating today. It does appear that many of the "hated it" users were disgusted with the plot in both movies. I don't know, maybe that's the main problem.

		<fullReview>Topsy Turvy is a really cool film about the professional relationship of Lennon and McCartney. Well, no. But, essentially, it is their story through Gilbert and Sullivan. Watching Mike Leigh's film really had me comparing the similarities of the two teams. In the film, the acting is superb, and it is a warhorse for Jim Broadbent. The sound is very interesting. In one scene the singers of Three Little Maids are briefly learning, and fumbling, the technique of snapping open a Japanese paper hand fan. The Japanese women do it perfectly, and the fans create a resounding noise. Next scene sees the performance of the song, and the women, on cue open and close the fans, the snapping sound complementing the orchestral score. The stage performances are quite magnificent, allowing that Leigh loves stage work. A delightful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful and wholly original approach to both biography and the exploration of the creative process, focusing on Gilbert and Sullivan's rocky road to "The Mikado." Director Mike Leigh's usual technique is to have his actors create their dialogue during rehearsals, and here the result is more a series of vignettes than a straight narrative. Most of these moments are illuminating - pay close attention to the costume fitting scenes - but others stray rather far from the point and drag out the length without adding much. (One of the earliest of these, a scene involving topless women, was probably responsible for the film's R rating, which is a shame.)Overall, however, the combination of long, leisurely takes and meticulous costuming and art direction is totally involving. This is the first film I've seen which truly made me feel that I was standing in the characters' living room while they conversed.Not for fans of MTV - Leigh is not afraid of holding the camera in place for five minutes - but worth seeing just for the six different degrees of "Ah HA!" on Gilbert's face moments after inspiration literally hits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant screenplay, great use of words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas, essentially the direct ancestors of the Broadway Musical, have lost little of their popularity since Victorian Era's twilight ? they are still routinely staged at every half-decent high-school and beyond. The composer / librettist duo's biography is the subject of Mike Leighs first period piece, a surprising departure from his highly improvisational and penetrating dissections of Modern England's working class, yet after a closer look, not surprising at all. The grand theme of the film is of course a tribute to the world of performing art, focusing on the conception and the fleshing out of `The Mikado', a departure itself from the entertainers' previous works ? and Leigh's clever metaphor of his own creative process. `Shakespeare in Love'?s light, shallow treatment of a similar subject is many miles behind such a complex, multilayered and deliciously subtle film. The two central characters with their opposing, yet complimentary temperaments (one stoic, the other epicurean), both exemplary and inexorable Brits, are in a way, two sides of an artistic personality (possibly the director's himself). Other themes and motifs, such as the advent of new technologies, England's questioning of its colonialism, the beginning of cultural exchange between the East and West, add to a deeper and more rewarding experience. The general style is so casual, self assured and devoid of nostalgic gloss, that the seeming impression is that of a camera transported some 120 years into the past and freely navigating amongst the characters as it would today. But perhaps the most welcome and noticeable aspect of this production is the writers' high regard of the English Language, gloriously witty and refined ? it is truly put on a pedestal here. Every phrase uttered is perfectly natural and fitting, yet a beauty to behold, without the intervention of `likes' and `you knows' that the Modern world takes for granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Ignored Movie of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Topsy-Turvy" chronicles the near-breakup of Gilbert and Sullivan, their reconciliation, and the subsequent staging of "The Mikado". Director Mike Leigh tells his story by following, not just Gilbert and Sullivan, but many of the different people that inhabit the world of 1880s London theater; the producers, businessmen, actors, spouses and mistresses. Unlike "Pulp Fiction" where related stories intertwine and careen towards a cinematic dénouement, "Topsy-Turvy" reminds me more of the story-telling style of Robert Altman in "Nashville". In this, multiple stories, unrelated except for their connection to the central theme, are woven together to create a larger tapestry. "Topsy-Turvy" has a rather long running time, but it seems to go past in a flash. This is one of my favorite films of 1999, and I am astonished that it garnered so few nominations at the Academy Awards, made so little money, and is not in the IMDb Top 250. Odd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, but is it art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful movie with few beautiful people in it. Although the setting is this famous team, G&amp;S, the movie tells tales of aging, mortality and human frailty. And yes, it does tend to weigh in on the question of what is art (though it makes no attempt to answer that question). I particularly loved Gilbert, who seems so senseless to everyone around him except at the crucial point in the movie where he decides about "The Mikado Song." Also touching was the use, as Sullivan sits abed contemplating his dimming prospects for artistic glory and his every-shortening days, of "The Long Day Closes," a part-song written by Sullivan for no particular stage show that I know of, which muses on the closing of one's "book of life." The words are not presented in the movie, more's the pity, but it shows a keen sensibility for the moment and a keener knowledge of Sullivan's ouvre by the filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilbert &amp; Sullivan as Never Before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is writer-director Mike Leigh's thoroughly entertaining take on Gilbert and Sullivan's creation of their most famous operetta, "The Mikado." But it's also a splendid view of a time and place (1880s London), filled with rich details. These are not just the handsome sets and costumes. We've given a hilarious conversation on that unfamiliar and mystifying instrument, the telephone. There's a naughty musical performance in a bawdy house that's an absolute delight. This sequence alone was the reason why the film was given an R rating. Congratulations, Mike (or whoever), for not caving in to change the R. We see some of the creative and personal conflicts that the two principals suffered between a near-failure ("Princess Ida") and the triumph of "The Mikado." Historically significant as these points may be, it's far more fun to eavesdrop on the problems the operetta's cast have to deal with. Both an actor and an actress complain when they are not to be allowed to wear a corset during the performances. The first run-through of the lines is a chaotic mix of mispronunciations and omitted words, and it's a funny bit played very low-key. Several Japanese ladies are brought into rehearsals to instruct the trio of "Three Little Maids" in mincing steps and the use of the fan. Neither group speaks the other's language and there is no interpreter. The teachers haven't a clue about what's happening, no one learns anything, and the courteously headstrong Gilbert has his cast do precisely what he wanted in the first place. The movie, however, is too long by at least 20 minutes, perhaps more. Sequences that could have been cut, entertaining though they are, become obviously unnecessary when the audience realizes that the characters have already been nicely established and the story is standing still. But this is a film filled with brilliant set pieces, and what seems superfluous to one viewer may be a highlight to another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a "Gilbert &amp; Sullivan in Love" but Worth a Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previews led me to expect this film would do for Gilbert &amp; Sullivan what "Shakespeare in Love" did for Shakespeare - present a witty, fast-paced, and thoroughly entertaining piece of cinema which would heighten interest in the artists' work. This was not to be. While the film did an outstanding job of recreating the London theatre world of the 1880's, in my opinion, it suffered from too much attention to too many details. As a result, it lacked the drama,impact and wit it could have had.For example, it took a full hour to get to the point of Gilbert's inspiration for "The Mikado", a visit to a Japanese cultural festival. While the fact that Gilbert and Sullivan had been "running dry" and were being criticized for repeating themselves is pivotal, the time devoted to this part of the story could have been reduced by at least half. When Gilbert does find his inspiration, the cross-cultural experience is in fact quite exhilarating. Unfortunately, some viewers may have already lost interest by then.Actually, more time could have been spent on Gilbert presenting his idea for "The Mikado" to Sullivan. Did Sullivan automatically accept it or did he have to be brought around? Given the fact that the two men had a somewhat stormy artistic and personal relationship, there appears to be a dramatic opportunity lost.Late in the game, we are introduced to a number of the actors' as well as the principals' personal problems. For what purpose? Probably to show us that the love for the theatre forced them to carry on despite their failings, at least momentarily. However, it seemed a rather scattergun approach, weakening rather than enhancing the story. I hope that Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, with their stormy but productive relationship, their rather silly but often clever and enjoyable work, will be fodder for future films. While far from a masterpiece, 'Topsy - Turvy" is a richly detailed and well-acted production with fabulous art direction. It certainly merits a look from anyone with the slightest interest in operetta or 19th century theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having grown up on G&amp;S I found this a fascinating film. Although the suspense of waiting for Sullivan to make up his mind was over rather early in the film, there was so much else to observe that nearly three hours went past very quickly.The portrayal of the seamier side of Victorian morals was superb, particularly Sullivan's attention to his various comforts. The lives of the cast also caught my attention - each one drawn very quickly and with incredible depth, given that there were so many of them.I would suggest that anyone going to the film make sure that they eat first - there is quite a lot of eating portrayed, and if, as happened to me, you haven't eaten first, you'll come out starving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb, magical movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This really is a superb movie - deeply engaging right from the first moment to the final credits, and ultimately managing the magic of extracting profound emotion and insight from trivial things. The most obvious comparison, for me, is to Truffaut's "Day For Night" ("La Nuit Américaine") - the minutiae of people coming together to create art (in Truffaut cinema, in Topsy Turvy musical theatre) becomes somehow, against all common sense, an allegory for the perception of significance in human life. Oh well... sorry if this all sounds a bit twee. Still, I should think anyone could enjoy this movie, and go away feeling better for having watched it. The only caution, I suppose, would be that if you really hate Gilbert and Sullivan perhaps this movie is not for you. But... do you really hate Gilbert and Sullivan? I've seldom if ever seen the music and words performed better than they are here... and I'd bet even many who thought they didn't like Gilbert and Sullivan at all will still end this movie with a smile on their lips, a tear in their eye, and a heart fuller than it was when they started watching. I certainly did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Understandable - I'm dumbfounded as well. Its almost too much of a good thing, almost. Issues of intimacy and alienation are themes that Mike Leigh has featured in his previous films "Naked" and "Secrets and Lies." They are still very much present in Topsy-Turvy but there is so much more! High camp, or should I say low burlesque, humour. Brilliant loving insights into male dominance over females. And the music is hot. Also this is a big screen movie dispite the fact there are no outdoor shots just humans and heartwarming set design. I think it can all be described by a comment I overheard from a middle aged women behind me as we left the theatre; "I'm glad I came along."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing more than once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely see films more than once in the cinema, especially when I didn't particular feel it was a great film the first time. So I was somewhat annoyed with my husband insisting we see it after I had already been with a friend. The result was a great surprise. I loved every minute.We usually watch films for their plot and one which is meandering and shifts unexpectedly between different characters and situations confuses us. A second viewing allows us to sit back and appreciate each moment for itself. Knowing who everybody is in advance is also a great help. For example, most viewers probably don't appreciate that the actor George Grossmith, a major character in the second half, has already appeared in two lengthy extracts from Princess Ida and the Sorcerer before we see him as himself.There is also the opportunity to marvel at the artistic design. Some reviewers have complained about the claustrophobic nature of the film, but that is exactly what was intended. The interiors are amongst the most lovingly realised I have ever seen on the screen.I still believe that this is to some extent a self-indulgent piece which would have been improved with tighter editing and the discarding of some beautifully acted but distracting scenes. I also have some sympathy with viewers who know nothing about G&amp;S. A few words of explanation at the beginning as to who G$S and D'Oyly Carte were would not have come amiss.Nevertheless it is still hugely enjoyable view into a completely different world, well worth seeing.</fullReview>

But if I had bothered to consider at length a Leigh bio-pic of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan I would have had severe doubts over my fiver. Unfounded. Brilliant. Mike applies his familiar style in an unfamiliar surrounding. Once again the minutiae captivate the audience, (fountain pens, oysters, telephones), whilst the big picture continues apace. The difference here is that great works rather than social disaster is the undercurrent. And what of the cast? Broadbent and Corduner truly stars. Timothy Spall a masterwork - lets come back to this as the performance of the year. On the downside?

		<shortDescription>Topsy-Turvy is a very fulfilling film for Gilbert and Sullivan fans and scholars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a composer and a huge fan of Gilbert and Sullivan. In fact when I was in college I did a lot of studying Gilbert and Sullivan, including musical analysis and presentations for class. So, before I saw Topsy-Turvy, I was worried that it would not be a very detailed biography. After I saw it I was very pleased. What this film does is rather than try to throw in a bunch of major events of the entire careers of Gilbert and Sullivan, It concentrates on a very particular time in their collaboration, namely the creation of The Mikado. Doing this, Mike Leigh (who has done a tremendous job in not only directing this film, but also in writing it) gives us all of those wonderful minor details. This adds a much more human level to these heretofore seen one-dimensional iconic historical figures. I think I smiled during every moment of this film. I saw it with my brother, who knows nothing about Gilbert and Sullivan and really liked it, and he was able to get a sense of being more closely involved with the characters in this picture, compared to many other historical films. He really appreciated this and left the theater with a genuine interest in Gilbert and Sullivan, which wouldn't have happened, I believe, if we had watched your standard run-of-the-mill (pardon the cliché) historical drama. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An astonishing film that, by underlaying a respectable heritage surface and a conventional putting-on-a-show plotline, with disruption, subversive, bitter comedy, access to real human suffering and compromises under a tyrannical social regime, and by using the modes of light opera (the film, despite Victorian trappings is as flat, stylised, caricatured, artificial (compliments!) as a G&amp;S operetta) is beautifully true to its subjects, two model Victorian gentlemen whose own doubts, failures, and anxieties surfaced in their work. Amid all the heavenly music, edible verbosity and jaw-dropping performances, the best scene is when, on the opening night of The Mikado, Gilbert is assailed by a female Irish beggar, in a nightmarish, labyrinthine alleyway - the conflation of gentlemen's repression, gender discrimination, neglect of the working class and the poison of colonialism is shockingly achieved, the repressed returning with a vengeance.</fullReview>

Wonderful art direction and production values create a completely convincing sense of Victorian era England. Likewise the Gilbert and Sullivan set-pieces sprinkled throughout the film - mainly from The Mikado - are a musical delight. However, director Mike Leigh takes the viewer on an unconscionably long journey to arrive at what is essentially a Victorian version of the backstage musical. Some reviewers have suggested that the film is thereby an analysis of the creative process. Maybe, but I certainly didn't get that point on first viewing, nor any other point for that matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Topsy-Turvy is a true cinematic treat.Wonderful performances,great Gilbert and Sullivan songs and savvy direction from Mike Leigh.Although The story of Gilbert and Sullivan's stormy partnership is well known,Jim Broadbent and Alan Corunder bring the character to such vivid life that it all seems new. Broadbent should have been nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of the workaholic Gilbert.His is hands down,the best performance by an actor this year.Corunder is also strong as the ailing,but,life loving Sullivan.Shirley Henderson is also strong as the Savoy's leading lady Leonora Braham,She is sexy,touching and possess a masterful singing voice. Ron Cook as producer Richard D'Oly Carte and Martin Savage as Comic lead George Grossmith also stand out in a near perect cast. The film is not perfect,certain scenes stand out as unnecessary,such as the ones involving Gilbert's estranged parents and a drawing room concert held by Sullivan's mistress.These problems ,however are small compared to the grand gift Director Leigh has given us.High points include a wonderfully written scene in which Gilbert,Sullivan and Carte are discussing the fate of a new operetta since Gilbert won't write a new libretto and Sullivan refuses to set the current one to music,The wonderful Mikado excerpts and a delicous scene where Sullivan is directing the Mikado actors in a rehearsal room. The film runs 2 hours and 40 minutes but when it ends you wish it could run another 2 hours!A near masterpiece of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Under normal circumstances I would not have gone to see this film. I have heard very little of Gilbert and Sullivan and I do not normally enjoy period dramas, in fact I rarely watch films at all. Because I love Mike Leigh's films I had to go and see it. I have not been to the cinema for ages it is so long since I last went that hadn't realised they was no longer had a man sitting above the audience showing the film. I thoroughly enjoyed this film it was not too long as many reviews state .I have difficulty sitting still to watch a half hour TV program but I didn't notice the time. It was lovely to see so many of the acters who have been in other films of his, although I could hardly recognize them whilst they were playing these characters. I have never seen an opera of any sort live so I cannot compare it but I thought it was great. The music was lively and the shows looked really effective. It is obvious that a lot of work has gone into it.It would not have been anywhere near as enjoyable without the scenes in between the stage acts. The rehearsals were fun to watch and I'm sure true to life. I thought the parts where they showed amusement at new inventions, like lump sugar and reservior pens were funny, just like we do at todays progress. The part where the Japanese women were bought in was good too and of course their home lives and relationships. All in all this film was well worth seeing. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface Topsy-Turvy is an lively and funny reconstruction of a period, featuring the lives of of two remarkable men, and it's watchable on this level alone.But it's also a first class examination of performers, how they work, and how their work relates to their times. The many perceptive scenes set in rehearsal and production are as fun to watch as they are revealing.The Mikado appears as "play within a play", a light-hearted play about the ways of the Japanese. We get a hint of these Victorians seeing something of their own formality and orderedness reflected back on them. The opera that G&amp;S and their company develop, inspired by a culture alien to them, is partly a commentary on themselves, whether they realise this or not.This is where the film develops depth. The Victorians seem as odd to us as the Japanese seemed to them. And in the detail of this now distant way of life, we sometimes catch sight of ourselves when we least expect it.The film darkens towards its close, in that it underlines how isolated actors or writers can be. There's no sentimentality here about a big showbiz family. But Leigh believes that performance can bring us together, whether we're on stage or in the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having performed in each of the Savoy operas shown in the film (Princess Ida twice (Arac), The Sorceror (as Wells), and Mikado twice), the mostly historical information gives a strong feeling of deja vu. I think that G &amp; S in later years got along even less well than shown, but the plot moves along strongly and convincingly, creating its own consistent view.The music is well done and acted, the subplots (the soprano's child and drinking, the sad relationship between Gilbert and his wife) were involving, and the movie hung together as well as any I've seen. This gives a gritty, realistic view of the lives of performers, and gives the music of G&amp;S excellent exposure.If I could change the movie in any way, I would delete the early scene with Sullivan and the prostitutes, which I believe gave the movie its R rating. Without that scene, a PG or PG-13 rating would have increased the audience. I intend to take my 15 year old to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Leigh certainly has avoided his usual film making style with this costume drama. Visually stunning and incredibly well acted, this biopic of Gilbert and Sullivan is very well made. It's problem is that it pushes 3 hours in length and is too self indulgent.Self indulgent? - well Mike Leigh is obviously a big fan of Gilbert and Sullivan and gives us many tunes - most in their entirety. My problem, and many of the people I saw the film with, is that I'm not so much a fan, and all this music got in the way. You get the idea of how a musical number's staged very easily due to the quality of the film making, but to see the entire number (and many more) gets too much. To see almost all of the Mikado when you go to see a film is just too much.The story can seem bitty as we get to see many characters living their lives, the actors, the producers, their families and Gilbert and Sullivan themselves. But the acting in these scenes certainly carries the film forwards.If you appreciate well made and incredibly well acted films then do go and see this, just beware if you don't like Gilbert and Sullivan music or find cinema seats uncomfortable for 2 hours and 45 minutes</fullReview>

How accurate it is or not makes no difference to me as everything else worked stupendously.

Mike Leigh's direction is superb, the cinematography and period details are beautifully evoked, the story is engaging and moving, the writing is witty, funny and wise and the music is amazing. The acting is great. Jim Broadbent is absolutely tremendous as Gilbert and his chemistry with Allan Courdener who is fantastic as well is what makes Topsy-Turvey work so wonderfully. I was also surprised at how well Timothy Spall did carrying the tunes, and Lesley Manville is suitably quiet and composed as Gilbert's wife- loved the superbly written and performed speech. All in all, an absolutely brilliant film and not to be missed whether you love G&amp;S or not. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

While it would be churlish to say that it could be seen as a remake of such making-a-musical-show films as "42nd Street" or "A Chorus Line" or "All that Jazz" it so far transcends the genre as to never be anything less than mesmerising.For me though, the true star of the film is nothing less than the English language in all its precision and all its beauty. Seeing Gilbert and Sullivan tearing bleeding shreds off each other in a do-or-die argument without raising their voices, or swearing, or even deviating from the point is breathtaking and inspiring in this age of instant foul language and fisticuffs. Seeing the rest of the large cast doing exactly the same thing too, is a glorious window onto a vanished culture. If you love the English language, films don't get any better. If you love actual, dead set, real acting,"Topsy Turvy" is breathtaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Topsy-Turvy is an odd film. It's very pretty to look at, well crafted, and pleasant enough to watch, but I couldn't make out what the point of it was. It's a sort of dramatised documentary about how Gilbert and Sullivan came to write "The Mikado". There are coy little cameos of Gilbert and Sullivan themselves, D'Oyly Carte, and the actors who formed their stock company. We get some excerpts from "The Sorceror"; we get told that Sullivan didn't like writing comic operas very much and was unhappy with Gilbert's libretto offered him, so, by chance, Gilbert is taken off to a Japanese exhibition in London and is stirred to write "The Mikado" which saves the partnership and they all (more or less) live happily ever after. But at least half the film is taken up with showing how Gilbert set about staging the play. Which is all very jolly and quite interesting if (like me) you like G&amp;S. But when the end-credits rolled up, I couldn't help thinking "so what"? As a film, it couldn't seem to make up its mind what it wanted to be. It looked like it would have made a good 1 hour Channel 4 docudrama, but someone had decided to turn it into a feature length film. But there wasn't enough there. It told us nothing about G&amp;S that you couldn't find out from an entry on them in any encyclopaedia; and if you wanted a documentary about staging a G&amp;S operetta, why go to all this bother? Alternatively, if you wanted a film of "The Mikado", let's have that. I thought it was rather a missed opportunity to explore something about the relationship between the three men (G&amp;S and Carte) that created this remarkable series of operettas, but instead we got an amiable souffle of a film that tasted nice enough but did nothing to satisfy (dramatic) hunger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For opera lovers only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene midway through "Topsy-Turvy," Mike Leigh's film about Gilbert and Sullivan, where a close-up of Jim Broadbent (who plays Gilbert) reveals the moment he thought to write an opera about Japan, "The Mikado." A subtle change of expression, something in the eyes, signals this epiphany. Unfortunately, this scene arrives entirely too late.It's a pity, because the moment the film begins to deal with the genesis of "The Mikado," it takes on an urgency that has been entirely missing for the previous hour. After Leigh belabors (and belabors!) the point that Gilbert and Sullivan have reached their creative nadir with "Princess Ida," we finally get a glimpse of what made them worth caring about in the first place. This is a serious tactical mistake, because some viewers will have lost interest in the story altogether.The remainder of the film, which deals with the development, rehearsal, and incidental facts of "The Mikado," is thrilling to anyone who loves theater and opera. The backstage stories illuminate the on-stage ones. And Leigh manages to film most of the opera's musical numbers. (Sadly, "Tit-Willow" is not among them.)I recommend the film to those already interested in its subject. Others, however, will be put off by its overlong running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, talk about your overrated critical darlings. "Topsy Turvy" lacks a ton of the elements that most folks, me included, need for it to be a movie. Like a plot, for instance. Or any kind of story. There is no drama, no suspense, no comedy-- nothing really develops here. There's not even an arty, weird point-- There's nothing. And, we are shown nothing new.One doesn't need special effects, gimmicks, marquee stars, etc.-- but one DOES need a reason to watch something for 2-3 hours, and this movie didn't really deliver. I like Gilbert and Sullivan stage shows-- I've seen at least 20 performances of this and that over the years-- and admittedly, it was mildly interesting to see a dramatic depiction of what they looked like, how they sounded and moved, etc. But that kind of static visualizing gets old in 5 minutes, and one gets desperate for an engaging story of some kind.In a way, this movie was nothing more than a kind of extended animatronic robot display, like the singing raccoons with banjos at Chucky Cheese. "Ooo-- there's Gilbert! Ooo-- there's Sullivan! Wow-- they move!"Yeah, but they don't actually DO anything. I gave this flick a generous "6."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly boring.Set in the 1880s, the story of how, during a creative dry spell, the partnership of the legendary musical/theatrical writers Gilbert and Sullivan almost dissolves, before they turn it all around and write the Mikado.Maybe you have to be into theatre, and musicals in particular, and/or enjoy a history piece on Gilbert and Sullivan, but the movie is very uninteresting. Moves at a snail's pace, goes for 2 1/2 hours, and nothing really happens. What does happen, you know already, from the provided synopsis.Director Mike Leigh could at least have made it shorter, rather than an endurance test.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting this movie to be about the relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan, which I'd heard ended with them not speaking to one another. Actually, the movie takes place way earlier in their joint careers, since, after the Mikado, apparently they wrote 5 more productions. Basically, the story seems more of a framework for musical productions from G &amp; S productions, almost all except the Mikado being from less popular, or less commonly done works. The acting was wonderful; the music and excerpts of productions were wonderful; costumes and make-up were wonderful. I was disappointed that so many loose ends were left untied, and so much in relationships and people's problems was hinted at and never fully developed. The characters were not as fully developed as I'd have liked. However, for a fan of G &amp; S, the movie was enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Details, Poor Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised that so many critics are so taken by the details of this film that they have overlooked the big picture -- that the story of "Topsy Turvy" is not told with any particular purpose, and the main characters aren't developed beyond what we see in the first hour of this overlong (160 minutes!) film. For example, we are introduced to Sullivan at the begininng as a frail man whose artistic aspirations aren't being met by his partnership with Gilbert, and then, once Gilbert comes up with the idea for the "Mikado" (the story of which is described in a minute-long "pitch meeting"), Sullivan is happy again, and the story more or less ignores their relationship, and shifts into a "Making Of" exercise. To be sure, the details in the second half are exquisite, from the sets and costumes to the nuances of rehearsing and staging the "Mikado" itself. But the over 2 1/2 hour length of the film could have provided more emotional payoff. I would have preferred to see the "Mikado" in its entirety, or to have watched "Shakespeare In Love" again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of The Mikado</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An important film from Mike Leigh. Where would western culture be without the Mikado? It's arguable that Aaron Sorkin would never have written Sportsnight, The West Wing...Joking apart, it is rather an interesting project for Leigh. I think it's very successful, although I suspect it might have limited appeal, focused, as it is, very much in and of the theatre. This isn't a big theme movie, although the performances are super-sized. Jim Broadbent is superb as W.S. Gilbert; often playing a somewhat bumbling character, Broadbent bares his teeth a little here, playing out the rough assumptive masculinity typical of Edwardian Britain. Allan Corduner is correspondingly tough, if softer-edged as Arthur Sullivan. There are a smattering of Leigh regulars but many are new - I wonder if this production, which makes judicious but plain use of more money than one might expect on a Leigh project made casting stipulations? It hardly matters as the ensemble are all top-notch. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's observation of ordinary people in extraordinary life situations is second to none, as proven by Secrets and Lies. Unfortunately, while the idea for Topsy Turvy is great (getting to know the characters behind the stage), Leigh's execution falls between two stools.The film is too long for a cinema audience, especially as we don't even arrive at the Mikado until the film is half over. However, the film is also too short, and may have benefited from being a TV series instead. With the beautifully staged musical scenes, Leigh does not leave enough room to develop the characters, and indeed it appeared at times as if chunks of the story were removed to keep the film below 3 hours.Consequently, I left the cinema feeling frustrated. The film may however work better on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that I will never agree with everyone's opinion on any movie, but there are a few below that simply should be ignored and frustrate me greatly.I am not an opera fan, never have been a subscriber to Gilbert and Sullivan, and have not bothered to seek out their music beyond that which seeps into the subconscious over the years.However, I do enjoy good stories, interesting characters, quality acting, and good songs. This movie has all of those.The only thing I knew about this film before renting was a brief mention at the Oscars last year. I now recommend it highly to my friends. If there are complaints about length, I believe that the viewer is simply not spending the time to pay attention to the witty and complete diologue. I have never complained about the length of "Reds." If one is trying to compare "Shakespeare in Love", as many reviewers seem to be doing, they are doing so simply because both films involve English accents. these are two entirely different premises, periods, and targets. I liken that to comparing "Saving Private Ryan" to "The Thin Red Line" because they are both about WWII.The acting is comical, telling, and superb. I enjoyed the humor of the film, simply because we rarely get to see delivery so dryly these days. The songs are presented very well (my favorite being "Three Little Maids". When I began watching, I thought that I would last about fifteen minutes, considering my opera stance. However, I enjoyed it enough to rent it q second and third time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been wanting to see this film for months, but I must admit I was hugely disappointed by it. I am not entirely familiar with Gilbert and Sullivan's works, but I know a good film and this was not one. Another reviewer referred to it as "clunky," which is an apt description. I, like this other reviewer, was constantly looking at my watch. Luckily, watching it on video, I had the advantage of the fast forward button--which I used through several of the musical numbers. I consider myself very familiar with musical theater, but I know now why I have never felt the urge to see a Gilbert and Sullivan. Too many words, forgettable songs and thin storylines.Funny, that sounds like a description of this painfully long film.

		<fullReview>I wanted very much to like this film. I enjoy the works of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, I spent some time in the musical theater in my youth, I love 19th century London....BUT...I found the movie to be tedious almost beyond belief. I cannot understand what the producers were thinking. The acting is great, the reproductions of G&amp;S scenes are spot on, the art direction is sumptuous, but there is just no tension, nothing happening of any interest -- the film seems without purpose. The story seems to be nothing more than "already famous and successful people quibble a bit then put together another famous and successful show." While many of the characters are people who made great works, from the tone of this story, it appears that none of them was particularly interesting. Ok, Gilbert was a little emotionally unavailable. Sullivan liked to party it up a bit. Some of the actors in the company were a bit outre. None of this is unexpected nor is it intriguing. None of the characters have any particular charm. However accurate they may have been, for me there wasn't a moment in which I found the characterizations interesting. Given my reaction, it shouldn't be surprising that I found the movie to be too long as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I AM a G&amp;S fan, but nothing in this movie would convince a newcomer that the operettas are fun. Though the movie has lots of Victorian detail (in case you want to know when the fountain pen was invented), its preoccupation is with contrasting the sex lives of the authors: Sullivan's well-known affairs, and the undocumentable and improbable notion that Gilbert wold not touch his wife because of problems with his mother. (Gilbert's wife is cast as rather plain -- she was, in fact, adorable.) Although there are large sections from the operettas, the hit tunes are scrupulously avoided -- and the singers are consistently off pitch. A hugely wasted opertunity, and much too long. If you want some fun with G&amp;S, find a video of "The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan" (1953).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good dramatization of Victorian England and the D'Oyle Carte company with their star show-makers; Gilbert &amp; Sullivan. Jim Broadbent is one of my favourite British character actors around today, and I loved his characterisation as W S Gilbert.My real problem with this movie is that it feels a bit too self-consciously patronising and formal; and I don't think it's to do with the subject matter or the era being depicted. The characters do feel like they're being put on pedestals - even with the addition of modern style elements like drug-taking, backstage bickering and sexual innuendo. The idea is worth presenting (and I know earlier attempts have been made at telling this story which I haven't seen and would dearly like to); but the presentation of the material is a very starchy and too "stiff-upper-lip" to really communicate effectively to a modern audience. I get the impression that this is what most modern film critics expect, and it's why this got nominated for awards.I just wish that could have loosened up a touch and done something a bit closer to Shakespeare IN LOVE - at least in wit and personality.PS: I personally don't think the costumes and art direction of this movie are better than AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Topsy-Turvy (1999) [Directed by Mike Leigh]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Towards the bottom of the cover art for Topsy-Turvy is printed in bold lettering, "The Egos. The Battles. The Words. The Women. The Scandals." Now that may be an accurate description of the Clinton presidency, but it definitely does not apply to this film. In a desperate attempt to craft an Oscar-vehicle, Mike Leigh seems to have haphazardly assembled a movie that -- despite it's fantastic costumes, splendid make-up, and well-written screenplay -- falls extremely short of it's expectations. In fact, it is ironic that at one point in the film Sullivan expresses his desire to create a play that is emotionally and dramatically entertaining. The reason I say this is ironic is because that is the principal fault of the movie itself: simply put, it fails to connect on an emotional level, making it's near-three hour running time seem even longer. The trailers and TV spots advertised it as a "delightful comedy," but set aside a few chuckles here and there, it is hardly humorous. Even worse is the fact that it refuses to at least try and succeed as a drama. It's very few dramatic scenes -- (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) only the subplot about Sullivan's child and the part in which George inserts the stiletto in his wrist (it is unclear whether it is an actual suicide attempt or just a procedure to make his skin look paler) -- don't even strive to reach their full potential. But the greatest disappointment about Topsy-Turvy is that it has absolutely nothing to do with Gilbert and Sullivan. It would appear that Leigh was trying to show how different they were and whatnot, but he never even places them together in the first place as a point of contrast. In other words, the audience doesn't care AT ALL about either one of them, which is just another failure from the dramatic standpoint. This said, Topsy-Turvy has some redeeming value: the make-up and costume design -- both of which received Academy Awards -- were fantastic, and the script -- which was nominated but lost to American Beauty -- had some great dialogue. However, Topsy-Turvy is surely not the "feast of a film" we were promised by critics, and is most likely not worthy of your time. Oh, and a side-note to Mike Leigh: great films aren't made by stretching out their running time and including a few out-standing aspects. By doing that you've only made a really boring movie that happens to be dreadfully long.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie, but has a lot of effort and interest to fans of the genre. *** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TOPSY-TURVY (1999) *** (out of four)By Blake French: There are a lot of characters in Mike Leigh's Oscar winning, whimsical comedy drama "Topsy-Turvy." There are also a lot of occurrences, musical numbers, personality conflicts, technical nuggets, and different point of views behind the scenes in the world of Broadway theater in the late 18th century. Too much happens in the movie-which in itself is much too long to hold our attention thoroughly during its unduly 160 minute running time.In the film we see many Broadway musical practices, some annoying. The movie doesn't stay focused on one particular event, but wanders off in enough directions to make your head spin. This is not a movie about the preparation and presentation of a comic opera, but details the diminutive issues of costume design, staff dilemmas, casting judgments, sexuality, and rehearsal. "Topsy-Turvy" really had me puzzled over its plot, if you can call it that, but at the same time it is passionate about the subject.Like a live theater production, these filmmakers must have spent endless hours constructing the costumes, set designs, and musical pieces. I just wish they did it in a more consistently interesting way. Certain sequences hit me as very intriguing, beautifully crafted and uncommonly absorbing. Others had me searching for the remote control to the VCR so I could fast-forward the slow-paced, tedious filmmaking. A plot synopsis would be pointless; if you enjoy "Topsy-Turvy," it will not be because of the profound, thought-provoking story, nor will it be the daring edge of the film. It will be the production design and interest in the material. If theater fascinates you, it is an interesting movie to see. I have personally been in several professional live theater productions, and can say from experience this movie is accurate in many, many aspects. Hours can be spent on a single moment; tireless practice can be put into a scene that lasts only a few seemingly insignificant minutes, but the ending result always brings forth a deep, rewarding sensation of self gratitude, team work, and success. Mike Leigh is not the kind of director you might expect to make such a playful production. His screen credits include the Oscar nominated "Secrets &amp; Lies," as well as "Naked," and "Life is Sweet," but "Topsy-Turvy" proves to be of his most peculiar work. Many directors could have turned this material into a sappy soap opera of conflicts and annoying characters, but Leigh gives each character a zestful, likable personality. The actors do a marvelous job at bringing to life some difficult roles: many of the performers must play performers practicing for a performance.I guess the biggest question here is whether or not audiences need to be fans of Gilbert and Sullivan to enjoy "Topsy-Turvy"? Many people are saying no, because of the quality of the film. However, I am a fan of Broadway and found this film to be very irksome during more than one occasion. My answer is absolutely. "Topsy-Turvy" is a movie intended for a very specific audience, and if included in that audience you may find the movie very appealing. You know who you are. </fullReview>

Nonetheless, I gave this a chance because it got such goooooood reviews--I hoped there might be something new here that might elevate it above the usual puttin'-on-a-show snoozers. There really isn't. Jim Broadbent's performance as Gilbert was the best part of the film--he's really convincingly irascible--yet the character itself, as written, is nothing more than a garden-variety old Victorian phlegmball, inhabiting the Savoy Theatre in this case. If you like G&amp;S, or the Victorian era, or the musical theatre, you will probably really love this movie and think I am just being a spoilsport. But if you are like me, and are inherently suspicious of all these topics, there is nothing here to make you change your mind--it's just another long tedious movie about a bunch of quirky Victorian theatre types hopping around in and out of ponderous costumes and complaining about one another. (Or maybe it's just that I can't see any puttin'-on-a-show movies without thinking of "The Producers," and kind of hoping the cast will launch into "Springtime For Hitler.")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, mostly boring, film about Gilbert and Sullivan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How wrong-headed can a filmmaker be? Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies) has written and directed "Topsy-Turvy", this long production (2 hrs. 40 min.) about Gilbert and Sullivan (Jim Broadbent and Alan Corduner). He begins his tale toward the end of their careers. Actually, Sullivan is feeling that their operas have started to get stale, and they have begun to repeat themselves thematically and creatively. At this point, Gilbert and his wife visit an exposition of Japanese culture and custom. Of course, out of this comes their crowning achievement, `The Mikado.' It sounds wonderful, but too much time is spent showing boring rehearsals and scenes from their less successful productions. The screenplay should have given more time to the performers' stories (which are hinted at) as well as the relationships between G &amp; S and their wives. Two of the best scenes in the film are at the end. Here the two wives reveal their innermost longings and emotions. These should have been developed along the way to greater effect in this fine conclusion. On a technical level the film is a fine recreation of the England of the late 19th century. The repressed emotions of the characters are mirrors of Victorian society and perfectly reflected in their conversations. It's hard to warm up to them, and one must sympathize with the manner of being so overly polite that one's true feelings can rarely be communicated. The scenes from `The Mikado' are the best part of the movie. Leigh would have done better to film the whole opera. It surely would have been much more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hugely disappointed with this film. I was hoping for a better understanding of the world of Gilbert and Sullivan, how they worked and how their company operated. What I got, however, was a completely elitist representation of England in the late 19th century.Going into this film without an extensive knowledge of the history of the period will leave you at a distinct disadvantage. But it's not just the history; there are specific facts about G&amp;S and their company of players that you will need to know in order to make sense of what's going on. Because the filmmaker doesn't find it necessary to clue you in on these things, the film excludes non-G&amp;S scholars and commits the ultimate sin of being boring.The film is also clunky in the way that an improvised piece can be. There are some charming scenes that play quite nicely, but many more that meander, overstay their welcome and finally end, leaving you wondering "What the hell was that all about?"I found myself looking at my watch, something I do only when trapped in the worst of movies. But one good thing has come out of this experience: after speaking to friends, we found out that we had all seen the film based on critics' recommendations. Not one of us thought to warn the others about "Topsy Turvy," since we all desperately wanted to forget it. Now we've formed a group, sort of a "Neighborhood Watch" for films, with an early warning system to protect each other from trash like this. I feel safer walking into a theater now.Danger, Will Robinson!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely holds interest as a fictionalized "Making of the Mikado"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who enjoyed Shakespeare in Love take note: prepare to be disappointed if you see this film. My main objection to Topsy-Turvy is that it pays little attention to the number one rule of story telling: there must be a conflict. There is a conflict of course: at the film's opening, Gilbert and Sullivan appear to have reached an impasse in their partnership as the pair cannot agree on the nature of their next collaboration. Unfortunately (for the film), this conflict is resolved within the first hour and we are left with little more than a fictionalized documentary that could just as easily have been titled "The Making of the Mikado".True, we do get to peek behind the curtain at the world of 19th-century theater, but even here our glimpses are all too brief. Uncomfortably long stretches place the audience in an all-too familiar spot: in the theater rows watching the performance. This is fine if one has paid to actually see a performance of "The Mikado", but the focus of this film is (or should have been) entirely different, and one is left with the sense that the scenes of rehearsal and performance are merely used to fill the gaps between other scenes.While Topsy-Turvy and Shakespeare in Love both present themselves as being "how it came to be"-style films, the similarity ends there. While Shakespeare showed us the behind-the-scenes story we never suspected, Topsy seems to take an educated guess at what might really have happened, and thus leaves us with a story that is infinitely more likely, yet infinitely less interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>remove the costumes and it's actually not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a cursory viewing, this movie appears to be a good film. Certainly, the director is a respected director, and the producer has produced some fine movies. Upon a cursory view, it's a wonderful costume drama, great music, absolutely believable acting and performance.So why did it bother me as I watched it? Why has it stuck with me to a point of critiquing it?The movie had little dramatic conflict. The whole point of it - Sullivan has a need to do serious work, be known for something besides the confection that are the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas -- is solved with a dolly push. Really. That's it. After all the belly aching, the overly dramatic moments of his deciding never to write for the Savoy again... Suddenly, apparently, upon a new story presented by Gilbert, all is well. We never see him have to be convinced to do the Mikado. He complains about the rehashed "topsy turvy" premises of Gilbert's librettos, yet the Mikado is another such story.Many plot points are touched on then never returned to - as if the script was a draft shy of complete, or that the movie was significantly trimmed to a mere 2:45!! - A hint that a leg might be gangrenous is never returned to. A potential problem with an unwed singer having a child is also never realized. A heroin using Tenor - nope, didn't do that either. In fact, none of the little sub-sub plots are worked out. The movie becomes a "behind the scenes" if you will, of the staging of an operetta - with very little of the dramatic tension that is the opera world.Quite boring.In the end, the movie is too "precious" for it's own good.So -- with some of the melodies stuck in my head, I must give this movie a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well acted. However...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very well acted and impressive costuming but ultimately an unsatisfying biographical look at a short period of time in the lives of two talented artistic collaborators who were unfortunately exceedingly boring as individuals. The movie consists of an apparently random beginning followed by an interminable middle and summed up with a pointless ending. Gilbert and Sullivan fans will no doubt adore it, the remainder of humanity would be better served by avoidance. Additionally the advertising for this film was in my opinion drastically misleading. One would have been justified in thinking that they were purchasing a ticket for an uproarious and perhaps even slapstick comedy and would then be served a dry sometimes tedious character(s) study/drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful, musical and historical but not much of a drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay but overrated: not really a dramatic work, just a slice of life look into G &amp; S at a particularly productive period. It debunks the idea that this duo were such flamboyant individuals that they were bouncing off each other and/or avoiding each other constantly (at least they're not in this time period, after the relative failure of Princess Ida and the success of Mikado), but what statement this bio film does have to say eludes me. Some nice performances from the G &amp; S repertory, but I'm sure we all have our favorite performances on records and videotape. Might make a useful primer for neophytes. And I assume, as in the film version of Shaffer's Amadeus, we're getting a sort of time-machine peek at how these productions originally looked onstage. The story culminates in the premiere of Mikado, which of course is a great work of music and comedy, but the old G &amp; S biography movie with Robert Morley and Maurice Evans climaxed with a revival of Yeoman of the Guard, which I think is Gilbert's and Sullivan's crowning achievement; more importantly, Yeoman became integrated with the particular dramatic values and historical ideas that that older movie was trying to put across. Topsy-Turvy just ends.It straddles the fence (ouch) with regard to the "old" revisionist claim that Sullivan was a notorious womanizer, as opposed to the still newer revisionist claim that he was gay, and just maintained the hetero image to keep the press off the scent, say the way modern celebrities going through troubled marriages deliberately feed news bites to the tabloids so that those reporters don't do any unwelcome digging on their own. How Topsy-Turvy does this is to show Fanny, the particularly visible woman with whom he supposedly dallied, as either a naughty but "platonic" friend, a la Nancy on It's Garry Shandling's Show and Elaine on Seinfeld, or a "fag hag" a la Grace on Will and Grace. Let the audience decide how it wants to interpret the relationship. Basically the stage performances from their operas perk the movie up at intervals, but the dialogue in between is trivial and, as such, too long.I thought that I should vote it a 7 on the IMDb's rating poll, but I saw that the current overall rating was 7.4, so I voted lower in order to help drag the figure down to where I thought it should be (perhaps my vote was a tad unethical, but hey, this is Chicago). It is at least a "7" movie, both for what I think is wrong about it, and for what is wonderfully right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The superb acting could not save this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real pity. The acting is really superb but the film is too long. It is admirable when a film is historically accurate but the danger of becoming slow is great. The director seems to find it difficult to 'kill his babies'. The personal problems of the actors are only described a little bit. To little to become interesting for the story, so it's only interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As if it were only the deleted scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Topsy-Turvy seems less like a movie and more like a reenactment. The viewer is led to wonder at their wonder over a cartridge pen, or the then-primitive telephone. These moments aren't particularly interesting, and feel overly aware of the historical importance.The blurb promised a rollicking good time of behind the scenes action, but the moments where I wanted to get behind the scenes were left unexplored, while actors' discomfort over going on stage without their corsets (in kimonos) was beaten into the ground in several seemingly endless scenes. The writer/director must have found these moments a lot funnier than I did.While "behind the scenes" might be expected to focus on the to be the fighting, writing, and composing of their plays. Those moments are rarely explored in any depth. Instead it is a tedious recording of the making of the Mikado, which might be more interesting if it was an actual production. There is no reason for the thing to run 160 minutes, except that the director couldn't bring himself to cut any of his inspired scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Topsy, No Turvy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilbert and Sullivan were known for productions that had no sense of pacing, were overlong and had cartoon characters. Thus, it makes sense that an immersive study would have the same characteristics.This is from the same filmmaker as "Secrets and Lies" a film of very light touch and sensitive probing of emotions. So one must assume that this film is dull and depressing on purpose, as a statement of art. I mean this seriously.But it may be that the point was supposed to contrast the pure pleasure of the productions with the tragic, desperate lives of the many people who produced it. However, the scenes from the "operettas" aren't that much fun, and this is from someone who is very easy to please.The best scene was Gilbert's father's fit. Had absolutely nothing to do with the story, being just plopped down in isolation, but was fascinating. I could have imagined a stronger film centered on the characters of Spall and the leading lady, Shirley Henderson. Did she do her own singing?This is not art. It is not rewarding. We deserve better from a fine filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this movie made - I just cannot understand.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite amazing how this movie has been given so much attention. I went to see it in the cinema without knowing anything about it apart from the fact that it has received a lot of awards. I was very disappointed. This must be one of the most boring movies of all times. First of all - Gilbert and Sullivan do not seem to be very interesting characters at all. Then to make an entire 3 hour movie about the making of just one of their musicals is frankly stupid. A major weakness is that the movie does not just concentrate on the 2 main characters - there are also stories about many of the other characters of the movie. For this reason the movie just goes on for ever and ever and you just sit back with the feeling that nothing ever happens. I have to say though that there is some very fine acting and the movie gives a very good picture of the Victorian London but the plot of the movie is simply not interesting. I cannot understand why on earth this movie has been produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip the film and see "The "Mikado".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's length is in no way indicative of time necessary to tell its story. That is if a story can be discerned from all of the various characters introduced or subplots leading nowhere. One feels as if a mini series has been edited down to what ultimately became 160 minutes of uninteresting character studies spliced together to create a very tedious film best renamed "Mumbo Jumbo".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy there's 20 minutes I want back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Mike Leigh's work. This is just up there as the worst films ever. It's clichéd "show the Americans some old england" look and ropey dialogue says that Tim Spall, Mike Liegh and Jim Broadbent need to chalk this up as a hangover. It's neither historically accurate not entertaining fiction. Why bother making this? Watching quality actors wrestling with this terrible plot and setting is excruciating. It shows the quality of the personnel that the film ever got made. I've no idea if it made any money, but I sure want my contribution back! I did actually ask for it back - yep I did. This is one of only two films I ever tried to do this with. Don't waste your life on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Disaster - Increadibly Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's absolutely incredible that such a pitiful movie can get such high ratings (7.8 made me see it at the first place). I agree with some other comments that it may be really interesting to the handful of people that have been dying to see how Gilbert &amp; Sullivan have collaborated on some of their operettas. But to the rest of the world, even that with some interest in musical theater (in which group I happen to belong), this movie is just an incredibly dull and totally uninteresting piece of crap (pardon my language if you will). Of course, "De gustibus non disputantum", but the major problem is that G&amp;S "art" is as far from "Handel", "Mozart", or even "Rossini", as Earth is from the Sun (or maybe even a bit farther ;-). And the whole movie is conceived to let the viewer "indulge" in this mediocre music well worth being forgotten for good. After more than two hours of waiting for anything worth my attention, I finally realized that the movie was a totally unsuccessful attempt of copying Milos Forman's "Amadeus". There were just two major problems: Sullivan is light years far from being a Mozart (both as a composer as well as a personality), and T&amp;T director is definitely no Forman, either. Enough said for such a bad movie - my advice is: "Don't watch it unless you're a real masochist, or are doing a Ph.D thesis on either Gilbert, or Sullivan (in which case you're most probably a masochist anyway ;-)!</fullReview>
