		<shortDescription>One most inventive and original films to grace the silver screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delicatessen is hard to pin down under a specific genre label; it's a surreal black comedy, a human drama, a post-apocalyptic horror movie, a twisted thriller, a futuristic fantasy; and all in all; one of the strangest and most original films I've ever seen. In this fantasy world, the world has been ravaged and food is now in short supply. This has therefore made food invaluable and it is being used as currency. Things are traded for with grain, corn and lentils, but not everyone can afford the luxury of food, and some have had to resort to cannibalism to continue to enjoy eating. Our scene opens at a delicatessen in an unspecified location in France, and we are treated to an absolutely delicious sequence (no pun intended) in which a man is desperately trying to hide himself in the trash can. We later find that the reason for this is that this particular delicatessen hires handymen and keeps them long enough to fatten them up, and then they are eaten by the delicatessen's butcher and the inhabitants of the apartment building in which they live. The story really gets going when an ex-clown turns up at the shop, wanting the handyman's job, which has...become available. The plot thickens when the new handyman meets, and later falls in love with, the butcher's daughter; Julie. Julie knows what goes on at the delicatessen and can't allow her new found love to meet the same fate as the others, and therefore does the only thing she can do; hire a band of vegetarian freedom fighters to save her love from becoming dinner for the butcher and his customers.Delicatessen is directed by the team of Marc Caro (whom, I'm afraid, I am unfamiliar with) and the more well known Jean-Pierre Jeunet, director of a few lesser known modern classics, but best known for the enthusiastic 'Amelie'. The film is brought to life by a brilliant ensemble cast. Dominique Pinon (who also featured in Jeunet's Amelie, Alien 4 and City of Lost Children) takes the lead role of the clown turned handyman. His performance is both understated and magical; as he simultaneously manages to entice the viewer into his performance, and yet keeps his character in the realms of reality (a place in which this film doesn't take place). Jean-Claude Dreyfus is the real star of the show, however, as the extroverted and over the top butcher. His performance certainly isn't subdued, to say the least; and every moment that he is on screen is a delight. In a stark contrast to Dreyfus, Marie-Laure Dougnac; the young lady that plays his daughter and love interest for Pinon is very down to earth, and is the most 'normal' character in the film...although there's still room for her to be a nearly blind klutz. The rest of the ensemble comes together excellently, and not a single actor in the film performs below par or looks out of place; and there's not many films that you can say that for.This film isn't quite like anything else I've ever seen. In fact, the only film I can think of that is similar to this is Terry Gilliam's futuristic fantasy; Brazil. The film draws it's originality from it's plot mainly, which is extremely surreal and inventive in itself, but it's not just that which makes Delicatessen one of a kind; it's all the smaller plot points. How many films do you know that feature a bullshit detector? (that is set off when the butcher tells it that "life is wonderful", no less). The way that the film looks is also wonderfully different; Delicatessen has a yellow hue, which lends it a style that is very dull and dreary; and that does the film no end of favours when you consider it's core subject material. The yellow hue also makes the film almost feel like a moving comic book, which is one of the things that gives the film it's surreal and absurd edge. I'm a big fan of atmospheric films, which is one of the main reasons why I like horror so much; and this film also has an atmosphere like no other. It's the way that the yellow-ish buildings look next to the dark skyline, and the way that the film uses darkness and smoke to make it more horrifying (see roof sequence towards the end) that gives this film the finishing touch to it's already distinct style.The love story in the film is sweet and tender, and this very much offsets the dark overtones of the rest of the film. This is nice, as during the scenes between the clown (Pinon) and Julie (Dougnac), the film allows itself to indulge in humour that isn't dark like the rest of the film, and you get the impression that it's enjoying itself a little more. This is just another thing in a long line of great things that make Delicatessen a great movie. Another of these things is the more minor characters. I have never seen a more motley crew than the one in this film. As previously mentioned, Julie, although not entirely 'normal', is the most normal character in the film; the rest of it is populated by lunatics. There's a man with a house full of frogs, a woman that continually tries to commit suicide, a man that puts cans on his deaf mother in law so they know where she is etc. The support cast's wackiness don't add anything much to the story itself (which only really requires them to be there), but the fact that they are different and imaginative is another of the film's absurd edges, and another thing that makes this film different from everything else. Delicatessen concentrates more on being absurd and surreal than it does in posing deep and philosophical questions. Personally, I have no problem with that, but those who do want a movie to be deep and meaningful might find the film disappointing because of that. That is not to say that the film completely lacks depth or meaning; although a moral to the story doesn't seem to present itself, the film takes it's depth from the 'what if' scenario that it presents; "if the world's food supply became too short to feed the population, would you resort to cannibalism or join the vegetarian freedom fighters?". It's a very general message; but it's definitely there.Overall, Delicatessen is a sublime piece of cinema. You wont find imagination and inventiveness to the extent that it is shown here in most films, and that alone is reason enough to warrant this classic status. Delicatessen is everything I say it is and more; and overall the film is one of the true highlights of the 1990's. A gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Citizen Kane is the number one movie to see to learn anything about cinematography, this might as well be at number 2. Delicatessen succeeds at creating a totally separate, consistent and believable universe with a very distinct atmosphere. The brown and green colors add to the weirdness of this universe. Is it horror? Yes and no. Is it a comedy? Yes and no. Is it brilliant? Oh yes!Everybody involved in the making of this picture gave it its best. The camera work is brilliant, the sets are simply amazing (with the final bathroom scene at the pinnacle), the editing and pace is breathtaking.This could have been a very dark movie (and I guess a few Hollywood directors would have tried to turn it into a splatter movie and fail miserably), but the humor is just light, off-beat and hilarious enough to make it into a consistent and bearable whole. Every universe has its humor, and a strange universe has strange humor. Jacques Tati would have loved Delicatessen.Julie's 'tea ceremony' without her glasses, the mattress spring test, Aurore's failing suicide contraptions, it's all funny as hell. I hope everyone who is even marginally involved in making movies gets to see Delicatessen and learns from its greatness. We could sure use a touch of genius in most of them ...10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original movie from the director of 'Amelie'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Delicatessen' is a very original comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who also directed the great 'Amélie'. It tells the story of Louison (Dominique Pinon) who is the new helper of a landlord named Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus). Clapet is a butcher and in a world where food is rare he prepares cannibalistic meals for the people in his building. Louison is the new meal and the people in the building wait for Clapet to kill him so they can eat. Clapet's daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) falls in love with Louison and to save him she seeks help from an underground group.You have read the above and you must understand 'Delicatessen' is not a normal movie. Although its subject is close to very scary the movie is a comedy and to be honest it is very funny at times. Listen to the way people talk here. Especially the conversation between the butcher and a mailman is very funny. The underground group gets a lot of laughs as well. The movie hints at real horror images but never gives us that. Most of the time the tension is broken with something funny.'Delicatessen' is not only pretty funny, it looks terrific as well. From the great opening sequence to the last shot it is visually perfect. The production design and especially the cinematography add a lot to the movie's whole atmosphere. May be it is not for everyone, some will find it ridiculous or the idea too lugubrious, may be it is, but the way the subject is handled is the right way. At least it is interesting and therefore already worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect for My Tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) is a butcher who runs the generically named "Delicatessen" housed in a bombed-out looking apartment building filled to the brim with eccentrics. Since food is scarce in the film's world, Clapet has devised a scheme to provide himself and his tenants with a regular supply of meat--he runs ads in the local paper for handymen, and after they fix a few things on the building, they become the main course. When the film begins, we see a man who tries unsuccessfully to escape. The bulk of the film is the story of Stan Luison (Dominique Pinon), who is the latest person to answer Clapet's advertisement.This film is definitely an acquired taste, so to speak. I've acquired the taste, and for me, it's a 10 out of 10. Delicatessen is set in a weird, post-apocalyptic, alternate universe that is not entirely dissimilar to the setting of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985)--in fact, this could very easily be the same world as Brazil, just that that film is situated in its titular locale, and this would be a less fashionable section of France. Like Brazil, most of the production design--the costumes, music, television programming, etc.--suggests an historic setting, say about the 1940s, but it also seems to be set in the future, or at least an alternate present.In place of Brazil's elaborate, chaotic technology, directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet have created a multi-leveled Rube Goldberg construction. Goldberg was an American cartoonist and sculptor known for drawings of incredibly complex contraptions that often performed simple tasks. This recurs from small scales--the interconnected tubes in the building and the uses of the "Australian", to medium scales?Aurore Interligator's (Silvie Laguna) attempted suicide set-ups, to the grand scale of the film, where each character, or set of characters, is interlocking in different ways that has a small, but complex causal effect on the whole. Sometimes, these concatenations are more simultaneous than causal, as in the ingenious "bedspring symphony" near the beginning of the film.Appropriate to its ultimate subject matter, the visuals are focused on decay and dinginess. The delicatessen is filthy and the apartment building is falling apart. The tenants own a lot of broken things, and for those things that aren't broken, there's a good chance they'll get broken as the film progresses. (And by the way, if you love the production design and atmosphere of the film, and wouldn't mind seeing something with a similar mood, but serious instead of a surrealistic "black comedy" like Delicatessen, check out David Cronenberg's Spider (2002)).All the tenants have various eccentricities, often involving food. One of the most interesting tenants is an old man who decided to harvest his own meals by turning his apartment into a swamp, via regularly running water flooding the apartment, and inhabited by frogs and snails. He has a huge pile of empty snail shells stacking up in a corner. Water is a motif in the film--probably because of its relationship to food, as a means of necessary nourishment, although ironically, in a world characterized by food shortages, water is mostly wasted in the film.While not a depressing film (it wasn't to me, at least, although not that I dislike "depressing" films), Delicatessen isn't exactly uplifting, either, although there is a message of hope at the end, I suppose. It's definitely not for all audiences, but if you're a fan of Gilliam, Cronenberg, David Lynch, and similar directors, you should definitely try a meal at this Delicatessen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sublime fusion of sickening grotesquerie and sentimental clowning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeunet and Caro, with the help of their familiar repertory of actors, create a deeply disturbing and violent world where only a few shreds of conventional social mores remain. These scraps of morality only serve to delineate more clearly the overall decline and collapse of their dystopia. We see a butcher's shop; the proprietor, played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus, is evil almost to the point of caricature. He only manages to survive by killing his lodgers when they get behind with the rent and selling them as meat. However, the situation is given an added twist when we learn that all the lodgers are aware of this; a woman who is sold a joint of mother sheds a couple of stifled tears and mutters she would have liked to have said goodbye. Similarly, the butcher is most apologetic when he accidentally chops off the foot of one of his clients who has paid his rent in full.Into this hellish world is placed someone with his moral values relatively intact. In this case, it is a circus performer played by the marvellously rubber-faced Dominique Pinon. A less engaging actor might have made this character seem two-dimensional, as he appears to have no faults whatsoever (except a set of over-mobile lips). He enthrals the lodgers' children with his games, is immensely chivalrous to the butcher's daughter and plays the musical saw. Finally, an old edition of his act is broadcast on the flickering black-and-white television, and even the most bloodthirsty lodgers are amazed and delighted. The butcher's jealousy is roused; Good and Innocence is forced to fight Evil and Hatred.As such, the plot is relatively straightforward. It is the sheer surrealistic imagination that Jeunet and Caro bring to their films that prevent them being unremittingly bleak or simple morality tales. They display a brilliant sense of musical timing- the whole building frequently becomes an orchestra of creaking bed-springs, croaking frogs, and crackling radios; above all this soars a love-duet of a cello and a musical saw. The faded `look' of the film complements this. With the exception of a single television remote control, nothing here would be out of place in in a exhibition of 40s and 50s design. In `The City of Lost Children' the exuberance of the design threatens to swamp the slender storyline on occasions; here, the more `grown-up' themes and less fantastic design go hand in hand.(A word of warning about the video release- the subtitles appear to have been written be a couple of Frenchmen who really ought to have concentrated harder in their English classes at school. Apart from that, I wholeheartedly recommend this joyously grotesque film.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolutely riveting!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melding the perfect mixture of the visual grace of a silent film with a modern soundscape and bearing a twenty-first century post-apocalyptic sardonic sense of humor, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro's "Delicatessen" becomes one of the finest contemporary films.This pitch black comedy delves into cannibalism and oddball romance in the same breath with equal gusto and therefore feels horrific, humorous, and haunting all at once. Every frame is a wonder of detail and originality that reinvigorates even the most jaded and long-time film viewer with the sense of rediscovering the art form. This is film-making in the highest regard worthy of praise, awe, and multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think the cannibal movie subgenre has been milked dry... think again! This one will have you from the opening credits. It's set in a crumbling apartment building in 21st century, post-apocalyptic Paris where food is at a minimum, grains are used as money and the butcher downstairs runs a black-market deli providing clientel with what seems to be the only meat product available, and it ain't chicken.Dominique Pinon is an ex-circus clown who answers a personal ad doing odd jobs there and encounters assorted weirdos while being targeted as the main course. There's a noncomformist who eats snails and frogs, a band of grimy cave-dwelling looters, an unhinged woman whose botched suicide attempts are comic highlights and an amazing musical sequence featuring a cello, creaky bed springs, machinery, drills and other noises combining to create a symphony of sounds.The oppressive atmosphere and murky brown color schemes could have easily turned this into a dreary disaster, but the directors keep it offbeat, surprising and clever throughout, and don't miss their chance to throw in some inventive black comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb film. The look and design of the sets is unique and the narrative is certainly original!! I would place this film along with others like Being John Malkovich as it really did make me sit up and take notice. There are some truly great set pieces in the film particularly when the whole house starts to get into the same rhythm as the love makers on the top floor ( ripped off by an American Beer company I note in an advert ) and the botched suicide attempt too - hey I said it is darkly amusing!! I would say that there is not a weak performance amongst the cast in this evocative tale of futuristic cannibalism!! Basically, trying to describe this film makes it sound too bizarre but I highly recommend it to anyone who likes originality and their humour on the edge of darkness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cornerstone of originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clever ideas and good notion of filmmaking are at the core of this movie, whose storyline is the smallest asset. But you won't really care when you see it, because even though the story isn't really elaborate, what you have here is one of the most original movies you'll ever get your eyes on. The setting is perfect, with no historic or geographic references, only an estranged building, which doesn't have a single straight normal tenant. The result is a magnificent work of actors, cinematography and set dressing, that makes the most of visual resources for a movie. The directors Jeunet &amp; Caro show their true potential in this movie that will keep you glued with its naive-like comedy style, and its unique set of characters, which could generate a separate movie about each and every one of them. Magnificent, and truly original.</fullReview>

No other movie I've seen so far could top this one for its combination of wittiness, dark humor, love for detail and collection of regular people holding a mirror up to each and everyone of us, showing us how strange we really are.Indeed this movie will not be constrained by a classification as romance, comedy or science fiction or horror. It is much more than the sum of these - it is a work of art and the painstaking work and love for detail which Jeunet &amp; Caro have put into it show everywhere you look.This movie is definitely off-beat and I definitely love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The brilliant debut of Caro &amp; Jeunet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 70s, french director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and designer Marc Caro met and found they shared a lot of interests in the visual arts, their friendship soon became an artistic team that would spent the whole 80s making short films where the duo was able to explore and master the cinema language, perfecting their storytelling abilities and visual design skills, preparing themselves to make a career in film-making. Their efforts were crowned in 1991, when they were finally able to take their craft to a full feature length film, in the project that would become their breakthrough in the film industry and the proper beginning of their careers as filmmakers: the post-apocalyptic comedy "Delicatessen".The world of "Delicatessen" is a dark bleak France where there is apparently no law and food is incredibly sparse (and is now used as currency). In this post-apocalyptic world, the residents of an apartment building in the middle of nowhere have found a solution to the hunger thanks to their landlord, the butcher Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who from time to time kills the building's handyman to feed the bizarre group of tenants. One day, former clown Louison (Dominique Pinon) arrives to the building and gets the handyman position, but unfortunately for Clapet and the other tenants, the butcher's daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) has fallen in love with Louison, and will do whatever is necessary to stop the madness of the delicatessen.Written by Gilles Adrien (who also wrote many of the previous Jeunet &amp; Caro shorts) as well as Jeunet &amp; Caro themselves, "Delicatessen" is a wonderfully imaginative tale of sweet romance and hilarious black comedy that gives an unexpected light-hearted twist to a plot that most writers would treat as a serious subject matter. And surprisingly it works, as while the story is anything but complex, the assortment of strange (yet very human) characters that populate the world of "Delicatessen" truly become the movie's soul. And not only the main characters, as every single one of them (no matter how small the role is) is highly detailed and serves a specific function as if the whole building was one of the odd machines that still work in this post-apocalyptic portrait of France.Visually, the film is simply sublime. Since the directors decided to divide responsibilities, Marc Caro took full control of the production design and the artistic elements of the movie, so with this freedom Caro's inventive artistic vision reaches new heights creating a movie that could be described as a moving canvas. Highly atmospheric, the french duo takes the cinematography (by Darius Khondji) to the next level mixing techniques and showing a whole range of influences that go from German Expressionism to 40s modernism, resulting in one of the most beautiful looking movies ever done. Still, the movie is more than a visual fest, as Jeunet (in charge of guiding the actors) shows a complete domain over his cast &amp; crew keeping the many elements of the film working nicely in the right place.As written above, the characters are the film's soul, and the ensemble of actors playing them really made a terrific job in the film. Dominique Pinon (who would become one of Jeunet's regular collaborators) delivers a subtle and charming performance as the ex-clown Louison. He is very believable in the role, and gives the character a very human touch, essential for the kind of character he is playing. The same can be said of Marie-Laure Dougnac, who plays Louison's love interest, Julie, one of the "more normal" characters in the movie. Jean-Claude Dreyfus as Clapet the Butcher is simply delightful as the story's "villian", and basically every member of the cast delivers an unforgettable performance no matter how long or short is their screen time (Silvie Laguna for example, is really wonderful)."Delicatessen" is a solid debut by this two skillful french artists, and it already shows why the two quickly became an important team in the French fantasy cinema. Their very own brand of surrealist fantasy flows freely through the film making a unique visual fest (although it definitely goes a bit over-the-top at times), and while it doesn't reach the artistic level of their follow-up (the 1995 classic "La Cité Des Enfants Perdus"), it's still a nicely done movie that most importantly, never gets boring or tiresome. Unlike their later films, "Delicatessen" may not be for everyone, as it's mix of black comedy and surreal fantasy may seem at times too close to absurd to be enjoyable. However, those with a taste for the bizarre will find a great movie in this French comedy.While "Delicatessen" still shows the excess of the young and raw talent of Jeunet &amp; Caro, it's not hard to see why they became known worldwide after this initial success, as this movie shows the enormous potential of their skills as filmmakers. This brilliant mixture of genres is definitely a very recommended movie, and like "La Cité Des Enfants Perdus" ("City of the Lost Children"), an essential film of the 90s. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Connections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most commentors on this marvel at the imagination, the adventuresome cinematography and the mix of black and humor. I found these amusing, but hardly interesting.What was interesting was how many ways the film explored human connection. Usually you get two: love (or some surrogate) and folded insight, connecting the movie to the viewer.Here you have:? eating one another and with each other ? love of course, love in the romantic sense ? sex (well, this is common too, but not usually divorced from love) ? performing together (two ways) ? conspiring togetherYou have connections themselves by radio, TeeVee, performing, pipes and chutes in the building (about which much is made), and a repeated set of Rube Goldberg suicide mechanisms. String, yarn, boomerang knife. Postal packages. None of these make sense unless you believe they were put there to make sense.It is as if they decided first to make a film about connection, and then to place it in a threatening future, allowing filming tricks.I'm glad this guy went on to make at least one film after this that found coherence. Maybe we have to sit through some number of these sometimes to get a good film. God knows that Terry Gilliam has punished before he rewards.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as style goes, this is almost without parallel. Jeunet's own 'Amelie' has moments of very similar style shots and humour and Gilliam's 'Brazil' has some of the zanyness and other world quality of it but other than that, it's more or less on it's own as an example of off-beat hard to pigeonhole non mainstream film.It's a comedy, a dark(ish) post apocalyptic drama, an art house movie, a love story. It touches on horror at times and seems to tick so many boxes, yet doesn't sit in any one of them. Few films manage that so well.The lighting is inventive and the sets are incredible. Even the subtle change of colour tone at the end, perhaps suggesting that everything will be alright now, cleverly plays on the subconscious and beautifully lightens the whole mood of the film at it's close.The wonderfully comic timed spring mattress duet that Louison and Mme Plusse share and Aurore's tragically pathetic attempts to kill herself which only succeed when she doesn't want to do it anymore are shining moments in the comedy of Delicatessen.The militant vegetarians who attempt the rescue and the old self sufficient man living in a flooded apartment with frogs and snails growing wild, providing him with a ready source of food are just part of the absurdity and yet wonder of a film that delights and amazes in equal measures.Truly a great film and to paraphrase a review of The Wire (TV's greatest ever series), I would seriously suggest that "you either love it or you haven't seen it yet"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious escape into French Surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a French movie by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and somebody else. Jeunet recently did Alien Resurrection, but that movie is nothing like this one. Delicatessen appears to be a rather low-budget movie. It has no great special effects or dazzling cinematography, but it is brilliant none-the-less.Delicatessen is about an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic Earth. At the bottom of this apartment block is a delicatessen where the butcher sells human meat, and he gets this meat from the people that live in the building. Then a nice man named Louisan comes to the apartment for a job and falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. The problem is that Louisan is the next person on the list to be cut up and sold.This movie comes under the classification of foreign movie. There is nothing deep and insightful in it, other than the barbarity of man. That is, in a time where there is no food, humanity will resort to cannibalism to survive. What makes this movie unique though is the characters. The French seem to excel in making brilliant characters. Where the Americans will put serious characters in silly situations, the French put silly characters in serious situations. My favourite is when the trogs kidnapped the wrong woman and then have an argument as to whether she is male or not. Then they realise she is not male so run off leaving her tied up. One then comes back, unties her, kisses her and says "that's in case I don't come back," Okay, you might not think its that funny, but the movie is. American movies tend to have the problem of having the first ten minutes hilarious and then the rest of it is ordinary. The French movies start rather ordinary and the comedy tends to last. It usually is because the characters are just so well done, and they remain in character right through.Delicatessen is just great if you want to see a decent comedy. It is French, and it is much better than a lot of American movies I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good yet strange french film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since "The City of Lost Children" have I been so curious about a film.This film takes place in the after a war of some sort leaving the world in shambles. A traveling man ends up taking work at a rather shady Delicatessen doing odd jobs. The movie then goes to apartment life examining the different traits of the tenants. Well our traveling man ends up going across the wrong path attempting to hook up with the Butcher's daughter...and so the life of danger begins.Well this movie is much like "The city of lost children" in that the background is so interesting that it tends to take from most of the film...yet the characters also hold that interest. The biggest issue I have from the film is that the characters and background tend to outshine the story itself. Otherwise I can say that this is a truly wonderful film that I'd love to watch a second time. Be wary though the language is french only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fiendish delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of Jeunet's more recent films, I was happy to find this one on cable last week. I found myself chuckling through the whole thing; not just at the jokes, but at the painstaking way Jeunet and Caro plant plot, scenic, and sound details that later play important parts in the film. (They even took time for things like designing and filming one of the cleverest opening credit sequences I've seen.) Jeunet's films are a feast of color and sound, where almost every character is memorable in his/her own way.The plot is simple, but why complain? The directors have created an entire world for us to enjoy, filled with quirky people (the suicide woman, the guys who make animal-noisemakers...for whom?), weird set design (there must be a plumbing fetishist on the crew), and painstakingly-created set pieces (the flood, the fight on the roof, the squeaky bed). Relax and let your eyes and ears be dazzled by this offbeat comic romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I was really shocked when I have seen this movie.Film is made with Sepia technique, but I didn't realized that it will be so "experimental". Everything in this movie is so fresh, and unpredictable, and new, and fantastic, and there is even a beautiful love story incorporated! :) Delicatessen differs so much from today's Hollywood movies, which all are filmed in similar fashion. I have picked this one from one of the "Best off" SF list, and I am glad I have watched it. I don't have much time to spend, and I tend to preselect movie on which one I will spend two hours of my time.European movies are so interesting and rich in comparison with US films, and I don't get how is possible that people still watch low quality stuff, when there are masterworks like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great oddity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This visually impressive and imaginative movie is probably Jeunet's best. Here he and his usual team create what they do best, namely weirdness. Take Amelie, remove everything that people label "so French" and turn it inside out. That's the feeling of Delicatessen.The plot is goofy but works very well in the movie and has so many little twists and turns it never lets go of your attention. The quirky(for lack of a better word) characters and the great dark humour is not for everyone, but if you can appreciate it then you won't be disappointed.The acting is good, and the various weirdos in the apartments are very convincing. A personal favourite was a guy who grows frogs and snails in his apartment. His insane look was a treat.If you really liked Amelie then you might also like this. That being said, they are very different while maintaining the same basic mood. Do yourself a favour, delve in the mind of Jeunet and check out this dark and twisted comedy for those with good taste...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeunet and Caro paint a dark world of hilarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Envision a post-apocalyptic world where all but a few sunbeams are blocked out by thick clouds. Most animals and plants have either perished or were claimed by the upper part of the food chain. All currencies have lost their value; after all, you'd spoil you stomach eating them. Instead, the status of money has been replaced by small sacks of corn. Meanwhile, the poor are starving. In a French suburb, a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) has made a merit of the people's necessity. Zealously he accumulates hoards of treasures by providing his tenants with meat. Human meat, that is. Under the pretence of offering a janitor's job, he slyly lures strangers into his house until finally turning them into profitable delicatessen. His next victim is already under way, Louison (Dominique Pinon), a former circus performer, arrives shortly after his predecessor has ultimately "moved out". Little does he know of the neighbours' cannibalistic intentions and his grave danger! Luckily, he forms a tender friendship with Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac), the murderous butcher's rebellious (vegetarian) daughter. When she is trying to save good-hearted Louison's life matters get out of hand and, not unexpectedly, resort to total chaos. Sounds gloomy, doesn't it? But "Delicatessen" is neither a horrific dystopia nor a social experiment. In fact Marc Caro has created a dark futuristic environment for portraying tremendously comic characters surrounded by the most amusing of oddities. In one scene a tenant tries to pay his debts by offering the landlord a rat-attracting whistle and gets gruffly refused because the bothersome rodents are already extinct. The droll idea itself that an immensely survivable species such as rats (whose uncontrollable numbers could not even be reduced by the most drastic of measures) has been eradicated by sheer human appetite put a grin on my face. There are dozens of similar hilarities of unmatched creativity, both big and small, at which I couldn't help but smile at. The film is filled to the brim with originality and black-humoured knowingness about life and (what else?) love. Jean-Pierre Jeunet adds his touch with quirky cinematography, setting a surrealistic mood which is charmingly emphasized by a fitting score. Being a comedy, "Delicatessen" provides little of philosophical value and does hardly preach on the deficiencies of human nature. Only sympathetic Louison offers an optimistic theory, something like: "There are no bad people? just bad circumstances. Or they just don't know what they are doing." Of course they know perfectly well. Hence all the fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro crafted a near-perfect film in Delicatessen, an almost indescribably unique French comedy concerning cannibalism, troglodytes, a circus clown, myopia, suicide, and sex -- and it's all set following some kind of apocalyptic catastrophe. An extraordinary group of actors (with faces worthy of Fellini) play the desperate residents of an apartment where one's next meal could literally be the neighbor from down the hall. The elastic-featured Dominique Pinon, as the clown turned handyman, is a joy to watch. Delicatessen is packed with Rube Goldberg-style set-pieces (I especially love the fixing of the bed spring as well as the rooftop battle during the television broadcast) that leave you breathless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't mind weird French films because they're often engrossing and unique. This certainly was different but I was ready to fast-forward it at one point because I was losing interest; a bit slow-moving, especially at the beginning, but it gained momentum along with its weirdness. It supposedly takes place in a post-apocalyptic world but, judging by the set and props, looks like the 1960s. There were many different sub-plots going on at the same time, most of which worked well together. I don't think the underground force segment fit well with the rest of the story. For the most part, I thought the characters were well-developed and memorable. Fine performances all around (especially Dominique Pinon) but I was expecting much more from Jean Pierre Jeunet (who directed Amélie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicatessen.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently watching this movie in a film studies lesson at school was left with an unsettled opinion. The film itself is undoubtedly outstanding in its artistic individuality, with Jeunet and Caro creating a masterpiece which is praised by film critics and viewers alike.Throughout the film the lavish use of colour and various shot types are what make the film such a wonder to watch. Jeunet uses alternative camera angles to create a somewhat obscure feeling whilst watching. The use of angles is especially what makes us feel like we are not only watching a movie but that we are becoming part of Jeunet and Caro's wondrous creation.The humour is somewhat bizarre but is still presented to us in a way which can be appreciated audiences; especially with Aurores various attempts at suicide and the distinguishing ways in which characters are filmed and presented. The overall plot itself contains some form of humour; boy meets girl and girl's father tries to use him for meat, this all being set in an apocalyptic future. To me that does not sound like a typical romantic comedy, giving the film an element of (as I have already stated) individuality but it also makes it quite charming.The overall film itself is very unconventional, especially with all the cinematic stylistic techniques and the individual touches added by the directors. However although I am able to appreciate this film in all its cinematic beauty I still find that I am unable to say that I am greatly fond of it. Yes, I think that it is a work of art by Jeunet and Caro and Yes, I think that it's highly appealing to some but I do not find the overall idea of the film that interesting. I would watch it again to be left in awe of the way it was made, but I don't think I would watch it as a form of entertainment. It is almost as if I appreciate this film for its artistic importance, much like a Shakespeare play or a Monet painting, rather than appreciate the film for actually being a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A far finer work than "City of Lost Children"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The elaborate, carefully planned comedy - even in the opening credits, in which nothing moves - must have been maddeningly difficult to shoot. It's a pity Jeunet and Caro sought to top their efforts when they made "The City of Lost Children" five years later. The result was lifeless and over-elaborate; here, the level of elaboration is just right, with no sequence allowed to be more complicated than it is clever. And even the most gratuitous fantasia - like the montage with the creaking bedsprings, the ceiling repair, the cellist and the metronome, the knitting, the drilling, and the bicycle pump - grows naturally out of the story, like a flower on a vine.But the biggest surprise to someone expecting another "City of Lost Children" is how real the sentiment is. Both films are populated chiefly by grotesques; the difference with the earlier one is that we're allowed to see the human beings underneath, without being invited to laugh ironically. It's worth noting that in the later film all finer human feelings were given to the mentally deficient - a retarded loner, a complete madman, and a child - as if sanity and intelligence precluded the possibility of any other admirable trait. But in "Delicatessen", Louison, however na?ve he may be, is no fool; the enchanting Juliet, even as she fumbles her way through a disastrous date because she feel embarrassed wearing glasses, is no object of ridicule. Nobody, in fact, is completely an object of ridicule. Even the butcher is allowed a moment or two when he is neither a joke nor a threat but a human being, one who finds he regrets the life he now leads but is not persuaded to abandon it.Even if "Delicatessen" had been recommended to me I doubt I'd have seen it in its original release. The fact that it was being praised as black comedy would have scared me off. It is indeed black comedy, but I urge you not to be scared: there's nothing nasty about the taste, and the dominant tone is one of optimism. We don't know the nature of the calamity that has struck this world. (It's not, as some people have mistakenly thought, anything so mundane or so easily comprehensible as nuclear war.) We don't know if the plants will ever grow back. But there's so much genuine hope it's hard to believe they won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the French could have pulled this off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The French,' said James Russell Lowell, `are the most wonderful creatures for talking wisely and acting foolishly that I ever saw.' And good old Henry Adams once said that what he disliked most about the French was their mind, their way of thinking. Why? Because, he said, the French were not serious. France is not serious. It's an insult; and, it's a compliment. Once their proclivity for playing `Sidewalk Socrates' is understood, one can begin to enjoy them. Henry Adams loved Paris when he got past the surface: `France was not serious, and he [Adams] was not serious in going there.' I say this by way of introduction to the French movie Delicatessen because, frankly, most French movies really bite. They have that bottom of the birdcage quality, which comes from trying too hard to be deep and philosophical, coming off as ineffably silly instead. Delicatessen avoids all of that because it doesn't try to be serious. There's nothing pretentious about it. But it could be. It's an outrageously funny black comedy. Only the French, with the penchant for speaking wisely, and acting foolishly, could have pulled this off. It's almost a satirical caricature of French society as a whole. Set in an apartment complex with a ground floor delicatessen, drifters check in, but don't check out ? that is, until a former circus clown shows up. The owner's daughter and the erstwhile circus performer fall in love, throwing her father's brutally perfected supply `system' (fresh meat) all out of whack. The `process,' it seems, cannot tolerate exceptions to the rule, especially not such impractical sentiments as love. Delicatessen has some outrageously comical setups. And best of all, the inhabitants are all laughable, each in their own way, from the murderous landlord, to his delicate little daughter named Julie. I won't spoil the fun for you by telling you any more. I urge you to find out for yourself. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weirdly delicious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weirdly delicious film, I cannot define this in a better way. Filled with idiosyncratic characters and eccentric scenes, this film is all about these characters above all else. In a building where a butcher heads a group of people and invites tenants on his terms and conditions, he acts with a weird sense. The building is dilapidated, the time frame is not mentioned and is left for ambiguity, the actions of characters are mostly out of place and hard to find reason. Yet, all of this makes an interesting a fun film. The fun is derived by the color toning of the film which is partially sepia. Also, the fun lies in the camera work by Darius Khondji. The whole setup and production design is done peculiarly to make us curious. From the first frame, of the film I was kept curious till the end as to what is happening on screen and where will it lead. For sure, the screenplay is gripping and it proves that however a story may be but if told interestingly, it can be great fun to watch.The editing is another department where the film knocks out a punch. It is meticulous and all the way meant to be interesting I believe that in a film if there is never a dull moment then the credit should go to the editing, and rightly so I do for this film. The actors are not known to me considering that this is french film. Yet, all of them are superb in their roles. From a tenant, to the head the looks they give, the expressions they showcase,. the tone of voice they speak in, are all instigating curiosity on the lines of fun and humor. Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro have given us a treat of black comedy and sarcasm embedded with fun and frolic of unpredictable characters. These directors have to be commended for this work which is indeed one of the fine cult movies of 1990's. French Cinema in itself is years ahead of contemporary cinema in other parts of world and this film just proves that. A 4/5 for a delicious film</fullReview>

A feast for the mind and eye, though this film is not for every one and you have to be patient for the plot to unveil, you have to be attentive with the details, as this is not a movie to watch if you are not in the right mood. It sets place in a building populated with a bunch of odd characters. They are all very strange but yet likable even though some of them are pure evil. You cannot identify in what city the movie takes place, or in what time period, all you know is that happens in France in a surrealist, apocalyptic background, when food sources were scarce and people must find alternative sources. I felt like the authors favored the vegetarians and portrayed the carnivores as crazy brutes driven by desire, capable to go to unbelievable lengths for their little piece of meat.

		<fullReview>The originality in the script with finest camera-work and a handful of funny characters does the trick. A dark comedy by Jean-Pierre Jeunet created upon a post-apocalyptic time (at times when food grains are used as currencies). Since the movie is dark natured with lot of weird scenes in surreal situations, the viewer must consider it only as a parody of human-life and not seriously. To mention some : 1) bed-springs sound for a symphony 2) soporific tea scene 4) Cow noise toys and a house full of mad people The plot gets too predictable and even though the story is original it is still hollow/weak.The bottom line : it is a food/recipe which I'd like to taste again and again (would watch the movie again) but may not be the same for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another very distinctive comic fantasy from Jeunet and Caro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This French cult movie is a somewhat unusual take on the cannibal film. Set exclusively in an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic city. Food is in very short supply and the butcher/landlord rules the roost. It seems that he is chopping up unsuspecting guests and selling their meat on to his impoverished tenants. One day an ex-circus clown moves in and unwittingly becomes the next target of the butcher.This is a Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro film. Like their other features like The Bunker of the Last Gunshots and The City of the Lost Children, this one also is set in a post-apocalyptic world of extremely vague origins. All their films thrust the viewer into such an alternate world but don't tell them quite why things are like the way they are. Visually, Delicatessen follows the same specific aesthetic as the others too, with an earthy brown and green colour scheme and a retro styling. The apartment block and dress of the inhabitants all recall a much earlier age, yet the setting is clearly in the future. Or is it really simply an alternate world? It's up to the viewer to decide. Whatever the case, this is another visually intricate work, with very detailed set design. There is a lot of consideration taken in creating the surreal world. This also extends to the characterisations too, such as the eccentric man played by Howard Vernon who lives in a dank cellar with a host of frogs and snails for company or the suicidal woman who conceives highly elaborate plans for ending her life, all of which fail for various reasons. You can probably guess from this that the humour is of the dark variety but there are many light comic moments too, such as the excellent scene where various tenants inadvertently create a rhythmical musical number simply by going about their day to day business. There really are a lot of different things to enjoy in this highly inventive comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Form trumps content in Jeunet's and Caro's uncompromising debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Delicatessen" marks Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's first film and it hit like a bomb. While despised by some, it even represents the reinvention of French cinema with new means to others, is the pathfinder of a new avant-garde, which would peak with Jeunet's later "Amelie". Well, "Delicatessen" for sure is an exalting, one-of-a-kind trip into a fantastic, twisted retro-future reality, a very unique dark comedy, quirky in all places, uncompromising in every respect. Indeed, the creative duo behind the project made exactly what they wanted to do - Jeunet, the guy who started off as a director of TV commercials and Caro, the designer/artist with the eye for the extraordinary out-of-place stuff. What is central in this kind of movie is that form dominates over content - to such an extreme degree at times that the narrative might suffer, but it is all embedded in a constantly turning kaleidoscope of impressions that sweeps the viewer with it. Everything is different, mysterious, weird in this surreal setting of a post-apocalyptic apartment building where a butcher hunts for human meat, where grain replaces money, underground living troglodytes plan a revolution and a retired clown enjoys playing the saw."Delicatessen", while very original, still quotes other movies in a lot of places, and is quoted regularly since its release, clearly showing its impact as a true postmodern phenomenon. Unforgettable are moments like when the whole house suddenly begins to follow a rhythm thanks to noises traveling through its pipes, or when a closer look is necessary at one of the beds to determine a problematic spring. Sounds difficult to imagine why these are classic moments? Well, one needs to see the realization to become a believer. Or learn why to reject it. Because Jeunet movies are as he describes it best himself: Fish, not meat, and you need to be a fish person. At any rate, even if you applaud to Jeunet's resourcefulness: Enjoy him in doses!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what anyone thinks of when they hear the genre surrealist black comedy. I know I had no idea what to expect from that when reading it in Delicatessen's synopsis. But after watching it I would have to agree. Delicatessen is just that. It's surreal, dark, and twistedly funny. It's the very first film from artsy French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and one of two collaborations between him and Marc Caro. Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular, stars as Louison, a clown who moves into an apartment building run by a fat lard of a landlord who also happens to be a butcher. Louison begins to fall in love with the landlord's daughter, Julie, and this stirs up a lot of trouble in this run down little apartment which is full of bizarre characters and is also smack dab in the middle of a post apocalyptic hellscape. What more could you want? Delicatessen is an odd film to watch. I honestly don't know what any of it means and I'm still piecing together what I just watched, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching it. It's incredibly strange, funny in a devilish and stomach churning kind of way, the kind of humor that you're not sure you should be laughing at, or you're a little afraid to laugh at. For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome.Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses. It's creepy and confusing to watch, but you can't help but enjoy it. Nothing is normal in this film, hence the surreal aspect to it, and there's only a weak strand of reality running through this topsy turvy flick. But every aspect of the film fits this crazy mixed up world Jeunet and Caro have created. Everything from the odd scenery that all seems out of place, to the collection of strangely twisted characters that inhabit the apartment, it all fits right in with this world that makes absolutely no sense.Delicatessen is as funny as it is creepy and as entertaining as it is fascinating. As far as analyzing the film goes I'm lost, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot about this film to still be deciphered, but that will have to come at a later date after many more viewings of this exceptionally strange film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicatessen is the second movie of Jean-Pierre Jeunet I'm watching after the notable "Amelie" and this movie really explains that the director's imagination is boundless. May be like Terry Gilliam who is famous for Twelve Monkeys, Brazil etc ?The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world based on a butcher (Clapet) who owns an apartment, a new helper(Louison), a circus performer and its tenants, each one of them is hilariously weird. In a world where there is a scarcity of food and it is used as currency, cannibalism has become a way of survival. Clapet fishes people with an advertisement for a helper job and Louison arrives there. Clapet and his tenants planning to feast Louison is the plot. The love between Clapet's daughter and Louison is tender and sweet.Darius Khondji, cinematographer of the movie has done a fabulous job. And editing of the movie is also noteworthy. The title part of the movie is so creative and intriguing.Delicatessen is not a normal film but a dark comedy, weirdly filmed and is very funny at times.

		<shortDescription>very dark but gloriously absurd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost from the start, with the closeups of fat faces in very strange expressions, I sensed that I had seen the style elsewhere. Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough, it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies; not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak, murky, misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison (Dominique Pinon) is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys (or "young rascals" played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde) are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed, at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet (Marie-Loure Dougnat) are playing a duet, she on the cello, he on the saw(?!). Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact, whenever Louison is shown clowning around, the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover (Karin Viard) are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you loved Amelie as much as I did then I think you will enjoy this film.A not-so-feel-good dark, romantic comedy who's story-line is like nothing I've ever seen before. There isn't much background but the viewer dives right into the despair and antics of the very expressive characters. It's amazing that as far fetched as this story is, you still can't help but believe it might be true...one day...Beautiful cinematography and costumes...the subtitles are only a bonus for you can read the lines right off their faces.Please Watch :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been following the reviews of Brandt Sponseller for some time, which has inspired me to participate to a lesser degree in this review process. There are several other reviewers that I follow but Brandt seems to have more fun with it than other serious movie buffs. So a tip of the hat to Brandt for introducing me to dozens of movies that I normally would not have seen, his review of Delicatessen persuaded me to watch what is now my very most favorite movie of all time. Sorry Mister Gilliam, but Brazil has now slipped to number two.Aside from being the most well constructed movie I've ever seen, the subtext of the character types runs so strongly throughout the central theme that this could easily be one of the ten best movies of all time. So well done that I wish that there were more starts to rate it with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is based upon the Special Edition. I've been wanting to watch this for years, and I was not disappointed in the least. In fact, I could not take my eyes off this for a second. This takes place in the future, in a post-apocalyptic time where natural food is so difficult to come by, it's used as currency. A butcher decides to take on this problem with a very hands-on solution... cannibalism. The story is well-told. Editing and cinematography is amazing, and this has some unforgettable images and sequences. The black comedy is hilarious, and hardly any joke or gag falls flat or feels forced. Characters are well-developed and interesting. Everyone is well-cast, including Pinon, who keeps getting hired, and with good reason, by Jeunet(whose efforts I continue to follow with great anticipation for every production of his that I get to view). The acting is flawless, even the kids are convincing. This has a great pace, and is not boring for a second. I don't know enough to say if the concept is completely original, but it didn't remind me of anything I've seen or read before(I hear that at least one aspect is similar to Brazil, though). This is immensely creative and imaginative. The script contains plenty of surprises. This builds atmosphere impeccably well, and is rather exciting when it goes for that. Parts of this are rather surreal. Not speaking enough French to judge it, I can only comment on the understanding of the dialog that I got from the English subtitles; a lot of it is quite clever. There is a little strong language, a couple of hints at sexuality and several instances of disturbing content. The DVD comes with an excellent director's commentary(albeit sans Caro, since he does not care for them), two featurettes that I will review on their individual pages here on the site, a teaser, a trailer and a photo gallery. I recommend this to any fan of this style of humor, dystopian settings and/or the duo of Jean-Pierre and Marc. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DelicatessenBrilliantly inspired lunatic genius. This movie is set in another universe that looks like maybe a post-apocalyptic French village. It's along the same lines as Terry Gilliam's "Brazil," a world in which too much has gone wrong and there's an underground group trying to right things. It's another "best movie you've never heard of" candidate, directed by Marc Caro and Jean- Pierre Jeunet; starring a bunch of French actors you've never heard of. (Well, I've never heard of them.)I'm unwilling to try to summarize the plot, I won't even try to describe it. It's a bizarre, funny movie that you'll love or hate. The characters are wonderful, the situations are delicious, and the possibilities are intriguing. As I sit here remembering the movie, the scenes wash through my mind, and there is nothing I can recount here that would make any sense.Caro has done nothing else I've heard of. Jeunet wrote and directed (in the American English titles) "A Very Long Engagement," "Amelie," and "The City of Lost Children," all of which I've seen, and "Alien 4" (also known as "Alien: Resurrection"), which I've seen parts of as I've surfed the channels. "Delicatessen" is nothing like them, nothing like anything else you've seen.Ultimately it's a series of more or less loosely connected skits that are fall off your chair hilarious, tied together in building with a street-level deli and people renting rooms on the five or so floors above. The originality of the scenes is unequalled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming, quirky, and beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a post-apocalyptic world, where food is hard to come by, the owner of a deli and landlord of an apartment building, Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), uses his chubby maintenance men as culinary currency. A kink forms in Clapet's plan when he hires a circus clown, Louison (Dominique Pinon), who develops a romance with Clapet's daughter, Julie Clapet (Marie-Laure Dougnac).While Delicatessen may not be a typical horror to all, it certainly is the type of dark, dark comedy that can appeal to the horror crowd. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of the most talented filmmakers in the history of French cinema with such fantastic films as Amélie, The City of Lost Children, and A Very Long Engagement. Delicatessen is not a stray from Jeunet's greatness. The direction and, specifically, the cinematography are impeccable. Jeunet and Caro took a phenomenal script and turned it into a beautiful film. But, we cannot forget about the actors that embodied their peculiar characters so wonderfully.Final verdict: 9/10. Don't miss this sometimes-forgotten masterpiece.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first glance this film might not seem very appealing, a dismal brown colour scheme in a film set in a post-apocalyptic era doesn't scream "Watch me!".In reality however this film is well worth the time of day, a remarkably good film from Jean-Pierre Jeunet in his debut feature film. Its both dark, comical and often absurd.The film has a somewhat endearing characteristic washed up in the distopic future where food is so scarce that the local butcher is forced (though he somewhat enjoys it) to kill the lured in tenants in order to keep his customers satisfied. However disaster strikes when Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac), The butchers (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) daughter falls in love with the new tenant, Louison (Dominique Pinon) aka, dinner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Exploited Themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet invites the viewer to a rather bizarre, post-apocalyptic, alternate universe that is not entirely dissimilar to the setting of his later work in Amelie. Both embody futuristic-like fantasy worlds where dark comedy, human drama and twisted thrills excite the viewer to become active in the storytelling process. I believe his purpose in making this film is for satirical reasons. He seems to be poking fun at a variety of cultural norms/taboos: caricature-like non-stereotypes, the renowned dictum, "the end is nigh", the war between carnivores and herbivores, and the awkwardness of the beginning stages of love.Caricature-like non-stereotypes: The wackiness of the characters in this film place a very imaginative dynamic that helps add to the story's absurdity. Set in what appears to be 1940's France, a cast of lunatics populate a run-down hotel, or what really seems like an insane asylum. These people are not your normal crowd: a man whose living room is infested with frogs, an anxious and delirious woman who tries numerous ways to commit suicide, an ex-clown turned handyman, a cannibalistic butcher, a band of vegetarian freedom fighters, a man who puts rattling cans on his deaf grandmother in order to keep an eye on her, and many others. It's almost as if Jeunet is trying to take the average stereotype of a culture and blow it way out of proportion in order to create a world that no one has ever seen before. The result: people laugh. Why? Because it goes against the conventions of what is considered "normal." Funny enough, however, calling something "strange" or "normal" is a stereotype of itself that is identified with other culture's look at our own respected culture. Delicatessen may just be a film that you go strictly for the humorous experience rather than trying to gain some deep philosophical meaning from."The End is Nigh": In this post-Apocalyptic fantasy world, the world has been ravaged and food is now in short supply. Food is actually being used as currency. Beans, lentils, grain and corn are all used as delicacies in order to maintain living conditions, let alone sanity. Some even go to the extent of resorting to cannibalism. Jeunet seems to be making a commentary on what living conditions may succumb to if the world continues to degenerate and fall into absolute chaos.Carnivores vs. Herbivores: As in most cultures, the battle between meat-eaters and vegetarians if often discreet; each side attempting to sell their propaganda in order to excite the pathos in others (more so with vegetarians). In Delicatessen, however, it's a conspicuous onslaught between both sides. Jeunet helps bring this theme to life through costume design: One meat-eater, like the butcher, is dressed in a stereotypical blood-smeared apron and holds an appropriate meat-cleaver as the finishing prop. His attitude resembles a psycho-path in a mental clinic, perhaps a commentary on Jeunet's feelings towards meat-eaters. Vegetarians, to the contrary, are depicted as underground freedom fighters dressed in aquamarine jumpsuits. That they live underground seems to suggest one of two things: 1). vegetarians have a unique position in society in that they do not necessarily follow the herd-mentality; meaning they do not conform to what is popular such as eating meat, and 2). vegetarians are often represented as quiet yet tenacious individuals whose beliefs speak louder from below rather than from on top. In other words, they do not need the lime-light to expose their message; rather, their message is exposed inconspicuously through their dedicated actions.Awkwardness of Love: This is Jeunet's most stereotypical theme. Like most beginning stages of romance, anxiety and stupidity reign supreme. When the new handyman meets, and later falls in love with, the butcher's daughter, Julie, sparks seem to resonate within both as they nervously attempt to show their respected affection for one another. It's an interesting commentary Jeunet makes, that despite the obvious chaos that surrounds these two character's worlds, love can still be found and fostered into something harmonious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after a lot of recommendations, i finally saw this film. I must say i'm impressed. This movie has a seriously high entertainment value.From the very beginning the film bursts into action; a butcher shows his sick "delicatessen". The hero enter the screen and completely fills it both by screen and by acting. Just like Amelie, everyday activities are shown in an unusual way. All these little details are shown throughout the film, making it never boring or slow to watch. the plot is quiet simple, but due to the details and little subplots, it becomes an exciting story.The story takes places all inside one building. This old should-be-abandoned building contains the lives of a own community. We as viewer get the feeling that there is no outside world. As the hero enters we all know what's gonna happen: he will be the next meal. The daughter of the butcher falls in love with him, and tries to save him from what's gonna happen. other families deal with their own absurd(!) situations, but all are connected to the butcher, witch is shown as the whole building reacts to the butchers actions.The film is shot in sepia, and contains a lot of close-ups. Close-ups of faces, things, everything. This really drawed me into the story. but i must say, i needed a moment to get used to that. It's all very hectic and wild.the acting is fun, direction intense, use of music is good, plot good. What more do you need?? This is a must for everyone who likes Amelie and/or terry Gilliam. Bizar, absurd and exciting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never been a fan of foreign humour as it is generally very specific to each culture I find, but this film works well.. Revolves around a time possibly just after WW1 or WW2 in a block of apartments where the butcher is the landlord who in collaboration with the other tenants hires a hand who ultimately is to be food for the hungry tenants. This being a time of rationing, the tenants are hungry and the surroundings are grim.The hired hand though is more than at first seems, being an ex-circus performer and strikes up a strong friendship with the Butchers's daughter. The other tenants are a motley crew of folk, and the end result if simply fireworks.This is a very terry Gilliam-esquire type of movie, but don't let that put you off if you never liked his type of movie. This is actually a very funny film, and does not side too far with the gruesome nature that the title seems to make it out to be....If you can take a step on the dark side of the world of cinema and be able to honestly laugh at it all, then this is for you....Very enjoyable....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't know black comedy until you've seen this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Jeunet has become famous recently for "Amelie" and "A Very Long Engagement". Before he became a cinematic household name in America, he and Marc Caro directed two of the most unusual movies that I've ever seen: "Delicatessen" and "The City of Lost Children" (he also directed "Alien: Resurrection", but that's another story). The former is not all that easy to classify. It has ex-circus clown Louison (Dominique Pinon) moving into an apartment where the butcher is cannibalizing people. While I did like it, I don't want to try to explain it any further, lest I give people the wrong impression of it. Granted, many people will probably want to avoid this movie; there are some pretty unpleasant scenes in it. But anyone who likes to look for artistic, surrealistic, or otherwise avant garde cinema should really admire "Delicatessen". Dominique Pinon, whom Jeunet always casts, is in top-notch form here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good. But it gets better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My dad hated this movie. All I can say is: if you like the style, you'll like the movie. If not, you'll hate it.Now let's describe the style. The Jeunet/Caro team has been compared to Terry Gilliam (BRAZIL, 12 MONKEYS, etc). That's pretty fair, but Jeunet/Caro add a fresh innocence that's not present in Gilliam's apocalyptic visions. True, DELICATESSEN is dark, morbid, and sarcastic at times, but there are also moments of pure beauty that shine through. A scene comes to mind where Dominique Pinon is blowing soap bubbles for a pair of mesmerized children. Beautiful.And so goes a recurring theme of Jeunet/Caro's work - that in the midst of horror, beauty can exist. My only gripe with the film is that it got a little silly in the last half. The zany antics of the "terrorists" distracted from the profound meaning of the piece.But here's where it gets better. I believe Jeunet/Caro perfected their art over the next few years and ultimately created the masterpiece CITY OF LOST CHILDREN. Fantasy doesn't get any better than that one, folks. I believe DELICATESSEN is a good primer for CITY, because DELI has a more linear plot that won't confuse you. Then you'll be prepped for the real heady stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to watching this film since they put a more popular Jeunet's masterpiece on TV, Amélie, and my uncle said it reminded him a lot of a film he had seen a few years ago, called Delicatessen.One thing that attracted my attention was the fact that, in spite of being set in a hypothetical future, the building outside and inside looks like they were in the 50s, with the old TVs and furniture and wallpaper. And also the tenants dressed as if they were more or less from that age.The film is obscure and crude, nevertheless the main characters (the ex-clown and the butcher's daughter) provide the human warmth that balances the film. Without them I can say it'd seem that the world that Jeunet has created for this film is just inhabited by mere animals.Finally I'd like to point out a movie that came to my mind as I was watching this one, Alex de la Iglesia's 'La Comunidad', it's Spanish and it was made a few years after Delicatessen so I may think the director picked some ideas from this Jeunet's movie. I recommend everyone sees this film, is just as surrealistic and harsh and I'll just say that the main difference between both is that the tenants at 'La Comunidad' are greedy instead of cannibals.</fullReview>

I had very high hopes for Delicatessen, and it payed off grandly. Delicatessen is an enriching experience with its gorgeous scenery, fabulous costumes, and bleak atmosphere. It very much reminds me of a darker Brazil, and the effect was throughout the entire movie. The cinematography was top-notch, the acting was superb, brilliant story-line, and there are many scenes I would recommend for film teachers to show to their students. All in all, this movie is not for everyone, since it is very dark and I can only see people who truly love french films or darker films to enjoy this.

		<fullReview>This film is one of a kind. Set in a post-apocalyptic (after WW2?) town, with a tyrannical butcher slaying his helpers to feed his tenants, who are all aware of the cannibalistic goings-on. I loved the intro, with the butcher's assistant trying to escape with the garbage, by wrapping himself in newspaper and hiding in the dustbin, only to fall fate to one of the ready-sharpened cleavers among the butcher's arsenal, leading to the enjoyable opening credits. A new helper, a former clown, arrives on the scene, looking for work, and the story begins. An array of interesting characters emerge, all with darkly humorous stories, all very hungry due to the lack of fresh meat. A lot of people will find this to be an unusual film, but if you like stories that are out of the ordinary, then this is for you. Though I wouldn't say it belonged to the genre of absurdism, sometimes it isn't far off.Overall, not quite as good as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's fantastic Amelie, but a good movie all the same - check it out!</fullReview>

The lead roles are perfectly cast, and you grow to adore the antagonists of this French tale. There are also enough supporting roles to really make this film feel frenetic, which is spot-on for what a movie like this needs.If anything, I was a bit disappointed that more horror/suspense elements weren't incorporated into the mix, but that's more a fault of misinformed hype than of the film itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant comedy/horror from the same man who directed 'City of the Lost Children' and 'Amelie'. This film keeps up with the high standards. Unique and enthralling a true spectacle. A 'Brazil' model of a post-apocalyptic world based around the idea of eating fellow humans when times get hard. Seems absurd? Well the film is even more so. A rather sinister butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), with a cannabilistic tendency hires, a clown (Pascal Benezech) to clean his apartment above a delicatessen. What the clown does not realize is that he is on the menu! Once the butcher's daughter falls in love with the clown all is revealed. Only due to an underground society named the 'troglodites' does the clown manage a heroic escape with an inspired scene in the bathroom.With fantastic foot-tapping musical scenes and spectacular visuals, in the Gilliam mold, delicatessen can be named a World cinema classic. Taking a very original idea and transforming it into a entertaining and entracing film.</fullReview>

Inventive in design, insane in plotting it's a latter day French minor classic Co-directors and co-screenwriters Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro made a brilliant feature film debut with this bizarre and visually stunning comedy about cannibalism. Granted, the directors 'cannibalized' Terry Gilliam, as well as the Coen brothers and David Lynch, to name but a few, but the design, action and camera movements reveal a personal style.The content - a clown (Pinon) falling in love with the innocent short-sighted daughter (Dougnac) of a butcher (Dreyfus) whose greatest delicacy is human flesh - is subjugated to the style, the insistency of which becomes rather wearisome at times. However, there are many tour de force sequences, such as the scene in which the rhythms of the butcher's lovemaking is gradually picked up by all the other occupants of the eerie tenement block. Before their leap to the big screen, Jeunet and Caro had been working together for 16 years on music videos and TV commercials, the influence of which shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes _Delicatessen_ so great? I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the film loves all of its characters, no matter how depraved they may act. Then it leads us, as the audience, to care about the characters, even though we want them brought to justice. The film never gets very explicit about its cannibalism overtones, or what has caused the shortage of livestock that has driven some people to eat any meat they can possibly get. No, they're not flesh-eating zombies, they're regular people with jobs and families, and when Louison tells Julie what happened to Livingston, his chimpanzee performing partner, we see this seedy apartment is merely a microcosm for the rest of the world. Not everyone is so insistent on eating meat, and that's what differentiates the main characters and the Troglos, underground dwelling vegetarians, or "seed-eating faggots" as Clapet calls them, probably inaccurately. Even so, even Clapet manages to gain our sympathy so that we laugh as much as we cry when he gets his comeuppance.Never have I seen a romantic comedy this thought-provoking, a science fiction film so caring, a horror film so pleasant. The comic bumbling suicide victim is sadly tragic, sweet and loveable, and oh dear what happened to Grandma and the guy who'll disguise himself as garbage to escape. The monsters are humans, the humans victims, the victims monsters. This is surely one of the greatest films ever made, defying genre categorization, doing so much in such a visionary way without ever sinking into luridness (unless one counts the stage business with Marcel clening his prophilactic, but even that is important since no one, anywhere, can afford another mouth to feed, because it's likely to have Swiftian consequenses). Highly recommended, even if you think it's not your taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French actor Dominique Pinon (The Return of Martin Guerre) as Louison was absolutely outstanding in the farce about survivors of a nuclear war. he plays a clown who stumbles into a situation where an apartment full of people are looking for their next meal. The plan is for him to be the main course! The butcher's daughter, Marie-Laure Dougnac, was equally good, as the one who falls in love with Louison, and tries to save him from her father (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) the butcher and the rest in the apartment.There is too much going on in this film to comment on all of it - the "tea" ceremony, the mattress test, the failed suicide attempts - suffice it to say that the entire 99 minutes is packed with laughs and macabre comedy.The script and direction (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who also directed Amelie and Alien: Resurrection) were superlative. The cinematography was brilliant, and the sound, costumes, and music were also first rate.If you like the British Carry On..., you will love this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is indeed sad to learn that French cinema has not been able to amalgamate science fiction genre with melodramatic parables. Delicatessen resembles many a science fiction film but what distinguishes it from other films is its detached narrative approach. Delicatessen is a minor masterpiece full of tense atmosphere.Jeunet and Caro conceived Delicatessen as they believed that sometimes human imagination takes unparalleled powers.It can be classified as an enigmatic journey to hell with a happy ending.The plot has a fairly small bearing on character development as Jeunet and Caro incorporate numerous oddball characters.Delicatessen is a visual feast for hungry eyes.As a mocking assault on all social values,Delicatessen remains a true visual adventure of unusual precision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightfully weird French film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a post-apocalyptic France, where food is scarce, former clown Louison takes a job as the handyman in an apartment block? not realising that after a week's work the butcher, who owns the building, intends to kill him to feed the building's residents. Before that can happen the butcher's short-sighted daughter, Julie, starts to fall in love with Louison. In an attempt to save him she contacts 'The Troglodytes'; a group of sewer-dwelling vegetarian 'terrorists'.The plot makes this sound like a horror movie but in reality it is a surreal comedy. The building is populated with a variety of bizarre characters including a woman whose convoluted suicide attempts invariably fail and a man whose flooded flat is full of snails and frogs! Things start well with the sight of the previous handyman's attempt to escape his fate disguised as rubbish and continues with a succession of inventive, strange and hilarious scenes. The cast does a fine job making their characters believable despite how strange they all are? only Louison and Julie are vaguely normal. If the goings on weren't strange enough everything has a yellow tinge that makes everything seem somewhat rotten. Overall I'd say that while this film won't be for everybody those who enjoy the bizarre and surreal should love it.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>France, post-apocalypse. Food is scarce and the residents of a block of flats must exist on what they can. Operating out of the ground floor of the building, and living in one of the flats, is a butcher. He has a method for procuring meat - by hiring a handyman for the building and then killing him. Food stocks are once again running low so he hires a handyman, Louison. However, the butcher's daughter, Julie, falls for Louison and will go to any length to prevent him from getting the chop, including getting him kidnapped by some not-entirely competent terrorists/rebels. High jinks ensue.Wickedly dark, off-beat, anarchic and clever. Very original plot with some very funny moments and a subversive current running through it. Some good drama too. Solid direction: dark lighting and a minimalist set help the post- apocalyptic, impoverished feel. Good performances all round, especially from Dominique Pinon as Louison and Marie-Laure Dougnac as Julie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is rare that I find a movie just too weird, but it seemed that my streak has been bested by "Delicatessen". It was just weird on a level where it stopped being fun and entertaining. And this 1991 movie was just really far out there.What peeked my interest about this movie was the synopsis on the back of the DVD cover. Yeah, it did come off as interesting. And I don't mind a movie being in a non-English language. But watching this movie, it quickly became clear that this was not in my range of preference.Set in an apocalyptic time, "Delicatessen" is filmed and constantly lit by a dark orange-like hue, which was a bit odd, but worked out well enough, I suppose.Now, what "Delicatessen" had working in its favor was the performances put on by the cast, and they made it bearable to sit through the train wreck of a storyline."Delicatessen" is somewhat of an acquired taste, which wasn't for me. This was a wide swing and a miss by directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delicious (so to speak) melding of genres.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a post-apocalyptic France of the future, meat has become exceedingly rare. So much so that it now can be used as currency. The residents of an apartment block above a deli have come to depend heavily on the strange man, Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) employed as their butcher. Then one day an entertainer named Louison (Dominique Pinon) comes to the place to accept a job as a handyman. Louison finds himself quite taken with Clapets' sexy daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac), but his new life may not be what it's cracked up to be. He may have some other purpose in the building other than odd jobs.At its best, this completely off the wall and extremely stylized French take on post-nuke and cannibal cinema is one of the most original films of its kind. The co-directors, Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, give "Delicatessen" a striking visual design, largely avoiding cool colours like blue (although there are occasional flashes of green); the colour palette consists of a lot of yellows, oranges, reds, and browns. It's a clever hook, but also making this a worthy entertainment are the incredible energy and the consistent tone of dark, and farcical, humour. There's nothing else this viewer has seen that is quite like "Delicatessen", and that can only be a good thing.The performances themselves are very stylized, with the well chosen actors going for broke a lot of the time. Pinon and Dougnac are appealing in the leading roles. Also leaving a big impression are Dreyfus, Karin Viard, Ticky Holgado, Anne-Marie Pisani, Howard Vernon, and especially Silvie Laguna as the troubled Aurore, driven to stage very elaborate suicide attempts by "voices". Caro can be seen on screen as Fox, one of the cave dwellers.Caro and Jeunet are able to reach some appreciable heights of lunacy here, matched by the wonderfully memorable imagery throughout.This one gets a solid recommendation.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

But with her father planning on putting Louison on the menu, she seeks the assistance of an underground cell of rebellious vegetarians. Conceptualized by the director of Amélie, Delicatessen is a quirky cannibal love-story crammed with eccentric characters that never takes itself too seriously, or too lighthearted.Furthermore, with all the hormones and preservatives we ingest, human meat would have a very long shelf life.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On one hand, this film has a lot of originality, especially the way it narrates the story and the interconnection of events; however, it also contains a lot of clichés that you see coming minutes before it actually comes. Nevertheless; if you have spare time, there is no reason to miss this.I rate a film 8/10 when it's a good film of a particular generation but does not establish itself as a timeless classic. This means people will think of it when they try to come up with names of films in this genre or theme, and it's enjoyable to re-watch from time to time regardless of personal preference. Think of Love Actually, Harry Potter and the like. To reach 9/10, it must push the standard to the next level either by displaying a sheer perfection or reinventing the genre. Lord of The Rings is a good example for 9/10 as it is a sensibly 'perfect' film that pushes the limit of production, special effect etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A success in portraying its dark comedy with limited resources, Delicatessen is a fresh intake in the post-apocalypse genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pushing aside a presumption of a bland cannibal movie, Delicatessen provided an interesting view with its dark cinematography with slight yet effective humor and unpredictable twists. The ingenious and entertaining integration of different noises to create music as well as the creation of rhythmic movements with sounds coming from the television are only two of the many creative ideas touched upon throughout the movie. The usual clichés of post apocalyptic dystopia has been effectively confined into a minimum while using the clichés to an advantage in producing cringing revelations throughout the movie. The movie's best feature would be its various side stories which look into the lives of the various different tenants of the butcher's building. The employment of humor in tragedy has been another highlight of the movie. However, the story suffers from a lack of elaboration in some parts of it. The movie itself was a little slow at times. Despite the slight drawbacks, the movie is definitely worth a watch due to its original concepts attractive to any movie enthusiast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some fine French cuisine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delicatessen is a strange little treat from the French director Jean- Pierre Jeunet, the director of other great modern French films like Amélie. But instead of the melancholy of Amelie, Delicatessen instead focuses on very dark humour, being based around a cannibalistic butcher who lures in victims to his apartment block so he can kill them and sell them as meat to his cannibalistic tenants. He does this in a post apocalyptic world where food appears to be scarce and people have become more willing to show their barbaric nature in order to survive.And this is where the films focus lies. For it is less interested in the post apocalyptic world, but instead focuses on the characters and the various tenants who live in the building and their dark humour . A majority of the characters will have their own distinct personalities that make them quite memorable. There's one tenant who keeps quiet throughout the film, keeping an inventory of frogs and snails to represent the side of fine French cuisine in contrast to the more barbaric man eating side of the film. Then there's the girl who constantly keeps trying to commit suicide and failing in the most darkly comedic ways. It's with characters like these where the film does gain its personality and it's many awkward chuckles that are somewhere between comedy and tragedy.The film also succeeds at creating both likable protagonists and despicable antagonists. Louison (the lead protagonist) is an extremely charismatic young boy who is both very kind to all the tenants in the building and very skilled being a clown and displaying a nice introductory scene using bubbles to entertain th kids of the apartments. Then there's the lead girl, Julie, who is very brave working to stop Louison from being butchered. Similarly, Louison often protects her making their relationship extremely dependant on one another.Then the antagonist Clapet is also very memorable. The film makes it clear that he is a despicable man within the first five minutes on screen as he commits brutal murder, but feels no remorse about doing it, instead appearing to even enjoy it. At times he's slightly overplayed, but this assists in making sure he stands out as the most insane, amongst an already insane cast of characters.The style the film is shot is also very interesting as for the most part the entire story is confined to the apartment building. Through this it helps to create both a claustrophobic feeling and makes the characters feel even more detached from the rest of the world keeping the story very self contained. Also the cinematography uses a fairly dark tone, assisting the film to get a distinct look and help it stand apart from other apocalyptic futures.However, whilst everything that was in the film remained effective, throughout the film I couldn't help but feel there was lost potential. For example, whilst what I saw of the apocalyptic world was interesting, I didn't feel like we saw enough of it. Presumably what they were going for was to create some mystery as to the world, with there being a great deal of uncertainty as to when the film was even set with the likes of black and white TV's being used. But I feel the film would have been stronger if they had expanded on certain elements of the world like creating some bizarre shows on television or hints at why there is such a food shortage.It also feels like the film would have benefited from a longer run time. It took a lot of nice scenes to slow down and build up the relationship between the two leads showing them playing instruments together to create a more natural relationship. But this carries with it the problem that the plot ends up feeling more rushed with less time to make the different characters arcs complete. For example, tenants such as the Landlords mistress feel like good characters but don't get enough time for us to learn enough about them.Though the major missed opportunity that I see in the film is we don't really see any of the characters eating any of the human meat, despite the entire film centred around cannibalism. We see it being given to them and there reactions to getting it, but it does feel like a missed opportunity by not showing them actually eat it. It's an opportunity to get a good thrill, but it never seems like the director used it despite the several opportunities he could have.But in spite of this it remains a good film with a distinct style. It's certainty worth the watch because it is something different. With its nice shooting style and interesting characters it delivers some entertaining humour and dark visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Evoke the same sensation if it was purely visual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm not a fan of the mixed genres that take priority of the screenplay in Delicatessen, the film does get a lot correct with style, mise-en-scene, framing, and direction. The coloring used for Delicatessen is scrumptious and makes for a viewing experience that could almost be purely visual. The directors, Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, control the film with a firm tone that carries the movie through its running time.The mise-en-scene the director captures with particular shots make Delicatessen memorable, starting with the opening shots consisting of circular objects of all sizes and shapes. The sound effects behind those opening shots are the sounds of knives, which identify food as the center of the film. The shot of the man in the garbage can, peering through the newspapers which he's wrapped in and the two mental cans he is inside is inventively cute and identifies the picture as a whole. The color pattern repeated the most frequently is the colors of red and green. The set, costumes, and lighting are saturated in these two blistering colors.Maybe the most memorable scene is when we cut between five different scenarios (a mattress being used, a violin being played, paint being swiped on a wall, a musical instrument being plucked, and knitting needles) using a specific amount of energy all of which collapse at the same time. The editing cuts like a knife between the different story lines and results in a well- crafted sequence. Rating: 7Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Delicatessen" is one of those very few movies that are able to accomplish it all. There's a bit of comedy, horror, thriller, mystery and adventure, all spiced up with surrealism and outstanding cinematography.It's amazing how well the movie builds its (very believable) post- apocalyptic universe, where people are doing everything to survive. Literally everything. Well, except one character! (Watch it to understand!)The actors do they job splendidly, every character is built up flawlessly having their own personalities and features, making all of them extremely interesting, even if some of them are not involved with the main plot. Each of the tenants of "Delicatessen" have their own very weird quirks that make them stand out on their own, without wasting even one scene with pointless content. The movie is entertaining through every shot.The music is amazing as well, portraying the accordion french music outstandingly which also gives the movie a whole lot of personality and character. It just fits perfectly.Photography is top notch, with the tones of brown / yellow and green giving a very weird, often dark, oppressive or just downright surreal feeling.Overall, this is one hell of a movie. Excellent from the beginning to the end. Some of the scenes here are just so memorable you will be wanting to watch them over and over... You'll fall in love with each characters' quirks, and you will laugh, cringe and think throughout the whole experience."Delicatessen" should be watched by everyone.Flawless 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

This dizzy French import borrows its mock portentous mood and visual momentum from the early films of Joel and Ethan Coen (by way of Terry Gilliam). But unlike a typical Coen brothers movie this isn't a genre rip-off, presenting instead an original and at times very black comic fantasy, with an odd pro-vegetarian subtext (the renegade vegan commandos inhabit the sewers beneath the city). The co-directors, both with obvious music video experience, are infatuated with their own clever camera work and production design (note the omnipotent fish-eye lens, able to roam though pipes and appliances and so forth), creating some elaborate sets which they later take great pleasure in destroying during the protracted climax. But once adjusted to the peculiar characters and hyperactive cartoon rhythm the film can be a lot of fun. Best running gag: one elderly tenant's constantly frustrated Rube Goldberg suicide attempts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and funny -despite the people eating bits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a post apocalyptic, bittersweet love story with a cannibalistic subplot then you've come to the right film.After some kind of catastrophe meat has become impossible to find but a local butcher keeps supplying his loyal customers (who are also his tenants) with their daily iron requirement by all means necessary. I'm not giving away the plot by revealing "they're killing and eating humans". We find this out very early on in the film. Not long after we realise that the customers are in on the secret as well. This shocking fact is secondary to the main plot of the film, which itself is probably secondary to the style in which it is made.The butcher employs resident handymen for the building but the main reason for employing them is to get a fresh supply of meat. A former circus performer (Louison) is the latest for the chopping block but he's a quirky character and beguiles the butcher's daughter and she decides to save him. We get amusing glimpses into the lives of the other residents, each one more bizarre than the one before.This film is directed by Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet. I've seen Amelie (directed by Jeunet) and the styles are similar. Both films create their own worlds in which we become fascinated by the lives of the quirky characters that inhabit them. However, while Amelie, while in a world of her own, at least lived a recognisable Paris Delicatessen is set in a fantasy world of what looks like the only building still standing in a large city. However there is still television and electricity (and postmen) because the plot requires them.Like Amelie the charm of the film is the little details in the film that may or may not be crucial to the plot, such as the short sighted daughter buying two of everything in case of breakages and Louison's saw playing talents.The overall tone is definitely positive and funny (really, even with the cannibalism). Basically the motto is love will conquer all. Thank God, Caro and Jeunet for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes when you read a certain movie plot synopsis, it's nearly impossible to comprehend how it can qualify as a "comedy", even though the comments and reviews all state that it is. I particularly had difficulties acknowledging "Delicatessen" as a comedy ? albeit a pitch black one ? as it is dealing with such devastating and depressing themes like post-nuclear survival, cannibalism, suicide and conspiracy to murder. It must be a real challenge for writers and directors to weave such unpleasant topics into blackly comical script, but Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, in their long feature debut, pull it off seemingly without much effort. In a post-nuclear apocalyptic world, where natural food sources have become real scarce, former traveling one-man circus artist Louison applies for a job as a handyman in an apartment building owned by the sneering butcher Clapet. What Louison obviously doesn't know is that Clapet is a psychopathic cannibal who cuts up all his handymen after a while and feeds them to the rest of deranged tenants. Louison's only hope for rescue is his blossoming romance with Clapet's shy and nerdy daughter Julie or perhaps the "Troglodytes"; an underground vegetarian movement. "Delicatessen" is a pretty brilliant piece of surrealist and progressive film-making, but only if you allow the film's bizarre comic book ambiance and morbid fairy-tale like designs to absorb you entirely. First and foremost, I love how this is another post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi film that appears to take place in a 1930's setting! I can't properly explain why, but to me this is the ultimate in disturbing. We're supposedly in the future but people wear hideous ancient clothes and decorate their apartments with furniture that even your great-grandmother would find old-fashioned. This old and grim depiction of a futuristic society is something we don't see enough but always has a tremendous impact, like in "Letters from a dead Man" or Terry Gilliam's "Brazil". Besides, Caro and Jeunet obviously found a lot of inspiration in Gilliam's oeuvre. Furthermore owes the film a lot of its powerfully comical impact to the magnificent script that pays attention to every smallest detail. Each and every single tenant in Clapet's apartment building is a deliriously decadent individual, like the woman who hears voices in her head and continuously undertakes fruitless suicide attempts, or the elderly and extremely peculiar gramps (glorious role for the aging horror/exploitation veteran Howard Vernon) who deliberately floods his apartment to keep his collection of frogs alive. "Delicatessen" is at times gruesome and grim and at other times hilarious and light-headed, but it constantly remains ingenious and uniquely original from start to finish. Great acting performances from the ensemble cast, visually striking effects and nightmarish set-pieces. Heck, even the romance story is genuinely heart-warming and enchanting. I think I like this film even more than that other 90's fantasy/fairy-tale masterpiece from Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet; the dazzling "City of Lost Children".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicatessen (del-i-kuh-tes-uhn):- A shop serving foods, often unusual or imported , ready for serving. True to its name the film is unusual, imported from France and ready to delight the senses straightaway. The quirkiness of the film is hinted in the visually brilliant and innovative opening credits itself. The story as such tells of lives of an eclectic bunch of people living together in a dilapidated building owned by a butcher. The times are hard, currency has been supplanted with barter system and people have resorted to cannibalism for subsistence. The imposing landlord, an out of work clown , the geeky daughter of landlord smitten by him, a schizophrenic aunt , a retired army man living off the snails and frogs he has bred in his own room are some of the many odd characters which churn up some bizarre but hilarious moments throughout the film . The best one being the tenants synchronizing the activities they are busy in, with the squeaking of the bed the butcher and his mistress are fornicating on. With some brilliant camera work and a highly imaginative script Delicatessen is in many ways symptomatic of the succeeding films of Jean Pierre Jeunet who In authors humble opinion is among the most creative artists of his generation. Watch it and your time wont be ill spent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most unique movie I think I've ever seen. And ever want to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when people say a film is unique, I cringe. 'Oh God, artsy-fartsy crap by some director who relishes in the project to the point of self-destruction' is usually what I think of first."Delicatessen" is, without question, the most original movie I have seen. It is not comparable to anything else. I can't even think of one movie to put it up against.On a surreal and subliminal level, it is frightening and mind-bending; it is like a nightmare that someone had after a Peyote trip. There is no need for drugs here though; watching the film is a trip in itself.I like the presence of Howard Vernon, one of the French exploitation stalwarts who appeared in several Jess Franco films and a few Jean Rollin ones. He is creepy as hell as 'the guy in the basement who lives with the frogs and eats snails.' The acting is out of this world, the dialog is hilarious, the plot is dizzying but interesting and the images will never leave you. "Delicatessen" leaves an awesome taste in your mouth with it's creativity and it's splendid storyline.I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed "Pan's Labyrinth," "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" or "Cannibal Holocaust." 10 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very interesting black comedy with a trademark copper-colored lighting by the co-directors, as if everything is clothed by a layer of copper and is eternally devoured by the ubiquitous mythical smoke (exactly the unique lighting employed in "the City of Lost Children"). The cast with the excellent costumes on join hands as a team of very charismatic and comical comedians even by their appearances alone. The theme of human selfishness and indifference to other people's sufferings was embodied thoroughly in the various characters and each of the sub-plots which never fails to amuse the audience in its own way but is not felt to be over the top. A truly delightful comedy experience which should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicatessen Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decade before critics were losing their voices in praise of Amelie, French director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, directed the dark and morbid comedy, Delicatessen. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic period of France during the 1950's in a small apartment building. This is a character-driven piece that focuses around several tenants whom get by in their own balance of using one another along to survive. The landlord, played by the brilliant Jean-Claude Dreyfus, is perfect in his maniacal role of a crooked apartment manager whom butchers his tenants and guests as a source of meat to be sold for a great profit. Within this farcical tale of horror is a cliché romance between two tenants, Louison (Dominique Pinon), and Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac). This part of the story serves little significance other than a slow distraction from the narrative but is constantly finding its way on screen.As for the visual side of the film, Darius Khondji does a beautiful job in his first cinematographer role on a feature film. The melancholic undertones of the story are truly highlighted through the long and slow pacing of every shot. We see a distant framing in a majority of the film leaving us very unattached from the cast yet still enjoying the story to a great degree, (a surprisingly daring decision for such a character-driven film). The entire movie is soaked in a very sepia-like tone to convey the post-apocalyptic imagery which works really well throughout the course of Delicatessen. It is no wonder that Khondji would later be hired to work alongside David Fincher, Michael Haneke, and Wong Kar-Wai. This exceptional camera-work is the ideal compliment to such an invoking movie. All in all, this is a really great film full of great performances, beautiful cinematography, and an interesting story; simply see this movie.</fullReview>

Unlike many other post-apocalyptic movies which focus on the brutal physical survival in the hostile new world, this one preserves and relishes in the unfaltering fundamental kindness of human nature.

And this isn't a surprise, as it will come evident right from the start of the film.Delicatessen is a dark comedy laced with mild amount of horror and with this mixed with deliciously deranged cast of characters serves a intriguing piece of storytelling about... well, about how odd life is in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Creativity In the Realm of Movie Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delicatessen is pure creativity. I suppose you could say it is essentially a sci-fi film. That it is. But it meshes everything. Frankly, I know a way to sum up the film in a way that demonstrates its appeal: How many movies have you seen or will you ever see that take place in rural post-apocalyptic 1950s France? OK, a few. Wow. You really know your movies. Well just how many of them have involved cannibalism? I didn't think so, Leonard Maltin.Consider a plot in which food is a stunted resource, in which grain is used as legal tender. The landlord of a dilapidated apartment building runs a butcher shop within, posting job opportunities attract people whom he butchers as an economical source of meat that he sells to his tenants.The protagonist is an out-of-work circus clown played by the very strange Dominique Pinon who arrives for an available job. Taking up residence, he gradually falls in love with the bookish daughter of the landlord. Alert to her father's intentions and Pinon's pending murder, we of course anticipate the story's progression. Delicatessen rewards us at a much fresher degree than most movies, even ones better than this, as she goes down into the sewers to get in touch with a notorious vegetarian subgroup of rebels whom she convinces to help rescue our hero.One reason I enjoyed the film is because, being a movie called Delicatessen with a picture of a pig on what is portrayed as a hanging butcher shop sign as the film's poster and DVD case image, it is in fact endearing for animal lovers like me. By the era depicted by the story, by the time the movie opens, animals have been hunted to extinction, and humans must suffer the consequences of such excesses at the expense of fellow creatures. Pinon's character mourns for his dead circus partner, his best friend, his monkey. The movie has a lightness of touch and does not intend to brandish a message at the viewer regarding a dystopian future, and we may accept the film however we wish.This tongue-in-cheek Gothic fantasy is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the same collaborator with whom he made The City of Lost Children, a similar film with incredible imagination and flair. There is an elemental charm to films like this, which entertain as sci-fi and action films are expected to, yet they surprise us so much more, because there is hardly a moment in which we can consider ourselves capable of predicting the next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Definitive European Cinema Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you fancy grabbing a film to watch over drinks with your girlfriend or with a group of mates, then I'd steer clear of Jeunet and Caro's Delicatessen. But if you are looking for a comedic, highly artistic, original and entertaining piece of cinema, then this may just the film for you. Set in the future, where meat supplies are sparse, a Butcher puts an advert in the paper for a handyman, whom he will eventually kill and sell him as meat. Louison (the rubber faced Dominique Pinon) applies for the job and falls in love with the Butcher's daughter, who, aware of her father's motives, convinces underground gang, the Troglodytes, to save him. Jeunet and Caro's unique artistic direction makes this film stand out amongst the crowd of European films, for its purely unique story line and apocalyptic setting, which seems to represent a 1940's war time France rather than a futuristic chaos, make this a totally individual experience. The monochrome shots (all of which are flawless and highly thought out) add to the mise-en-scene, and give it the Jeunet and Caro trademark appearance. Caro, who is only the artistic director, has a huge influence over the film, being equally billed alongside Jeunet, the director. His influence is clear, as each quirky screen shot is visually stunning, and when it is considered the low budget of the film, it makes this feat far more impressive. Besides the artistic brilliance of the film, each actor gives performances that add to the film, and, if they are not realistic, give a sense of alliance between the character and the audience (in Domique Pinon's case especially). Too add to the great cast, the black comedy (the cutting between the increasing pace of the Butcher's sex and the menial tasks leading to the climax, just one of the surreal and hilarious moments) put the icing on the cake of a brilliant film. But, and only a small but, I don't feel it is a film I could watch over and over again, as it may begin to lose that unique appeal it had upon the first watch, where I was dazzled by the surreal plot and fantastic mise-en-scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tres Bien Jeunet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I began watching this film midway through, I found myself quite lost in terms of the narrative, with random kidnappers with goggles that would randomly appear confusing me slightly. However I found that this enabled me to appreciate other aspects of film I do not usually take particular enjoyment in, these are mainly artistic elements of a film. In particular the use of monochrome design in some shots, really made me acknowledge and enjoy this element of film. This design may have had some influence from Caro too, the artistic director, whose impact on Delicatessen must be substantial, for he is credited as much as Jeunet, the director.After re-watching the film from the start, I felt as if i could now enjoy the dark comedic tone that much more and start to enjoy the balance between some impressive expressionistic devices, most notably for me, the previously mentioned monochrome design and the humour that Jeunet incorporates into the plot, the catastrophic failed suicide attempt 'pres de fin' (near the end) typifies the humour in Delicatessen.Due to my circumstances, I was lucky enough to be able to enjoy the film as an art form and also the strong narrative which had some at times, very funny moments, which is certainly a first in all the (admittedly few)European films I have seen, which was a pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Niche, art-house films, like delicatessen, i often find. are hard to enjoy, i find myself searching for hidden creative meanings, pretentious expressionism and obscure references and often sit puzzled as i try to distinguish the fine line between creative genius and random drivel. However Delicatessen is an exception, the array of different shots, angles and narrative techniques allow the viewer to appreciate and enjoy this film on so many levels, one can watch the film for any area of study or interest, be it mise-en-scene lighting or narrative. Jeunet and Caro have mastered every single aspect of cinema in this one film, and because of this, the film is on the one hand a challenging thought provoking film that requires deep concentration, but on the other simply an entertaining flick, i think that Jeunet and Caro have managed to find the perfect equilibrium between entertainment and art. The film seems to give you light hearted entertainment, and then offer you the more expressionistic and art-house elements if you want to notice them. This makes the film unique and slightly refreshing as it is a nice break from other artistic films that seem to sometimes be packed full of expression that it drowns the narrative and makes it impossible for the film to be viewed as entertainment. all in all, Delicatessen encapsulates the creative genius of Jeunet and Caro showing the viewer their true powers of imagination, creativity and ability of expression, whilst still allowing the viewer to enjoy the film and also enjoy it at surface value. A truly great film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"No-one is entirely evil. It's the circumstances. Or we don't know what we're doing."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a rotting wasteland where food and barter replace money, Dominque Pinon's unemployed clown (a gentle-natured cross between Popeye and Klaus Kinski) takes a job as handyman-cum-dinner in a rundown apartment owned by a butcher who hacks up the hired help to feed his other, not too morally particular residents. Complications ensue when he falls in love with the butcher's daughter and she enlists the aid of an underground group of vegetarian terrorists to help her save him. The butcher himself is beginning to feel remorse ("No-one is entirely evil. It's the circumstances, or we don't know what we're doing") but that doesn't stop him trying to make mincemeat out of his prospective son-in-law. There's more, but you probably won't believe me.What starts out as just your average cannibalism comedy gradually wins you over, drawing you into the damaged lives of the block's credibly eccentric inhabitants, and even comes up with an entirely new way to get out of a trapped bathroom, but not one I'd recommend trying at home (unless you're being pursued by a cannibalistic butcher, of course). Nice little touches abound, such as the butcher's clumsy short-sighted daughter buying two of everything in case she breaks them or the granny who has tin cans tied to her so that her family can find her if she gets lost (no prizes for guessing what happens to her). You may not think you'll like it, but you probably will in spite of yourself...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ingenious Little Fantasy Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have tremendous respect for the visionaries of cinema, such as Burton, Gilliam, Proyas etc. I like it when sheer imagination is explored on film.Jean-Pierre Jeunet's first film Delicatessen is frequently hilarious and always inventive. He and his partner in crime Marc Caro show such creativity in the sets, props, costumes and lighting. The only problem with Jeunet's style is that he lacks a strong narrative sense and his films seem to resemble more a series of charming vignettes instead of actual stories.This is more apparent in his later, far bigger work, but here it's less frustrating because the scale is small and the flashes of brilliance are there on the screen every few minutes.Delicatessen plays like a trailer for what was to come from Jeunet, not just in terms of his style but also his regular troupe of performers who would make appearances in his later works (it seems they all take turns playing lovable and loath-able characters).But as it stands, Delicatessen is entertaining and fresh even after it's been over fifteen years since it's released. It's sure to get more charming as the years go on. long live the frogs! And their funny voices!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, that's how I saw it. Obviously, such movies are open to interpretations and I will be thankful to anyone who deciphers a few events for me - for instance, what was the interligator's lover exactly trying to do whispering through pipes? He went out to save her from the butcher, so he definitely didn't want her killed! Anyway, the comedy itself was not black. It was tasteful comedy in a black setting. Aside from the ingenious ways that Aurore tried to commit suicide in (and the ingenious ways those failed), there was the little incident of the butcher trying to scare grandma Tapioca, who didn't budge but eventually saw a spider and died a 'natural death' from fear. The allegory of a whole gang, the troglos, literally 'underground'.I notice that most people here have mentioned that food became currency in the movie setting. This may not be correct as you cannot really deal in something you have fallen short of. Also, there were no instances of food being used as currency. Instead, humans did 'end up' being currency for food. Basically, the butcher had become a black-marketeer and he used the grain reserves as an exchange to deal in meat - any meat. Shortage of food also meant that children were trying to hunt frogs from a resident who ate snails and frogs - 'each to his own', as the man explains.Artistically, the duet between Julie and Louison and his play with the bubbles were delights to watch. There was also this comic-artistic scene where all residents 'matched the beat of lovemaking' in whatever they were doing - a treat of a scene just the visualisation of which deserves stars.Overall, a weird-great movie that I enjoyed being a part of (as a viewer). There may be several messages, one being - Clapet says the world is a bad place but he did not make it that way - the lesson being that if we continue to shed responsibility simply because we didn't make the world, the world would surely deteriorate into a delicatessen like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeunet delivers, as always.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Jeunet's first film is just as strong as the rest of his brilliant resume. It combines the Gilliam-esquire dark humor that was present in The City of Lost Children with some very original takes on rhythm and predestination and, most importantly, a beautiful romance between Louison (Dominique Pinon) and Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac). The story takes place in an apartment building with a Delicatessen at the bottom run by the dastardly Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who chops up people as food for the bizarre tenants. Gilles Adrien's intricate screenplay took time and dedication in weaving a story for each tenant that we see play out through the entire film. But it's the main love story between Louison and Julie that engaged me the most. Louison is the newest tenant and is next up on Clapet's menu, but Clapet's daughter Julie has quickly fallen for Louison and tries to save him before he's chopped up and fed to the tenants. This is the setting for an outrageously bizarre story that provides lots of intense laughs and absurd reactions from me the entire time. It's by far one of the most original films I've ever seen and features some really dedicated, wonderful art direction. Truly one of the best out there. Jeunet's genius never ceases to amaze me.</fullReview>

A masterpiece with a level of intelligence that is outrageous, a visual level that goes beyond Tim Burton's dreams, and audio that laughs and frightens at the same time, and a direction that is just unique. The film tells the story of Louison, a former clown that exiliates to a butchery-permanent hotel. While it could sound like a calm, relaxing place in the middle of a fog graveyard, it's not normal at all. This is not your average meat store. Why? It's HUMAN. And Louison is the next victim...

		<shortDescription>one didn't expect to have so many cinematographic influences in one genuine story but Jeunet and Caro did it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had hammered on this site "le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain" (2001) by Jean Pierre Jeunet a few years ago, chiefly because I didn't know anything about his author. Maybe, it's high time I upgraded it and its creator again after I watched this little treasure, "Delicatessen" which put him and his co-partner Marc Caro on the map back in 1991. It is one of the most momentous movies of the year.Such a ground-breaking movie couldn't go unnoticed that year. Jeunet and Caro created a quirky universe which shelters a swarm of heterogeneous ideas bridged to give a well-rounded, homogeneous whole. Where do their influences come from? Well, first the tawdry, eerie scenery echoes the one Roman Polanski tapped so well in the spooky "Le Locataire" (1976). Then, some exterior shots make the viewer deduce that the authors had German expressionism on their minds when they penned their film.Now, what about the characters? They're colorful, nearly to put it mildly! The brats seem to come from the poetic realism of French cinema in the thirties. Each character or member of a group is so well defined that one could almost talk of subplots that beef the film up with the central story concerning Louison (Dominique Pinon) and Julie. Besides, they're acted by first-class actors who give their characters life and presence on the screen. Jeunet must have been satisfied with their performances since the viewer will see some of them in some of Jeunet's subsequent films, notably Ticky Holgado, Rufus, and especially Jean-Claude Dreyfuss, the best of the batch here and the best butcher French cinema has ever seen since Jean Yanne in Claude Chabrol's masterpiece "le Boucher" (1970). Both are monsters of a different kind but the audience feels liking for both of them.Technically, when one construes Jeunet's stylish directing, it's hard not to think of Terry Gilliam's style, notably "Brazil" (1985) and through the disquieting angles he uses, things and several human beings take an eerie dimension. Then, another tour-De-force from Jeunet is to have included humor coming from Tex Avery's cartoons and his pithy editing has some Martin Scorsese accents. In spite of some little parts where the interest can wane, the amount is a film that brims with diverse influences on all levels. They are all dovetailed to serve a whimsical story filled with eye-catching details and grisly humor.With this deliciously unsettling black comedy, it's no wonder Jeunet is among a handful of French filmmakers celebrated abroad. According to him, this ground-breaking film and its successor "La Cité Des Enfants Perdus" (1995) have been major influences on American cinema since their opening. His moniker is "the man with two thousand ideas". I can't remember who gave him this nickname but it's a well-deserved, flattering one.</fullReview>

With any movie that should be a primary barometer: if it holds up with the sound off, or in foreign (original) dialogue you cannot speak, then it is probably a cool movie! :) You can actually follow the story and stuff without knowing what they are saying. I look forward some day to seeing it with subtitles! (overdubbed movies in English tend to lose a lot of the atmosphere of original actors voices).I'd rank this up there with City Of Lost Children, and Amile - cute French movies. Nobody does Cute like the French - check out the Cirque Du Soleil movies also!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The film is fantastically grim and depressing and if one was to live there you would surely be driven quite mad!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the back of the DVD case I noticed the words `futuristic comedy'. Am I the only one who didn't find it funny? Granted it has some comical parts, but I would say it was more irony than comedy. The poor crazed woman `Aurore Interligator' repeatedly trying to commit suicide but somehow always being foiled in the silliest of ways is more of a tedious act rather than comedy.The movie is about a post-apocalyptic town with no food and desperate times have lead to desperate measures being taken. The local butcher recruits ?new' people to the town as helpers and then murders them to sell their flesh to the townspeople.The film is fantastically grim and depressing and if one was to live there you would surely be driven quite mad! It is of course `one of those quirky, weird' films where nothing is quite right in the world. Films like that always seem to freak me out when you see how people have lead their lives and what their principals are, and compared to the lives we lead are just absurd.To round off, this film is an excellent piece of work. It's in French with English subtitles but many of the truly great films are from another country, with another perspective. It stays well away from gory killings and just leaves the mind to wonder what has gone on and the overall atmosphere generated from the movie is eerie to say the least.A brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another good movie from Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director of Amelie). Delicatessen is a futuristic fantasy movie, in a time were it's almost impossible to find food. The story is very funny but it's also kind of scary. Like every others Jeunet movies the atmosphere is fantastic. The acting and the cast is good. And the plot is funny and interesting. Delicatessen is a movie definitely worth looking at. A 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE this film, the opening five minutes are LEGENDARY and I laughed out loud more times than I care to remember. I know some people (apparently the under 18 voters aren't impressed, and I say to them, why not?!) don't appreciate this film, but in my opinion it deserves a big fat 10.The film is beautifully dark and features some pretty grim issues but the whole thing comes together so well you finish the film feeling hugely satisfied, I personally watched the whole DVD with a huge gormless grin on my face just as a result of the opening scene.It's rare to find such an original, witty and dark film in today's processing-line film industry and obviously this doesn't seem to be appealing to everyone, but if they don't like it they can go watch Britney in Crossroads, whilst the rest in us bask in the reflected glory of the best thing to come out of France since Thierry Henry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicatessen captures the essence of (good!) art-house flicks through its exploration of human character matched with unique visual style.Sometime in the future (after some unspecified disaster has occurred) people struggle to survive using arcane technology and changed morals.The mail is delivered by bicycle, television is in black and white, and food is scarce. So scarce, that responding to a job wanted ad could be your demise, and a healthy meal for others. Against this backdrop, the two main characters (Louison and Julie) struggle to find love and happiness. The other tenants of their apartment building add to the story, each with their own personality traits.I watched Delicatessen on VHS subtitled in English. I would definitely watch this again. Similar to Brazil in its artistic scope, but without the nonlinearities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delicious Gallic black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Jeunet (of Amelie fame) created this delicious, cannibalistic black comedy about a butcher in post-apocalyptic France, who keeps his tenants supply of ultra-rare meat in plentiful supply due to a high turnover of handymen. When the latest handyman becomes the love interest of the butcher's daughter, they enlist the help of vegetarian underground rebels.Made in 1991, it is only now released on DVD and VHS, given the attention it deserves. Delicatessen manages to pull together the most bizarre situations and oddball tenants, yet it all seems so close to reality, you recognise it as perfectly normal. The look and feel of the film is unique and along with a cracking script, Jeunets beautiful direction and wonderful set design, they create a brilliant film.Even though this is a much darker film than Amelie, if you liked that, you'll probably like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a seaside resort come to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delicatessen in terms of style and content, is what I would imagine a seaside resort would look like circa 1930, an even closer similarity would be an old fashioned carnival, full of wild performers, loud noises, beautiful colours with just a hint of danger. This is a film that could have only come from the warped imaginations of Marc Caro &amp; Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whose odd retro (highly Gilliam) influenced look at France produced two back-to-back visual masterpieces. Since the dissolve of there partnership much of the praise has been heaped out to Jeunet, who as yet is the only one of the two to direct a solo project, but after his Amelie (2001) proved to be a frothy, romantic (not to mention light hearted) fantasy, it would seem that the dark theme and visual design is pure Caro. This revelation only makes the partnership greater, we can now look back at the films they made as a team and see the contrasting play of light and dark. Delicatessen is a wonderfully rich film, full of fantastic set pieces (Julie's dream of Dr Livingston's monkey tea party quickly turning nasty is just one of many standouts), dreams mix freely with reality, never letting the audience in on the joke until the last minute. The acting is also a plus (usually very poor in highly stylised films) showing clearly how passionate the two film-makers where about creating a fully realistic world. Jean-Claude Dreyfus and Marie-Laure Dougnac are great as the Father-daughter owners of the run down apartment block, and Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon carries the film with great skill. Delicatessen is a delicious black comedy that shouldn't be dismissed as empty fantasy, one that definitely should be enjoyed by all. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once F.F. Coppola predicted that the next Mozart wouldn't be musically inclined, but would run around with a video-camera. Maybe he is right, and although film still has a lot of catching up to do when set against the big arts, it's moving along nicely. I am not sure if Jeunet &amp; Caro are Coppola's 'children', there is no doubt however that they are Buster Keaton's grandchildren. And something that helps to push them way up in cinematography-expertise: they think and write film, even in the very first stages where the film is just a handful of ideas. Where Coppola had the ultimate star of film-making beside him on several occasions, the Vittorio Storaro of Caro &amp; Jeunet for this picture (and Alien 4) is the wonderful cinematographer Darius Khondji (Se7en; The Ninth Gate), which completes a team of visionaries that made an absolutely sensational film !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The breakthrough film Jean-Pierre Jeunet &amp; Marc Caro can only be described as bizarre, one of the oddest films I've ever seen. The world of Jeunet &amp; Caro is a world filled with clowns, darkness, cannibals and urban terrorists, a world where dreams and nightmares are shown as reality, we believe everything we see in the film because there is no alternative. This isn't like a lot of fantasy films, in which we get equal measures of the real with the surreal (for example Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King (1991), but a flat out fantasy. We are drawn into the film by the skilful opening, where one of the tenants of a run down French apartment building tries to escape by hiding in a trashcan. From there on the film gleefully tops the scene that precedes it with sheer draw dropping imagination (the monkey dream sequence being one standout). Everything about the film is a pleasure to watch, the slapstick acting, the inter cutting of scenes (Editor Hervé Schneid of Europa fame) and the same gritty yet beautiful photography that cameraman Darius Khondji would later displays in his English language works Se7en and The Beach... A great film for any fans of surrealist black comedy...</fullReview>

This movie is deliciously wicked (pun intended) with wonderful cinematography and score (the synchronized paint/tire pumping/mooing/etc scene is wonderful as well as the various facial expressions and dialogue throughout the movie) and carries an interesting twist on the plot.

		<fullReview>This movie is darkly fun. Delicatessen is set in a run-down, quirky apartment building where the landlord (who is also the butcher in his downstairs deli) kills visitors to feed his tenants. This doesn't seem to bother the residents, who belly up to the deli counter on mornings after a murder to get their share of meat. Some of them even help the landlord when it comes time to kill. You see, times are tough, and people are hungry. (I guess even human flesh can provide sustenance in the world of surreal make believe.) But there's a new visitor in the building, a circus performer who signs-on as a handyman. He hits it off with the landlord's daughter. They become attached. But the residents get hungry for meat, and chaos ensues. The movie is in French with English subtitles. The acting is sufficiently odd and hilarious. The sets, lighting and overall feel of the movie make it dark and surreal--fitting for its cannibalistic theme. I found it thoroughly enjoyable, nicely paced, and entertaining. Mostly, it's original--and just an overall better movie than 90% of the other movie releases today. I give it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't particularly care for French films...However...I love this film. I have loved this film for years and there really isn't much anyone can do about that. I love dystopic future/post-apocalyptic films, I love comedies about cannibalism and this film manages to bring them both together quite effectively. I really don't know how to describe the movie beyond saying that it is a commentary on human nature, or politics... or perhaps it is simply a bizarre and witty comedy. The film has beautifully drab and depressing feel to it that really accentuates the disintigration of society... if there were no laws, we would simply eat each other and not feel particularly bad about it. People could have legs chopped off and feel that this was justified as an accident. People could attempt to drive one another to suicide, could eat their parents and as long as no one said it was wrong, it wouldn't be.While I think this may be a sort of dark and pessimistic view of human nature, I ultimately don't disagree with it. Anyone who is a fan of Caro and Jeunet's later work will probably have seen this film, but if not... see it now. Anyone who like Eating Raoul, Very Bad Things, or Brazil should also see this film. While not for everyone, it will definitely appeal to a certain crowd.</fullReview>

If you haven't seen that one, and you are a fan of science fiction, you can turn in your membership now. You are not deserving of being a sci-fi fan! Co-directors Jeunet and Caro are stark, raving brilliant, and put together two movies that are totally rich with things to look at, characters to absorb, and tangled, dreamlike plots. Delicatessen was the first one, a hilarious comedy. As far as which is better, it's hardly worth choosing! They are similar in many ways, and yet they have totally different stories, plot development, and pacing. Delicatessen is funnier, City of Lost Children more bizarre. If you liked one, see the other!Judging from the comments, some folks just will not "get" this movie, and others apparently will be mortally offended, but that's ok. There are plenty of other movies for THEM to see! However, if you like complicated stories, rich visuals, whacky ideas, off-beat humor, and French slapstick, plus DARK science fiction, then this is heaven! Don't let the subtitles worry you, either. So much of this story is told visually, you could probably get by without the dialog.It's unfortunate that some reviewers seem to have to recount the entire script in their review, but don't let that spoil the movie for you. Even if you read the entire script, it couldn't spoil the experience of seeing what Jeunet and Caro see, and the masterpiece of a film they have made out of it.I now have to do one of the hardest things I have ever done -- bring this movie back!

		<fullReview>This is possible one of the most orginal, imaginative and hilarous films I've ever seen. Considering this was made in 1991 that is some feat. It is based in a post-apoclaptic (sp.) world where food is in short supply and a butcher kills off people to feed the residents in his building, picking off the unlucky newcomers or those to old. This is the basis for the black-comic mayhem which follows. Picks of the film: the finale (bathroom scene) and abstract suicide attempts by a female resident. Suicide attempt one: She sits in the bath (with her clothes on) and with a sewing machine to one side of her with a piece of red cloth on. The red cloth stretches across the bath with a light on top of it turned on. The sewing machine is connected up the door buzzer. She invites a bloke around.......meanwhile next door the clown (employed in maintenance) is fixing a bed. The bloke rings the door several times the light gets closer to falling...the clown hits the bed net door and plug comes out just as the light falls in. SUPERB viewing Attempt 2: She stands in kitchen with a rope around her neck on top of chair and connects a rifle to face her face connected to the door. And then she swallows loads of pills as her husband attempts to open the locked door. He succeeds but the rifle is knocked off target shoots down the rope, she falls to the floor and chokes up the pills as he enters. BRILLIANT WATCH THIS FILM The rest of the film is great too but far to complex to explain.....I repeat go down to rental shop a take this film out. If your an open-minded film lover who likes black comedies especially.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicatessen is one of those films that has a distinct style, lots of memorable scenes and is immensely satisfying to watch. The story centers on a butcher's shop and the butcher who kills his employees and sells their meat in his shop. A circus clown named Louison arrives for a job and is given a room upstairs. The problem with this next intended victim of the butcher is he starts to become friendly with the butcher's daughter, Julie, and they duet musically together - Julie on her cello and Louison on his saw. Also in the several apartments in the block are a host of strange characters, including a man who keeps many frogs in his flooded room and eats lots of snails, and a woman who wants to commit suicide in as many ways as possible. Later a group of vegetarians infiltrate the building and cause havoc. There are some great scenes: one where different objects synchronise to a climax; one where the woman's multiple suicide attempts all fail simultaneously; and a huge water splash scene. It is a brilliant, bizarre and very entertaining film to watch. A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a hard time expressing in words how much I love this film. The genre of the film is kind of hard to pin town, it's part comedy, part surrealist film, part love story, and part horror story; it's a really unique film that succeeds on all those levels. Dominique Pinion gives a great performance, to me, he looks kind of like a cross between Robin Williams and Klaus Kinski. Watch for an appearance by Jess Franco's favorite actor Howard Vernon as the "frog man". I really like the sequence toward the beginning with several people in the apartment doing different things simultaneously, and all the things they're doing climax at the same time, it kind of reminds me of the sequence in The Fifth Element with the jet preparing to take off. Who else but Jeunet and Caro could get away with making attempted (but constantly thwarted) suicide a running gag?The cinematography by Darius Khondji is some of the best I've ever seen, the film has a beautiful sepia-toned look to it. Khondji would go on to do great work on David Fincher's Se7en, City of Lost Children and Alien Resurrection (both also from the Jeunet and Caro team, with Jeunet as the sole director on the latter), and other films. One of the great films of the 90s, I can't reccomend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another movie aimed at the 'not for everyone' crowd, This simply fantastic movie about a clown who tries to survive as a tenant in a cannibalistic butcher shop has 'Jeunet et Caro' written all over it. The visuals are awe-inspiring, and the film is contains with numerous scenes where sound and visuals combine to give the viewer a gritty feeling of rhythm within the movie. Beautifully choreographed and staged, well-written, and exciting. Pardon the irrationality of this review, but I get excited even when writing of it. Go see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicatessen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had remembered the image of a hanging pig in front of a cracked dark red background from the poster or DVD cover, and reading more this French film sounded like it could be a good dark one, from directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Aien: Resurrection, Amélie) and Marc Caro. Basically, set in a post-apocalyptic modern era, society has become dependent on the rare food available, and the food itself is being used as currency, and in this world is a delicatessen on the ground floor of an apartment building. The owner and butcher Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who also runs the apartment building, has offered a new job opportunity as a handyman, he has lured many victims in this way to murder them and use their butchered bodies as a cheap source of meat to customers, former circus clown Louison (Alien: Resurrection's Dominique Pinon) applies for the vacancy and moves in. While doing the maintenance Louison meets and becomes friend's with the butcher's daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac), of course slowly it becomes a mutual attraction and romance, and he proves useful to Clapet that he is reluctant to kill him too quickly, and with his knife trick and boyish charm the handyman charms many other tenants. Julie becomes aware of her father's motives, and goes to meet the feared Troglodistes, a vegetarian sub- group of French rebels living in the sewers, she convinces them to save Louison, the group are almost overthrown by Clapet and the unsympathetic tenants who try to murder Louison, but he escapes with Julie to the upstairs bathroom. To keep out the attackers the pair flood themselves, floor to ceiling, until Clapet opens the door and washes the attackers away, he returns, but unintentional kills himself with Louison's knife, and in the end, with everything peaceful, Louison and Julie play music together on the apartment roof. Also starring Karin Viard as Mademoiselle Plusse, Ticky Holgado as Marcel Tapioca, Jacques Mathou as Roger, Rufus as Robert Kube, Jean-François Perrier as Monsieur Georges Interligator and Silvie Laguna as Aurore Interligator. I can see what the critics mean when they compare this film to something like a film by Terry Gilliam or David Lynch film, with its dark visions on an eccentric and in some cases insane society, surreal scenes of mad murder, unarousing sex and other highly unusual behaviour, it is a good mixture of semi-horror and Gothic stuff accompanied by delirious and funny stuff, I admit not easy to follow, but a likable black comedy fantasy. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this film as I have fallen in love with "amelie", Jeunet's great film. But I find it to be an utterly disturbing,meaningless and horrid film. It is not entertaining at all. See at your own risk. Not recommending for anyone who loves good film. "Amelie",on the contrary, i think is one of the greatest films ever made. But this one, no, it is better to be forgotten. I had great expectation. But now I am utterly disappointed. Now I am waiting to see Jeunet's another film "A Long Engagement". I keep crossing my fingures, that it is not like this one. I would like to request to make films which are good to watch and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicatessen was a film that i have watched in a recent film studies lesson and i have to say that firstly i thought the narrative was incredibly inventive and entertaining. Every shot is carefully thought about by the director the way he uses monochrome shots where one colour dominates the scene i think is fantastic. In some cases it reflects the characters and surroundings, for example; the brown walls in the halls suggest the dullness of the hall as it is just used not appreciated. Whereas some characters rooms are dominated by greens and oranges suggesting more colour in their lives? He tends to use similar techniques in most of his films for example in one of his short films Foutaises he uses the exaggerated screaming effects, also at the tea party at Julie's he only bites the corners off of his biscuit which is mentioned in Foutaises along with the grotesque faces and the faced motion effect. One of the biggest similarities between the two films is the near identical credits yet they look a lot better in Delicatessen mainly because he would have had much more money to spend. It is strange that given the story line this film is so amusing with the bed spring test symphony where all characters are unknowingly going about their business and creating a symphony of different noises known only to the audience adding to the humour. The scene at Julie's with the tea where she discards of her glasses to look better and spends the whole time bumping into things is another one of my favourites. The suicide attempts the two mischievous boys, the man in the basement with all the frogs and snails all add up to make this one of the most hilarious black comedies i have ever seen, and i look forward to watching the rest of his films for example; Alien Resurrection and Amelie. Overall i would give this film 8 out of 10 as it was very entertaining and consider it to be one of my new favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing but not to all tastes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the weirdest and most original films I have seen in a very long time. The film is about a post-apocalyptic future, though the future looks an awful lot like France circa 1950 (as well as having burned out hulks of buildings and the sky is brown). The set design and costumes look very much like the future world of Terry Gilliam's film, BRAZIL. It is supposed to be the future but the design is purely rooted in the past--as if on some alternate reality Earth.In this dystopic world, there isn't much to eat and society has disintegrated. The film is all set in and around a dilapidated apartment building where the tenants all survive thanks to the landlord--who butchers newcomers for the consumption of all!! Despite being a very dark subject, this cannibal fantasy is actually quite funny and charming (that is, apart from when they are hacking the unsuspected into cutlets).Into this sick micro-society comes a rather homely man, Louisan--the next unsuspecting victim. Now that I think about it, this film abounded with strange looking cast members--as if Fellini somehow were involved with the project. However, the landlord's daughter falls for this new guy and is determined to do her best to help this poor guy to escape--even if it means enlisting the aid of the dreaded troglodytes! As you no doubt can tell from the summary, this is one weird and original film. However, had the film not been done with such a light and comedic touch, it would have been yet another schlocky teen blood-feast films. But with the tongue in cheek attitude and lots of wonderfully dark little vignettes, the film is remarkably charming--even if it is about cannibals.Exceptionally well written, amazing visuals (you can't help but be riveted) and a wonderful freshness make this a very enjoyable treat. However, because of the subject matter, I am sure this sick film won't be to everyone's taste! Also, because there are so many clever and small little touches to this film, it sure bears repeated viewing so you can catch it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicatessen has joined a body of work unparalleled in modern film. Both its most notable counterparts ("City Of Lost Children", and more recentantly the vivacious "Amelie") are brilliant and vibrant peices of cinema, however personally i feel that Delicatessen takes the cake. Dominique Pinon (A Jeunet regular) plays the hapless wanderer Joseph, who turns up at a rather ominous butcher shop looking for work. It is a dank, rather terrifying unspecified region of France, in a future when food is scarce and vegetarians reside below the surface like rats. What ensues is both darkly comical and touching.Jeunet's cinematic style is striking to say the least - the camera zooms around the recesses of the apartment block and surrounding alleyways like a hyperactive insect. Characters are bursting with life, oozing charm and wit - most notably the sinister butcher, or the Frog-man. The film is painted with deft strokes, resulting in a seamless cinematic treat, drizzled with masterful comic timing and a lot of heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Bizarre, Wickedly Entertaining Tidbit of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd put off seeing "Delicatessen" for a long time after hearing about it. I'd heard it was a cinematically stylish dark comedy, and assumed it would be weighted down with "significance". After having finally seen it, I kind of wish I'd come to it totally cold, since apart from the somewhat bleak setting and its wild, overwhelming climax there is nothing heavy about this movie.More stylish than profound, "Delicatessen" is not necessarily the movie its acclaim would lead some to believe. (If it's the "2nd greatest movie of all time", "Duck Soup" must be the greatest.) Though it takes place in a post-apocalyptic near-future, this setting only intrudes upon the film enough to give rationales to the characters' actions. It's not so much a (post-) disaster movie as a comic romance, a twist on the "traveling salesman meets farmer's daughter" genre, populated by a more-than-usually-eccentric cast of supporting characters. (The romantic leads are fairly quirky in their own right as well.) The influence of Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" is readily apparent, from the absurdly retro props and sets to the (literally, in this case) underground rebels. At times, however, I was reminded even more of the Coen brothers' works; the ways the writing-directing team of Marc Caro&nbsp;and Jean-Pierre Jeunet combine in-your-face cinematic style with an intricate, surprising plot, unusual characters, and a certain air of cheerful amorality should more than satisfy Coen addicts. (There's even a dream sequence, a regular feature of Coen films.) Since I'm totally unfamiliar with everyone in the cast, I won't presume to judge their performances except to hope that their post-"Delicatessen" careers are doing well.Once again, despite its reputation this is a terrifically enjoyable (though unusual) light romantic comedy. If you think you can stomach a certain amount of grotesquerie, "Delicatessen" should prove to be a satisfying cinematic tidbit. (Apologies to those of you wondering why I've tiptoed around a particularly obvious plot point in this review. Suffice to say that, in case someone reading this has through some mischance heard nothing of this movie, then I certainly don't want to be the one to give away its secret ingredient.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about "Delicatessen" some time ago. But... just the title. No more. Then i decided investigate about it, and i read that is a comedy about cannibalism. Well, is a topic that i just saw in movies like the masterpiece "The Silence of the Lambs" or in stupid horror movies that was famous just for be horrible or maybe inhuman... oh, yes and stupid too. So, is a comedy? Well ... why not? The movie is really amusing,with that classic view of French movies comes "Delicattesen". A story of a lot of funny and "horrible" situation in a building like any other. There is a thing that i love of this movie and is the handling of the sounds, if you if your already saw it, you what i'm talking about, if you don't, you must see it. This is a rare but funny comedy that going to make you pass a good time. A perfect movie for see with your neighbors.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In tough economic times, the landlord of an apartment building, who owns a butcher shop on the first floor, provides meat dishes to his tenants, but what kind of meat is it? The premise has the potential for a delicious black comedy, but the execution here is so bad that it's unwatchable. The humor is more forced than The Three Stooges, and there is not anything here that is even chuckle-worthy. The comedy is so overdone that it's not only unfunny, but it's dreary and depressing. The post-apocalyptic cinematography is somewhat interesting initially but then it accentuates the drab atmosphere and adds to the dreariness of the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Delicatessen '' is not one of the best films ever and certainly it is not my favorite from Caro and Jeunet, but since it came earlier then ''Amélie'' and ''City of the Lost Children'', it needs to have its credits. The plot is also very unique, with a bizarre and dark city where some kind of catastrophe leads people to starve. Food is being used as currency and it is a luxury for a few. A butcher and his neighbors, in order to have meal,have a wicked plan of always lure new tenants, whom they always kill and cannibalize.By the way, this movie is a dark comedy, so if you are not a fan of the genre, stay distant from renting or buying the DVD.</fullReview>

Louison, now aided by Julie, resists and injures many of the bloodthirsty tenants by flooding his apartment. He is able to narrowly avoid death as Clapet inadvertently kills himself with Louison's weapon. The film ends with Louison and Julie enjoying each other's company on the roof of the now peaceful apartment building.In movie there are lot of mid shots and close ups to show emotion in better manner,,long shots are used when those are felt necessary and to cover background and background actionsFew interesting points-------------------------------------When clapet prepares his choppers and knives then that sound goes through pipe creates havoc of butcher nature When louison comes to live and goes to bathroom he opens one tab&amp;water comes from another and vice versaChildren were smoking that does not usually happenLouison was creating water bubbles and smoke bubble in water bubblesAll activities in same tempo with a sync?creaking bedsprings, the ceiling repairing and painting ,lady playing guitar, knitting the sweater, lady dusting ,,bicycle pumpA tenant harvests frogs and seeps by filling the water in his apartmentJulie welcomes louison without spectacles and tries to serve tea that particular sequence is amazing and humorous Julie tells reality about his father and meanwhile louison gets sleptOne lady tenant tries to kill herself and louison is trying to fix the bed he does something and lady fails to suicide ,,basically all the scenes where lady tries to kill herself but fails every time gives good dosage of humourAustralian knife scene used by louison and stupidity test machine scene both scenes are beautifulClapet turning the antenna , troglodytes kidnap wrong target,male tenant throws woolen ball down stairs to sleep properly with his wife and old lady start crying not due to clapet but due to fear of spider these are few more splendid scenesIn last scenes when louison and Julie escape and go to bathroom and then louison says now let's do the last thing which we are supposed to do and start undressing himself and Julie then it gives the feeling that he wants to make love wih Julie before they die but he collects clothes to tap water go outside by putting them between the gap of door and floor and as he wanted to flood the building to save themselves from clapetThis particular scene is perfect epitome of surrealism Marc caro's artistic vision is appreciable as he became very much inventive for this movieThis is a character based movie where directors created a new but identifiable world to create various situations to produce horror ,love ,romance and most important element comedy to entertain the whole world</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were at home one evening without much to do, or with a bunch of mates and decided to watch a film, something like Delicatessen would be the last thing I'd choose to watch, thats even If i'd had heard of it in the first place. Recently, in a film studies lesson I did get the chance to watch Caro and Jeunet's futuristic dark french comedy, and as I soon discovered, the film was surprisingly entertaining. From an immediate discovery of cannibalism within the Butchers to a suicidal woman unable to kill herself, there is rarely an expected moment in the film. Some absurd comedy intertwined with different shot types and striking colour scenes makes the audience truly appreciate the film as a work of art, as well as a piece of entertainment. There were arguably at times dull moments, and even moments that were so unorthodox they became too weird to comprehend, but as a whole, Delicassen was an enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film, i was unsure about how much i would enjoy it as this genre and unique style has never really appealed to me before. However i was pleasantly surprised after just ten minutes of the film as i was really enjoying the black humour and the strange and unpredictable characters. The film is visually impressive and the use of colour is particularly striking as it is not something i am used to encountering. Jeunet uses close ups effectively to show off the grotesque features of certain characters particularly 'the butcher' and Louision. I believe this generates a lot of comedy especially in the sex scene as we see the butcher in a way that is not exactly favourable but still find we cant stop watching. I also noticed this technique in Jeunet's short film Foutais which also generates a lot of comical effect. Another particularly funny section of the film is the series of suicide attempts performed by Aurore. Again something that we probably should not be laughing at but the performance and direction allow us to see light on the situation as something always gets in the way of this distressed woman from taking her own life. This comes to an hilarious end when she literally tries everything to kill herself but an unfortunate (or fortunate depending on how you see it) series of coincidental events lead her to fail in her suicide attempt once again. Beyond the comedy though, Jeunet presents us with the out right bizarre, at its height in my opinion with the man who lives in a foot of water surrounded by frogs and snails both for company and nutrition as we later find out. Colour also plays and important role in this particular scene as the screen appears green which adds to the abnormality. Another particularly striking feature is the choice of camera angles. On several occasions, Jeunet uses high angle shots almost giving a CCTV feeling which makes the scenes even funnier as the realism allows us to think a strange place like this might actually exist. Amongst all the bizarre humour is a touching love story though which further widens this films fan base. I am not saying the film is designed for a mass audience as it is clearly an art house film but i do believe that many people (as i was) will be surprised by how approachable the film is. The love has a happy ending which is always nice to see and the odd pair leave us while playing music on the roof which in context is a fitting way for the pair to end the movie. Overall, i believe Jeunet created a masterpiece when he made this film as it goes beyond entertainment and forms something closer to an artwork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even those people who do not enjoy French films or just foreign films in general will be hard pressed to find something wrong with this brilliantly surreal black-comedy, unless it is perhaps in taste. At times it is perhaps disturbing to an audience who regard themselves as morally right and civil, to see such a benign and malignant setting. An interesting view on a post-apocalyptic world, indeed one that hasn't been delved in before and presented in Jeunet's distinctive style that is seen repeated in several other films such as Alien Resurrection and Amelie, jointly created though of course with the art director, Caro. Originality is definitely something that goes with this film hand in hand along with plenty of hilarious moments such as the failed suicide attempts (I say hilarious.. It is a black comedy after all!) And the bizarre rhythmic sex scene. Trying to describe the film in any detail would not only ruin the image of what it is but would also prove to be an extremely difficult task due to the wacky sets, actors(Those wide lenses again by Jeunet) and overall narrative. So instead I would strongly recommend watching it and enjoying!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that Pan's Labyrinth has everybody talking about adult fantasy in a way that doesn't involve bosomous tarts being "saved" by Prince Charming, maybe we can redevelop interest in the true auteurs of contemporary fantasy classics: Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro! Delicatessen is a sumptuous and entertaining work about a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has resorted to eating other humans. It happens, and the dire and important consequences aren't the point. The point is that a friendly clown (played by Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon) doesn't actually WANT to get eaten, but unlike his unfortunate predecessors, he's not only clever, but also such an all-around good-guy that the butcher's daughter doesn't really want him to die either.That's not all. This world, as tiny as it is, is littered with colorful characters and comedic types that all have to have a say in whatever situation, providing one of the most entertaining approaches to in-group dissolution ever shown on screen. What's awesome about this movie is that that same form of fresh cliché wiped off and given a new cover dots the entire narrative... everything that happens feels familiar, but none of it is grossly repetitive. This film is as much a parody of post-apocalyptic movies as it is its own comedic entity.I can't say it's as good as the two directors' later work, The City of Lost Children. But it does more for entertainment than most movies out there, and it's a real visual treat. I hope other fantasy-adventure style creations come out from either both or one of them. I mean, I love Amelie to death, but this stuff is a little bit more rare, you know? --PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another for the hybridologists, you can just hear them winging possibilities like 'a cross between 'Freaks' and 'Grand Hotel', which is a way it is except that 'The Lower Depths' might be closer than the Grand Hotel. This is black comedy in spades. By distorting everything from the buildings to the faces Jeunet has imbued the whole schmeer with a Cabinet of Dr Caligari feel, a not unapposite simile given that the apartment building does verge on the asile. If you don't go along with it from image one then you'll wind up resisting it and walk out, if you do go along with it you'll have a few laffs. The actual building bears more than a passing resemblance to the apartment building in which Gabin holed up in 'Le Jour se leve', albeit a distorted version as noted earlier. Is it deliberately referential? You tell me. Certainly Prevert and Carne did not spend too much time on the other tenants whilst Jeunet explores them in depth (both higher and lower). Would a suicide maven sit in a bath of water fully clothed in the hope that an elaborate ropes-and-pulleys arrangement will result in electrocution? Does it matter. Not really. Is it fun to exploit serious myopia to the extent that someone could get badly scalded? It's fun HERE, morally is another question. Billy Wilder might have written something like this on LSD but when he came down he would have pruned it and still come up with a black comedy. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt cheated. The film started out with fantastic camera work and charming cinematography, the photography was great and the build up of the tenants was well thought out and their characters unique. Everything indicated I was in for a black comedy/romance that revolves around cannibalism due to the post-apocalyptic economy. Suddenly this sub-plot comes into play about underground rebels called "troglodytes". Once this comes into the film things get out of hand with nonsensical comedy (jokes involving large people and toilet water) and an uninteresting scattered pace, also, our intriguing tenants disappear from the story and become seemingly useless.Some of the creativity and style seemed over worked. I didn't like the way Jeunet got his actors to act, I mean don't get me wrong I didn't think they were bad actors, it was just the direction from Jeunet that seemed like I was watching a theatre play for five year olds; spitting at a photo frame so hard that it shatters, the squeaking all the tenants created all at the same time, a bourgeois character constantly attempts and fails suicide ? little things like this irked me from time to time. I did however enjoy the scene in which Louison, the films protagonist and another tenant squeak the springs of a bed in rhythm to the music on television and I enjoyed the creativity of Louison's circus-like acts.I adored the visual style but I didn't like the way the comedy was brought out (or the comedy at all, really) and the direction of the actors. It was a great film with flaws I would have overlooked. Unfortunately the "trog's" were introduced, when they came in I lost all faith and interest in this being something I'd consider brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Delicatessen" is centered on a crumbling apartment house with a delicatessen on its ground floor, where the only customers are the residents of the apartments above it. Since there are no neighbors (or buildings) surrounding it, the proprietor of the delicatessen relies on hiring handymen for his building, then killing them and serving the meat to the knowing residents. The latest victim is Louison, (Dominique Peron) a retired circus clown who falls in love with the proprietor's daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dognac), a shy woman who does everything she can to protect Louison from his fate. The hungrier the residents get, the more desperate they become, eventually culminating in the film's climax.Jeunet is the director who brought us "Amelie", the incredibly beautiful and charming film from 2001. If you are expecting something that looks like that, "Delicatessen" is not going to be it. The cinematography is dark and gritty, and there are some pretty interesting camera angles. Where the two films are similar is that both are essentially fairy tales; "Delicatessen" is the Rose Red to "Amelie"'s Snow White. Obviously a story about post-apocalyptic French cannibals is not for everyone, but it is an interesting film nonetheless. Overall, I enjoyed it, though I did hit a few snags with the pacing. 6/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a futuristic post-apocalyptic society, food is rare and the butcher Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) is the landlord of a building, where he rents the apartments and his single daughter Julie Clapet (Marie-Laure Daugnac) lives in one of them. Clapet's butcher shop is supplied by the flesh of his assistants, and the cannibalistic tenants are fed by human meat. The former clown Louison (Dominique Pinon) is hired to be the new assistant of Clapet, but Julie falls in love with him, and in the end she contacts an underground gang to help her to save Louison. 'Delicatessen' is one of the weirdest movie I have ever seen. Its surrealistic atmosphere recalls 'Brazil ? The Movie', with a very chaotic society. The recent released Brazilian DVD (Universal / Studio Canal) is a shame, without chapters, running time, having only the movie and nothing else. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'Delicatessen'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can see why Sigourney Weaver frog(sorry)-marched Jeunet through Alien Resurrection, having seen this black comedy. Setting, characters and action are all off-centre and there is a romance at the heart of the film - so far, so French - but crucially, the film develops into a conventional thriller filmed in a consistently unconventional way. Alas there are no jokes in Alien IV so we had to wait until Amelie for Jeunet's first mainstream hit.I almost gave up; many of the characters are fleshed out in comic book style (imagine Judge Dredd set in postwar Paris). But a brilliant performance from Dominique Pinon as a world-weary but optimistic former showman gives the characters some line. He is offset well by Karin Viard as the murderous deli-owner's mistress. She struggles a bit with the comic slant of the film but exudes a sexuality unseen in other supporting roles (I think of her feminist in La Separation or bourgeois housewife in L'Emploi du Temps).Once the thrill-plot has emerged and the momentum has picked up one can really begin to enjoy the surrealism of the movie: an underground resistance-vegetarianisme, or a prim tenant of the deli-block moved to a series of elaborate suicide attempts. If only the strong (and idiosyncratic) control of the tension and its set-piece release were also used to curb the earlier style-indulgent wanderings. 5.5/10 and look out for l'homage a ET...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is launching as a comedy, sci-fic, and romance.. When we judge the movie through these fields, it is just a piece of crap for me. It is not that funny so it can not be comedy, it is not a sci-fic, but it is really odd and original. If you wish to see a movie with a really different environment and way of storytelling, watch this, you will definitely find something different.I have to say that the scenes, lights, cinematography, cadrages are the most powerful items in this movie. These items are too much strong, that the story and script remains too weak besides them. And unfortunately I didn't see anything futuristic in this movie, just an old crappy building with people from 1950's. Put some green-yellowish lights to have a spooky atmosphere, and find 10 freaky characters; here you are, movie is served..As a movie fan who believes the integrity is one of the most important criterias in a movie, I can say that this movie has just escaped the train. If you really want to make something odd, than make the whole thing odd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicatessen is a devil's food cake of surreal-post-apocalypse-nowhere's-land-set movie-making, and one that can make you feel completely delighted and utterly flabbergasted and confused as you bite down on its cinematic trickery and deranged sense of humor. It is, as far as I can gather, about a butcher (rubber-meat-faced Jean-Claude Dreyfuss) in an apartment building who finds unlucky saps to be a part of his offerings ala Sweeney Todd. This part, at least, is most clear as it's right before the opening credits, which by the way are laced with such creativity with its texturing and movement you'll already be strapped in for the ride. But Delicatessen isn't a visual trip in the sense of say Terry Gilliam. It's about an assorted lot of characters in this apartment: the butcher, the clown who takes a job as an assistant, the butcher's near-sighted daughter who falls in love with the plucky new guy (who may soon be dinner), plus a woman who keeps trying to commit suicide in over-elaborate designs, and a man who seems to be content living with a horde of frogs.Coming into Delicatessen after the City of Lost Children, Caro and Jeunet's masterpiece, I was sure I would be looking in Delicatessen for visual flamboyancy, the daring of shot compositions and a set design that calls back to literature and paintings of a distinctly stomach-churning European sensibility. This, at least more than plot. But aside from the central focus of the clown and the butcher's daughter, and a couple of key scenes like the running gag of the suicide lady, Delicatessen isn't always the easiest tale to follow. Maybe it's the troglodytes, who appear in the black suits and shuffle in and out of the film in an odd occasional frequency until the last twenty minutes (it's there that things start to build into a near-perfect frenzied crescendo, including that great scene where the clown-guy busts open the pipes in the bathroom to flood out the madmen/women bashing against the door to get at his meaty self.But, hell with it, why not just *look* at the movie and get sucked into it, anyway? It's a sumptuously defined world here, like and unlike places we know, like those unsavory dives in the bad parts of town with the grossly maladjusted workers with faces like four miles of bad road. And it's a beautiful film of ugly colors, if that makes sense, of (as in COLC) lots of grays and browns, diluted shades and then bright corners, and of course those frogs and the sewers and the ironic black-coated hope of the troglodytes. Delicatessen didn't, as they say, "blow me away" as Caro and Jeunet's sophomore effort did so effortlessly, but it deserves to be seen by anyone into those "weird" movies that college kids eat up like bon-bons and the older folks, the ones well familiar with Bunuel and Svankmajer and the writings of Burroughs, will have a good larf with. An imperfect thing of rancor wonder you'll want to revisit whenever it pops on TV. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Particularly boring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't any good... It's some kind of art movie that includes a lot of weird scenes and a lot of surreal situations... but in the end it really does not tell you anything. I'm not easily fascinated by displays of human weirdness.... so I found myself particularly bored by this movie. I'll compare it to The Triplets of Belleville... another French movie that I disliked for the same reasons as this one. It's just sequences of weird events. Hm... seems like my comment needs to be 10 lines in order to be submitted. What more to say? The setting of the movie is in a house where there's a butcher who kills his apprentices to sell their meat. It's about this new unsuspecting guy he hires, and it's about the surrounding neighborhood who knows about the killings, but who do not interfere with it because they're dependent upon the meat (because there's some kind of famine in the city). Enough said. A particularly boring movie, like I said!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm apparently swimming against the tide of critical opinion. If this film is the 2nd best ever,as one enthusiast asserted,Hollywood,our society and my sanity are doomed. I will concede that the co-habitation scene was different and amusing despite the lack of naked bodies struggling to achieve perfect union.Saw this movie in non -theater environment which may be a mistake . The unpredictable dynamics of audience reaction can be very critical. Audience belly laughs create a different mood to viewers than groans or other unappreciative reactions I thought it most illogical that in what was presumably a post war devastated society some of the characters' dress was straight out of Bergdoff Goodman.If this was intended to convey some deeper message, it was way over my head. Illogical movies are a big letdown for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had never seen "The Triplets of Belleville", "Brazil", "V for Vendetta", or "Sweeney Todd", I would have rated this movie a 9. The production values are second to none, especially for a European movie.Perhaps I'm jaded, but plots with a twist or two are great, but not if you can see them coming from a mile away.It is, however, a very mature film because it is unashamedly campy and doesn't pretend to be anything other than that. Not really "film noir", but instead "film sepia".If you're a fan of French movies, you should recognize Dominique Pinon right away as the pessimistic young thug in "Diva". He seems miscast here as the potential love interest of the butcher's daughter, since he seems older than Jean-Claude Dreyfus, who plays the butcher. Alas?maybe that's part of the intended effect. (Pinon is actually nine years younger than Dreyfus.) If you didn't really like any of the movies named hereinabove, you probably will have a hard time "getting" this. Otherwise? enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Always clever, frequently exhausting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeunet and Caro made an auspicious debut with this comedy trifle. It's alarmingly full of mechanical gags and originality. Any sequence in this movie could be extracted and garner much admiration, but 30 superficially clever segments in a row begins to wear on a viewer. Being accosted with each new episodic conceit actually becomes exhausting. And when a even a brief respite from all the hyperactivity is needed, it's not to be found. Humans are mined as a source of delight for behavioral aberrations, but no one connects with anyone to any real degree. The movie refuses to go deeper into anything. Jeunet and Caro at this point, are still in love with props. Delicatessen is emotionally chilly. The two obviously love the old silent clowns, Tati, Chaplin, Keaton, etc, and it's sillier than you ever imagined a French movie could be. But it's around a thousand percent better than their next film; the truly god-awful atrocity City of Lost Children. By the time Jeuenet (w/o Caro) made Amelie, he had found some much needed humanity, and calmed down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicatessen looks like a series of sepia tone paintings brought to life in this off beat comedy from Jean Pierre Jeunet. This is one of the strangest, quirkiest films I've ever seen. Jeunet's previous works, Amelie(2009) and Micmacs(2009) were also different but they at least had coherent story lines, Delicatessen does not. It is without structure of any kind.The landlord and butcher of an apartment building and deli in some kind of post apocalyptic France with a food shortage is also a butcher who serves customers meat from a mysterious source. He hires a former circus performer to be a handy man. What follows is good acting wasted by surrealism which tired me out by the end, A very disappointing effort by Mr. Jeunet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The French can make truly great films. However, merely being of French origin does not make a great film and this, most certainly, is not the cinematic masterpiece some would like to believe it is.First off, let's get one thing out of the way; the cinematography is phenomenal, defining what was a new and grotesque atmosphere that is truly unsettling and has since been copied numerous times by other directors. Beyond that, this movie is utter rubbish.The plot is contrived, and not in a surrealistic fashion that works. Instead, it is merely predictable and boring. Furthermore, the characters themselves are underdeveloped and, as a result, one is never really convinced of their motivations. The attempts at sentimentality are intentionally paper thin French clichés. The movie is simply unable to deliver on either the humor or contrasting horror it so desperately strives to impart due to a lack of any emotional connection with the characters. It was not unlike watching a puppet show, which may have been intentional, but that doesn't make it good.Because the movie simply isn't funny or particularly horrifying and the performances hollow and uninspired (with the exception of Jean-Claude Dreyfus, who manages to almost hold the movie together) the film as an allegory for French societal ills (moral degradation, self consuming, etc.) is obvious and, in the worst traditions of French cinema, obnoxiously self absorbed. Had more time been spent on a character development, more nuanced dialog and less on attempted irreverent sentimentality, then perhaps one might care about the underlying themes.In the end, this movie is simply 100 minutes of futility.</fullReview>
