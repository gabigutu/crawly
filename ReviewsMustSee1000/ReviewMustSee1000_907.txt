		<shortDescription>Somebody up there liked Paul Newman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman stars as Rocky Graziano in the middleweight champion's life story, "Somebody Up There Likes Me," directed with spirit by Robert Wise. The film covers Rocky Barbella's young life on the mean streets of New York, made all the meaner by his juvenile delinquent presence and that of his friends. Totally out of control, Barbella steals, runs, and punches his way through his home life, reform school, and prison, including his army stint where he knocks out a corporal and goes AWOL, then assuming the name Graziano. It's not long before his talent is put to good use in the ring. The respectability and success he gains is short-lived, however, when he refuses to take a dive but then fails to report it to the boxing commission or identify the criminals.The film covers Graziano's marriage to his wife of 47 years, Norma, and his historic fight with Tony Zale. Pier Angeli plays the petite but tough Norma, who knows just how to handle her husband; Eileen Heckert is marvelous as Rocky's mother. Harold Stone, as Rocky's disillusioned father, is very good in the difficult role of an unlikeable man with an uneasy relationship with his son. Sal Mineo is effective as Romolo, Rocky's friend from the neighborhood.James Dean was to play Graziano but after his death, the role went to Paul Newman. Words are not really adequate to describe the young Newman's work in this film. He totally inhabits the character of Graziano and loses what one thinks of as "Paul Newman" in the bargain. One of the hardest accents to do without making it sound phony is a New York one, yet Newman pulls it off with no problem. Though Dean would have been excellent, Newman's portrayal is a treasure. He's angry, sympathetic, scrappy, vulnerable and caring - in short, a flawed human being. It's one of the finest performances on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Great Movies Of The 1950s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was excellent! I think it is one of the most underrated and under-discussed movies of the 1950s. It was interesting from start-to-finish and had drama, humor, suspense, action, romance.....and it's all true. The story was approved by the man it was about: boxer Rocky Graziano. Thus, you know it's not "based on a true story" in which 90 percent of it turns out to be fiction, just for dramatic purposes. No, this was Graziano's story and Paul Newman - despite not looking Italian - did a superb job playing him. This movie put Newman "on the map" as an actor. He was fascinating in here and dominated most of the scenes.The film's direction by Robert Wise and the cinematography also took center stage. Apparently, the "powers that be" agreed as this film won an Oscar for its photography.Newfane's portrayal of the juvenile delinquent-turned-championship boxer may have dominated the story but all the characters left strong impressions, beginning with this parents played by the great character actors Harold Stone and Eileen Heckart . Pier Angeli is well- cast as Graziano's sweetheart-turned wife. Her Italian accent fits in perfectly as does her character as the soft and frail--but tough female complement to Rocky. Too bad we didn't see much of this actress in the USA.The rest of the supporting cast is top-notch, from Everett Sloane as the fight manager to '50s star/teen idol Sal Mineo as a neighborhood pal to Graziano. Also good was Robert Loggia as the bad- influence hood. This was Loggia's first role on screen. Speaking of first roles, did anyone catch Steve McQueen in here?? I did a double-take when they had a quick gang-fight rumble on top of a roof and there's McQueen! The camera put a closeup shot on him and there was no doubt it was him! He had no lines, unfortunately, but that apparently was his film debut.This movie is finally going to be released on DVD sometime in November of 2006. I hope more people get the opportunity to discover this fantastic movie which, by the way, reminded me quite a bit of another fantastic film in this era: On The Waterfront.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent bio-pic with great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that made Paul Newman a star. And with good reason. Although James Dean was signed to play the great Rocky Graziano, his death in a car crash made the role available for Paul Newman to step into. Newman who up to this point had made only a handful of forgettable pictures,turns in a marvelous portrayal of a man who is so filled with rage that everything he touches turns into trouble.Newman's performance is layered with anger, humor, and fear. Rocky Graziano was by means the brightest guy in the world, and Newman to his credit does not try to make this an endearing quality of Rocky's.The story does a nice job of not glossing over Rocky's troublesome youth. It shows a lot of the trouble and bad decision's that he made that led to being thrown out of schools, reformatories, and later into prison. This is not a sanitized bio-style film that you would have seen in the thirties or forties.The rest of the acting is also first rate. Especially from Eileen Heckart and Everett Sloane as his mother and trainer, respectively. Lots of actors making their film debuts in this movie also. Look for Robert Loggia, Steve McQueen, George C. Scott and Dean Jones.Robert Wise has done a wonderful job of bringing NYC to life in this picture. Watching Newman walk down the street with all of the people jeering him at first, and then rooting for him as he starts to gain some fame is the work of a top notch director. Wise would later exploit the scenery of New York to better use a few years later in "West Side Story". He also did an excellent job with the fight sequences.It's easy to see where Sylvester Stallone got his inspiration for his "Rocky". In fact, you might say that he not only borrowed the development of his character, but that of Adrian, as well."Somebody Up There Likes Me" is well worth a look.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story is in the tradition of a number of fifties movies about delinquency and rebellion?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film follows Graziano's impoverished childhood in New York's East Side slums, where he grows up in the streets, among hoodlums and gangs? His father (Harold Stone), a disappointed, third-rate ex-boxer, takes out his frustrations by drinking and by beating up Rocky; his mother (Eileen Heckart), is an unhappy, nervous wreck? As a result, Rocky becomes a brutal delinquent, spending most of his youth in reformatories and prisons? Defiant, impulsive, striking out with his fists at anyone, he is seemingly incorrigible? Even the Army can't tame him?he punches an officer, goes AWOL and is sentenced to hard labor?but in prison he learns that he can turn his hatred into a living: instead of fighting the world he can punch one man at a time in the ring? He becomes a successful fighter, marries a devoted woman, Norma (Pier Angeli), and eventually makes it in the world, becoming middleweight champion? The story is in the tradition of a number of fifties movies about delinquency and rebellion? Newman's portrayal of Rocky as an inarticulate teenager is similar to Brando's motorcyclist in "The Wild One," who also rebels against anything convenient and practical? But unlike the Brando character, Rocky develops from a causeless rebel into someone with a clear goal?to become a respected member of society?and this strong ambition allies him with many of Newman's subsequent characters? In "The Rack," Newman says he's "half my father's disappointment?half' my mother's hope," and the situation here is the same? Alienated from his vicious father, he runs out "to be something," and strikes back at the world? Their final confrontation, in which each recognizes his responsibility toward, and need for, the other, is a powerful moment; and the two reaching awkwardly for each other recalls the car scene in "The Rack." Newman effectively portrays Rocky's sincere but clumsy attempts at tenderness with Norma; in subsequent films he would play many men who have difficulty being tender? Rocky is made even more sympathetic by his genuine concern for a fellow hoodlum (Sal Mineo), whose idolatry of Rocky as a father-figure evokes the similar relationship between Mineo and James Dean in "Rebel Without a Cause."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James and Paul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to note the career relationship of James Dean and Paul Newman. Both were leading contenders for the starring role in "East of Eden." Dean's moving screen test landed him the part over Newman.Then, upon Dean's sudden demise, Newman was awarded the role Dean was to play in "Somebody Up There Likes Me." Fortunately, Newman was up to the task.His Rocky was most effectively limned, with Newman in top physical form as well as in the acting department. He assumed a "New York hood" accent, which enhanced his portrayal, and executed the challenging fight scenes with conviction.Perhaps young Newman's burning ambition at the time to greatly succeed in his craft provided extra stamina to smash through this meaty part for a "knockout punch." Fresh from Actors Studio training, Mr. Newman was fortunate to be surrounded by a quartet of fine "method" artists. Eileen Heckart was particularly fine as Mrs. Barbella, Everett Sloane as a concerned Manager, Sal Mineo as dependable pal Romolo, and Pier Angeli as sensitive Norma Graziano. Rocky's hard-hitting life was given a realistic black and white production, doing justice to the middle weight champ's biography. Robert Wise directed with his usual skill and confidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-Paced, Excellent Wise/Newman Biopic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the critical and commercial fiasco of THE SILVER CHALICE, Paul Newman decided that the move to Hollywood had been a mistake, and returned to Broadway, to star in "The Desperate Hours" (later filmed with Humphrey Bogart in Newman's role). Warner Brothers, not amused by Newman's departure, tacked an additional two years onto his film contract, and brought the young actor back for a so-so war drama on loan to MGM, THE RACK. Then lightning struck!Boxer/Entrepreneur Rocky Graziano's entertaining autobiography, SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME (ghosted by Rowland Barber) had been planned with James Dean in the lead, but the 24-year old star's untimely death, after completing GIANT, left the WB without a loan-out actor for the MGM production. The studio decided to use Newman, and at last the young actor had a role he could really "sink his teeth into".Masterfully directed by the legendary Robert Wise, the fast-paced, gritty comedy/drama follows young Rocco Barbella (Newman), from his early gang days (with Sal Mineo in a small role, and young Steve McQueen and Robert Loggia, unbilled, as other gang members), resulting in a prison stint, finally released just in time to be inducted into the service! His quick temper and natural boxing skills catch the attention of an Army boxing coach, but the undisciplined Barbella decides to go AWOL, using boxing (under the name Rocky Graziano) to pick up quick cash. Eventually, Graziano/Barbella gets his life straightened out, aided by the love of a good woman (Pier Angeli, James Dean's real-life girlfriend, and Newman's costar in THE SILVER CHALICE), and a sympathetic manager (Everett Sloane, in another of his many masterful performances), and Rocky begins a long, hard drive to become a champion.The role of Graziano would be a showcase for any actor, and the Method-trained Newman plays it with an explosive physicality and intensity that is occasionally too theatrical, but is still mesmerizing. His performance foreshadows, to some extent, Robert De Niro's Jake La Motta, in RAGING BULL, without the abusiveness and ultimately self-destructive qualities. Just as La Motta, even in defeat to Sugar Ray Robinson, would proclaim "I never went down!", Graziano would not allow himself to accept defeat gracefully, resulting in a constant physical pummeling that would leave his face so battered that he'd even frighten his child!SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME would influence a generation of young actors and film makers (including Sylvester Stallone, who would 'lift' characters and some story elements in his script for ROCKY). For Paul Newman, it opened doors, and although his next two projects would be a standard Warner Brothers musical biopic (THE HELEN MORGAN STORY) and soap opera (UNTIL THEY SAIL), MUCH better films would soon be on their way. A new star had been born!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky, the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise was a film editor before he became a director. Having edited some of Orson Welles films when he was starting out, made him a natural director. After all, Mr. Wise knows how to move his camera and how to capture great moments in film. "Somebody Up There Likes Me" is a rarity these days, in that it's seldom seen.This is also a film that has a rich texture. The story, photographed using New York as a backdrop offers a rare view of how it looked in those years. We are taken to Brooklyn, downtown Manhattan and other natural locations that were an asset in the film. It helps that Mr. Wise had the inspiration to engage Joseph Ruttenberg as his cinematographer because of the excellence of his work in the films he photographed.This is a story of Rocky Graziano, a boxing champion, who came from a poor family. The father, Nick Barbella, is seen at the beginning trying to show young Rocco to box. When he doesn't get the response he wants, he punches the boy squarely on his nose, making him bleed. Rocco would grow up to become a hoodlum doing petty crime and being sent to jail.Rocco's story could have ended in tragedy, but didn't. It helped to have met good friends along the way like Irving Cohen who helped him with his boxing career. The love of Nora is another of the blessings this man was blessed with. In fact, yes, somebody up there must have liked Rocco Barbella, a man who is a legend in boxing circles.The young Paul Newman was lucky to land this part. James Dean had been selected to play the role, but it went to Mr. Newman who took it and ran away with the film. This was his big break through in films. Paul Newman was formed at the famous Actor Studio. His technique is in sharp contrast with other, formally trained actors, but in a way, by making Rocky's character so complex, we get a detailed account of the man by an inspired young actor that went to become a legend in his own right.The supporting cast was excellent. Eileen Heckart is the suffering Ida Barbella, a woman who has been cheated out of everything by a husband that is a brute. Harold Stone is also good as Nick Barbella. Pier Angeli is sweet as Norma and Sal Mineo makes the best out of Romolo, the childhood friend. Everett Sloan plays the pivotal role of Irving Cohen.In the film we see a lot of interesting young actors who went to have their own distinguished careers later on. Steve McQueen, Robert Loggia, George C. Scott, Frank Campanella, and other New York based theater actors are seen in the background without any credit.This is a boxing film that was way ahead of the others because of the tight direction of Robert Wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Newman Wins It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until now I've only seen Paul Newman in 1990's and later movies - but he's never been the actor that called me into a movie theater or made me change the channel. He always seemed to play the same type of part: easy going, calm, aware, well contained. Or maybe that's the way he made each part seem.After seeing this movie, now I know why he's considered such a great actor. I only watched boxing when it was part of the Olympics - just don't enjoy the sport itself that much - and only know about Rocky Graziano from the newspapers. But Paul Newman was riveting. He made this character of a complete underdog, who apparently had no hope, no charm, and nothing to live for, into someone I cared about enough to stick with the movie for two hours.I don't know how true-to-life the story was; Hollywood generally creates composite characters, cleans up reality and changes or outright ignores major events. Certainly the many fights Graziano had were a bit of a blur in the film and I'm sure several critical steps in his advancement towards middleweight championship were neglected. The reason for the violent relationship between Rocky and his father was unexplained. And his mother's mental state (the film alludes to her time in the hospital) is not fully developed.These gaps do not overshadow in any way Paul Newman's performance. I always thought it was longevity, charitable works, and a long-lasting marriage to another actor (not to mention darn good spaghetti sauce) that gave him the aura he has - now I understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incomplete biography of Graziano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the director Robert Wise wanted to emphasize more on the behavior of young Graziano, his problems with his father, the time he spent in jail and his misdoing in the army, but some aspects of his final life as a boxer were not shown at all in the film, which ends with the rematch between Graziano and Tony Zale in Chicago in 1947, where Graziano did his best to knock out Zale. With this victory Graziano became world champion, something that did not last for long. Zale and Graziano met once again in 1948, and this time Zale finished his adversary with a knock out in the third round. Graziano wanted to come back in 1952 fighting against the famous Ray "Sugar" Robinson. In that fight, Graziano knocked down Robinson in the third round, but he recovered and finished with Graziano in the same third round. In any case, Graziano was a good boxer, and this bloody -violent sport put his life on the right track. Interesting to note that this was the first film (uncredited) in the career of the actor Steve McQueen. Sal Mineo again acted as a wrong young boy in New York. The actress Pier Angeli did a good work as Graziano's wife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Way back in the day when I was a lad, I read Rocky Graziano's memoirs Somebody Up There Likes Me and enjoyed the book. Someone at MGM must have liked it even more than I did because a really fine film was made from it and a star was born.Paul Newman's debut picture, The Silver Chalice, was a bomb. Had he not made good in this it's possible he might never have had a film career. But he perfectly captures Rocky Graziano's character and it certainly is the character I remember Rocky talking about in his memoirs.Thomas Rocco Barbella grew up on the Lower East Side of New York City and his teen years were during The Great Depression. The bleak poverty of the period ground the soul out of many a family as you can see in the portrayals of Graziano's parents by Harold J. Stone and Eileen Heckart. There were no jobs period. I have an uncle who told me that he spent the late thirties after graduating high school doing absolutely nothing, looking for jobs when there were none to be had. What probably saved him from being a Graziano was a strong family structure which Rocky didn't have.But he sure had dynamite in those fists. In between all kinds of crooked mayhem he was causing with friends, Rocky discovers boxing as a way out of the slums. It was a long process, it involved a few stretches in various penal institutions, including a year term in Leavenworth for going AWOL from the army.Barbella was his given name, but he took the name Graziano which happened to be his mother's maiden name while fighting when he was AWOL. The year stretch didn't corrupt his fighting skills any.Somebody Up There Likes Me saw some interesting people in bit roles. Steve McQueen is one of Rocky's punk friends, George C. Scott has a walk-on as a prisoner. And Robert Loggia makes an unforgettable film debut as a wiseguy who nearly derails Graziano's career. Dean Jones also makes his screen debut as well.Boxing fans know Rocky best from those three classic fights with Tony Zale for the middleweight championship. Tony Zale won the first one in New York. And then Graziano was offered a bribe to throw a tune-up fight and backed out of the bout altogether. The rules of the New York State Athletic Commission say bribes have to be reported, taken or not. But Rocky's code of the street didn't allow for that. He lost his license in New York, but was allowed to fight in Chicago in a rematch with Zale. Of course he won it and while he lost the championship back to Zale the following year, he's in the books as a champion and one of the most popular.Pier Angeli is Norma Unger the Jewish girl he falls for and marries and she radiates the positive goodness he needs in his life. One of Everett Sloane's finest roles is Irving Cohen, former garment worker and now fight manager. My parents met Irving Cohen years ago, they almost bought a house from him way back when I was a toddler. Sloane's portrayal rings very true.Finally Sal Mineo as Romolo is very good and having read the book, I can say that Romolo was a real person and Mineo plays him as described in Graziano's memoirs. The last scene with Mineo and Newman together before the second Zale fight is very dramatic as Rocky sees exactly the turn his life could have taken.Paul Newman fans have this as required viewing. For me it is one of the best boxing films ever made and one of the best inspirational films ever made as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Question: Is there such a thing as a boxing movie that isn't just a total cliché from start to finish? 'Cause if there is, then I'd sure like to know about it. I really would.With that said, you have my personal guarantee that 1956's Somebody Up There Likes Me is such a predictable cliché-of-a-boxing-movie that, at times, it's almost too painful to endure.On top of having this one major strike against it, this film also lost itself some significant points for its gross miscasting of Paul Newman in the lead role.Not only did Newman never, ever come anywhere near to being at all convincing as a full-blooded American/Italian, but his goofy performance as boxing champ, Rocky Graziano, was, by far, one of the most absurd and annoying examples of copy-catting Marlon Brando's quirky mannerisms that I've ever seen.Believe me, Newman's ridiculous portrayal was absolutely laughable to watch at times.Filmed in stark b&amp;w, Somebody Up There Likes Me's story (which was set in NYC during the 1930s &amp; 40s) was based on the autobiography written by real-life, middleweight, boxing champ, Rocky Graziano (whose birth-name was Rocco Barbella).Of all the many boxing films that I've seen over the years this dud has certainly proved to be one of the weakest and most unsatisfactory, by far.By the end of the movie I literally loathed Newman's Graziano character right to the very bone. My only wish was to see one of his opponents really clean his clock, but good. But, unfortunately, this never happened. So I was left totally unsatisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Paul Newman's fan I think he is one of the best actors of the last four decades This movie reflects the life of a great boxer as no other. The fact that the movie has been filmed in black and white captures the essence of a decade where the values were more than money for the American society. All the performances are excellent, and the Perry Como's song Somebody up there likes me is a plus. I want to mention Everett Sloane and Sal Mineo performances because they really help to show the boxer's life. Although there are many good Paul Newman's movies this is a masterpiece to me.To summarize,this is one of the best movies about boxing that you can find and is also a biography</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wise directs probably one of the best boxing movies ever. Paul Newman is combustible as Rocky Graziano, who is considered by many as one of the greatest knockout artists in the history of boxing. His rough youth in the back streets of New York and brushes with crime made Graziano a fearsome force to reckon with. A world champion known for that "one punch knockout" ability and matched with Tony Zale in one of the ring's most storied rivalries ever; somebody up there really liked the volatile undisciplined fighter. Newman is electrifying and faultless. Also starring are: Pier Angeli, Everette Sloan, Eileen Heckart, Harold J. Stone, Sammy White and Sal Mineo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good--and a lot closer to the truth than I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky Graziano was a very, very flawed guy to say the least. To be more blunt, until he settled into a career in boxing, he was an antisocial jerk--a blight on society. However, as was the case with most older bio-pics (such as "The Birdman of Alcatraz" and "The Sound of Music"), in order to make a more marketable flick, the truth was often very, very malleable--as the writers took such huge liberties with the facts that the original of the film was hardly recognizable. And, since Rocky was not a very likable guy, I expected a whitewash with this film. Fortunately, the writers stuck reasonably close to the truth and Paul Newman puts in his first excellent performance (after his disaster in "The Silver Chalice").The film begins with a lovely man (Harold Stone) forcing his young boy to fight. He slaps the little kid around horribly--and it was obvious the father was a complete jerk. From this sort of upbringing, it's understandable why the kid grew up angry (in reality, the father would bit his two sons against each other in boxing matches for his friends to watch--and Rocky's older brother usually beat the snot out of him). This portion of the film shows the many stupid and self-defeating things Rocky did before switching to a life in boxing. Stealing, violence, prison and a stint in military prison--all make up this sordid portion of the movie. To see just how Rocky manages to pull it all together, watch the film.Overall, well-written and with a very likable performance from Newman. This isn't exactly "Raging Bull" but it is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

It's weird because during Graziano's wild antics i can't help but like the guy because i think Newman makes the character so charming, the time he spent with the real Graziano pays off in spades as he captures his mannerisms and style impressively .

		<fullReview>Paul Newman as Rocky Graziano, the fighter who couldn't seem to get it right, starred in the 1956 biography "Somebody Up there Likes Me."According to all our sociologists, Rocky Barbella was doomed before he started. Coming from a dysfunctional family and viewing the poverty and gangs of the local tough streets, Rocky is a hardened guy. He is full of anger. Newman is terrific displaying this anger in and out of the ring.Involved in stealing and going AWOL while in the army, Newman received a dishonorable discharge and served one year at Leavenworth. It is there that he got good boxing training and when out, he begins to fight his way to the top. In the interim, he marries a Jewish girl, Pier Angeli, who is as much Jewish as Mama Leone. I still can't figure out what kind of accent she had. Yet, Angeli does convey the kind of plain girl who would stick by her man.Veteran actor Everett Sloane portrayed his manager Irving Cohen. He is feisty and has the right temperament for the role.Just as things are going well, Rocky is trapped into trying to throw a fight. When he loses his boxing license in N.Y.C., the papers print about his dishonorable discharge. So, it's off to fight for the championship in Chicago.The ring scenes are quite authentic and provide plenty of punch. Newman does well playing a punchy fighter in a very common, yet effective performance.Harold J. Stone, who died recently at 92, is effective, although briefly, as Rocky's alcoholic father-a man who could have fought to the title but did not. Eileen Heckart, a great supporting actress, is given little material to work with, but her facial expressions best depict the desperation faced by a downtrodden family.The film does provide a knock out punch and it's well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Paul Newman at his best. It's also Sal Mineo at his best (although pitifully under-used) and the rest of the supporting cast are on top form too. It's a beautifully shot movie, intense and moody but with sudden bursts of humour that catch you off guard. Although there is no doubt a certain schmaltz factor in the Hollywood re-telling of Graziano's true story, there's no attempt to put a gloss on the proceedings or over-play the undeniable bleakness of the New York slums in which the young Rocco Barbella was raised.Those who are familiar with the ins and outs of boxing will appreciate this picture on so many levels but if, like me, you've always been a bit warey of the "noble" art of pugilism, please don't be put off by the violent subject matter. This is a story about a man who grew up with nothing and, like so many others before and since, had no other way of succeeding other than through the speed and ferocity he could put behind a right hook. It's about human emotions, a man's basic fragility but unbreakable spirit (and goodness knows, those in authority did everything possible to break Rocky's). It's also about the people who love him, his mother, wife, manager, even his brutal father, and the tough but waif-like street urchin Romolo.A word or two on Romolo (and a possible minor spoiler). He's a kid who's never had the opportunity to be anything but be bad but in Sal Mineo's beautiful and sensitive portrayal you can't help but grow fond of him and care about what happens to him. He doesn't feature at all in a large chunk of the film and I found myself fretting about what had happened to him. It's a credit to Mineo's performance that I found myself smiling with relief when I spotted him in the closing scene.If you're not familiar with Graziano's story then the brilliantly choreographed climactic fight scene will prove all the more exciting. If it was pure fiction you could be certain that Rocky would win against all the odds but as it's based on fact you can never be sure. I found myself willing him on, sitting on the edge of my seat, the fact that I was watching actors go through the motions of a fight completely lost on me.This is a movie that everyone involved with can be thoroughly proud of, especially Paul Newman. Why he or the film were never even nominated for Oscars is beyond me. But at least Joseph Ruttenberg's Academy award for best cinematography is some consolation.I haven't got "Somebody Up There Likes Me" on video yet but I'm hoping that, to quote Romolo, that's just a "temporary situation".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Hollywood" version of boxer Rocky Graziano's autobiographical life story has Paul Newman (as Mr. Graziano, née Barbella) beaten by an abusive father, growing into criminal gangland activity, and rising up to succeed in the sport of boxing. This is, of course, the inspirational plot of the "boxing picture"; and, it was very much a part of the "American Dream". Graziano was one of the biggest boxing stars of his time - according to my grandfather, the era feathered several Muhammad Ali-caliber boxers (which must have been quite exciting). Grandfather saw Mr. Newman as a good casting choice; better, in fact, than the originally cast James Dean.Mainly, "Somebody Up There Likes Me" falters under its increasingly implausible "based-on-fact" storyline. Director Robert Wise starts off well, foreshadowing his own "West Side Story" (1961). Soon, the stylization becomes hard to stomach; and, the movie, obviously, compares unfavorably with more realistic boxing films. The "love story" between Newman and Pier Angeli (as Norma) is particularly unrealistic; romantically, they act like a couple of 12-year-olds.Sal Mineo (as Romolo) heads up an enjoyable supporting cast, as Newman's friend from childhood. Certainly the film's "Best Supporting Actor", Mr. Mineo provides Newman with a warm bed, and cheers on his career. Pool-hustling Steve McQueen (as Fidel) and Michael Dante (as Shorty) are two other interesting members of Mineo's gang. Mr. McQueen is quite charismatic; and, Mr. Dante's enviable prowess with women is depicted very effectively. A slew of other notables appear; including impressionable Everett Sloane (as Irving Cohen). Eileen Heckart and Harold J. Stone are a little strange, as Rocky's parents.The photography (Joseph Ruttenberg) and writing (Ernest Lehman) are strengths. Listen up for Newman telling a smiling Mineo, "I need to get some shut-eye before the bed cools"; and, wisecracking Sloane's observation, "I should have never left the lingerie business; I was the happiest man in ladies underwear." You will have no problem reading the credit identifying PERRY COMO as the mawkish title song singer; at the time, he was probably the biggest name associated with the film. ****** Somebody Up There Likes Me (7/3/56) Robert Wise ~ Paul Newman, Pier Angeli, Sal Mineo, Everett Sloane</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie and every performance was amazing. Pier Angeli really showed range in this motion picture. Her performance was moving. I realized after seeing this film that Paul Newman was a gifted actor. I had a hard time taking my eyes of him in each scene he was in but was able to do so when Pier Angeli appeared. I didn't like his lack of effort in the Warner Brothers' motion picture The Silver Chalice but this helped change my mind about him as an actor.Both Pier Angeli and Paul Newman should have been nominated for Academy Awards for their tremendous performances.I know that James Dean was first chosen to portray Rocky Graziano but tragically he was killed in a devastating car accident. I know this from reading several of his biographies as well as the only biography that was written about Pier Angeli. I am sure Pier Angeli was thinking about James Dean in the role as she and Paul Newman were filming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring Paul Newman in one of his most interesting performances, Robert Wise's "Somebody Up There Likes Me" is a haunting piece of cinema. Newman wasn't the first choice for the career-making part of the rash and real-life champion Rocky Graziano. It's just impossible to think of James Dean as a more suitable actor, though. Come to think of it, perhaps not even Brando himself had pulled it off better than Newman, who made "Somebody Up There Likes Me" in Brando's shadow.The picture also showcases the gift of director Wise for social commentary and, ultimately, human comedy. Good boxing movies are always gritty and noirish, but not nearly often as sensitive as this one. Featuring a rare mixture of well-balanced tragic, realistic and lyrical undertones, the work of both Newman and Wise focuses on the study of its anti heroic main character, only to transcend the boxing set-up and to reach the vast realm of human condition. So Wise improved upon his then already classic work in the genre and managed to give us an almost forgotten masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome To The Ring, Mr. Newman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman arrived as a screen star with his performance as street tough Rocky Barbella, the first of many anti-hero roles for one of the best anti-heroes in Hollywood history. But "Somebody Up There Likes Me" plays more for the heartstrings as Barbella transforms himself into honest boxer (and real-life famous middleweight) Rocky Graziano.Newman looks a bit old to play Barbella in his street-kid days, and his Lower East Side diction doesn't convince however many H's he drops. But the film challenges his sturdy charisma by having him play a nasty hood, not to mention saddling him with some hoary lines when pressed to explain why he's so bad."I try tuh turn da leaf, but I can't make it!" Rocky begs his weeping mother (Eileen Heckart) early on. "Sumtin inside of me! I try, and I can't make it!"The film rises above such tinniness with performances by Newman, Heckart, and others who dare to play their parts as if their lives depended on it, as was maybe the case for a then-struggling Newman. Helping also is a surprisingly fun turn in the script. Much of the early heavy melodrama gives way agreeably to a comic sensibility that showcases Newman's sly strengths in that department.Writer Ernest Lehman was a frequent collaborator with director Robert Wise, and they seem to draw the best from each other here. Wise knows he has a melodrama, and sells it with piquant characters and on-location shooting in Barbella's Lower East Side neighborhood that makes the film feel alive. Lehman keeps his story moving while creating a romantic subplot (utilizing the delightful Pier Angeli) that for once doesn't slow down a sports movie.Make no mistake, clichés do abound. When Rocky gets in trouble, it's announced in newspapers with double banner headlines. When he has a bad dream, he starts from the bed like he got zapped in the foot. There are not one but two friendly Jewish-uncle figures ready to counsel Rocky with wise good humor when he's feeling low.I'm not sure what the point was of a lengthy subplot involving a crook from Rocky's past who tries to get him to take a dive; it was based on the historical record but is poorly integrated into the movie. But welcome to the movies anyway, Robert Loggia. It's nice to have you with us.Also welcome here future Disney star Dean Jones and King of Cool Steve McQueen, whom Wise gives a very cool intro by having him literally swipe at you with a switchblade."Somebody Up There Likes Me" is famous both for who is in it and who wasn't: This was supposed to be James Dean's next role before his fatal crash. I wonder how the gentler, anemic Dean would have done playing self-described "scum of the slums" Barbella/Graziano. Certainly he could not have sold the climactic bout with Tony Zale as Newman does with his scowling brio, or carried off the moonier, playful moments that come to define Graziano in the second half."Somebody Up There" may not be perfect, but it delivers a warm and resonant introduction to Newman and a boxing film still punching its weight 56 years on.</fullReview>

A poor Italian in New York in the bad years of the post depression decade. His mother forced his father to stop fighting. He lived in gangs even before he could walk. He got in jail more than he should have. He was drafted into the army on the most voluntary obligation possible. He got discharged dishonorably and was sent to one more prison term and there he was noticed as a fighter and was trained into boxing by some military chap who was seeing millions behind him. He even fell in love when he shouldn't have and he missed a fight. In one word he was a loser. And yet he will manage to get to the top and the championship. In those 1950s they did not hesitate on the clichés and the simple scenarios and it worked. It is true they were launching a brand new young actor and that one knew how to make things worth seeing and watching. The film is quite good, in black and white, for his time and worth seeing still today though of course slightly too slow and sentimental, but well we cannot always have modern special effect saturated films all the time.

		<shortDescription>Newman's First Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Somebody Up There Likes Me" is the second film Paul Newman starred as leading actor and the first to become a hit making him a great movie star. Here he plays the legendary boxer Rocky Graziano in his long and very difficult journey to be a recognized boxer. The movie begins showing his tough childhood in Bronx where he participated in robberies, and then went to prison because of his long list of crimes. After he went out of prison, he is drafted by the U.S. Army, but runs away. His luck seems to change when he discover that he can get fast money winning boxing fights. His first friend is Irving Cohen (Everett Sloane, the eternal Mr. Bernstein from "Citizen Kane"), who became his coach, arranging more and more fights to the young talented man. Just like Rocky Balboa who finds Adrienne, suddenly Graziano finds his first love, a young Jewish girl called Norma (Pier Angeli), who like him very much but can't stand his boxing.But the biggest challenge to Rocky isn't in the fighting but it's something more deep. A guy (Robert Loggia) that he met in prison reappears and then makes an offer to the boxer: he must lose a important fight. Why? Because his past on robbery and in the Army may be revealed to the public that really likes this guy. Rocky's always battling with himself trying to understand why bad things happens to him over and over again. OK, you might find the plot very obvious, something that you've seen before, but it has it's good moments and some originality. Newman's performance is a great asset to the film. He is conflicted, lost, sympathetic, angry and yet the audience always like him. Even that the boxing scenes doesn't work so well like in "Raging Bull" it's still worth watching the story of a man who's been beaten too much but don't give up so easily. Pier Angeli, Everett Sloane, Sal Mineo (Rocky's friend), Eileen Heckart and Robert Loggia (in his film debut) are very good in strong supporting roles. Pay attention to Steve McQueen participation as Fidel, one of the members of the gang in the beginning of the movie. Well directed by Robert Wise. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot.Frankly, the movie made me yearn for the days of John Garfield and his epic struggles to escape the slums, (Body and Soul {1947}, Humoresque (1946), for example. No Garfield-like shading here. Instead, Newman's Graziano acts like he's on super-charge the whole time, yelling his lines, rushing frantically to and fro, while mannerisms abound as though the shadow of James Dean still looms large. This may be the only time in his marvelous career that the usually restrained actor goes way over the top. I don't know what the real Graziano was like, but I doubt he was this antic version of the Energizer Bunny.Then too, boxing movies have always been prone to falsifying the action. After all, staples of real matches such as jabbing, defense, and feeling out your opponent take up valuable screen time and are not very exciting. So even the best boxing films, such as The Set-Up (1949), are prone to substitute artless clubbing for artful punching. Here, the gap is in real evidence.The movie itself is routine, at best. Clichés abound, but there are several notable performances?Stone as the fearsome father; Heckart as the long-suffering mom; and the always reliable Everitt Sloane. Also, the movie benefits from the many New York City locations, along with some well-done studio street scenes.Though popularly received at the time (1956) when the name Graziano was still widely known, on second viewing the shortcomings are unfortunately all too apparent. Fortunately, however, actor Newman appears to have learned his lesson, which was after all, only his second feature-length film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has everything about the era going for it - crisp black and white photography, a flawed hero scrapping his way to respectability, and Perry Como singing the title song as the picture opens. I never knew what this film was about until I got more deeply into Paul Newman's work, and until I saw it tonight, I couldn't picture him in the role of boxing champ Rocky Graziano. I recall catching Graziano in any number of appearances in variety shows of the Fifties and Sixties, and Newman's casting just didn't seem to fit. But there's a lot to be said about his performance here, gritty and realistic in every respect. I couldn't help thinking of another Rocky, the one made famous by Sylvester Stallone in his own Oscar winning film made twenty years later.Not knowing the real Graziano's history, I can only go by the former boxer's own endorsement of the film as being the real deal. If even half of his story depicted in the film is accurate, you'd have to wonder how he ever caught the breaks to turn his life around. Credit future wife Norma (Pier Angeli) for providing that inspiration and keeping him on track.Film fans are in for some cool surprises here, like Sal Mineo and Steve McQueen as members of Rocky's unofficial gang as a youth, Everett Sloane as his eventual boxing manager, and Harold J. Stone as Rocky's pathetic father with a huge chip on his shoulder for a failed boxing career of his own. I've mostly seen Stone as an adequate character actor in various TV Westerns, but he really gives a strong portrayal here that impressed me with it's range. As for Rocky's mom, I don't believe I've ever seen Eileen Heckart before; her jail-house scene with Rocky seemed to provide him with the motivation he needed to make the crucial pivot in his life that eventually saved him.As for the boxing, there really didn't seem to be that much of it, taking a back seat to the personal story of a man who rose above his circumstances. Graziano's full career of eighty three matches resulting in a record of 67 wins, 10 losses and six draws isn't even hinted at, though the picture does convince you that he was one of the fiercest punchers of all time. It would have been neat if Rocky had made a cameo in the picture at some point, and I had to wonder why someone didn't think of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After appearing in the disastrous film THE SILVER CHALICE (1954) and the average MGM loan-out THE RACK (1956), Paul Newman finally landed his breakout role in this fast-paced biopic of boxer Rocky Graziano. The part was originally to be played by James Dean as his follow-up to 1956's GIANT, but that icon's untimely death paved the way for Newman to step into the role and become a star. Newman tackles the role with such an intense aura of vitality that can only come from an artist who hungrily wants to prove his own mettle. With his muscular little body and totally method approach, Newman is completely convincing as Graziano (arguably more so than Dean would have been), and impressively does not shy away from the grittier and less likable aspects of Graziano's character.Director Robert Wise perfectly captures the essence of New York in the first half of the century, which makes it seem even more inevitable that he would go on to helm WEST SIDE STORY (1961) a few years later. The film chases the sometimes hot-headed Graziano's rise from street thug, criminal, army misfit, boxing champion, and family man, and Wise keeps things moving along at a steady and coherent rate. The Oscar-winning set design and cinematography are both superb, and (in addition to Newman) there are also memorable performances from Pier Angeli, Everett Sloane, and Sal Mineo. Forgive me for the lame summary line, but SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME still packs a punch!</fullReview>

The acting is good, Newman is terrific, he never stops moving, and the movie itself never slows down. For a biopic, it presents its hero as flawed from the outset; the script is good, the dialogue is fresh, and the boxing scenes are, for a 1950's film, pre-Raging Bull, pre-Rocky, surprisingly convincing. Rocky Graziano wasn't a particularly refined technician in the ring; he was a grim, determined street fighter. He had no style, and that's how Paul Newman plays him. The big match at the climax of the film is presented in enough detail to show one boxer just beginning to tire as the other gets his second wind. Paul Newman is great as the main character, but the other actors, the writing and direction and the production itself rise to the level of his performance.</fullReview>

Stone is Nick Barbella.Both terrific.Sal Mineo does steady job as the juvenile delinquent Romolo.The great actor Robert Loggia does his screen debut as Frankie Peppo.There are also Steve McQueen playing Fidel and Dean Jones (his debut) playing Private in Rocky's Tent at Army Base.Russ Conway who passed away this month plays Capt.Grifton.The fighting scenes in this movie are terrific.There are some similarities with boxing movies that came later.Raging Bull telling the story of Jake La Motta seems to have been influenced by this movie.And I did see some of Stallone's Rocky especially in the relationship between Graziano and the shy Norma.Norma does seem a bit like Talia Shire's Adrian.Of course, like in all good sport movies the sport itself is in the background.It's all about this person who became a fighter beating all obstacles.Somebody Up There Likes Me is a classic when it comes to sport movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and worth the time to watch. I only write this comment, because this movie has the worst, absolutely WORST, theme song. Perry Como does the Italian ballad thing, but his song is just awful. So much so, that while you watch the opening credits, you are very tempted to turn this movie off because any movie with such poor music may very well make other production decisions just as bad. Luckily, if you fight the urge, you will see a very good movie and hear no more music until the end credits. Newman does the lost soul redeemed through woman role very well and all is believable. Pier Angeli is a sad Hollywood story, and this movie is one of her best performances. She has that delicate fragile presence on screen that contrasts so well with the Newman boxing thug image. Beauty and the Beast themes always have the element that there is a threat of danger to beauty, but clearly in this movie,Pier's character is the leveling agent for this relationship, and she excels in this role. Rocky Graziano is the American dream, work hard, channel your talents, trust on those who love you, and all that America has to offer is yours. Of course it helps if you're white and male, but what the heck, this isn't brain surgery or social comment, it's a movie, and not a bad one at that.</fullReview>

Rocky Grazione is such a man, good for nothing, not even the army till a day comes someone convince him to try in the boxingsport. Everything becomes brilliant till Newman is confronted with the mob who tell him whether he has to loose or to win... "Somebody up there likes me" isn't the first movie about boxing but it's a movie that has more to do with raging Bull rather than Rocky (not that the first part was so bad at all) and Newman plays one of his best roles ever (they had James Dean in mind to play this role).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember, before you judge this film harshly, it was a biopic, and that meant there were limits as to where the story could go. Unlike for example Rocky, where the only limits to what he could do or whom he could fight were self-imposed by Stallone himself. Late his career, Newman became known for his "H" series (Hud, Harper, Hombre) and tended to play every part the same way. But in this biopic, we see a very unique character emerge -- a guy with a natural knockout punch that will do whatever he has to do to avoid authority figures -- and right off the top of the film, the audience relates to the character and enjoys the exposition. Especially endearing are the courting scenes with Pier Angeli. Newman is so subtle in these that you almost feel like he would rather be in the ring with a brawler than trying to tell his girl how he feels. Not perfect but very few fight movies are. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

Newman is perhaps too intellectual too "actor's studio" ,but it's a workmanlike job.On the other hand,Sal Mineo is wasted ,the low point of the movie.His scenes do not hang well with the others.Now,the young generation knows -or should- where SS stole his 1977 blockbuster.Even Adrian's and Paulie's characters resemble Pier Angeli's Mrs Graziano and Everett Sloane's Cohen.This Rocky is the one and only one,even if Newman would later be surpassed, not by another Rocky ,but by Robert De Niro 's "raging bull".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somebody up there likes this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that I've known for a long time, but never got a chance to watch. Somebody Up There Likes Me is a film about the true story of middleweight champion prizefighter Rocky Graziano, played by heavyweight actor/movie icon Paul Newman. Rememberred as Newman's debutfilm (but actually his third) this film is a hell of a ride and a 'must see' for cinefiles and movielovers.Director Robert Wise creates a work of intense realism and humanity. The streets of New York; the off-beat domestic social relations and envirements; the underground world of boxing; most of all Newman's impressive performance as Rocky, are all masterfully shaped into a piece of raw truth and human behaviour. Elia Kazan and Brando opened the door to this American cinema realism with Streetcar Named Desire ('51) and On The Waterfront ('54), but this movie is definitely one to mention in that category. Wise managed to create an even more famous movie seven years later with West Side Story ('61) in which he explores the New York streets and ganglife even further, but of course in the context of a musical - the coolest musical ever made, perhaps.Also nice to mention is the fact that a young Steve McQueen playes a gangmember of Rocky's gang in the early days. Newman and McQueen later became 'friendly' rivals which resulted in the fact that they didn't do Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid ('69) together on account of the billing of their names. They couldn't agree which name should get top billing. The one movie in which they finally worked together is of course The Towering Inferno ('74), where McQueen got first billing but Newman's name was placed a little higher..! (watch the movie and/or poster) A concept that I first noticed on this film, and later saw again and again in other films with two major stars - Righteous Kill ('08) for example.Rocky was Paul Newman's first great performance, and lead the way to even more iconic and masterful performances in films like The Hustler ('61/Rober Rossen), Hud ('62/Martin Ritt), Cool Hand Luke ('67/Stuart Rosenburg) and Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid ('69/George Roy Hill). Newman of course died recently (2008) and will remain a personal favorite of mine; a true actor, icon and cool guy. All the films I mentioned are personal treasures to me, and continue to be profound and touching examples of truly great cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be the champ that I wasn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the breakout movie for Paul Newman after the disastrously bad "Silver Chalice" that was released the year before. The role of Rocky Gaziano in "Sombody Up There Likes Me" was actually meant for James Dean but since he was tragically killed in a car crash before filming the part fell into Newman's lap and the rest is movie history.An incorrigible youth growing up in the tough Lower East Side of Manhattan Rocco Barbella, later changed to Rocky Graziano, was in and out of reformatories like your average young man attended grade and high school. As Rocky grew into his late teens he became so violent and uncontrollable he was sent to do hard time at the notorious Ryker's Isand prison that only taught him how to use his fists in order to be top dog in the pen. It also was to help Rocky get out of the helpless world that he made for himself in later becoming a professional fighter and middleweight world champion.Being a member of the 10th Street gang Rocky together with his fellow gang members Romolo &amp; Fidel, Sal Mineo &amp; Steve McQueen, were already bad news whenever they showed up in the neighborhood looking for kicks. Rocky could thank his lucky stars that he ended up being drafted into the US Army that in the end not only saved his life unlike most of his fellow 10th Streeter's, like Fidel, who ended up either dead on the mean streets of NYC or in the Sing Sing electric chair.Playing Mr. New York though guy to the hilt Rocky ended up belting his commanding officer Capt. Woodhope, William Sage, out cold when he tried to knock some sense and discipline into his hard skull.This lead Rocky to go AWOL and while on the lamb he ended up in Stillman's Gym in midtown Manhattan with a new name, Graziano, and a new profession, besides being a professional criminal, becoming a professional prize fighter. Rocky was finally tracked down by the army and FBI and sent to Leavenworth Federal Prison for desertion and assaulting an officer. It was in Leavenworth that Rocky finally got a hold of himself and learned to control his violent temper by using his fists, especially his dynamite right, in the ring instead of on the streets or in the local neighborhood bars and pool halls.Being managed by Irving Cohen, Everett Stone, Rocky shot to the top and within two years of his release from prison he was a top contender for the middleweight champion of the world. It was also during that time that Rocky met, through his sister, fell in love with and married the sweet and sensitive young Jewish girl Norma, Pier Angeli, who was anything but thrilled with his career as a professional pugilist. The most emotional and explosive scene in the movie , to me at least, had nothing to do with Rocky's many fights in and out of the ring. This involved the scene between Rocky and his alcoholic and washed up, as a boxer, old man Nick Barbella, Harold J. Stone. Nick always was abusive to Rocky and may well have been the reason for Rocky to become the violent and unruly person that he was. Just before his rematch with champion Tony Zale Court Shepard, Rocky just felt that he lost it and made his way back to NYC, the match was to be held in Chicago, to get away from it, the fight, and everything else his wife three year old daughter Audery, Angela Carthwright, and manager Irving Cohen.Going back to his parents house in the Lower East Side Rocky was confronted by his dad Nick and the explosive exchange between father and son, that left Nick sobbing like a baby, finally brought the two together like nothing ever did before. Rocky finally realized that Nick's abuse of him was the results of his own failures in life. And it was just there and then that Rocky decided that unlike his father he'll confront his demons, in and out of the boxing ring, instead of running away from them. It was that new attitude that eventually, or in the movie, had Rocky overcome one of the most murderous assault a boxer was ever to encountered in the ring from the fists of Tony Zale. With his left eye closed shut and barley able to stand on his feet Rocky ended up knocking Zale out cold, with Rocky on the verge of being knocked out himself, in the sixth round of their unforgettable July 16, 1947 championship fight. P.S Just the year before on September 27, 1946 in the first match between challenger Rocky Graziano and champion Tony Zale at New York's Yankee Stadium the reverse happened. Looking like he was a sure winner Rocky got caught, as he was about to knock him out, by a powerful punch to the midsection by Tony Zale that not only knocked the wind out of him but kept him grounded to the mat as Rocky was counted out by the fight referee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's Sly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine my surprise when I caught this film on AMC and realized it was about a boxer named Rocky. Suddenly my eyes were opened and I realized that perhaps Sly Stallone took more than just creative liberty when forming the screenplay for his 1976 film? Although Sly was actually influenced by another boxer named Rocky according to the DVD, nevertheless the similarities are rather eerie.Both films feature the characters of Rocky (in this case Granziano instead of Balboa) as having a background in crime / thug work. Only the outcome for Rocky Granziano (Paul Newman) is more serious.In "Somebody Up There Likes Me," Rocky is tossed into jail, where he suffers at the hands of the wardens and causes disturbances because he refuses to become disciplined.When Rocky finally gets out of jail he vows to start his life over...soon he begins boxing to make quick pocket money, and he manages to become a famous name in the sport - never seeming to lose a fight.Newman's performance here is key to the film. For such a young star he delivers a raw, fascinating and intense performance that is nothing short of believable.Robert Wise directs wisely (ha, pardon the pun) and keeps some of the unnecessary stuff to a minimum...focusing instead on Rocky himself and those directly influencing him - or being influenced by him.Overall I found this to be a surprising little hidden gem and I'll never look at Sly's version quite the same way again. (Although it's still a great movie, too.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revealing drama of a truly violent sport.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it amazing that for a sport I truly abhor that there are so many great movies about professional fighting-from "Golden Boy", "The Set-Up", "Body and Soul" and "Champion" to "The Harder They Fall" and the much later classic "Rocky", these movies delve into the psychology of the men who turn usually from the violence of the streets to end up getting paid for it. The young Paul Newman is a unique choice to be cast as the young Italian street thug who spends time in prison, gets dishonorably discharged while in basic training for World War II, yet ends up the prize-fighting champion of the world. This story of one man's rise over adversity has been told so many times, but this one avoids being manipulative in trying to win our sympathy for him. Initially, there is no sympathy for him as you see his horrendous series of street crimes, but what will win you over is his desire to change his situation, and ultimately himself. Newman, still looking far from Italian in his Chico Marx hairstyle, manages to be convincing, so eventually you forget about his famous blonde hair and blue eyes. Still in the infancy of his film career, Newman was cast in several "thug" roles ("The Desperate Hours" on Broadway and "The Helen Morgan Story" for example) before switching to troubled romantic heroes.Harold J. Stone and Eileen Heckart are outstanding as his troubled parents who seem so far apart that you instantly understand why Rocky has turned out the way he is. Stone, being cold throughout most of the film as the embittered father who was forced to give up his own career as a boxer, is first seen brutalizing the young Rocky (Terry Rangno) who breaks a shop window with boxing gloves in it, after which the cop chasing him gives up, claiming that the boy'll end up on death row at Sing Sing anyway. Heckart's mama is so grasping in a loving manner that when she finally tells Rocky that she's prepared to disown him, it is almost heartbreaking. In a year full of four outstanding movie performances, stage legend Heckart shows why she could steal every scene she ever played. Recognized for an Oscar Nomination for that year's "The Bad Seed", her grieving mother in that could be sister to this character, yet her supportive friend in "Miracle in the Rain" and the earthy waitress in "Bus Stop" show her incredible range. Heckart could take the most pathetic actors and make them identifiable.Young Sal Mineo manages to look the same throughout the film (which takes place obviously over a long period of time) but his intensity is tremendous. The gritty cinematography captures the rough lower east side, and the violence of that neighborhood (overlooked in the fun but unrealistic "Bowery Boys" movies) gives the movie a "film noir" edge. The fight scenes are truly intense and show the brutality of the sport, as well as the outrageous fans who clamor for more carnage as the blows continue to get harder and the desperation of the fighters explode. As the young wife who struggles with her own conflicting feelings towards Rocky's profession, Pier Angeli has the difficult task of taking her character past the obvious direction. She manages to instill her with a variety of strengths, weaknesses and most importantly, the love and caring that Rocky needs to feel. An important scene between Angeli and Heckart is the key to stressing how she rises above a potentially one dimensional meaningless role.Director Robert Wise, who so brilliantly directed the prize-fighting "B" feature "The Set-Up", increases the intensity here. There are many elements utilized in his treatment of tough teen New Yorkers that would be evident in his film version of the musical masterpiece "West Side Story".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before There Was "Rocky," Rocky Was There in "Somebody Up There Likes Me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Robert Wise's second movie about boxing, "Somebody Up There Likes Me" is just as gritty as his earlier movie "The Set Up" with Robert Ryan. "Somebody Up There Likes Me" is a biography of 'the hard knocks' life that real-life boxer Rocky Graziano rebounded from to become a media celebrity in the ring. Paul Newman steps outside of his usual easy going demeanor to play Rocky as a tough guy who got a lot of bad breaks, especially from his pugilist pop who socked him around as a kid, before things got better for him.Indeed, this MGM movie is a formulaic biography with all the right elements and some contrivances to boot, but Wise directs it well, particularly the boxing scenes, and he benefits from a strong cast, especially McQueen in a pre "Blob" role as a juvenile delinquent. Rocky really had a terrible upbringing and a mean-spirited dad (Harold J. Stone at his meanest), but he manages to hold on long enough to win in the end. He suffers through prison as well as a military court-martial with a dishonorable discharge. Gripping black &amp; white photography gives this movie a memorable look and the skyline shots of New York with the bridges looming up in the distance over the tops of the tenements are evocative.Pier Angeli, Everett Sloane, Sal Mineo and Eileen Herckart round out a solid cast. There are is inevitable scene where Rocky has to refuse taking a dive. He winds up behind bars early on as a rebellious youth. Newman proves that he can be as good if not better than Marlon Brando here as he portrays a character who isn't the brightest bulb in the lighting system. Definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

Nowadays that refers to useless crap, but I mean it in a 1950s sense. Proper entertainment. Leaves you feeling happy but with that little something extra that you take away from it. A true all rounder.Brilliant. Don't think. Watch.Well so much for keeping it short. It turns out that I need 10 lines. Well on we go: Ever wonder where Stallone got the idea for Rocky, I mean the guy doesn't look too bright you know yet he did it, he made one of the best movies of all time, well in a way this is the original. The down and out bum fighter, fighting to pay the bills and buy some food, gets a chance at the big time, gets a chance to make something of himself, make his family proud. Yet his path isn't without obstacles, from the mafia to romantic commitments. Add some very humorous and original 'fun for all the family' jokes and you have yourself one hell of a film.</fullReview>

The play is a biography put to film giving some glimpses, it is claimed, into the life of a famous boxer.As much about about his struggles and his tormented life than his "sport", though there is a climactic seemingly realistic fight scene in the picture. Over 50 years since the movie came out yet far superior to many films that are made currently. I happened across it on Turner Classic Movies which I subscribe to on cable, so well done to them for showing this classic. Modern film makers could learn a lot from this picture especially the screen writing which is thoughtful, intelligent yet often amusing. I was engrossed throughout and it deserves at least:8+ from 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman got his second shot at stardom with this film, two years after the abysmal failure that was "The Silver Chalice". Newman helped define the tough yet vulnerable 50's male rebel persona in this fine. You could say he offered a mixture of Brando's swagger, Dean's youthful schoolboy and Clift's wounded soul. But Newman, as he has proved in a career spanning over 50 years, a career that has seen his potential filled far better than his contemporaries, was no mere copycat. He is a terrific actor, and while his performance in "Somebody" may lack the brilliance of his later efforts ("Hud" comes to mind), he is in fine form and convincing as Rocky Graziano.I often find that most boxing films are pretty much the same. Kid rises from the wrong side of the tracks to fame in the ring, gets a sweet and pretty girlfriend, and then has to contend with gangsters and his own demons before he makes his obligatory big comeback. Its a pretty standard formula, and "Somebody" sticks to it in telling Graziano's real-life story, but its also the stuff of good dramatics, and quite entertaining. Robert Wise proved he could handle the ring in "The Set-Up", and here he films some more brilliant fight sequences. I like how Rocky's gritty upbringing is conveyed, and the film has a great sense of verisimilitude. I also really liked Italian actress Pier Angeli in the role of Newman's faithful wife. While Miss Angeli is now best known to classic film fans as allegedly James Dean's girlfriend before his death (she suicided at the age of 39), she was also a welcome screen presence. Photogenic and lovely, she wasn't a great actress exactly but she was very convincing in this role. Few other actresses could halt Paul Newman with a slap to his face. They are perfectly matched in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest directed movies I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is with boxing movies but a lot of the movies involving the subject are among the finest movies. Perhaps its because of the complexity of the main characters, that are tough but yet always likable in a way. I just can never get enough of these movies.What I really loved about this movie was the way it got directed. Robert Wise really knew how to handle the story and actors in this one. Every sequences is basically made with a lot of class and professionalism put into it. The story is filled with all of the cloches you could expect. I mean, if you have seen a couple of boxing movies before, then nothing that happens in this movie should come as a surprise to you. But because everything is done and handled in such a good way the movie is a great and an original as well to watch, despite being formulaic. It's also a movie with lots of pace. The story pretty much covers most of the life of famous boxer Rocky Graziano, so basically every 10 minutes the movie is set at a different location or time period. This often doesn't work out for biopics and makes the movies overfull to watch, this is especially the case with modern biopics though and for this movie it works out just fine, which is not only due to the directing approach of the story and characters but also not in the least thanks to the acting performances.This is one great role from Paul Newman. Normally he's just he pretty boy, or the old man in his recent movies but in this movie he shows that he also convincingly can play a real tough trouble making character. It's an early role from Newman and actually one of his first movie roles out of his career. The same goes for the later turned stars Pier Angeli, Sal Mineo, Robert Loggia and even Steve McQueen in a very small role. McQueen and Newman would much later star again together in the movie "The Towering Inferno", in equally big roles this time.It's also a great looking movie, especially with its cinematography and it's editing also makes sure that the movie at all times is a well flowing one. The movie provides a great and interesting look into '30's and 1940's life in New YorkIt's a movie about the rise and fall and rise again of a boxer with all of the usual drama and clichés involved. It's nevertheless an interesting and a just plain great movie to watch, due to its directing and acting performances. I now also see were Martin Scorsese got his inspiration from for "Raging Bull". It's a movie that's pretty much made in the same style and even the way the boxing sequences are shot show some striking similarities.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's take on Rocky Graziano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman gives a rather wonderful performance as boxer Rocky Graziano in this sometimes sappy, sometimes gritty 1950's biopic. Newman gives his all, with lower East Side accent and convincing physical prowess in a demanding role, which went a long way towards making him a star. Of course, it didn't hurt at all that, viewed from certain angles, you could swear they were using his face as a model in ancient Greece for some of the more beautiful statues they produced. How could he not have become a movie star? With some people, its just destiny! Pier Angeli plays his mousy, patient wife and is okay. Sal Mineo shows up as a delinquent (surprise casting there!) and the great character actor Everett Sloane (Citizen Kane) shows up to steal scenes as Graziano's manager. Steve McQueen is easy to spot in a bit role , his first real role in films. He worked again with Newman 18 years later in "The Towering Inferno" and for director Robert Wise again 10 years later in "The Sand Pebbles".I liked the location shooting in New York City a lot, and Wise does a good job keeping the story moving at a good clip. The climactic fight scene keeps you riveted. Some of the ethnic stereotypes are grating in our present PC world, and there are more than a few clichés, but all in all the film is good entertainment of its time, professionally handled by all concerned. My least favorite part was probably the quite sappy title ballad sung by Perry Como.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..................AT THE INTERSECTING film genres of the Fight Film and the Biopic............THERE WAS A fine, major motion picture called SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME.YES, WE TEND to give this movie, a sort of multi-classified production, one that was truly difficult to pigeon-hole. It has a certain economy of celluloid story telling that wastes not any valuable footage. Yet rather than this frugal approach's to footage usage viewed as being somehow "cheap", it was rather a testimony to the total professionalism of its Director, the mow legendary Robert Wise (1914-2005).IN CONSIDERING THIS film's being a story of a recently still active fighter, it was virtually a contemporary story. The years covered are from Rocky's home-life in the mid and late 1930's through his disgraced record in the WWII Army and up to his career in the Prize Ring (1940-52). All of that would be considered current and recent, not in any way even near being a period piece. (Contrast Cinderella MAN; which was made 60 years after the fact).WHILE THE STORY is certainly not a Pollyanna story, it is based in fact and probably was worse in real life. The movie does seem to have a definite morally anchored theme. In effect, it is a success story. "Inner City Slum Kid Beats Odds-Succeeds In Life!:, would be a proper headline in its description.IN EVALUATING THE film's value as a story with a moral and one of entertainment value, we are immediately reminded of Martin Scorscasce's RAGING BULL. This is a great comparison; inasmuch as the two men were contemporaries in life, as well as in their Ring careers.THE FIRST OBVIOUS deviation is that whereas our reviewee today was a film of recent happenings and RAGING BULL was made some 40 years after Jake La Motta's days in the Squared Circle. Other than that, we find that the two movies are Polar opposites in many respects.WHERE THE CENTRAL theme of our Graziano story is how Rocky's Boxing career was his salvation, in the La Motta story, we see how the years in the Ring wore him down; much as an intensively accelerated life of working ages and ultimately puts the finishing touches on anyone's life.WE MUST COMMENT on how the uncontrollable events of life altered MGM's plans for this picture. As we all know, The lead was slated as a starring role for James Dean. He was killed in a car accident prior to the start of the production. This immediately altered plans for the amenities of its mounting. It was immediately reduced from a Technicolor production to glorious Black &amp; White. Extensive location shooting was replaced with in-studio, sound stage filming.THE BUSINESS ABOUT going to B &amp; W over Color can be debated; as to whether or not it really hampered the story's impact. One need only contrast various Fight Pictures, which were most effective and satisfying in either case. Just think of and compare RAGING BULL (B&amp;W) with ROCKY and/or Cinderella MAN (Color).AS FOR THE selection of Paul Newman as the lead, we cannot and do not have any complaint. Mr. Newman was always the consummate film actor and could thespiate with the best of 'em. It would have been very interesting to have seen the tragically doomed young James Dean in the role, but it just wasn't in the cards! WE MUST SAY just a little about the picture's theme song; which was "Somebody Up There Likes Me!". It was sung by Perry Como.WELL, THAT SHOULD be quite enough about Perry's gig, Schultz!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was growing up, Rocky Grazino had a brand of sausage in our local grocery store. I did not know the story behind the face on the package. It took me a long time to see it.After watching this film, it appears Sylvester Stallone stole his story for Rocky from this real life Rocky. He proved how bad Hollywood marketing was in the 1950's as if this one had been titled Rocky, it would have made more money.The real Rocky G endorsed this as a pretty much accurate account of his life. I am not sure if James Dean would have done a better job than Paul Newman does here. Dean died in a car accident a few months before this was filmed.This one does have a lot of the same props as Stallone's effort but in this case there is more realism. This real Rocky from New York City was a hero to kids and fans alike. He got involved with scandal and he grew up in a rough gang neighborhood. He is portrayed as a high strung but honest worker who deserves a lot of respect. This movie gives him that. At least Stallone's Rocky punched hanging beef. Grazianos sausage is not in evidence here.</fullReview>

The Rocky franchise is huge, however it is incredible to watch this film from 1956, I at first thought that Paul Newman was imitating Stalone and then I remembered it's a film from 1956. So Stalone acted the part almost exactly right down to the accent. Just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Newman Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) *** (out of 4) Paul Newman shot to stardom playing Rocky Graziano, a troubled New York man who spent time in prison before finally getting his act straight and finding his way out through boxing.Having seen the majority of Newman's work it's rather amazing that he was given another chance after the disastrous THE SILVER CHALICE. I've honestly never seen such an improvement in acting from one role to the next but there's no denying that Newman is simply wonderful here and really makes you believe he is this character. A lot of times those thick, over-the-top New York accents are just downright bad or obnoxious yet Newman perfectly captures the character and especially the attitude.Again, the main reason to see this is for the terrific performance by Newman who is simply wonderful in the role of Graziano. There's not a single second where you don't feel as if you're watching the real guy and it's pretty amazing how well Newman was able to capture this troubled and angry man. Newman really does a fantastic job throughout the picture no matter what type of anger he is displaying. The supporting performances are also quite good with Pier Angeli, Everett Sloane and Eileen Heckart also doing fine work. It's also pretty cool getting to see Steve McQueen and Sal Mineo in early roles.Robert Wise does a very good job with the direction and I especially loved the look and style of the picture. The opening sequences in the slums of New York look and feel just like the film noirs that the director made at RKO. The film does have some flaws and that includes us seeing too much of Rocky's "bad" stuff. We somewhat get beat over the head with his various bad adventures but there's still no question that this is a must see.</fullReview>

Graziano could have easily given up and fell back to his old ways, but he hung in there and won the Middleweight Championship.New is perfect as the fighter and you could see it in every move he made. You forgot that it was Newman and you saw a real fighter. Pier Angeli was also marvelous as his wife. She supported him and fought hard to keep him on the right path. The movie was a perfect comeback for both of them.Capably directed by Robert Wise, the Ernest Lehman script keep you interested throughout. The film won Oscars for art direction-set decoration, and for cinematography, and got a nomination for editing.A great sports movie with a great actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overcoming Extremely Long Odds - Newman's Unbeatable in this Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to his second autobiography published in 1981, Rocky Graziano was paid $200,000 for the rights to make this movie. Perry Como does a memorable job singing the theme while Sammy Cahn wrote the lyrics.The story portrays Rocco Barbella, a young Italian boy who grew up on the East Side of New York during the 1920's and 1930's. During this era life was extremely difficult for Italian immigrant families as they could not get decent jobs which were already taken by other ethnic nationalities who had preceded their arrival in America.Young Rocco was always loyal to his family and especially his mother (played by Eileen Heckart.) Long before his teen years, faced with an abusive alcoholic father and extreme poverty, Rocco learns the way of the streets. He becomes a bona fide hoodlum in the process. In reality, many of his friends and enemies from this era wound up in Sing Sing's electric chair.Eileen Heckart plays a superb role as Ma Ida Barbella, a religious, worry stricken mother who refuses to give up on her difficult son. Harold Stone plays an excellent role as Rocky's father Nick Barbella, whose main resolve is in a wine bottle.We see Rocky as he finally hits rock bottom, a point from which the only way is back up. Coupled with his girlfriend and future bride Norma (played by Pier Angeli,) Rocky takes on the world of professional boxing and shows a talent with great potential. (It should be noted that Rocky was rated as one of the best punchers in middleweight history by Ring Magazine.) I'm critical about some of the early fight scenes; but in all fairness the ones toward the end are extremely well done.The most important thing to remember about the story is that Rocky "turned the leaf" against huge odds; and not doing so might have landed him in the death house at Sing Sing. And so it follows that Somebody up there really did like him ! Great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky Graziano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise directed this biographical account of Rocky Graziano, from his troubled youth as petty thief and hoodlum that led to his imprisonment, to his later release, where his big plans were intercepted by his prompt drafting into the army, where he proves just as undisciplined, and goes AWOL. He later uses his fighting skills in the boxing ring, where he finally finds the long sought-after success he has wanted, even finding love with a woman named Norma(Pier Angeli) Until one day when Rocky's past comes back to threaten him, and jeopardize his career...Paul Newman is fine as Rocky, with solid direction and interesting story of a not always likable lead character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starkly compelling tour de force by director Robert Wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of Paul Newman, although I know he's a good actor...just not my cup of tea. So, it was with little enthusiasm that I finally sat down to watch this film. Wow! What a great movie! So starkly real and compelling. And, although Newman gives a very fine performance, I'd have to say I give the credit, overall, to Robert Wise, the director. And oddly enough, when watching it, I saw obvious parallels in the opening scenes with "West Side Story', only to realize later that Wise directed that film, also.In particular, the early scenes of the film, where we learn what a juvenile delinquent Rocky was, are very powerful...although in this portion of the film, Newman is clearly too old for the part. However, I'm old enough to remember Rocky Graziano (although later when he had become a television star of sorts), and it was difficult to imagine Newman even portraying Graziano...but he did it extremely well. I walked away from this film more impressed with Newman than I had ever been in the past.Several other actors deserve mention here, also. Eileen Heckart as Graziano's "ma" turns in a stunning performance as a beaten down old woman living in the tenements. Sal Mineo as Graziano's young pal is always worth a mention. And, Everett Sloan, as the boxing manager is very good here.ANother thing worth mentioning here is that I am a bit of a boxing fan myself, and I watch most matches that are broadcast on HBO. The fight scenes here are the most realistic I have ever seen in a movie, and although we know they were throwing their punches, it's my guess that the actors were pretty sore after filming.And, last but not least, you have a superb Perry Como vocal -- one of his most powerful and dramatic performances -- in the opening and closing title song. What more could one want for that era?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And a left, and a right, and a cliché!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get the bad stuff out of the way quickly because the movie is worth watching.I didn't believe the pop psychology for a minute. An Italian father who is a wino? Eileen Heckart as an Italian mother? Hatred for authority because Rocky was beaten up by his drunken father? Rocky Barbella too shy around girls to date them? Nope.This is a pretty dated movie, all things considered, especially considering the insipid inspirational title song by Perry Como. A gang tough from New York City gets into all kinds of trouble with the police and the army and the boxing commission and finally rises to the top by clobbering Tony Zale and winning the middleweight championship. Local boy makes good.The fight scenes -- and there aren't that many -- are about standard for Hollywood. When a fight begins they come out swinging. Like -- right away. Nobody feels anybody else out. Nobody dances around and thinks. And every punch either misses by a mile or lands smack on target. THUMP THUMP THUMP. Any one of those blows would stun an elephant but the bout consists of nothing but these sledgehammers. WHOMP, and the recipient shrugs it off.Some of the supporting parts are pretty bad. Eileen Heckart has done some nice work -- elsewhere, not here. Sal Mineo is the person Rocky could have become without his talent for pugilism. Pier Angeli may not be much of an actress but she fits the part very well physically, with her big sad eyes and her fragile figure -- vulnerable all around, unfortunately, in her off screen life.There are good things about the film too. The neighborhood streets deserted at night because everyone is inside listening to the Graziano-Zale fight on the radio, the populace spilling onto the sidewalks in celebration after Rocky wins. And the guy playing Tony Zale really LOOKS like Tony Zale. Newman gives it his best shot but as the character is written it doesn't amount to much except Rocky pacing around, bobbing his head, and looking either puzzled or angry.This is however a familiar trajectory in sports movies. Ignorant guy works his way up from the streets, has moments of self doubt, then overcomes them and wins. We are, at least, spared here the manager in the corner shouting, "Use your right! Use your RIGHT!" Or the floored or canvassed protagonist finally sighting his girl friend in the audience and hauling his bloody mess to his feet for a final knockout of the nasty opponent.It's been overtaken by more recent movies about boxing, especially "Rocky" and "Raging Bull," both of which are better than this film. Of course Graziano was around during the filming and we can't have a true reprobate as the central figure. What he does that's wrong, and there are several things, he must do out of naiveté or ignorance or conflicting principles. The most interesting scenes involve the "bad" things that Graziano is shown doing. I mean -- clobbering an Army Captain with a sucker punch during wartime? Is it worth seeing? Definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Robert Wise Brings It All Home and Makes Newman a Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of the Success that Can be Found in this Biopic of Hoodlum Turned Middleweight Champ Rocky Graziano, Must Go to Director Robert Wise. His Decision to Film Only the Night Scenes at the Studio and the Daytime Scenes on Location, Add a Noirish Look and Enhances the Films Success and Realism.Paul Newman is OK Playing the Larger Than Life Boxer and Manages to Keep Just a Heartbeat from Caricature. The Outstanding Supporting Cast Highlighted by Pierre Angeli and Everett Sloane with Good Work from Everyone Else, Contribute to the Overall Believability, Dramatized Sure, but Not Too Much.The Fight Scenes are Great and Work Just Fine and the Editing Throughout the Picture is Excellent Moving Things Along at a Stunning Pace. Everything Comes Together to Make this a Fine Fight Film and a Surprise Considering the Safe and Saccharine Decade.Made Paul Newman a Star, and for that He Can Thank the Director. It Set the Box-Office Champ on a Career and He Never Looked Back. The Whole Production Team Seems to be On the Same Card and Together They Made This an Above Average Boxing Movie and a Very Good Movie Overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>solid bio-pic with newcomer Newman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky Graziano (Paul Newman) has to fights his drunken violent father as a kid and grows up to be a petty criminal. He is sent to prison where he violently resists. When he is finally released, he is immediately drafted by the Army for WWII. He goes AWOL and starts boxing. He is sentenced to Leavenworth where he continues to box. On the outside world, he continues to box, stays clean, gets married and has a family. He loses a title fight with Tony Zale. Then he gets into trouble with his past coming to haunt him.Originally set to be played by James Dean before his death, newcomer Paul Newman shows good promise. The movie is standard biopic. The acting is solid. However for a boxing movie, the boxing action is still not the best. It's old fashion intercut with other things in a montage. The most memorable hits come from the father hitting little Rocky early in the movie. This is much better as a character study and Newman shows his charms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biography of Graziano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ilike the kind of biographies films because we can learn many lessons from the famous characters to make their histories by solid trustment and good planing without be weakens inside the hardness of life.Rockey Graziano was a rich character because of his varietal life he faced it in many situations. He faced many hard situations in his life and he transformed from fail to fail until he was be a successful man and hero in boxing.This film was a message for any one face a failure in his life that we must be strongly to attack any defeat in their life to be good and perfect in their work without any afraid from loss and beaten because failure is the base of success and beaten is the base of victory.Winston Churchill made a definition for success that( success is the transformer from fail to fail without losing their confidence of themselves).This quote is the best title for the story of Graziano to be success and brightness in our life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the very few occasions when a film seen in one's youth and revisited years afterwards more than stands up to the memory. Seen just today, close to 60 years after its initial release Robert Wise's bio-pic of middleweight champion Rocky Graziano is as fresh as paint. One minor bemusing point; I looked in vain in the credits for the name Lou Stillman. Most movie buffs are familiar with Stillman's gym in Manhattan where most boxers trained at one time or another; Stillman has a fairly substantial role in the middle section of the film, almost inevitably given that this section of the movie takes place largely in the gym. Stillman has several lines with both Newman and Pier Angeli yet zip on the credits. I have a strong feeling that Stillman played himself but it would be nice to have it confirmed. Newman was barely registering on the Hollywood map at the time though he was reasonably well known on Broadway. Warners brought him to Tinseltown and starred him in one of the all-time great stinkeroos, The Silver Chalice, and though he redressed the balance almost immediately with an outstanding performance in The Rack, no one went to see it. Monty Clift, who had boxed well in From Here To Eternity and would do so again in The Young Lions, was first choice for Graziano but wasn't interested so it was tailored for Jimmy Dean who ran out of breath before shooting could start, so Newman, who had played Hemingway's The Battler on TV, won the role by default and totally inhabited it. His stellar performance is only one of many on view beginning with Eileen Heckart as Mrs. Barbella (Graziano's real name), Harold J. Stone as the loser father and Everett Sloane as Graziano's trainer. One of the finest films from the tail end of Hollywood's Golden years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film gives a very incomplete idea of Rocky Graziano's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My low mark is based on two things:The film, as I say in my summary, gives a very incomplete account of Graziano's boxing career. It appears to suggest that, after winning the world middle-weight championship, he lived "happy ever after". whereas in reality he was beaten by Zale in the return contest as well as by Sugar Ray Robinson (by which time he was past his best). He was never a great boxer but an extremely courageous one and well deserved to be champ.Secondly, Paul Newman is dreadful all the way through. His performance is just an imitation of Brando (facial tics and all) to the extent that the film becomes boring for long stretches. His character seems to have been lifted from "I was a fugitive from a chain gang" (scenes of hard labour, etc) and resemble sparring sessions rather more than prison terms.PS Pier Angeli, as the wife, is just an animated cliché of the bad guy's soulmate, rescuing him from himself. Her own performance is alas unrescuable</fullReview>
