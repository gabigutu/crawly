		<shortDescription>Maybe The Best Ever For Just Pure Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumanji ? a timeless adventure story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed ? I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films ? in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist ? in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe ? everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game ? and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that "I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes?"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight" ? Jumanji "Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more" ? GautamRATING: 10/10 (amazing)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.Oh and one more thing: from "Jumanji", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die!Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter ? I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play. But remember: once you start this game, you can't stop. If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must."Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things. Only finishing the game will make it all go away.In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added. Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself. He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing. The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams! Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter.Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles. He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt. The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type. The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the "This is MY baby" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page). Highly recommended for old and young alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just used to love "Jumanji" as a kid. This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy "Jumanji". It's a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with.Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it 'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter? You'll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy "Jumanji"! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another of my favorite childhood movies, there is Jumanji,one of my favorite movies with Robin Willians and Kirsten Dunst. Alan Parrish is a rich boy and his family were the founders of the city of New England, where the boy and his family lives. Not only that, his father is a businessman who has lots of deals and one of them is the notable shoe factory. But Alan life is not so good as we think: he is having problems with her best friend Sarah's boyfriend and his gang and his father wants to send him to a boarding school. Angry, he says to his father that he is never going to talk to him again and will ran away from his home. But when Alan was going to scape from his house, his friend Sarah goes to his house to talk, and they end up playing the mysterious game called Jumanji that Alan found buried. The strange game starts, and many strange things like wild animals start to show up, until Alan enter the game and be confined there until the results of the dice be 5 or 8. Sarah, too afraid to continue playing,run away. After 26 years,two brothers named Judy and Peter found the game and start playing it, like Sarah and Alan 26 years ago. Peter takes 5 in the dice, what makes Alan turn back after many years. Now they need to finish the game in order to all the horrible results end, but first Alan needs to find Sarah and convince her to play the spooky game again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family. Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library. At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as "realistic" as in other computer generated animated films. That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real. The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together. Have fun. Read the book. Watch the movie. Play the game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Family Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called "Jumanji", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished.Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human.The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like "Dead Poet's Society" or "Good Morning, Vietnam"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality.This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor.Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular b?te noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the "Narnia" stories).Fortunately, any moralising in "Jumanji" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of "alternative timelines". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements:--Kirstin Dunst at her peak.--Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic.--A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory.--Some clever time folding.--A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited.Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerous Boarding Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called "Jumanji" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. "Jumanji" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Jumanji"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Jumanji' is a drama comedy about a boy who is always picked on by a bunch of bullies. He gets sucked into a disastrous game board called 'Jumanji'. He was taken to a jungle for 26 long years. He then comes back after the dice read 8 and with the 3 other players who unleash the unexpected dangers of the jungle? onto the real world.Alan Parish is a troubled boy with kids picking on him 24/7. One day while walking through a construction site he finds a chest that holds 'Jumanji' - the board inside it. He starts playing this game with a young girl, Sarah, where he is sucked into the game. After 26 yrs he comes back as a man!! Sarah Whittle is one of the bully's girlfriends and she brought back Alan's bike when he invited her in to play the game. She was really scared when Alan was sucked into the game, after that she was chased by bats all the way down the street. It looks so real but when she falls over and a bat is on her shoulder, it looks Judy and Peter are the two other players who live with their generous aunt because their parents had died in a car crash. Judy lies because it makes her feel better and Peter doesn't talk to any one except Judy. Peter turns into a half monkey/human for cheating, which special effects make this look real.Together all four encounter many different but dangerous stuff from the jungle. Not only does it affect Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter, it affects the whole town. All in all 'Jumanji' is a rollicking imaginative adventure that will carry you away? literally!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumanji is a game that teaches you a lesson...If you start something you'd better be prepared to finish it. Thankfully, this is a movie in which that is easy to do. The premise, a game that produces real consequences (like a stampede of wild African animals, or a floor that turns into quicksand), is a fun way to introduce several exciting--sometimes hysterical, sometimes terrifying--circumstances for Robin Williams and the rest of the cast to have fun with, and fun it is, like a roller coaster at Six Flags.But in a way this film is also about growing up; about learning how to fit in, how to be responsible for yourself, and above all how perseverance can win the day. Yes, this is a fantasy-adventure movie. But there is a point to it all, and that point is that sticking to something in the face of terrible adversity has its own very special rewards.One last thing. This is supposed to be a Robin Williams movie. But good as he is, Jonathan Hyde as Hunter Van Pelt and David Alan Grier as Carl Bentley steal every scene they are in.</fullReview>

I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!</fullReview>

The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush.This is everything family entertainment should be.

		<fullReview>I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was.The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done.This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to play the game. You can't move until somebody roll 5 or 8.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good.There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid.With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him.Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him.What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film.Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley.I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is "better" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head.</fullReview>

The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9.

Williams and Hunt give it their best and a young Dunst is effective, while the movie itself is alternately poignant, absurd, mildly if broadly humorous, and very uncomfortable. If you've bought into the premise and can follow it through the finale is very satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films which sort of faded into obscurity at time of release but will I believe over time be considered a classic. I have seen it over a dozen times. And, for the purposes of this review, the reason I mention that fact is to ask the obvious question... why? And the why is because of the narrative. It is nearly perfect. Heck, it may even be perfect. If you are going to create a hi-CGI fantasy about children, geared to the child within (so to speak) you need to jump down the rabbit-hole is a convincing way, so that there is no hope of return. This is the essence of every good "fantasy" from the beginning of time, from Peter Pan to Alice In the Looking Glass to the Matrix. Once you are in, it is hard to get out. And that hooks the audience. What better way to establish such a narrative than a kid's game with "turns" and "dice"? Where each roll gets you in deeper? Also a great chance to watch to watch Robin Williams and Dunst before he/she became too old to play these roles; and Bonnie Hunt (great!) before her film career imploded.Postscript 12/14 -- with the recent passing of Robin Williams I wanted to add the following, especially after another viewing. First, it is one of the most perfect fantasies Hollywood has done since the invention of color film (keeping in mind that the best fantasies hail from the 30s and 40s). Second, and I know his fans will not agree, possibly Williams' best work. Early in his career, and he got a chance to play a boy in a man's body. Is there a more perfect role for him?? Hunt did not have what you would call a wide or varied film career but she is pitch perfect here, and matches Williams note for note, emotion for emotion. And Kirsten Dunst, another controversial figure, seems to have had a backwards career, with her impact dwindling as she aged. The highlight of her career may have been kissing Spiderman, but her face holds the camera here in every scene she is in, and she too is pitch perfect. Massively un-appreciated, one of the greatest films in its genre ever, right up there with Harry Potter or Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and "Jumanji" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie &amp; it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off.This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children.All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania.Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent family entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children.Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the very best I've seen with Robin Williams. The movie has great cast, good acting, great special effects for its time, and an original, well told story. A family friendly fantasy action thriller.There is so much magic in the movie, it is so close and intense. It is full of great shots, great performances, where the actors, Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt in particular, but also all others including the child actors. Actually, Kirsten Dunst and Laura Bell Bundy are particularly impressive child actors with terrific presence.It does drag a bit sometimes, in sequences where you just wish the heroes would be more efficient, where you get a bit of a "oh no, not again" when the story gets delayed again by similar problems. This affects my rating a little bit, but most of the complications that delay the story are called for, so it isn't a great problem. The average action movie is a whole lot worse.Although the movie can be slightly scary for small children, it has no profanity whatsoever, some violence but no blood and gore. But it has a lot of humor, particularly visual humor, and much of it is actually funny. Very family friendly. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Til the dice read five or eight ? Jumanji</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming.Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time ? well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects.The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be "real", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end.The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still children?one had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow up?and with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think.There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as "Soulman" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the "adult" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dazzling Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good. I always liked James Horner's music. There are only minor flaws here or there. I rate this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly imaginative fantasy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A most enjoyable surprise is this pure fantasy from special effects wiz Joe Johnston ("Honey I Shrunk the Kids" and "Adventures of the Rocketeer"). Story concerns the discovery of a mysterious board game by a young boy, Alan, in 1969. When he and his friend Sarah begin playing the game, they unleash forces beyond their control that propel Alan to another world and send Sarah running and screaming from the house. Twenty-six years later, young orphans Judy and Peter find the game in a dusty attic and begin playing themselves, once again releasing power they cannot contain.Johnston has a ball with the limitless f/x possibilities made available by this innovative premise (based on the novel). Computer graphics and animation is astounding, and though several images are obviously artificially generated, the impact is still markedly effective. Johnston constantly surprises, and will have you on the edge of your seat, heart pounding, from scene one to the dazzling finale. Wisely too, he has mixed in some romping fun and a good measure of humour, to make this a memorable fantasy-adventure.Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt and the young support cast - led by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce - do very well, but all, including the usually dominant Williams, are outclassed by the visual expertise, which includes some impressive sets and art direction. Sound effects are also top notch.James Horner provides another thoroughly satisfying score to round everything off. One of the best, most imaginative films I've seen for some time.Saturday, April 6, 1996 - Village MorwellThis wild, romping fantasy-adventure is a must for young and old alike. Special effects wiz Joe Johnston presents a film dominated by spectacular visual illusions, illusions which even manage to outshine the normally prominent Robin Williams.The plot does have similarities to "Back to the Future"', in that the board game gives the power to change history, as did the De Lorean in Robert Zemeckis' fantasy-adventure smash.Director Joe Johnston should really take full credit for fashioning this flick into a funny, frightening, full-on-fun-fest, with the undoubted help of an enjoyable cast (including Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce, Jonathan Hyde and Bonnie Hunt) and an ingenious effects team. Music is from a very capable James Horner. Highly recommended for a return viewing, especially at the cinema.Friday, August 30, 1996 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A treat for fans of family fantasy fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child, Alan Parrish becomes trapped inside Jumanji, a magical board game he finds discovers buried in a building site. 26 years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce), two orphaned kids living with their aunt, discover the game in the attic of their new home and begin to play, freeing the now-grown-up Alan (Robin Williams) in the process. Unfortunately, they also release a host of dangerous animals, deadly plants, and an unstoppable bloodthirsty hunter. Their only hope of survival is to finish the game, whatever the risks.Action packed, funny, heartwarming and even a little scary in places, Jumanji is an excellent family adventure for the whole family, and one that, thankfully, doesn't rely solely on its special effects to impress (a good job, since quite a bit of the CGI is looking rather dated). The story is engaging (with a nice time-travel style twist at the end), the cast is great (with Williams managing to give one of his less irritating performances), and once again director Joe Johnston delivers a final product that, whilst not a classic, is still thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wish they had more Jumanji history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When your life hangs on a simple roll of dice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: this comment is provided by Christopher Dorian and Peter Rhydon.When young Alan Parish and his friend Sarah Wittle sat in Alan's living room and began playing to that strange game named "Jumanji", neither them, nor the audience, could have expected what was coming after.Because "Jumanji" is not your parents' "Payday". The game instructions are simple: roll the dice and the player who reaches the end first is the winner. It's just in-between that things go a little bit different...What was just a little game meeting transforms into a special effects extravaganza, filled with all sorts of creatures and eye-catching action scenes and stunts that seem to be borrowed from the best moments of the Indiana Jones adventures.The computerized special FX are the main aspects of the movie and they mostly succeed to their task. While they may look archaic today, remember that these visual tricks were created in 1995, and that computer-driven movies were a new sensation. Looking at the lion's faces isn't completely interesting, but it's worth the effort.Action scenes are well conceived, well acted, and well pictured. Particularly memorable is the crocodile fight in the flooded house, with the characters trying to defend themselves like the Orca crew in "Jaws".Those two points are tightly linked with one man: director Joe Johnston, who previously made "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and "The Pagemaster". He clearly shows that his former employers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had a huge effect on him and that he gets inspiration from those two phenomenons. And when we see the final result, we could feel that Johnston could become a phenomenon too.But it isn't the case. And why? Because "Jumanji" relies on a quicksand storyline and poor lines, because characters are occasionally believable and because action scenes are not epic in the Star Wars or Indiana Jones style. The concept is excellent, but the developed elements are not on the same level. Characters are often performing in clich and predictable scenes, instead of innovative situations.If we talk about the actors, one should prevail from the others: Robin Williams. Even if his grinning smile looks stuck on his face like The Joker, he is a convincing jungle raider and his performance is fantastic, whatever it is for dramatic, terrifying or comic moments.What is also good about the film is that it can be enjoyed by people from all ages. Children will be delighted and excited by the animals depicted here and adults will enjoy the magnitude of the special effects employed during the film. The dialog is generally well suited for a general audience and there is no real troubling or disturbing moment.It's good to see that the '90s still deals with that kind of stuff. Technological developments imply more and more sophisticated video games of all kinds, but it's heart-warming to see that classic board games can provide excitement like this. After seeing that movie, playing "Monopoly" would seem to be like a tea party or some other kind of silly joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good original family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues.Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable.Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy. 6 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, I think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a lot better than others have ranked it. It deserves more than a 6 average. I gave it a 7 and believe it's underrated. The basic story is that years ago, while a child, Robin Williams was transported into the game he was playing at the time and trapped there. Later, two other children find the game board and play it, releasing a now grown up Williams, along with all sorts of dangerous animals and vines and stuff. These things threaten mankind and it's up to Williams, along with Bonnie Hunt, to find a way to stop these things from killing off man. There's a good bit of suspense and with every move the heroic folks make, something counteracts it and things nearly always end up being worse than before. They finally determine that the only way to end the horror is to finish the game that Williams started all those years ago. Now, if they could only find the game board. This is a well written adaptation of a popular book, and I found it quite entertaining.</fullReview>

The whole idea of slight, unhappy, 12-year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:20) getting trapped in a board game in 1969, for 26-years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back 35-years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Ain't No Game!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS]In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one!--</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality? Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle. This is, if nothing else, a fun film. It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted. Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects. I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour. There is no cursing or sex in this one. No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations. Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago. Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well. David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town. Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter. It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father. The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun. Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, "How did they do that?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great, great time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this film is hugely enjoyable to watch, when I first saw it I was 10 and I absolutely loved it! What made it so fun was that it had a sense of humor and that you could never predict what would come out of the game next, making it very exciting to watch. Kids will fall in love with it, it is such an unabashed action ride, you can watch it over and over. Unfortunately the critics didn't like this movie, and it wasn't a huge box-office success either. It is hard to see why. OK, the effects weren't at the level of Jurassic Park. What made this movie fun was the original storyline and the enjoyable performances. The actors are well cast in their likable roles. This is the perfect adventure film for youngsters. JUMANJI is one hell of a roller-coaster ride that I highly recommend. P.S.: Roger Ebert gives it *1/2 out of **** and says it is unappropriate for children. Why, why, why? Every kid I know adores this film. Some critics just don't make any sense. In his review for 1999's THE MUMMY, which I hated by the way, he says he loves ludicrous adventure movies like that one and gives it ***. Well then why the heck does he dislike this one?

		<shortDescription>Fine special effects, fizzled screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another of those films where a 30-minute documentary on how they did the special effects would be a lot more interesting (not to mention a lot shorter) than the movie itself. The digital effects and animatronics are great; the screenplay doesn't work. A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie. The pasted-on homilies the screenplay comes up with _ the need for courage, commitment, real parent-child communication _ are drowned out in the hubbub, and a good cast (not to mention a big budget) is wasted. And they're planning a sequel to THIS? Have they run out of good (or even mediocre) films to do sequels to?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jumanji" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game "jumanji" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining family film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film talks about a board game set in the inhospitable jungles of Indonesia that recreates magically the dangers in the board, for horror of the players involved. Directed by Joe Johnston, the film has a script by a team led by Jonathan Hensleigh. The main protagonist is Robin Williams, assisted by the young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce.Yes, the theme of the movie would make a great horror film but, in this case, we have a comedy. And Robin Williams was definitely the "Mr. comedy". Any comic role fit him like a glove and this film was no exception. Although his character have some psychological depth, because of the trauma of being alone in the jungle for decades, it only serves to accentuate the humorous slant of what he says and does. The script is interesting, simple and very imaginative. The story works, entertains and holds the audience. The film scares a bit in certain scenes, but never in an excessive dose for children. The scenarios are good and the special, visual and sound effects are excellent. Some creatures in the film are clearly false and have a funny look. The soundtrack is regular, not bringing surprises, but doing their part without blemish. This film was made to entertain the audience, in particular the families, and does it very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light &amp; Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today.</fullReview>

The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role."Jumanji" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give "Jumanji" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers).The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives.Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was.The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the "remastered" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad.That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI.The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting.That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be.That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not.The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film.Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumanji (1995): Dir: Joe Johnston / Cast: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Bradley Pierce, Kirsten Dunst, Jonathan Hyde: Board game forces players to finish it before it finishes them. Every dice roll erupts something new from its supernatural fury. In 1969 Alan Parrish is sucked into the game before a friend's eyes. 26 years later he returns thanks to two kids who inhabit the house with their caseworker and discover the game. Intriguing plot boils down to images that descend from the game. Monkeys, lions, elephants, rhinos, spiders, crocodiles, thunder, and a game hunter seeking Alan's life. Repetitious with inventive production but perhaps too scary for young children. Directed by Joe Johnston who previously made The Rocketeer. Robin Williams as Parrish pulls through due too established background information that led to his trauma. Bonnie Hunt succeeds because her fear seems real. She enclosed herself against society until she is reluctantly recruited for the game. Against it is the film's conclusion where Williams and Hunt know perhaps too much. Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are the standard children that are merely targets for whatever emerges from the game. Jonathan Hyde has duo roles both as the father of the children as well as the safari hunter, but neither role sparks much life. Ideal take on board games and a theme of fear that accompanies each role of the dice. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a little bit long ago and it seemed dull then. This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better ? And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young martial artist is caught between respecting his pacifist father's wishes or stopping a group of disrespectful foreigners from stealing precious artifacts.I believe I first saw this film when it came out in theaters, and it left a pretty good impact on me. Even culturally, I feel like it has left its mark because people still remember this one -- even if they have never seen it. The idea of a board game that takes on a life of its own is brilliant, and well-executed here.Apparently this film was seen as the next step in CGI following "Jurassic Park". Arguably, "Jurassic" is still better, but it probably had the bigger budget. For the mid-1990s, these are some great animal effects. Rarely are they surpassed today, and generally we see things much worse (yes, I mean you, SyFy network).Bonus: Kirsten Dunst before most people knew who she was (though I believe this was still after "Interview with the Vampire").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumangi is a good movie with a reasonably well written storyline and a fantastic cast. It's an entertaining film that boasts a fun and unique storyline that the kids will certainly enjoy, even if the effects are outdated, and the performances can be appreciated by all ages, Robin Williams delivers a very dedicated performance, which shows how great of an actor he really is, he easily could have phoned it in for a film like this, but he refused, his scenes with Bonnie Hunt are the films highlight, their chemistry is outstanding and brought this film from a six to a seven for me. As far as the story goes, it's very mediocre, it moves too slowly for a while, and suddenly too much is happening all at once, it tends to drag on certain plot points and relies on bringing the characters back to the board game too frequently. The characters are poorly developed and none of them are a single bit relatable, the film gets too dedicated to its weird plot that it dosen't take the time to make the four main characters human, we are given very little information about their life before they discovered Jumangi, and because of that it makes their journey a lot less compelling. It's jam packed with flaws and kids will certainly enjoy it more than adults, but Jumangi still has this irresistible thing about it that makes it a lot of fun to watch, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film, for Robin Williams alone, it's worth the watch. Two kids must finish a dangerous board game with the help of two adults in order to save the world from its destruction. Best Performance: Robin Williams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave Jumanji 7 out 10, which is a pretty good rating from me. 10 are epics like Gone With The Wind &amp; Lawrence of Arabia, 9 are classics and 8 the near great. 7, like Jumanji, are just good, clean fun; not Oscar worthy movies, but movies worth watching.Robin Williams delivers a fairly straight performance for him, but it works, it is good acting. Kirsten Dunst, does a great job as his love interest and former playmate.Other roles by David Alan Grier, Bonnie Hunt, Jonathan Hyde and Bebe Neuwirth fill out the cast nicely along with the child actors who play Peter &amp; Judy and the young Alan &amp; Sarah.Jumangi was one of the better, more successful films to come out of TriStar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great. The story is so interesting and unique. The cast do a great job of portraying their characters and the visual effects aren't bad for the mid-ninties. Some people say they don't like this movie, for whatever reason, but I think it's an enjoyable adventure that anyone would enjoy.This movie is about a board game. A very special board game. When two children play the game, everything that the their players do, happens to them. So when Alan's piece gets a card saying he has to wait in the jungle, he disappears, which nearly drives the young girl he was playing with mad. Twenty-six years later, two new kids play the game, and release Alan. Alan and the kids must get the other play to continue to game, otherwise they won't be free until it's completed.Best part of the movie: When Alan comes out of the game.Worst part of the movie: The spiders.Recommended for: Everyone.Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not board</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life.And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end.Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in "Hook", "Popeye" all the way to his breakout part in "Mork and Mindy". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see "Cheers" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too.I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matine features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in "Mrs Doubtfire" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it.Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in "An Interview With A Vampire" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like "Aladdin" and "Mrs Doubtfire" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad.Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well.</fullReview>

I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for 30 years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost 20 years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise.</fullReview>

This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive, and Williams is one of the world's supreme artistic talents. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone character of the hunter. The story is nothing special but exceptional performance from most of the cast, realism and the weird mood it puts you in make it a must-see masterpiece. In its category it is amongst the best.

		<fullReview>Fun family film about a magical board game that hosts many dangers that can only be stopped when a player finishes. The entire cast does their job well, but the only one not interchangeable is Hyde in a double-role as the main character's wealthy stern father and a big-game hunter (hint: intentional parallel). Entertaining from start to finish, but even children in 1995 were likely very aware that the scary creatures on screen were nothing more than special-effects?because of this, it's difficult to ever get lost in the delicious chaos despite all the funny moments and thrills. Still, despite its flaws, the story is interesting enough for the whole family enjoy and the film is good enough to be replayed every few years.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumanji is one thrilling adventure where two children, Judy and Peter, find a magical board game in their newly rented home and, while playing, they unleash a man named Alan whom for decades has been trapped inside the game. The horde of other dangers released from the game like runaway wild animals, gigantic mosquitoes and pesky bats can only be stopped when they finish playing the game. Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst), Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) and Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) are the four main characters playing and trying to finish the game, but as each of their turn passes, new dangers are released from the game. This leads to an endless supply of wild adventure, thrilling chase scenes, and crazy comic relief (i.e., monkeys driving a motorcycle). These nonstop action are highlighted by incredible special and visual effects. Serving as co-stars are the kids' aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) and police officer Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier), who are unfortunate enough to get caught right in the middle of all the chaotic events surrounding the board game. This lead to hilarious scenes and priceless reactions from the two as they see the dangers like giant crocodiles and man-eating plants before them. Full of non-stop fun, excitement and adventure, this is one of the greatest family adventure movies to catch!Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah.But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if a board game became real?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this movie years ago, and managed to catch it again today on network TV. I am a confessed big fan of Robin Williams, ever since his days on TV in "Mork and Mindy", and his role in "The World According to Garp." He was not a child star, he didn't really start to gain his fame until he was almost 30. With his body of work behind him, he has established himself as one of the best actors of his generation.Kirsten Dunst is sort of on the other end of that spectrum. She was a child star, starting acting when she was around 10. Most of us remember her for "Interview with the Vampire" which came out just before "Jumanji". While she will never be considered one of the best, she has had steady work and perhaps now best known for her role as Mary Jane Watson in several "Spiderman" movies. It was fun seeing her again here (I had forgotten she was in it) as a young, inexperienced actress.The story is about a board game, JUMANJI, that becomes real. When the dice and the move dictate wild animals, they appear in the house. Or an earthquake, or a flood. Robin Williams is the main character as Alan Parrish and Kirsten Dunst is one of the kids, Judy Shepherd.The other key character is Bonnie Hunt as Sarah Whittle who, as a child had played the game with Alan as a child. Their hooking up again after all those years was a key to resolve everything. But, in the end as the kids threw the game into a stream, the last scene shows the box in the sand, on a foreign beach, perhaps France, for another unsuspecting person to find it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space.Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing.The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths.I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans.

The message could be something like, "run away before the lion gets you" and sure enough, a lion will suddenly appear in your house, ready to get you! I rate this 8/10 because of the fact that there was mild swearing, and I thought it was pushing it with the kiss at the end. But overall I enjoyed the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throw the dice and take a turn, Jumanji made the critics gurn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and based on Chris Van Allsburg's short story of the same name. It stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Jonathan Hyde. The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed.Simple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects-said the critics- Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005) , an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on its effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting, peer pressure, grief and bullying, while the impact of a missing child on one town is a noteworthy addition to the story line. You wonder if those critics actually paid attention during their free viewings?.Yes it's berserker family fun, but it's not without worth in the writing too. Besides which, for the action set pieces and the laughs-they alone mean the film has its merits. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, deep, accidental?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it helps to watch Jumanji and remember it's not a comedy, in spite of Robin Williams, comic policeman, impressive pratfalls and covering the villain in paint. It's a pretty clear morality tale, of course, with the main message (to me) being that Alan's father is right; you have to face up to what you're afraid of. But the subject of the message is hidden by the clever misdirection at the start of the film. There's a lot of time spent establishing that Alan is being bullied, and that he's being bullied because he's an only child of the posh family. So, is Jumanji a film about facing up to the bullies and how 26 years in the jungle makes you harder, smarter and faster and able to kick their tiny keesters when you get out? You know it isn't. Jumanji is a film about being afraid of your parents; of your parents being scared of you; and of the real fear behind that fear, which is the inevitable mutual loss. Clever, clever misdirection - but that's signalled in the first scenes of the film. Alan isn't paralysed by the "bullies"; he can go and get whupped with indifference. And the film gives us no hint of any resolution of that scenario. He's terrified of his father, though. The deep part comes when you have to ask why; and the playing between "young" Alan and his father is to my mind some of the best observed of that sort of confrontation I have seen. Other deep parts of the film? The close similarities between child and adult ways of dealing with trauma; Kirsten Dunst and Bonnie Hunt both lie vigorously and repeatedly about what happened (though we have to give Bonnie credit for trying to tell the truth at first...). Bradley Pierce's look to camera by the woodshed. He knows we're watching; is his character giving us the sly nod to prove the actors know it's not real, and however bad it might look they weren't in danger? Why do I say "accidental", then? Because there is so much shallow stuff in there too. I don't just mean the general FX and demolition derby. They're fun, they're a good ride. All the wailing and screaming and plain silliness has me asking whether I'm reading too much into this piece. After all, Robin Williams was well known for his splendid "man-child" performances; Mork, Toys, Hook, GMV. In the end, I think I'm giving the film the right amount of credit, and all because of the scene at Bonnie's door. Was that the first hint of the very mad and dangerous characters he would flower into playing? If so, it was well done and well judged. 8/10 for this fun and dangerous film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is family entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When two children play a board game a man trapped inside appears and tries to help them finish the game as jungle elements from the game trouble the environment.Shown every Christmas, re-released countless times and still Jumanji never loses its touch with its viewers.This breathtaking imagination of a board game coming to life is as wonderfully exuberant as toys coming to life in Pixar's first film. The concept of a game coming to life is made even more exciting by encoding prospects of deadly animals such as lions, mysterious mosquitoes and violent talented monkeys. Everything is thought of and what a treat we have in our hands.There is now a new definition of family entertainment, known as Pixar. Since releasing Toy Story after this was released they have been dominating the box office with wonderful family tales about sentimental robots, cooking rats and racing cars. And to rewind the clock back 14 years this picture is to be hailed as the beginning of the end.A truly new concept with very little explanation required and a marvellous array of hormonal characters with breathtaking action and enough humour to make you smile, this was and still is marvellous.Family entertainment now either involves a boy with a wand, Harry something, or sitting in your living room watching Simon Cowell make fun of ordinary folk.The reprisal if you want to call it that of non-animated picture was in 2005 where Jon Favreau attempted a step up from this picture, by using the same concept of a board game coming to life and applied it with a sci-fi edge, set in space. Whilst there were moments of good action it boiled down to being a repetitive ideology of this 1995 classic with not enough quick wit and mistimed action sequences with an egregious sentimental intention of brotherly love.This has none of that. There are no overly soppy sentimental parts as the required drama is justified early on. The action continues consistently with first initial deadly elements before the stakes are raised. Van Pelt adds a sharp intake of breath threw his evidently evil hunter, which actually is never properly explained, but that is the point. Nothing is explained, events just happen and we can sit back and enjoy the fun spilling out from every angle.Johnston is the man in the know as the adventure flows with exquisite timing. The scene with the house flood is a perfect example whilst the monkey motorbike stage shows his ability to do comedy.This truly is a remarkable film and is worth watching again and again for its wondrous story, its lovable collection of characters and easy sharp mind. This is family entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumanji is fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!) Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities. Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great. If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Allsburgh's film adaptations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Author Chris Van Allburgh has had three film adaptations. His most recent was Zathura, which I didn't like. Before that, The Polar Express was released and re-released. I don't know why because I did't like it that much either. But ten years before Zathura was his first film adaptation, Jumanji. The only one I liked. The only one that critics disliked. Jumanji, for some reason, was a film that I really liked. I'll admit some of it was a bit weird, but I really liked it. I liked it because of Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, two great actors. People don't give Williams enough credit and the same with Hunt. But I love both of them. I also think the film has great visuals and it's a triumph with entertainment. I can understand why critics would call it weird, but I really liked it. You may disagree with me. But there's something about Jumanji that I really liked but I can't think of what exactly it is. Though some parts are kind of odd, Jumanji grabs my attention and I'm recommending it.The Plot: When two kids find a magical board game, they release tons of animals and a person who once played the game when he was younger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood.In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of "Jumanji" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure.JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were.Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing.The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the "plot" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tempting to rate this as full marks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Updated April 2008 I prefer to avoid rating stories as on a scale of 0 to 10 how would I rate any individual feature compared to others? How do I take into account fluctuations between different viewings? First viewing this stood out as so attractive that I wanted to forget my ways and rate it full marks next time I logged on to IMDb. I hold back, but it is a real urge. I have three episodes of the very okay animated television series on disk, which I hungered for as that has Ashley Johnson playing the small boy, Peter. As a feature this is different, they are in their own world with Jumanji coming to them, different treatments. I find the feature to be even better than the 1996 animated series, but that should not be so unusual. * Once upon a time the good were expected to not bother with frivolity such as fantasy games and chocolate cakes, but some went over to the other side. This is about kids who discover a special game that they could long to escape from. Cat In The Hat 2003 as a variation on this. In Jumanji the kids are a bit of a problem but nothing like with Sally and Conrad in the 2003. I like it that all the destruction gets tidied away, underclass tend to not to be able to play the game all that well. Nappy McPhee 2005 as another variation. Freaky Friday? I rate Jumanji above all these. * For me it is the aftermath of discovering Harry Potter 5 feature and me wanting to give Jumani full marks maybe reflects my love of the early HP. The HP series has moved on to other worlds, but this shows that there is still life as I hope for on this particular planet. Discovering that The Worst Witch 1998 series in now fully available from Australia is positive to me too. A need to shout Full Marks. TWW, the television series is way better than the feature. * Then getting a copy of zAthura 2005, a sequel to Jumanji. This is such a different treatment, the kids so obviously a pain that I found the first part of the story to be working to put me off of watching the thing. One flip side, it helped me appreciate Jumanji and the animated series more. Also, zAthura became gradually more approachable as the unfurling of the characters' personas allowed a more sympathetic view to emerge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie as a child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 8 or something and I loved it immediately. The idea that you could actually play a game that could have the consequences Jumanji had was awe-inspiring for a kid like me. When I saw it again on TV 2 or 3 years later I taped it and watched it over and over again. At one moment I would lay in my bed and play the movie second by second and word by word in my head. That's how obsessed I was with this film. The action made me want to study biology and major in zoology actually.But I didn't study biology, I am a film student now. And from a film student point of view this movie is, of course, nothing special. The effects aren't perfect, it's no quality film and certainly not Oscar worthy or anything. But from a personal point of view, it still amazes me. When I watch it again it takes me back to my childhood and the amazing visions I had back then of it actually happening in my school and such. For that sense of nostalgia and the memories I have for this movie, I give this a straight 10 out of 10. After all, it was my favorite movie as a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumanji is a fun filled film with great special effects, gripping action and it revolves around an interesting although absurd idea of a damned board game. However absurd this idea may be, it works as far as the adventure goes. It has many flaws because eventually the absurdity becomes too much and, especially for adults, it will become annoying because of its repetition in the the attempt of filling the movie with 'funnys'.Robin Williams himself is a pleasant surprise as the action hero. His choice may have been a little surprising, but alas, Williams shows he is able to be anything, anytime, anywhere. So hats off to his performance, not the deepest ever but an enjoyable turn for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams and his best movie role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been familiar with this film for over a decade. And it still remains as one of the best films with Robin in it.In this movie he plays Alan who was a boy who always had trouble facing his fears. Till he stumbles upon a mysterious board game called "Jumaji" a game of adventure and survival. And that's exactly what he'll face.The first time I saw this movie was when I got it on VHS back 9 years ago. I was still young and naive back then and didn't understand most parts of the film. But I was amazed with how well done the special effects were.The Elephants, Monkeys, and wild animals looked so real I actually thought they existed. This was back before I knew what CGI or special editing was.The flow of the story is very well done. Plenty of thrills, excitement, and some funny moments. Robin Williams is great with his role. Along with Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, and Bradly Pierce.I'm sure all Robin Williams fans will be satisfied with this movie. I never read the book it's based on but it's good to see every now and then. It's rated PG for thrilling moments, and some parts that might make a kid ask too many questions. I'm sure it's fine for Ages 11 and up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera.A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest "Jumanji", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost...Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate 1985. But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst...**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be "unique". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word - fun! **mild spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>B "Jumanji" is, simply put, a fun, family-oriented action/adventure film. From the killer plants to the CGI stampede and monkeys, to character actor Jonathan Hyde's ("The Mummy", "Titanic", "Anaconda") dual role as Alan Parrish's (Adam Hann-Bird/Robin Williams) father, and the ruthless man hunter Van Pelt, this is a gung-ho "Indiana Jones"-type film for kids. The plot is basically two sets of kids who discover a board game that makes the events that occur in them (killer mosquitoes, monkeys, etc.) come true. Robin Williams plays Alan Parrish, a boy who got trapped in the game as a kid, with Bonnie Hunt as the girl who was with him and later, his love interest. Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce play the two kids from 1995.  I'll take my previous statement back - the film is more slapstick than "Indiana Jones". A lot of the humor is physical or sight gags - eg. the monkeys riding a motorcycle with a pistol, which IS pretty damn funny, and the rows of supplies knocking over paint cans that bury Van Pelt.  The film is suspenseful, well-produced, and has good special effects. No, I'll take it back. The monkeys and the lion look really fake (the stampede works since it would be hard to film a real one), but otherwise, they're okay. Aside from the fake-looking animals and the way-too-drawn-out ending, "Jumanji" is superb. Seven stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things.I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in "Spiderman", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10</fullReview>

Robin Williams ( 26 year old Alan Parrish ), Jonathan Hyde ( Sam Parrish/ Van Pelt ) and Bonnie Hunt ( Sarah Whittle in 1995 ) are the best members of the cast. From the moment the fun starts ( I mean, when they start playing the game ) it never ends. To be honest, the animals in this movie were almost real and I sometimes check my closet before I go to bed. You never know what could be in there...Here's what I think: the special effects deserve 10/10, the cast gets 9/10 so I think the movie must get 9,5/10. Now go and find 'Jumanji'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is full of surprises and it is a film that I enjoyed very much. When I first saw it I didn't realise that Jonathan Hyde was playing both Sam Parrish and Van Pelt. That shows how gifted an actor he is. It is also reminiscent of the same actor playing Mr Darling and Captain Hook in productions of Peter Pan. There is some of Peter Pan in the film and there are echoes of Back To The Future and It's A Wonderful Life. Robin Williams is at his best as always and Bonnie Hunt does very well as Sarah. Bebe Neuwirth also shows that there's more to her than Lilith in Frasier. A great film for all the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts!Unbelievable. Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin. Then again, maybe it is believable.`Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then "Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable.But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, classic, family fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being rejected by many a film critic for being childish and lacking in the classic sweepstakes, I found this film more than enough to satisfy my evening desires. With its strong plot and good actors, this film has much going for it, despite slightly lame CGI, its the story that carries you on. I have heard few people praise this film but I believe it to be a classic due to having an eerie dark sense all the way through until the credits roll, whilst still maintaining comedy and being for the whole family. It is bound to keep the viewer thinking of the awful situation these people face long after viewing has finished. Overall, one of the high points of Williams' career, and Kursten Dunst has never been better.Try it, you might surprise yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) &amp; his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical &amp; Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later &amp; it's 1995 &amp; Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother &amp; sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) &amp; Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game &amp; start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures &amp; climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji &amp; is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's &amp; a stampede...Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different &amp; the two main character's here Alan &amp; Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas &amp; themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror &amp; comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse &amp; worse as all the chaos &amp; mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around &amp; the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji &amp; to find something so original &amp; different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house &amp; an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed &amp; a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces &amp; the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow &amp; it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood clich but it's fun &amp; very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really.Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's &amp; Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly &amp; systematically trashed &amp; as a whole the film delights in needless destruction &amp; mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs &amp; a few scares as well &amp; I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older &amp; younger audiences.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire &amp; British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here &amp; his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on &amp; have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good.Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children &amp; adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well where do I begin.The Casting: I guess the casting was OK. Robin Williams does a decent job, same goes for Kirsten Dunst. I really love the Sara Whittle character, but I am unsure if its because of her written dialog, which I indeed love, or the acting of Bonnie Hunt. I don't know what role the policeman is supposed to play however. I mean he doesn't do anything really important and it seems like he is there just to tie up the loose ends. It is OK though, I would rather have this cop around than just having them loose the game some more, which I think would have been the other alternative. His supposed to be funny moments however is something the movie could've done without.The Story: I really enjoy the story! Its simple, not to serious and perfect for adventure. My problem with it is how the story about the characters end which is a bit counter dramatic. The moral of the story, whatever you perceive it to be, feels meaningless. Since everything just ends up a-okay for everyone.Some people have been complaining that you never get to know the origin of Jumanji or how it looks inside the game. I don't have that problem simply because it would take away all the mystery. The parts of the story I grow tired off is how they loose the game to often. I figure its to add suspense which works at times, but the movie overdoes it. Another thing that I don't really like is how Van Pelt, the hunter, has to buy a new modern rifle. I kind of liked the retro feeling to him, but that disappears when he has an enormous automatic black rifle with night-vision aim rather than his own old rifle. The effects: To be honest, what comes first in my book is acting and story. If you take the old batman movie the effects aren't at all impressive. But that don't stop them from being awesome. Same goes for this, sure the computer effects haven't aged well and the monkeys just look stupid. But it isn't that big a part of the movie. Maybe of the marketing but I've learned you have to take that part of the entertainment business with mountains of salt.I figure I got to much to say about the movie, there is a lot of stuff I haven't talked about, so I'll just stop here and sum my thoughts up.Its imaginative and adventurous with good acting and decent effects. The only part which stops me from giving it a 10 is the "comic relief" which is just stupid and unnecessary. A bit more adult sprinkled on this movie and it would be a lot better in my eyes. Still, a good movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about two children playing a mysterious board game that was left by the previous owner of the house they're living in now. They play it and the game begins. A man comes out from the game after staying there for a decade. They figure out the game is dangerous and think it would all go away if they just finish it. During the coarse of the game, there is peril everywhere! This is a good movie, not better than Zathura, but it's still good. I have to warn some parents out there because if you're taking your kids to see this movie, it might scare them. Might. Although it didn't scare me because I'm 14. Characters get hurt. Some even die. There are funny moments and sweet moments. This is a good film that anyone could enjoy. Probably not your little children.</fullReview>

But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter.The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good.Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the critics on this one--it's a great romp that gets better with time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning--Spoilers**We've owned Jumanji on video since it was released in 1996 and pull it out a couple of times each year for kicks. It's as fun today as the first time we saw it with plenty of twists and plot turns to keep you hooked through the closing credits. I've read the reviews by several of the critics on IMDB, and it is obvious they just don't get it.Criticism #1: "Jumanji is too scary for kids": Our children (ages 2 to 11) have all seen this at an early age and none was ever the slightest bit frightened. Jumanji doesn't scare kids because 1) the dangers are never prolonged; 2) there is a ton of humor interwoven in the dialogue; and 3) everyone knows it's just a game. After all, the pranks in Jumanji are no more harmful than what you see in Looney Tunes or Roadrunner &amp; Coyote and kids instinctively get that.Criticism #2: "Jumanji has no story": wrong again. Every time we watch it, something new comes out, particularly in the relationships between the main characters. There are particularly poignant moments between the father and son characters allowing them to reconcile and overcome the aloofness that can keep men from coming to grips with their feelings toward each other. And, the Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt relationship has a great payoff with romance and their triumph over forces of nature (real and implied). There are also numerous humorous details and themes that run through the film from stampeding rhinos to run-a-muck monkeys that keeping you laughing throughout the entire film.Criticism #3: "The special effects overwhelm the story": The film is based on an animated children's book and the special effects intentionally mirror the artwork from the book. My kids oohed and ahhed at each and every FX enhanced adventure from the stampeding animals to the wood floor turning to quicksand and in each case the result was to stimulate a great deal of discussion about the ideas in the story. The monkeys are particularly funny evoking squeals of laughter as they embark on their high jinx.So, don't let bad reviews deter you from seeing this flick. You and your family will have a great time during the movie and your kids will want to talk about every aspect of Jumanji after it's over, even if it's just an excuse not to go to bed on time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best.I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that.It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too.This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little adventurous... and childish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jumanji is a great idea. The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic.However, some aspects of the movie prevent that. For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys. They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief. Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here.Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching "Spy Kids", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation.The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance.The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way. Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action.The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie. A lower-than-average job on his part.Overall, this movie is really good. I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great Hollywood thrill ride of a movie. I loved the idea for this flick, a mystical board game coming to life. What's great about this film is that for once Robin Williams isn't doing his usual "Robin Williams" stand-up schtick. He's playing an original character and it's about time too, daddy-o.This movie is a great blend of thrills, special effects and laughs. I like how it uses a lot of the old jungle movie icons like the Great White British Hunter, giant crocs, lions, mischievous monkeys and rhinos. And even the actual Jumanji game board itself looked cool! I wanted to own one. I write screenplays myself on occasion and this film made me wanna write my own special effects extravaganza!But go checkety check out Jumanji and have a great time at the movies. Dig?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that I am a huge Robin Williams fan, I had never seen Jumanji, it just never appealed to me, but even since Williams' untimely passing, I've been trying to view his entire filmography. I also wanted to catch the original film, before its reputation was irreparably damaged by next years re-make, featuring the Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. The film focuses on young Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), the son of a rich industrialist, who is always in the way. One day, he finds a weird board game, buried in a construction site, and decides to play with a friend, but this is no ordinary game, and Alan becomes trapped inside for decades. It isn't until two kids, moving into a new house discover the game and start to play it, that Alan is freed. Not wanting these kids, to face the same fate he did, they track down his old friend, and decide to finish the game and put the madness to an end. I think when Robin Williams played a child or a crazy person he was at his best. Those were the time when he could really just let go, be free, and be truly hilarious. As in most films like this, Williams is the film, the rest of the cast revolves around him, and without him, this is just another kids movie. Kids love these quirky, weird films, and parents hate being dragged to them, but Williams had a way of making both sides happy and making them both want to see it, that's what Jumanji was. For all intense and purposes this is a kids movie, with Williams acting like a big kid, but making adult jokes, innuendoes, and just being that guy who made him a legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam.The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JUMANJII loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today!The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town.Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it.The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film.The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention.This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later.I will give this 7 out of 10.Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining adventure movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better.Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it.The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal.The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed.As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories.I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considering it has Robin Williams in it, it is okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not really a huge fan of Robin Williams, his type of humor does not usually work for me. In fact, I always thought Mork and Mindy was where he did his best comedy. This movie is about a boy who disappeared while playing a board game. His sister who was playing at the time saw him disappear into said game and is basically a bit crazy later in her life thanks to this incident. Two children find and play this game one day and to their surprise the boy who disappeared has reappeared thanks to a roll of the dice. They now have to continue to play the game as things begin to pelt them, animals run amok, and a determined continually hunts the foursome down. The effects are okay for the time, but they are the type of effects that are in to many movies these days. The type that looks like they are there, but at the same time they do not. The comedy is okay, Robin Williams does not get as worked up in this one as he usually does in his films and you also get to see a young Kristen Dunst. This one coming out after her appearance in Interview with a Vampire. David Alan Grier also stars as a cop who gets caught up in the game as near the end the game really begins to cause quite a lot of chaos. Still, it is an effects driven family film so the story is a bit shallow. So worth a chuckle and it does have a lot to look at, but at times it seems almost like you are watching a video game rather than watching four people play a board game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fun family film about a game. I was sceptical, but as I like Robin Williams, I was obliged to go and see the film. The first thing that hit was the atmosphere. It's a bizarre and quite scary film. Well for a 7 year old anyway.Robin Williams plays the part really well but the real star of the film is the special effects. The stampede and various other disasters from the game were fantastic for their day. OK they look a bit dated now but in their time, they were some of the most advanced special effects ever used in movies.Bonnie Hunt steals the show with her humour and character. And the 2 children are fantastic as actors. The only thing that lets Jumanji down is the tag line. It gives away too much of the story of the film. But don't let that spoil things. The film is an unmissable adventure based on a small picture book. Surprised? You will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumanji</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult where?with the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friend?he must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HORRIBLE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril!</fullReview>

Left to his own devices he tends to go off the deep end a bit. Then you add the lame script and an over-done score, you get a movie that misses.I gave this movie a 4 because it was an original concept, it had some great cinematography and it had a few really cool special effects.

		<fullReview>Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting.The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game.There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit clich'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie.6.5/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly lively jungle jaunt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think when Jumanji was released ten years ago, it was probably an attempt to cash in on the recent success of Jurassic Park. Both films have similar ideas. Using CGI effects to bring all manner of creatures to life. Although not quite as successful as JP, I still found Jumanji an exciting film.Beginning in 1869, in the town of Brantford, New Hampshire, two boys are hurriedly trying to bury something in the woods. This certain something doesn't take kindly to it, and protests in the form of jungle drums. Just before they leave, they pray for the poor soul who should ever find it.We cut to 1969, when young boy Alan Parrish is drawn to a construction site by the mysterious sound of jungle drums. It leads him to a chest. When he opens it, he finds a board game, JUMANJI. Alan has no way to know he is about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime!Showing the game to his best friend Sarah, they become enthralled in the game's seemingly magical powers. It's pieces move by themselves. Words appear in a crystal at the centre. And things have a tendency to come out of it when they roll the dice. Things take a nasty turn when after Alan rolls a 5, the game pulls him into it, where he remains trapped for 26 years.A new family move into Alan's home, Judy (Kirsten Dunst), Peter, and their aunt Nora (a woefully underused Bebe Neuwirth). The game calls to them as it did Alan and Sarah, and they end up releasing giant mosquitoes, a group of mischievous monkeys, a ferocious lion, and a fully grown Alan Parrish (Robin Williams).Alan barely has time to register how much time has passed when he realises there are more rules to JUMANJI then he thought. Everything that has come out of the game so far will stay in our world until a player reaches the end. But getting to the end is easier said than done. The more moves they make, the more dangerous things come out of the game. Reuniting with an adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), our foursome must tackle JUMANJI'S dangers and finish the game once and for all.Although there's not much to Jumanji plot-wise (a trait it shares with Jurassic Park), there are enough thrills and spills going on you'll barely have time to notice. No sooner have our heroes survived one deadly encounter, the film throws in another. That type of dynamic is really what drives the film, and there are times where Jumanji feels repetitive.But it has a decent cast to carry things along nicely. Robin Williams plays it relatively straight, but then I usually prefer his more dramatic roles to his larger than life ones, so it didn't bother me. And compared to most of the sugary shite he was churning out during this period, Jumanji was a nice change of pace. Bonnie Hunt adds some of her own comic touch, who's been left a nervous wreck after witnessing what happened to Alan as a child.The children are not that bad either. That's one thing I like about Joe Johnston's films. The children in his films actually have a shred of dignity to their characters, and are not nearly as precocious as they might have been in the hands of a less able director.Jumanji is certainly imaginative. We get quite a menagerie of creatures on display. Stampeding elephants and rhinos. Giant spiders. Man-eating plants and vines. This could all be a mite too scary for younger kids. But I first saw Jumanji at the age of 12, and I loved it. There are nice touches of humour throughout that help offset the scarier scenes. And there's a funny running gag about a policeman's car that gets slowly wrecked by the different things coming out of the game.Unfortunately, when it comes to the CGI, the effects are nowhere near as dazzling as Jurassic Park's dinosaurs. The filmmakers just haven't got the hang of using CGI. The monkeys especially look fake. And some of the animatronics could have been handled better. Those spiders are very jerky when they move.But the film more than makes up for its shortcomings in the action scenes. Joe Johnston seems to get a certain glee watching his CGI creations running rampant destroying everything, in much the same way Joe Dante did in Gremlins.It's certainly not a boring film. The indoor monsoon is my favourite part, where Alan has to wrestle a crocodile! It's fairly inventive too, when Alan nearly gets swallowed up after the floor turns to quicksand. And the earthquake. Brilliant!If you can simply switch your brain to autopilot and try not to think too much, you'll be in for a fun ride. Overall, Jumanji may be a bit shallow, but you'll find it difficult not to get sucked in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie plays. In comes zoo. Who's that laughing? Why it's you!Jumanji never made a big splash (though the PR engine tried its best) but it's a clever little fantasy about a magical board game that changes reality. The special effects are laughable and enjoyable at the same time, particularly the stampede, and altogether it's a fun jaunt. Surprisingly, considering that the rest of cast is mostly up-and-comers, Robin Williams doesn't dominate the film, but adds the right touch of insanity to the whole affair.But, like many Williams vehicles, there's a heavy "let children be children" component, as well as a domineering father figure who somehow just can't show his love for his child. Ignore all that, and just enjoy the game.7 of 10 from me.</fullReview>

Parrish has father issues with a hunter, the boy turns into a monkey, and Dunst just stands around waiting for 2002.See it, and remember how good you thought it was, and how poor it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Jumanji' is a film about a board game that becomes real. It's an original and creative idea, but I think it gets old pretty quickly. By the end of the film, I had had enough of Robin Williams; Robin Williams is okay in small doses, but I find his humour in a particular film to get old pretty quickly. I felt that this happened in 'Jumanji'. It's probably a film that children will appreciate more than adults. There is some good humour in it involving jungle-related incidents like rampage monkeys and quicksand and growing vines. It's a creative and original idea, and it's one that they are going to do again but this time with a space-themed board game instead of a jungle-themed one. Kids will probably really enjoy it, but I think adults will get board quickly when faced with the same humour and same situations. Not bad, but not excellent either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might actually have been better without words.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jumanji is the movie Night at the Museum (which also stars Robin Williams) wishes it could be what with all the creatures magically coming to life and running amok. My question is... Why would any movie strive to be Jumanji?... Well, I suppose it is a successful and memorable family film, but honestly, how much better does that make it? Based on the wordless children's book, "Jumanji" is the name of a jungle-themed board game that two recently parentless children happen upon. When the kids roll the dice, their game-pieces magically (or magnetically) move, and if the game says something about monkeys or a ferocious lion, monkeys or a lion actually appear in their home. Robin Williams pops out of the game as a past Jumanji player who spent his childhood surviving animals and a hunter in the game's jungle world. Since his piece is still on the board along with another's piece, the girl who watched him get sucked into the game (played in all-grown-up form by Bonnie Hunt), they have to help the kids end the game/destruction of the town. My favorite scene is when the monkeys are terrorizing In Living Color alum David Alan Grier in his squad car... although I just can't stop wondering why the filmmakers didn't use real animals instead of the awful, blatant CGI. Ultimately, the film's marketing is what hurts it the most: funnyman Williams is over-dramatic, the movie's style is more freakish than fun, depth is attempted in double-casting Jonathan Hyde as William's hunter and father... Jumanji lies to its audience in every fathomable way, but at least it still has a sense of adventure, which I guess is good...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Man Tate disappears in jungle for 26 years, comes back as Robin Williams?.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to transport yourself back to late 1995 when Jumanji was released into theaters. The movie-going public was still waiting eagerly for another stupendous family adventure to follow Jurassic Park, which blew away audiences of all ages despite some grisly scenes. The badly disappointing Congo had been released earlier in the year but younger audiences were recently charmed by the animated adventures of Pocahontas, while more mature audiences were considering the implications of Outbreak and reminiscing with the brilliant re-creation of the 1960s in Apollo 13. Teenage audiences (which included myself) were mostly still running around the high schools quoting Clueless or ranting and raving about the (now primitive) technological wonders of The Net, although in my own circle of friends we were more interested in the techno- criminals in Hackers, the pure, unfiltered awesomeness of Seven and that amazing blonde who got naked in Species. Oh, and I was ditching school on an almost daily basis with one of the owners of this very website and sneaking over to Fashion Island and watching Ace Ventura over and over.Sadly, Jumanji was a definite step backwards in almost all adventure movie departments. The special effects more than anything else are a conspicuous regression, but the biggest problem is that the effects sequences themselves are so disjointed from the rest of the movie. It all starts with a quick sequence taking place in 1869 where two kids bury a magical board game called Jumanji in a wooden chest in the woods. This is about the extent of our knowledge of the game, by the way. There is a whole other movie that takes place before this one begins, without which Jumanji is left with a gaping plot hole. But no matter, the important thing is that this is a board game is so hellacious and fearsome that the kids fear for the soul of anyone who happens to dig it up in the future. No word on why they didn't just burn it.Cut to 1969, where a young boy named Alan Parrish happens upon the chest at the site where his father is overseeing the construction of his shoe factory. He takes it home and plays a game with his friend Sarah. The game pieces snap into position without being touched and move themselves once the dice are rolled, but even more amazing are the physical manifestations of dangerous safari creatures and other mayhem conjured up by the game. After Alan and Sarah have each taken a turn (Alan's even accidentally), Alas has been sucked off into Jumanji, wherever that is, and Sarah has taken off down the street, pursued by a squeaking mass of bats.Then we jump ahead again, this time 26 years into the future to the modern day (1995). The house has been empty for years and a new family move in. The two kids, Judy (a young Kirsten Dunst) and Peter find the game and begin to play, opening the door to Jumanji and bringing back things like lions and monkeys and Alan Parrish, now a grown, hairy man without the benefit of any human contact for the vast majority of his life. It turns out that the only way to stop the black magic of the game is to get to the end and say "Jumanji." And since Alan and Sarah were in the middle of an unfinished game for all of those years, they are now in the middle of a four-person game with Judy and Peter and they must all take their respective turns until someone makes it to the end. Sarah, of course, has suffered a life of diminished credibility ever since she claimed that Alan disappeared into a board game when she was a child. So much for the truth setting you free!The movie is structured as a series of special effects sequences involving whatever dangerous manifestation results from each person's turn rolling the dice. They all scramble frantically in the face of new dangers every ten or fifteen minutes or so, then the dangers disappear neatly for the next person to take their turn, and so on until the end of the movie. It's not exactly the most imaginative structuring going on here, but I will admit that the ending has a little twist that, while it includes one of the cheapest happy Hollywood copout moves in movies (they also pulled the same thing in Click), I would be lying if I said it wasn't at least a little heartwarming. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie is geared toward kids around 10 years old, the same age as the kids in the movie, but it also contains some imagery and some situations that kids that age would find much too frightening or intense. There is a scene involving giant spiders that admittedly look like nothing other than big plastic spider-puppets but that is still just as creepy as anything in Arachnophobia. So beware if you have a fear of creepy crawlies!I would be lying if I said the movie wasn't at all fun or entertaining. The story is told in an unconventional way, but it's also true that it's an unconventional story, which at least makes it a little more interesting. But in retrospect it's a little hard to get over how perfectly everything is arranged as a setup for the ending. The relationships between Alan and Sarah and between the two of them and the other two kids who, needless to say, are orphans, will seem a little too perfect for some people. The characters are not uninteresting and the performances are satisfactory, but unfortunately they all take second billing to an ambitious special effects team that doesn't seem to know when their half-baked digital creations are helping to drive the movie along and when they're just swallowing everything else up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! First of all, my #1 favorite actress is Kirsten Dunst, who plays Judy! I have seen Kirsten in countless other films including: Bring It On, Disney's Anastasia, Mona Lisa Smile, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 (June 30), and (Duh!) Jumanji of course. We have a lot in common. I am a HUGE fan of Robin Williams as well. He has played in films that I've seen such as: Mrs. Doubtfire, (also starring Pierce Brosnan who plays the worlds greatest Secret Agent: Bond, James, Bond. Robin has also been in: Disney's Aladdin (The Genie), Patch Adams, Flubber, Biscentanial Man, and Hook. I have seen Bonnie Hunt in her t.v. show, Life With Bonnie, and Cheaper By The Dozen starring the ever sooooo funny comedian Steve Martin and my sister's favorite actress Hilary Duff. I have a lot of favorite actor's but only one actress, and that's Kirsten! When I first saw her in Jumanji I fell in love with her. She is one beautiful young lady. I didn't know who she was though, LOL!!! I didn't recognize her in Spider-Man "sigh". As I looked at the credit's I saw a name: Kirsten Dunst. I remember seeing that name in the end credit's for Jumanji. I just about fainted, LOL!!!! I rented Jumanji again, and I looked at her and I realized: "Wow, she hasn't changed a bit!" "She's still got those big Blue eye's that I just love," she hasn't lost her sense of humor," and I will always, always, ALWAY'S LOVE HER SMILE! Every movie I've seen her in, she's always been a really hot Redhead, Well, in Jumanji she wasn't a redhead, but, SHE WAS STILL HOT! LOL!!!! She's a legend, to me. I looked at her biography on IMDb.com and I saw that she was born on April 30,1982! I just about fell out of my chair. LOL!!! I was born April 10,1988!!!!!! She's six years older than me, but heck! I still love her. But, I'll always remember her as that little girl named Judy in Jumanji! My favorite line that she said was when the Cop commented on Robin's clothes for the first time: "He's a Vegetarian! I was sucking in air, I was laughing so hard. Another scene was in the rain in Jumanji when Robin and Bonnie were about to kiss, and Kirsten is in the back rolling her eyes! LOL!!! That brought be back to the upside down kiss in the rain in Spider-Man! Jumanji is a fun movie! It can be a little intense sometimes, but it can also be funny. One last thing: KIRSTEN DUNST IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY FAVORITE ACTRESS! THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining...but one major problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB "User Rating" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7.However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of "finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal").I kept yelling at the screen, "Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay." Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A previous reviewer wrote:"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie."I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of "big problems" with this movie!"Random hazard generator" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for "plot" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension.Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of "random hazards" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game?Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human "random hazard" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end.All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop "random hazards," poor CGI effects, "lots of screaming and running around" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each "random hazard," the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the clich of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichs.The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Williams's careless comments in the 2003 DVD version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrarily to what the greatly lamented Mr Robin Williams affirms in his commentary, Jonathan Hyde had already appeared in quite a few movies (at least 42!) before Jumanji -- sometimes as the leading man, such as in The Best of Everything (2000), Woman Obsessed (1989) and Bijoutiers du clair de lune, Les (1988), aka Heaven Fell That Night (UK) or The Night Heaven Fell (USA). As good as his comments are, I deplore the fact that Mr Williams did not seem to bother to check his sources before uttering his remarks. And so, generally speaking, they seem VERY improvised -- with many repetitions, generalizations (such as : Brit actors tend to be better than American ones (!), etc. And, alas, not too many precise FACTS or behind-the-scenes details. This being said with sincerity and honesty, we're going to miss you, dear Mr Robin Williams : may your career rest in peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end is near!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is.Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused.The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening.Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package.Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing.All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Below average action adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew Jumanji was never going to burst with intelligence or be driven by great performances, and yet despite this I was quite looking forward to it as a holiday blockbuster. Well to put it in simple terms that was a mistake. The films plot stands a chance of being the most convoluted of the year with so many back stories it only ever annoys. It starts of with a young boy called Alan Parish who gets sucked into a board game, at this point I should have left as it only gets more idiotic. After this incident we flash forward twenty years to find two new children have found the game. They unleash Alan who is now grown up and played by an irritating Robin Williams. Along with him an assortment of Jungle beasties are unleashed into their quiet neighbourhood. The kids and Alan must complete the game to restore everything but with every throw of the dice more horrors await. The film resembles an ameturish pantomine in every respect a part from the visual effects. Director Joe Johnston also responsible for the mediocre Honey I shrunk the Kids should have treated the audience like adults, then the film might have gone somewere. However as the movie doesn't treat us like adults and depends totally on its special effects I think its safe to say its a failure. The performances particularly from the children and Robin Williams are predictable and annoying. Jumanji might entertain under 7's or those with IQ's under 50 but for the rest of us it simply is a heavily flawed and rather rubbish piece of cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame, lamer, lamest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess this must be meant to appeal to kids, because has that R.L. Stein flavor to it -- you can't suspend disbelief because the whole thing is just so cheesy and lame. The closet thing to an interesting character is Carl the cop -- although Sara seeing a shrink after watching Alan vanish IS a hoot.Fine for the kids, but adults would do better with a book and a hot bath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for 13+ age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see "Jumanji". Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recommended only to those who find elephant destruction awe-inspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took four--count 'em, FOUR--screenwriters to conjure up this adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's book about a man imprisoned in a supernatural board-game, freed by two precocious tots, setting off a chain-reaction of incredible disasters. Muddy, confused sideshow is mindlessly busy, held together for the most part by the special effects. The film is slickly designed to appeal to hyperactive kids, yet it hasn't an ounce of brains--or any sensitivity to the humans or animals involved. Directed in a soulless, sledgehammer style by Joe Johnston and starring Robin Williams, sadly at his lowest ebb. * from ****</fullReview>
