		<fullReview>MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE (4 outta 5 stars)I never really thought this was anywhere near the best work of the Pythons... but, the more I see this movie, the more I like it. People not in tune with the Python sense of humour will find this film unbearable I'm sure. (When I saw it in the theatre when it first came out there were an incredible numbers of walkouts... even *before* the infamous "Mr. Creosote" scene.) Not an actual movie so much as an extended (and expensively-produced) episode of the classic BBC TV series "Monty Python's Flying Circus"... depicting several stages in the lives of human beings, from birth to death. There are some hilarious bits (the sex education class, Death crashing a dinner party), some clever bits (the opening fish skit, the show-stopping dance number "Every Sperm is Sacred") and some just plain gross, disgusting bits (Mr. Creosote, organ donations). Plus, the movie has its own special short subject "The Crimson Permanent Assurance"... where an accounting office staffed by aging workerbees suddenly metamorphosizes into a pirate ship! Most people find this bit incredibly boring and pointless... but, dang, its cleverly done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monty Python's final film adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famous British comedy troupe, Monthy Python, crafted this bizarre collections of their special brand of humor as their last film together; loosely tied by the common theme of the everlasting search for the Meaning of Life, this series of sketches make a very good closure for their film adventures, as it seems as a return to their roots in the TV show "Flying Circus" and dedicated to long time fans. Nevertheless, this may also be a turn off for fans expecting something akin to "Holy Grial" or "Life of Brian".Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones direct the segments that form "The Meaning of Life", divided in the diverse stages of human development (from birth to death), the action flows with ease; although due to the nature of the film, some sketches are definitely better than other. It's safe to say that this movie contains some of the best and the worst the troupe has done; however, their most mediocre work is still better than most modern comedy out there.The movie also foresees the future careers of both Gilliam and Jones as directors; their film style (particularly Gilliam's) is now mature and almost fully developed. Gilliam's short "The Crimson Permanent Assurance" is an outstanding segment that could even stand alone on its own, and that presents Gilliam fully in form as a wild fantasy director.While this was their last film, the group seems to be at its peak when talking about acting; from John Cleese's Dr. Spenser to Graham Chapman's near perfect impersonation of Tony Bennet, the acting never lets down, and even when some scripts are dull even for their time, the Pythons as actors never disappoint.Something worth to notice are the great quality of the songs performed in the film. they are not only written with their high quality witty humor, musically they work very well and rank among the best the group has written in their history together.Still, the movie may be overlong and at times tedious to people not used to the team's brand of humor. Specially considering that "The Meaning of Life" has more in common with their early roots than with what made them famous. Also, probably some of the jokes are definitely outdated now; however, "The Meaning of Life" is a very good display of the gang's different sides.While maybe not as ingenious as "Holy Grail" and definitely nowhere near the masterpiece "Life of Brian", the Pythons last movie is still a very good comedy to watch. However, this certain brand of humor may be appealing only to fans of the Python's TV work, as it has more of those early roots than of their past film adventures. 8/10. An acquired taste indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody good "Python"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment you start watching "Monty Python's Meaning of Life", and you see the unexpected movie within the movie "The Crimson Permanent Assurance", in which an office building turns into a pirate ship, you know you're in for one hell of a surreal ride. "Meaning of Life" is the Pythons at the zenith of their lunacy, filled with shocking moments of violence, offensive behavior, repulsive bodily functions, and all sorts of jaw-dropping bric a brac. Whether or not the movie truly intends to make us ponder the meaning of life or not is debatable, but you have a great time watching it. With an aquarium full of fish as a sort of Greek chorus, we explore the 3 stages of life: birth, growth, and death. The faint of heart better beware: "Meaning of Life" has scenes that would, even today, barely fly in the land of the Puritans. Michael Palin, as a dirt-poor father of 100 children, leads an epic musical number against birth control. Eric Idle, while singing about the vastness of the universe, witnesses a constellation take form of a naked woman giving birth. John Cleese plays a headmaster who teaches sex ed by having intercourse with his wife in front of his class (it's easily the least erotic sex scene in cinema history). And, in "Meaning of Life"'s most famous scene, the revolting, gluttonous Mr. Creosote (Terry Jones) literally eats until he explodes. The film lampoons several touchy topics: Catholic dogma, basic human stupidity and selfishness, the foolishness of war (in a brilliant parody of "Zulu", with Michael Caine in a brief cameo), and even death itself (one man is able to choose his death, in which he is chased off a cliff by a mob of topless women). Yet it's not entirely gratuitous. In fact, the Pythons make several good points: birth control shouldn't be denied to anyone, especially those too poor to have children. Gluttony is wrong, and will in time punish you itself. We only live once, so we better enjoy the ride. It's no-holds-barred madness, and it's Monty Python at their best. "Meaning of Life" doesn't have the same cult following as "Holy Grail", but it's certainly one of their best. If you can't handle gore, sex, vomiting, or lunacy, steer clear. For those willing to take the chance, check out "Monty Python's Meaning of Life" and maybe we'll figure out, as the title song says, if "mankind's evolving, or is it too late?".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More hilarity on film from the Monty Python team; this time, in sketch-comedy form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third and last real film by the Monty Python crew. First, they made fun of the medieval times and its beliefs. Then, they gave the earliest followers of Jesus a whooping'. Now, they... well, they pretty much cover every stage of life in the search for the 'meaning of life'. The film, unlike the two other ones(Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian) is basically a series of sketches(whereas the two aforementioned films had progressive plots), much like the series(Monty Python's Flying Circus). As such, it's pretty much like watching an episode of said series, if the episodes were nearly two hours long. Of course, this means that if you like the series, you'll like the film. To this date, I have yet to meet anyone who likes the group and doesn't like the series, so I guess it was a good idea. Despite the title, it has reasonably little actual philosophy and such, but I doubt any Python-fans will be completely devastated by this. As another new thing for a Python-film, it's also a musical. There have been one or two musical numbers during the previous films and the series, but nothing this major. There are about 8-9 musical scenes in the film, complete with choreographed dancing, lead singers and backup vocals. Of course, it's all done in typical Python-style, so not a single one of them is what you'd normally expect from a musical. The comedy is pretty much the same as usual from the Python troupe, with some misses, but mostly hits. Plot is pretty much nonexistent, but what there is, is good. The pacing is good, but because of the film's all-sketch content, it gets somewhat dull around the middle(as Cleese also points out in the 'making of' featured on the DVD). The acting is all pretty good. The special effects are nice. Not much else to say, since you already pretty much know the Pythons' style of humor from the series and the two earlier films. And if you don't, you should probably check out either of the films first, or, even better, one of the more sober episodes of the series. I recommend this to any fan of the Monty Python group, particularly those who prefer the Flying Circus over the two other films, since it's more sketch-comedy than the others. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Best but, it's still Python</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After The Life of Brian and The Holy Grail, this film had a lot to do to keep up. The python boys are going to explain to you the meaning of life, in the only way they know how, brilliantly and stupidly.Not entirely linear this is like lots of mini movies, depicting the the stages of life, from birth to death, with episodes such as learning and fighting each other in between.Each short film is well made and they all lend a comic viewpoint to there particular place in life.My favourite is probably death (the grim reaper is just so cool), or perhaps its fighting each other, or.....What the hell there all good fun.Don't worry about the opening movie, it nothing like the rest of the film and it does grow on you.8/10 If you don't like python stay away, if you've never seen them, then give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pythons' Last Stand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Meaning of Life" as a whole is clearly not Monty Python's best work, yet some of the individual sketches - the film is really just a big-budget sketch show - provide some of their most inspired moments. But overall, this is not the sort of swansong that befits the Monty Python legend.Part of the problem is that, when the film was made (1983), British comedy was in the grip of the "alternative" revolution, as a new generation of comic writer/performers (Ben Elton, Rik Mayall, Ade Edmondson, etc) were beginning their rise to stardom and making the Python brand of humour look hopelessly out-of-date - alternative comedy was essentially comedy's "punk" to the "prog-rock" of Python.The film opens with a beautifully-shot, but utterly pointless Terry Gilliam creation, "The Crimson Permanent Assurance", which serves little purpose other than to provide a set-up for a gag later in the film. When the film proper begins, though, the familiar Pythonesque humour kicks in, and normal business is resumed, albeit patchily.The highlights for me are the "Live Organ Transplants" sketch, in which a man has his liver forcibly removed on his own kitchen table, and "Mr Creosote", the grossly fat diner who gorges and vomits his way to an explosive demise, both of which are the type of gross-out gags which have always found a place in British humour - even today, the "League of Gentlemen" team are proudly carrying on this tradition.Also, some of the songs in the film are among Python's best, particularly "Every Sperm Is Sacred", a wonderfully over-the-top song-and-dance number, and the cheesey "Christmas In Heaven", in which Graham Chapman gives the greatest Tony Bennett impersonation ever committed to celluloid. Unfortunately, much of the remaining material is meandering and tedious, and just serves to pad the thing out to its already over-long 107 minutes.Python fans will find a lot to amuse them in "The Meaning of Life", but don't expect it to be another "Holy Grail" or "Life of Brian" - it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great comedy which may be crass and rude, but is not lacking in typical Python wit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life" is without a doubt the short film that opens it. Directed by Terry Gilliam and originally conceived as an animated sequence, "The Crimson Permanent Assurance" is a crucial step in Gilliam's career as a director. His previous two solo efforts as director, the inconsequential "Jabberwocky" and the brilliant-in-its-own-way "Time Bandits" saw him developing his visual style much further than he did for his scenes for "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", with "Time Bandits" arguably being the first 'Gilliam-esque' film he made. Still, "Time Bandits" didn't see his style fully developed, and "The Crimson Permanent Assurance" is an even more bizarre film, but with a far more confident and clear-cut visual style. Simply put: Gilliam was ready for "Brazil". This segment is the best in the film from a cinematic viewpoint, without a doubt, and even gives some of the other segments a run for their money in terms of the quality of the comedy, which involves office clerks who become pirates. Yes, it is quite strange.The issue a lot of people have with "The Meaning of Life" is that it is crass and rude and even sillier than the Python standard. It's shock humor, but for the majority of the sections of the film work so well and are so clever even in their lack of class that I would not hesitate to put "The Meaning of Life" on the same level as "Life of Brian", though it's not as good as "Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail". That's not to say this isn't 'Python-esque', because it's very much so, they're just completely liberated by the medium of film to say and do whatever they please. Indeed, there's something in here to offend nearly anyone, but there's also a fair bit in here to please everyone, even a wonderful scene in which Gilliam's 'supporting feature' "The Crimson Permanent Assurance" suddenly intrudes on the events of the film."The Meaning of Life" is constructed as a series of skits, and though many have suggested that it is hence not as much of a narrative movie as their previous two efforts. I tend to disagree with this viewpoint. Yes, this film is a series of skits, but they are all elaborately set up within an overarching 'commentary' on the general theme of the movie, the title. There is one section of the film which is both entirely unnecessary and honestly quite bad is 'The Autumn Years', an unfunny and vile piece centered around Terry Jones in a fat-suit repeatedly vomiting and eventually exploding. Basically all of the rest of the film is very, very funny, and even the jokes which fall flat within scenes like "Live Organ Transplants" and "Death" don't go terribly wrong because the overall quality of the scenes and sections are so high and the concepts behind them very funny. Gilliam's animations work excellently within the film and this would sadly be the last time we saw a distinctive Gilliam animation within a major film."The Meaning of Life" is great comedy. It's crass and rude and goes for cheap humor often, but it's mostly handled with a great deal of wit and intelligence that elevates even the section involving the world's most pornographic sex education class to a high level. Perhaps in retrospect this film's flaws are more obvious than those "Life of Brian" suffers from, but both are ultimately on the same level.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Palin sums it up best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Meaning of Life finds the Monty Python boys going back to their Flying Circus roots in a film that examines the many stages of life, and reduces them all to the absurdity that one would expect from these six loons. A very neat short film from Terry Gilliam starts off this search for the meaning of life and we go from birth, to examining the benefits of being a Prostestant. From there we are treated to war, live organ transplants, a very bizarre middle section of the film, sex education, Terry Jones puking and exploding in what has to be one of the most disgusting but extremely funny scenes ever committed to film. It all leads up to death, and I personally like Grahm Chapman's way of execution. It all winds up in Heaven, where every day is Christmas and it's all set up like a Las Vegas lounge show. At the end, Michael Palin gives us the meaning of life. I think he's right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>least in the Python 'trilogy', but parts are wildly successful and memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking a slight departure from the story structure of The Holy Grail and Life of Brian, the Monty Python troupe went back to their 'Flying Circus' TV days to cook up this philosophical, musical, ultra-violent, sexual, total stream-of-consciousness look into what makes up our lives, and if there is a meaning to it. It's split up into parts, starting off with the Miracle of Birth (extending into the Miracle of Birth in the Third Role), a part on war, a part on sex, and so forth. This time Python goes even further with the outrageousness, the delayed punch-lines, the wit, almost nothing is taken prisoners. They go after religion, children, schooling, business, fat people, television, you name it, they go for it, all in the quest for the 'meaning of life'.I saw the film twice last year, and bits on TV, and I had pretty much the same reaction the second time as the first. Like with many of Python's sketches, the strengths usually out-weigh the weaknesses, depending on who's stronger in the bit; I loved the Miracle of Birth number with Michael Palin's "Every Sperm is Sacred" song, which spirals into one of director Terry Jones's most inspired numbers; I had big belly laughs when Gilliam, as a resident, got an impromptu kidney operation, as the bystanders barely seemed affected; the Mr. Creoste sketch was crude, but blatantly over the top; the timing in the school scenes and the battlefield scenes was very sharp. But in the end, the parts are more memorable than really on the whole, un-like with the other two films. They set themselves up for a challenge- to make a comedy successful without the sort of core that was in Holy Grail (the search by King Arthur and other knights) and Life of Brian (a man mistaken to be the messiah). Sketches and specifics in the Python world are when they're at their best, and aspects like the animation and the overall scheme of getting the punchlines (or lack thereof) right isn't affected. What can be said is that some of the bits that don't work well as others keep one wanting to get to the next best bit- luckily, this all leads up to a manic scene of Chapman running away from dozens of naked women. It's always a spectacular romp with the Pythons, and even when they're at their worst and most vile and and strange (there is one scene I have no explanation for), its watchable. Maybe some scenes, like with other comedies from my childhood that I'm still amused by, will become funnier as time goes on, like little in-jokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leave it to Monty Python's Flying Circus to create something like this. "The Meaning of Life" opens with a sketch about a bunch of overworked accountants taking revenge on the yuppie bankers, Errol Flynn-style. Then, the movie shows the various stages of life. Among these displays are an explanation of why "every sperm is sacred", John Cleese's demonstration of having sex, Terry Jones as a man who has quite literally had too much to eat (and continues having too much), and finally, death - prior to which you are chased by half-dressed women.Anyway, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones do their usual stuff.

		<fullReview>This one and "The Life of Brian" top their list, in my humble opinion. Each time this rolls around on cable TV I expect finally to find it boring but rarely do. If I can make it to the second sketch, the aquarium with the fish, I'm hooked. Now, I can't spell out too many of the situations without ruining the surprises, but I can't resist those fish.We see an underwater scene with a fake fish swimming slowly back and forth. Another fish enters and they exchange gruff, "Good mornings." One by one other fish swim into the scene and each time, there is the same "good morning" exchange, very ritualized and formal. There is a brief conversation between the fishes. (All of them have hideous humanoid face.) "Anything new?" "Wot?" "I say, anything new?" "No, nothing much new." One of the fishes faces the camera and exclaims, "Look! Howard's being EATEN." And the camera shows us that the fish are in a restaurant aquarium, the kind from which ultra-fresh live fish are hand picked to serve as an entrée.We see the fussily dressed waiter bending down to show the customer his nicely prepared decapitate piscine preparation."Hmmm," one of the fish wonders aloud. "Makes you THINK, doesn't it?" Then the opening credits roll -- "Monty Python's Meaning of Life." Granted this description loses something in being transposed from one medium to another, but if you don't find this amusing you may not appreciate the rest of the film.There are some dozen or so sketches, none of which fall entirely flat, but some of which are stronger than others. The most offensive by far is the fat man, M. Creosote, who waddles into a fancy French restaurant in the fattest FAT SUIT known to man or beast. He literally drags his belly along the floor. The staff rush to seat him and cater to him. (Throughout the film, much of the humor derives from the unflappability of the cast, no matter how dire the circumstances -- selling one's children for use is scientific experiments, losing a leg ("Woke up and -- one sock too many") or death. The waiters provide the rebarbative M. Creosote with a bucket to puke into and M. Creosote uses it -- not delicately but voluminously, all over the floor and the other diners. When he's eaten and drunk what appears to be the entire stock of the restaurant, no more than a tiny head on a balloon of a body, dribbling vomit, the waiter entices him into trying just one more dessert, wafer thin. The waiter gingerly feeds it to him, then dives behind a wall as M. Creosote explodes like a bomb, drenching the entire interior of the establishment and causing all the other customers to become ill.I see I've already ruined two gags. Okay. I'll try reining myself in. But I'm compelled to mention some dialog in the scene in which death visits a quartet of diners at home because of some tainted salmon mousse. An American man in a loud jacket and tie removes his pipe and begins to argue with the Grim Reaper. "Shuddup!" orders the Reaper. "All you Americans talk too much. You talk and talk. You say things like, 'I wanna tell you something,' and 'Just lemme say this!'" I'm laughing too hard to go on and it's just as well that I quit now. But maybe I should add that the last sketch, following Death, shows us a heaven staged like a Las Vegas show, and it's ridiculed. Maybe Monty Python, in deliberately throwing away any attempt to define the meaning of life, has bootlegged a philosophy into the story after all. Marcus Aurelius recommended "waiting for death with a cheerful mind" and observed that "death looks at all of us and the best we can do is smile back." Like other Stoics, he assumed that people should not fear that which is natural. "Why should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according to nature" Albert Einstein described his own attitude towards death in similar terms. "It is a natural event." If you're uncertain about this being your cup of tea, my advice would be to watch it for ten or fifteen minutes. If you aren't grabbed by then, watch something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Meaning of Life' may not appeal to everyone. Even I find some of the sketches too vulgar and a few to be repulsive but that's Monty Pythn for you: sometimes stupid, sometimes outrageous and sometimes funny. The sketch that I enjoyed most was the one with the old office workers fighting with the corperates of modern day. I was also morbidly fascinated by the organ donor sketch. The team: Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and others do a good job of acting, writing and directing. Yes, it might not be everyone's cup of tea but those familiar with the Monty Python series know what kind of humour to expect. I enjoyed lots of it but the one with the fat guy at the restaurant was disgusting to watch. On a final note, the special features on the DVD are worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big step down, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Meaning of Life is the most tasteless and offensive film Monty Python ever made, and it revels in that. The Pythons go out of their way to offend and shock the audience as much as possible to show how far they will go to get a laugh. The movie deliberately touches every wrong chord to get to its audience, and in its own way, the shocking bits of the film are a bit entertaining. Rather than telling a more-or-less coherent story like the two previous Monty Python films, The Holy Grail and Life of Brian, The Meaning of Life consists of mostly unrelated sketches, similar in format to the troupe's original brilliant Flying Circus sketch show. Unfortunately, also like Flying Circus, The Meaning of Life features sketches that simply aren't funny. But while Flying Circus's funny moments far outnumbered the unfunny ones, The Meaning of Life seems to have more scenes that didn't get a laugh from me than those that did. It's not a bad comedy, and it contains some hilarious scenes, but often I found myself just watching the movie and just feeling bored or uncomfortable. However, when I wasn't bored, I was often shocked by some of the film's content. The most shocking scene of all centers Terry Jones as one Mr. Creosote, a cartoonishly obese man who vomits all over his table in a restaurant, fills up a few buckets with his vile yellow projectile vomit, and even on the restaurant staff. And just when you think the scene couldn't possibly get more disgusting, a waiter (played by John Cleese) decides to take matters into his own hands. Mr. Creosote is stuffed with food, but Cleese gives him a thin mint anyway. He then runs and hides behind some restaurant furniture as Mr. Creosote slowly expands and then explodes all over everybody and everything in the restaurant. The scene is totally disgusting and revolting, but at the same time it's hilarious as it shows just how far the Pythons will go to get a laugh. The entire film mocks everyone and everything in life. It's possibly the most egotistical film Monty Python ever made, and it's certainly the boldest. However, it is, unfortunately, not a particularly good film. I wouldn't call it bad, it's Monty Python and naturally there's going to be good in it, but it fails to reach the troupe's usual greatness and brilliance. Fortunately, we still have 2 other cinematic masterpieces by Python to watch. So a third one that isn't so great isn't all that bad, is it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting, Obscene, Disgraceful; and downright hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was introduced to Monty Python a few weeks ago by a friend who let me borrow their movie collection on DVD. I have still got it with me, and have watched all the films at least twice. I have to admit, the humour and format is a bit out of date, but when you consider it's all over 20 years old and all still funny, you realise how ingenious it actually is. Anyhow, despite what other fans have said, this is almost certainly Monty Python's best film. Sure, it doesn't quite have the satirical cleverness of Life of Brian, sure it isn't as creative as Holy Grail, and despite the fact a lot of fans like this because it's quite similar to the flying circus show, it doesn't get as close to that as 'Now for something completely different' did (probably because that contained sketches directly from the show), and sure, John Cleese denied rewriting the script, which would of made the film even better, but it does have one thing that the show; or any of the other movies for that matter; doesn't have... Conplete and utter frequent obscenity. Seriously, from the beginning to the end it's got sexual, near blasphemous, and death based humour, but because I was watching it with my brother and not mother or any older generation, I hardly noticed. That was, until the live organ transplant scene. Seriously, that was the funniest, most shocking scene I have ever seen in Monty Python, or possibley ever. You have to watch it to get it, but damn. It's also got everything Monty Python's stuff other stuff has got, including an incredibly surreal 'middle of the film' Your'll love this film if you like Monty Pythons unique brand of humour, or if you enjoy fatalist, dark, sexual, toilet, violent, offencive or any other kind of shock value humour. Oh yeah, It's also got Boobies. I think it also contains the f-word a few times, but I don't think it was used more than in Life of Brian so from that side it was less obscene, but on the whole, this is the live-action, plot less, philosophical South Park movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Now For Something Completely Wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cancer that robbed us of Graham Chapman in 1989 not only snuffed out the life of one of Britain's great eccentrics, it also left this sad, shaky undigested lump of a film as the last will and testament of that great comedy troupe he so stolidly centered, Monty Python's Flying Circus.Like the first Python film more than a decade before, "And Now For Something Completely Different", this was a collection of sketches. But rather than refining material first performed on the BBC, the six Pythons created a wholly new piece more or less about the purpose of human existence. The patchwork nature of this project is hard to ignore and even commented upon within the film, but the real problem with "Meaning Of Life" is how sourly unfunny it manages to be.Have you ever wondered about how so many philosophers have the letter "S" in their names? Neither have I, but the Pythons manage to beat this frail idea into the ground, in the form of Michael Palin and Eric Idle as a pair of middle-aged Americans stuck for dinner conversation. How about organ donation? It turns out a cruel, bloody trick played on Terry Gilliam as a Jewish Rastafarian for some bizarre reason. War is cruel, especially when you are a World War I officer enacted by Terry Jones whose troops decide to throw him a surprise birthday party in the midst of battle.John Cleese manages to come off best by appearing in the one good sketch here, a pedantic schoolmaster so mindnumbingly boring he can't keep his class interested even while showing them how he has sex with his wife. "As you can see, I have now entered...oh, do try paying attention!" Cleese avoids most of the rest of the movie, another plus for him. Those Callard &amp; Bowser commercials probably seemed a better idea at the time, and they were.On a commentary track for the DVD, principal director Jones and Gilliam, who directed a meandering opening sequence about pirate accountants and some smaller bits, talk very contentedly about the film, Gilliam enthusing about how smooth and professional the troupe performed at this time. They are smooth, but rarely funny.The one sketch the two directors criticize in the whole film is a bit where two men dressed as a tiger apparently make off with someone's leg. It strikes them as very early Python, and indeed it is, from a time when their inspired, mind-warping silliness made them comedic successors to the Beatles, as George Harrison often maintained.The sketch is dodgy, but it's about the only glimmer of that old light to be found. Otherwise, the Pythons seem more interested in outraging viewers than entertaining them, with healthy doses of blood, vomit, and religion-bashing. There's a saying the worst thing you can give creative people is anything they want. That the Pythons enjoyed no censorship and a big budget puts them too often at their self-indulgent, lazy worst.Maybe the problem was that Cleese, Palin, Gilliam, and Idle had already struck out successfully as individuals by this point, and saw the whole Python deal as just a few extra bob rather than anything important. Maybe the long layoff since their last big project, "Life Of Brian", made them shyer about speaking their minds regarding weaknesses in each other's material. Maybe they needed to give Chapman more to do. He was the star in "Brian" and "Monty Python And The Holy Grail", a cheerfully daft center for the others to bounce off of. Here he stands out mostly for a scene where he is chased by a group of bare-breasted maidens.The breasts are nice, anyway; almost making up for the fact their placement has no point. Nothing has a point in "Meaning Of Life", and after more than 90 pointless minutes of it, you will never be so happy to see Death arrive to crash the party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nutty mixture of surreal and satiric bits abut the essential issues of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delightful as well as hilarious film but plenty with profanities , nudism , sex , grossing humor and obscenity . This film being the last Monty Python explores the meaning and aim of life in a lot of sketches from conception , boyhood , adult world , war , to death when the group suffered from food poisoning , then Grim Reaper brings for the final stage of human life and beyond .Irreverent and often sidesplitting satire of religion , Catholicism , Protestantism , traditional family , God and many other things . Monty Phyton performs a series of sketches about the life cycle from birth , existence to death in this often uproariously funny , sometimes tedious , movie . According to Michael Palin , the picture ranges from philosophy to history to medicine to halibut . Here the comedy team takes a look at life in all its stages in their own uniquely silly way , as they satirize and humorize almost everyone . ¨The meaning of life¨ , originally called "Monty Python's Fish Film" will probably offend some catholics , including many political and social comments . As it has a mercilessly critique to Roman Catholic in a sketch when a couple has quite a lot of children because 'every sperm is sacred' (the kids who sang the song later said they had no idea what they were singing about) ; being unknown to the rest of the team until later, director Terry Jones spent most of the budget for the film on the dancing and singing sequences . The bizarre "Find The Fish" sketch was filmed in the main control hall of Battersea Power Station, London . It was supposed to represent the weird dreams that we all experience from time to time , Terry Gilliam later expressed his regret that this aspect wasn't given a little more explanation . The best part of the film results to be the beginning with a stand-alone 17-minute supporting feature entitled The Crimson Permanent Assurance stunningly directed by Terry Gilliam ; it was filmed as if it were a completely separate project , Gilliam got his own sound-stage, crew and cast . This segment continued to expand because, according to Gilliam, nobody told him to stop . Furthermore , special mention to the death sketch, where Arthur Jarrett , Graham Chapman , has chosen to die while pursued by naked girls . Six cast members played a lot of characters such as Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones and Michael Palin . The talented cast also conceived and wrote all of the material . The characters they are seen playing last are as following: Graham Chapman as Tony Bennett, John Cleese as Death, Terry Gilliam as Howard Katzenberg, Eric Idle as Angela, Terry Jones as Mrs. Brown and Michael Palin as the Lady presenter . The last shot featuring all the Pythons together is when Death shows the six dead people 'Paradise' . You don't have to be British to enjoy the various political asides and lampoons . Lively Original Music by John Du Prez , including jolly final song sung by Eric Idle . Colorful as well as evocative Cinematography by Peter Hannan and Roger Pratt in segment "The Crimson Permanent Assurance". The motion picture was well directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam in animation and special sequence ; it won the Special Jury Grand prize at the Cannes film festival . While writing this film, the Python troupe decided to take a break and put on some shows at the famous Hollywood Bowl, which were filmed and released as Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982) . In 1965, filmmaker Terry Jones with his friend Michael Palin, made The Late Show (1966) for television, which was his first success and he wrote for many other TV shows . But Jones' greatest success was the zany Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969-74) (with Palin, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle) and other hits such as Jabberwocky , The meaning of life , Monty Python and the Holy Grail and ¨Life of Brian¨ , this is the tale of of a man whose life parallels Jesus ; it results to be the most sustained and funniest film from Britain's bad boys that may prove offensive to some and a sheer delight to others .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monty Python's Magnum Opus...but make sure you know Python first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I was expecting the "inspired lunacy" of Holy Grail. Of course, this was back when I was first getting to like Python which was a few years ago. I thought a couple of bits were funny but it didn't satisfy me as a whole. A few months back I saw the old VHS laying on the basement floor one day and decided to pop it in. I was floored. It was HILARIOUS! I love this movie and it seems like its more mature Python, which is NOT a bad thing. This movie is considered Monty Python's magnum opus and rightfully so. This is the Python movie to end all Python movies. Go out and get it now!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Understand The Humour of the Story You Will Enjoy It Immensely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The determination as to whether you liked "The Meaning of Life" depends if you found any of the humour in it funny. The reason so is because the film itself is just a variety of sketches made into the film rather than a concrete story arc with a standard plot along with well-developed characters as you follow along with on their journeys. Some people wouldn't mind the sketch-driven movie and others might find the whole idea very annoying. Whether concrete or not, the factor whether you enjoyed it or not depends on if you laughed at the scenes featured here. To me I really had a good time watching "The Meaning of Life" and the sketches were funnier than the stuff "Saturday Night Live" has been putting on in recent years. Still others may not have enjoyed it much and it's partially due to the certain type of humour that may have not caught on by many audience members. And if you can't decipher that kind of humour, you won't find "The Meaning of Life" funny at all.The bizarre humour here is naturally over-the-top and focuses its attention on the easy targets to its capacity. The comedy is formatted of characters being oblivious to the peculiar settings they are faced with or what's surrounding them or what they're getting themselves into. They don't think what they're doing is funny and succeed in keeping their manners sharp and straight and to me I find that both funny and effective at the same time. Also, you must keep in mind of some of the subliminal sight gags hidden behind the sketch, therefore, it also pays to keep your ears and your eyes open at all times. Just as well, this adds more credibility into making all the more hilarious.The individual segments are more superior to the other sketches and they they're not as effective in its comedy factor. Such funny scenes that provided a lot of laughs were when John Cleese was teaching his pupils the finer points of sex. Another memorable sketch was the Grim Reaper sketch, but the one that will make even the hardened stoic person chuckle is the slow-motion boobs. The midway sketches provided nothing but dead weight and were not too hilarious at all. This is followed by a segment featuring the world's fattest man, while it is still very funny, I thing they overdid with the gross out humour for too long that it wears out its welcome in rather short period of time. I really wince in pain by the sight of barf, therefore that sketch was hard to digest (no pun intended).Like I said earlier different people have contrary tastes in what kind of humour they like. "The Meaning of Life" is movie is no exception to the rule. Either you like the humour or you despise the humour. There are no moral lessons in the script any kind of important messages to follow. In fact all the serious issues implemented in the movie are being deliberately lampooned. Some of the sketches will make you cry in laughter and others will keep you waiting for the next scene to come. But I laughed quite frequently here and that's what really counts. I mean who couldn't laugh at such memorable quotations like, "stampede towards the clitoris!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very uneven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pythons are the ultimate when it comes to comedy - Flying Circus is incomparable, Holy Grail is a great slice of lunacy and Life of Brian is the best piece of satire I've ever seen, but this frankly is way below their usual standard. I put this down mainly to the fact that they were all off doing their own separate projects when they got together to write it and weren't as keen on compromise as they used to be. The main flaw is that it is, despite what they all say, a sketch film, and sketches are always a bit hit-or-miss. Oh, this certainly has its fair share of hits. Some scenes (Sex Education, Cannibalism, Every Sperm is Sacred) are hilariously and painfully true and revel in their own inspired silliness, just like the Pythons' earlier work, while some (Soldiers, Captain Biggs), though well-executed, would have worked better on Flying Circus. Others (Find the Fish, Crimson Permanent Assurance, Christmas in Heaven) fall flat, while a couple (which I don't think I even need to name) are unabashedly nasty, graphic, shocking and grisly, but I won't deny it, quite entertaining. One outstanding feature, though, is the music. A very clever idea somebody had was to present the film like a traditional musical, and all the little compositions are great songs in their own right, and hilariously dark in context. Which brings me round to the general feel of the film. The Holy Grail was pure silliness, Life of Brian was definitely black comedy, but with the odd upbeat moment, but the Meaning of Life is absolutely bleak. I don't mind this, in fact I like it, but some people will find it depressing and even slightly unsettling, so beware. I'll finish my critique on a good note, though - the performances of the six Pythons are always a joy to watch. Graham Chapman is brilliantly strange as ever, John Cleese's mad establishment figures are in full swing, Terry Gilliam gives us more surreal cameos and Eric Idle is, as always, wonderfully cheeky and effortlessly sexy, but the real standouts are the "nice guys" of the group - Michael Palin gets his own singing solo as a working-class Catholic Yorkshireman and plays it to the hills, and those of you who are used to curly-haired, sweet-looking Terry Jones are in for more than a bit of a shock when you meet his morbidly obese Cockney glutton, Mr Creosote. All in all, this is a very mixed, patchy film and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't familiar with the Pythons' other work first, but it does have its moments and will forever be a part of the great Monty Python legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can I say about this movie? It's funny enough to make your side hurt &amp; leave you begging for mercy. Simply crazy, but the Pythons refuse to let themselves sink to unfunny gross-out humor. (Yes, there is gross-out humor, but it's actually funny.) I've watched this lots, and it still makes me laugh. This might also serve as a good introduction to Python for those who have not yet joined the massive cult.The highlights for me were "Find the Fish" and The Sperm Song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. Admittedly, it's filled with very dark, biting humor with undertones of social criticism. It's very different from anything else Monty Python attempted but it retains the marvelously silly quality of the other works.I think just how much someone appreciates this movie depends on how tolerant they are of the themes and ideas being presented. A deeply religious person would be more offended than usual. Anyone offended by the viewpoint that life is ultimately meaningless will also not appreciate it.I remember some critics were bashing it here when it came out by pointing out the Grim Reaper character's negative comments regarding Americans. I always found this profoundly ridiculous since on the balance, they bashed themselves, the English too, in the same sketch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ragbag Collection of Sketches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways MONTY PYHTON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE has dated badly since its original release in 1983. Many of its attitudes, especially towards sex and gender, are needlessly sexist, reminiscent of the days when Benny Hill dominated British television screens with his plethora of half-clad ladies. One could argue that the Pythons are making fun of such attitudes, but when one sketch includes a scene of a male fugitive (Michael Palin) being pursued by a bevy of topless totties, we do begin to wonder about the film's stance.Structurally speaking THE MEANING OF LIFE is a mess, a ragbag collection of sketches stitched together under an umbrella title, rather like one of the Pythons' television shows. There is even less plot-line than LIFE OF BRIAN or MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL; what we soon realize is that the film is not going to explore the meaning of life, but rather provide a showcase for the Pythons' idiosyncratic brand of humor. Some of the sketches are just plain puerile, reflecting the writers' experiences of the British public school (read private in the US) system. As an educator, John Cleese makes love to his wife in front of a class of bored male learners; once the joke has been established, the sketch soon wears thin. The staff take on the learners at rugby and use the occasion as an excuse to beat the learners up: we are left thinking "so what?"On the other hand the Pythons manage to land some telling satirical blows. They satirize a Health Service more concerned with impressing administrators than looking after patients; and deflate the often archaic brand of muscular Christianity that prevails at many of Britain's educational institutions. The scene involving Mr. Creosote (Terry Jones) is strong meat for anyone, but reminds us of how our penchant for rich food often leads us to over-eat. In a culture apparently dedicated to the celebrity chef, the thrust of this sketch is more pertinent now than it was over three decades ago.For Python addicts there are familiar milestones such as Eric Idle- themed songs, directly aimed to replicate the success of "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" in LIFE OF BRIAN. Terry Gilliam's animations continue to fascinate for their sheer surrealistic inventiveness, while it is fun to see the late lamented Graham Chapman in a variety of roles. All in all there is something in this film for everyone -- provided you look hard enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny moments in an uneven film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having pushed the shaky alliance between plot and Monty Python style humor to the stretching point with "Life of Brian", the brilliant U.K. comedy team returned to their sketch roots for their third and final film, usually regarded as the least of the film series. The sketches are loosely organized around a chronology of human life (beginning of course with "The Miracle of Birth") and the idea of philosophical inquiry into the meaning of human life. Along the way the audience is treated to the best and worst of their collective talent, and the strongest feeling for fans to take away unfortunately is the feeling that the group's sensibilities were fracturing.The show begins with a short film directed by Terry Gilliam, "The Crimson Permanent Assurance." Its very witty and the unique style of visualization puts the rest of the film, mostly directed by Terry Jones, in a bad light. There are some other funny sketches, some much funnier really, but none of them are visualized in a particularly interesting way.This is a film of as they say the good, the bad and the ugly. The good -- the machine that goes "ping", "The Third World", Eric Idle's "Universe Song" and Noel Coward impression, "Christmas in Heaven." The bad -- an overlong war parody that misses all marks, a rambling conversation about tigers that seems like amateur variety hall, naked field hockey executions (in a movie that later mocks cynical exploitation). And the downright ugly -- Mr. Creosote is all you have to say for people who've seen the film.It seems a lot longer than it is, and all of it a bit arbitrary. The Monty Python troupe is more interested in skewering the absurdities of social behavior than in investigating anything of any "meaning." But the dark edge to the comedy is consistent and the film bravely challenges the audience's sense of taste and proportion. In the end, it's more entertainment than we could expect from a movie but less than we could hope for from Monty Python. Looking at it now especially in retrospect it's clear that it was the right time for the "boys" to go their own way and take on the world as men: otherwise we wouldn't have Gilliam's "Brazil" and other classics, we wouldn't have Cleese's "Fawlty Towers" and "Fish Called Wanda", and so forth. Although at the time in the 1980s it seemed a tragedy to me that Python was no more, it seems clear at this point that they left on a relatively high note and went off to pursue individual goals that brought them to new and interesting places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking extreme of Pythonesque hilarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been putting this one off for quite a while because for some reason people just did not tend to talk about it as often as Monty Python's other works. Now I know why. Monty Python is always surreal, iconoclastic, and edgy, but in this they amp it up to a pretty shocking degree. Whereas the troupe keep their same deadpan tone and straight-faces, I can't help but feel there's almost a level of anger behind this latest production, contrasting starkly with an incredibly increased production budget. They have gigantic orchestrated dance sequences, state of the art special effects, increased animation budget, more extras than all of their other productions put together, bigger sets, increased costuming and make up and prosthetic effects, more and bigger props, and crazier visuals, and it's all pretty much to hit you across the head with projectile vomit, squirting arteries, the blackest of humor, and an almost impatient death wish. It's hilarious, but I feel as if they've done something dirty to me.I spent more of the time jaw-droppingly taken aback than I did laughing. The closest the Pythons get to their classic absurdist sensibilities is during the war sequences! The rest of the time they're pretty much kicking religion's ass and deconstructing every step of human life. A sequence in space seems more like they're interested in using new animation to pull dirty tricks than making sure the joke fits, and they throw inserts into the mix of creepy stuff like talking fishes and a surrealist television show from nowhere that looked and felt like Spaced's send-up of Vulva's art piece except without the context to know what the heck was going on while a man in an elephant suit ran around. It all fits their sensibilities but it's so off-putting--which may be why it was their last show.I can't decide if this is my new favorite Python piece, or if I'll just never sleep again. I'm impressed, but aghast. I think I need to shower...--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it doesn't measure up to 'Grail' or 'Brian' it was great to see the whole group perform together before the loss of Graham Chapman. I recently read how hard it was to get all six Pythons together to make this. The writing, rehearsals, and the actual filming were so tough to coordinate because by now these guys had professional lives outside Python. Some were willing to make more of an effort than others. Cleese was always the holdout for he wanted to constantly move forward, away from his sketch-comedy roots. And Chapman drank and had his cancer to deal with later on. Gilliam and Jones were established directors with their own agendas by 1983. But Palin and Idle were always game for more zany antics with the old troupe. Even though there were these problems behind the scenes, I think their final effort should be put in a time capsule for all to revere. Check it out. It only costs a couple bucks to rent. You won't be sorry. Personal guarantee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as "Holy Grail", a bit boring at places and sadly disappointing, yet having its own quality moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" last night and this night I watched "The Meaning of Life". To be honest, I was actually pretty disappointed of it, but what can you expect after seeing such a magnificent film as "Holy Grail"? This movie was nothing near it, though it definitely had its moments.Again, the movie starts with something that's just completely irrelevant for the movie itself, making it recognisable as a Monty Python film. Again, the Monty Python boys have created something so silly and ridiculous, that it's just so funny, though not as funny as you would think it would be. The movie doesn't take the stupidity to the level it's supposed to, sadly making the movie a bit boring. Yes, there is still that same stupidity, but it should be up a notch, as now it just stays in the level or normal silliness for most of the time.Despite from that, the Monty Python boys are all in all excellent in their roles, well that's the whole meaning of it anyways. For me, the actors who stood out the most were the excellent John Cleese and Michael Palin, I think the other actors were sadly more left out, though they still had many many roles. The movie tries to form a some kind of a plot, which again is something so irrelevant that it's just ridiculous. Only this time the word "ridiculous" really means ridiculous and it just doesn't make it so funny. I know I shouldn't compare this to the "Holy Grail", but as that is at the time the only Monty Python I've seen besides this one, I just must. At least "Holy Grail"'s story was there, being so ridiculous it was hilarious.The movie has its moments like mentioned before, but neither one of the scenes made me laugh as much as I did in "Holy Grail". Again, there were some absolutely hilarious scenes, but then there was so much boring stuff in it, that it just let down the whole overall feeling of the movie. I was very surprised how much money they had spent on the movie, I mean, some parts were just fantastically made and they really looked so good. They had really took some time on making some of the scenes, and the whole movie as well. It seems like there weren't much improvised though, it felt too "written" I might say."The Meaning of Life" just doesn't do as much as I would have hoped it would. Everything's slightly more average and it just doesn't catch your attention so much. Despite from that, it's still worth watching and I must say I was really impressed by the soundtrack, it had some really awesome songs in it, which didn't make any sense though, but they sure made you laugh. A slightly disappointing film, but still, you got to raise your hat for the Monty Python crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My face hurt. My sides hurt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Meaning of Life when it came out in '83, in a tiny theater in Athens, Ohio. I was the only person in the audience who got it. At all. I laughed until snot blew out my nose. Everyone else in the place just stared at me with righteous disgust. That made me laugh even harder. I laughed so hard that my face hurt for days. Seriously.It's still my favorite Monte Python movie. It is hilarious and it is deep. And yes, at the end it does answer the question: What is the meaning of life? So you have that going for you. Which is nice.That (the line you just read) was the original ending. I must however, supply the editor gods with more lines, as they are displeased. What better way to fill out the page than to quote scripture?"And spotteth twice, they, the camels before the third hour. And so the Midianites went forth to Ram Gilead in Kadesh Bilgemath, by Shor Ethra Regalion, to the house of Gash-Bil-Bethuel-Bazda: he who brought the butter dish to Balshazar and the tent peg to the house of Rashomon. And there slew they the goats, yea, and placed they the bits in little pots." Here endeth the lesson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is so underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Meaning of Life is a film that you can watch again and again, yet still finding something new to laugh about every time, as was "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "The Life of Brian". The whole movie is basically a chapter book of the stages in life (ex: Part 1, Birth), except it's totally messed around with by the members of the Monty Python gang. I found myself laughing 1 minute into the movie, when you see the sketch about the old men and "The Very Big Business Association of America", or "The Crimson Permanent Assurance". One of the funniest scenes is "The Autumn Years", where Terry Jones does a brilliant job as Mr. Cresote in a french restaurant, who is extremely fat and eventually blows up after everything on the menu and "just one watherthin mint". The movie's comedic cartoons by Terry Gilliam also give the movie something to laugh at. After having seen the movie many times, I found myself on this site wanting to see its rating. I was very disappointed, because this should definitely be in the top 250 movies ever made. Sure it has an R rating. Sure it has violence, sex, nudity, and coarse language. That's the brilliance of it. That's the pure genius of it. And that's why it makes us laugh time after time. If I could, I would give this film 15/10, but 10 is the maximum. This movie is the one of the heights of British or just overall comedy. It's smart, funny, and I highly recommend people to see it. You will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Monty python's: The meaning of life" is awesome. It is the best life-based parody I've ever seen. Most comedies focus on how to deal with life's problems and turn them funny. Anyhow, this film just makes fun of those problems without trying to find them a funny spot. How many comedies just start talking and laughing about how the character steps in any animal's body wastes??? Every comedy nowadays has a scene where the main guy (or girl) is turned into an idiots who just can't deal with life. Besides, every comedy gets to a point where the characters realize their life is bad and just try to fix all their mistakes. This movie fixes nothing and has no stupid scene. I''s every inch true. If you haven't seen it, rent it (or buy it)immediately!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My First Python Experience, and Still My Favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong... I love GRAIL and BRIAN. I love the show, and I even love most of the post-Python stuff that's come out. But this is and will always be my favorite Python experience. Where GRAIL and BRIAN found the troupe stretching out their legs with strong stories (understandable, since their show had been sketch-based), I really do feel that they were at their best with the sketch-comedy format. One reviewer on this site suggested that a feature film is not the best place to try on a sketch comedy; though he may be right, I think Python do an admirable job, and I also think that this is definitely a structurally interesting film, as well as being their darkest, weirdest, and most provocative statement. And besides, though it is episodic in structure, there is a narrative flow to it; Python takes us from birth to death, beginning to end, and has us laughing all the way. Tellingly, Cleese, who once poo-pooed this film as the least successful at their efforts, says on the commentary track that he'd never realized how good MEANING OF LIFE is, and that it contains some of their very best material. I agree. "Every Sperm is Sacred", "Mr. Creosote", "Death", "Live Organ Transplants", "Birth", the entire "Growth and Learning" segment, and of course "Find the Fish", without a doubt the single WEIRDEST thing Python ever did, and actually one of the weirdest things I've ever seen in a movie, bar none (seriously, I want to emphasize further... even if you don't really like this movie, "Find the Fish" is PRIME PYTHON... one of their defining moments, along with the "Fish Slapping Dance"). The only thing I see wrong with the film is the "Fighting Each Other" segment, which is only funny for a couple of minutes (the search for the missing leg gets old quickly, and the skit about the platoon throwing a party for their captain is amusing, but simply not good enough to be included here). The production values are higher, the direction slicker, and the material better-written than in all their previous work, and for every bad joke there are least three or four good ones. It's also a musical, containing more song-and-dance numbers than before. The "Death" segment marks the last time all six Pythons would appear on screen together, and it's a little sad in that respect. Oh yeah... Terry Gilliam's short film "The Crimson Permanent Assurance", which appears before the film proper, is wonderfully funny and creative, as Gilliam's films can be expected to be. About the extras on the new Universal special edition DVD: very good documentary, though I always hate to see Cleese bad-mouthing this production (he's always been the hardest to please); a lot of junk, some of it amusing, some of it quite useless; but most interestingly, deleted skits. For the most part it's easy to see why they left these out of the movie (and the DVD has an option where you can watch the movie with these scenes where they would've been in the final cut): though I found the "Martin Luther" segment uproariously funny, it simply doesn't have enough appeal to those who aren't up on church history (and there are many)... and of course, the other excluded segments are pretty hit-or-miss, but it's still interesting to see them. So in conclusion (goodness, what a messy review this is!), here's how I rank the works of Python: #1: MEANING OF LIFE; #2) "Monty Python's Flying Circus"; #3) MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL; #4) LIFE OF BRIAN (I always felt it was slightly overrated, though I do still love it). And the other stuff -- concert movies, along with the first film, AND NOW FOR SOMETHING... don't count!!! Sorry for the chaos of my review, hope you enjoy this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>inconsistent but occasionally hilarious, mainly due to the songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Once upon a time, six amazing friends teamed up together to write one of the finest British comedies of all time. They would collectively be known as 'Monty python' and the series was "Monty Python's Flying Circus". Shown from 1969 to 1974, the series featured some of the funniest comedy ever created in this country.In 1983 the Pythons came together once more to create "The Meaning of Life". More sketch orientated than previous film collaborations, it is a bit of a disappointment to many Python fans. Inconsistent and only occasionally hilarious, the film is saved mainly due to one or two brilliant new songs. Still, despite it's disappointments, it is still a Python film and there are moments when that skill and genius are evident.As one fish says to another "what's it all about?". Well Monty Python is about to tell you. Starting from birth and proceeding through to death, "The Meaning of Life" educates us all through comedy sketches and music.The problem with "The Meaning of Life" is that it is often just not that funny. Stories involving the vomiting Mr Creosote (Terry Jones) and the random long armed man (again Jones) are easily remembered for the wrong reasons, whilst other moments of the film are easily forgettable. This in itself is unique for Python and it is a shame.Still, there are moments of the film when the old Python is resurrected. A surreal story involving the Grim Reaper is brilliant. As is a "Zulu" spoof where dying soldiers are more concerned by a General's scratch. Most notably though are songs like "Every Sperm is Sacred" and "The Meaning of Life". Whether sang by Michael Palin or Eric Idle, it's moments like these which save the film from being forgettable. Sadly though, they are far too few.Unlike other "Monty Python" films, "The Meaning of Life" is a huge disappointment. At times instantly forgettable, the film never really lives up to the strengths of previous efforts. There are moments, most notably the songs, but these are too rare and the film soon disappears from the mind. Forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pythons get too much money: This is the result.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be blunt and say this movie should have been a lot better, every Python seems to agree with that, but I think they are approaching it the wrong way. They have said again and again the thing needed a structure or plot, but with the attitude here, I don't think that would have helped.This movie is just big and bloated indulgence. From musical numbers with barely a joke (The Christmas in Heaven bit and Dick song, I mean, the other two were done well enough) to looooonnnngggg bits that are sets up to rather small jokes, I got the feeling that Terry Jones just felt he could spend his way out of any problem.The other two movies strike me as being more inventive and clever, and I have a theory that's because they were made by comparatively young men with so little money they thought with brains instead of checkbooks.Though I completely love the Short Film, so maybe I don't have a point.Either way, very uneven. There. A long, boring review and I finally get to the point... Just like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There can be too much Monty Python</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of the Flying Circus ever since I had the chance of seeing the reruns on Ponchivision.I was watching this movie with great expectations, but I must say I felt disappointed.While watching the English comedy group for half an hour is great fun, it's another thing to watch them for two and a half hours.Since it's a movie with a more limited audience, they get away with whatever they have in mind, so the jokes are raw and not as funny or guilt-free as in the show. I can notice that all six performers say their lines more viciously, with a "we know this is annoying" kind of look.I particularly felt displeased with the Mr. Creosote skit. I can say that after watching it, Terry Jones has lost my respect. But, the ghastly scene does has it's audience.The skit with the tiger was perhaps the funniest, if not the only one that didn't make me feel guilty of something.The length of the film makes it drag a lot, so it's my opinion that the Monty Python "stream of consciousness" style works excellently on TV, but not on film.I still love those classic sketches and I still have to see "Holy Grail" and "Life of Brian", but "The Meaning of Life" is my least favorite. Sorry.</fullReview>

It's okay to be silly, since this is one of the characteristics of Monty Python's movies, but I almost didn't laugh in this one,since the jokes a little bit of disconnected.:( The best part of this movie in my opinion, is when they show the catholic family and the protestant one, and starts singing about sperm, and the father of the catholic family needs to sell his kids to scientific experiments. :P For people who are watching Monty Python for the first time, I highly recommend to watch ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'', that is the most hilarious-to not mention the best-monty Python of all.:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always with films that are basically a long series of short sketches it's hard to keep the material even in quality. That problem is evident here too. Some of the better sketches are among Pythons funniest, others are hardly funny at all. This is undoubtedly the darkest of their work, a very bleak and sometimes grim look at society. And it's also in these darkest moments that the movie is at it's most flawed.I did like the opening part, "The Crimson Permanent Insurance" even though it's got almost nothing to do with the rest of the movie. It has the quirky style of Terry Gilliam that usually doesn't really appeal to me, but this time it did. The other episodes, that all deal with different stages of life (including some aspects of life like "Fighting each other") are mostly also well done. The one i found to be least funny is the last part called "Death". It wasn't awful, just not very good. The rest of the movie is somewhat of a roller-coaster going from not very funny to brilliant. The "Mr Creosote"-scene as it's called being the most disgusting and over-the-top part, the part showing the war in Africa (and two men dressed as a tiger) being among the funniest.For someone not too familiar with Monty Pythons work this might not be a good start. Rather one should try to watch one of their more light-hearted work. While i find this movie to have it's points, actually i think many parts are quite funny, there is still a streak of black which disturbs the experience. I know a lot of people who dislike this movie, and granted it's not for everyone. But for fans of Monty Python or their brand of comedy in general, there are still parts here well worth watching. I rate this 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Have you ever wanted to know what it's all about?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.As a Monty Python film this is preferable to most, largely because it's their sole film (using original material, at any rate) that returns to the sketch-based format.Whereas Holy Grail and Life of Brian had tried to adopt feature-length narratives, Meaning of Life is divided into eight sub-sections, as well as "The End of the Film" and the amusing "Middle of the Film". The humour present is perhaps more appealing to non-fans, as a sticking point is the Pythons' continual obsession with intellectualising trivial issues. Here they trivialise intellectual issues, which is far more satisfying.As with any Python activity, it's really very hit and miss, and there are plenty of misses. The end, for one. A rant by Terry Jones at the then-current state of the film industry seems a bit like pots and kettles, and the second section, "Growth and Learning" just goes too full out to shock. In fact, most of the film is like this, with a juvenile need to offend, which is odd considering even the youngest Python was forty at this stage. Yet this urge to break every last taboo gives us digs at Catholics, Protestants, Mormons, Jews, Africans and Americans. We get women talking openly about their periods and young naked children discussing reproduction with their father. There are also some gratuitous topless shots at the end, though I won't complain about that part too much. At the time it was all probably very risqué and daring, though it seems strangely tame, and even inept these days.The opening mini-feature, The Crimson Permanent Assurance, seems a gracious attempt by the team to allow Gilliam a Brazil try-out. It's nicely directed (better than the main film, in fact) though doesn't really go anywhere, or indeed be funny at all. It ends with a song, feebly playing on the words Accountancy/Accountant Sea. Still, it only lasts fifteen minutes I suppose... The opening proper is a ghastly sketch with Cleese as a heartless Doctor, saying lines like "Can I put the tube in the baby's head?" Cleese... posh bloke that shouts... no, I still don't get why that's supposed to be funny.But there is a fair amount of good stuff in there, if not exactly side-splitting. The one bit that did make me laugh out loud was the least sophisticated moment, and arguably the most famous, the Mr. Creosote restaurant scene. An insanely obese man who vomits everywhere (including four times over the back of a cleaning lady) this puerile, gross-out humour is undeniably amusing. This then leads on to another great moment, Eric Idle's French waiter leading the camera away to explain his philosophy on the meaning of life. Having explained it and seeing the underwhelmed response, Idle starts screaming at the camera, telling us what to do if we don't like it."Fighting Each Other" is another nice segment, with three brief satires on war. Perhaps the best is where an army captain, trying to fight his way out of a bunker, is given gifts by his regiment. Seeing Chapman trying to avoid enemy fire while being presented with a full-length grandfather clock is an amusing touch. Idle appears as an embittered Scots soldier, bemoaning the fact that a soldier can shoot people and be praised for it, but a civilian cannot. "At home they'd hang me. Here they'll give me a f*****g medal!" My favourite bit though has to be Eric stepping from a fridge in a neon pink suit, walking out into space while singing "Galaxy Song". It's not particularly funny, but it does get across some of the sense of scale and wide scope that makes this film rewarding. Well, it would if it didn't also highlight the film's modest budget. There's also an Oliver! spoof and a mickey-take of Johnny Mathis to contend with. Gilliam oddly only gets one sustained cartoon, a nice sketch about leaves committing suicide.Okay, it all could have been a lot better. Despite what their fans would have you think, "quality control" are two words unlikely to have troubled the Pythons. But this is a refreshing change of tack for the group, even down to Idle's Noel Coward take off. Usually Coward in Python would have sung about currency or foreign politics, but here he just gets to reel off a ditty about penises. It's this no-limits, full-bore attitude that makes for interesting, if not actually all that funny, viewing. And as the final Python film, then the ultimate question of life itself was a subject they were long overdue in tackling. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another reviewer nailed it - by the time this film came out, the Monty Python style of humor was already becoming a bit, well, dated. It'd lost the freshness which made the original TV show and their earlier films such classics. In short, the lads were trying TOO hard to be funny, and it shows. Not that's it's a bad movie, there's enough funny stuff to give nearly every viewer a good laugh at some point or another, but it's just not consistently funny, which is the mark of any great comedy. My favorite was probably the bit about the English Army officers fighting in Africa in the 1870's, when one of them wakes up to find his leg missing. The doctor says "Must have been bit off by a tiger". "A tiger, here in Africa?""Well, maybe it escaped from a zoo". This was the sort of lunatic dialogue which made their earlier work great. But too much of it is just gross out humor. The fat guy was pretty funny, but the liver sketch was just disgusting. And Cleese doing live "sex-ed" in front of a bunch of bored schoolboys just made me want to cringe. Like I said, it seemed to me the guys knew they were past their prime, and instead of just letting the humor flow naturally, they tried too often to force it out. With decidedly mixed results. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last hurrah of "Monty Python"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Holy Grail" had an episodic structure, and a more-or-less coherent plot but that hardly mattered because the film was one of the funniest of all time. "Life of Brian", while not reaching the same heights of hilarity, was still an improvement, because it was funny, told a story, made some subversively intelligent statements about religion, and concluded with the troop's signature song. So I titled my "Life of Brian"' review: the Prime of Monty Python.Now, a third Monty Python's movie is an offer one can't refuse but there's no escape from the uncomfortable feeling that this well-meaning movie doesn't play in the same league than its glorious predecessors. Some parts do, some scenes are nothing short of masterpieces but others are so painfully not-so-funny that you spend more time wondering the meaning of their presence rather than life's. Because "The Meaning of Life" is a series of totally disjointed sketches, don't let you be fooled by the title, when they had enough material to make a film, the group was looking the least loose way to connect the sketches, with a lot of stuff about sexuality, death and birth, Life with a major L came all naturally.And it was a great idea because nothing is a meaningless as life, when you think about it, or when you hear the magnificent "universe" song (one of the film's highlights). Therefore, we know we're not looking for answers but multiple showcases of life's incongruity and how they inspire the most absurd situations. After all, what's a sketch about a gigantic client who vomits every ten seconds has to do with the meaning of anything? Much aware of this linguistic stretch, the group provides a funny Greek Chorus made of fishes in a restaurant's tank, wondering where all the nonsense is getting to. But this is the Monty Python we're talking, so as long as it was funny, who cared if their advertising was misleading? Didn't Mel brook titled his "History of the World Part I" without providing any sequel? In the name of comedy, anything is possible, as long as it is funny. The problem of "The Meaning of Life" is that it suffers from its very structure, by making it into a series of disconnected sketches, some were likely to pale in comparison with the others. All comedies have their slower moments, but we know they are just the obligatory low spots before the high ones, but in the case of this anthology, a low spot and a sketch make one. "The Birth" is funny, "The Third World" part is the perfect moment, but how about the restaurant with the conversation about philosophers? How about that bit with the tiger? In fact, how about that Crimson Insurance Company feature that introduces the film? The opening short was a perfect satire against the bureaucratic capitalistic world, and the sight of old guys making a pirates' ship out of their company's building is a great omen of Terry Gilliam's surrealistic talent, but while we're enthralled by the action and the satire, and before the film gets to its hilarious conclusion, it's fifteen minutes of our lives spent trying to determine what is supposed to be funny. At that track, this is not even an intro, this is 'filler' material. And while I'm too much a fan of the Python to push the 'skip' part, I just do something else waiting for the film to begin. And the Crimson syndrome affects many other parts that started great but went on past their punch line or didn't even try to have one.Fillers, that's it, the film was full of them. The war bit starting in the trenches was a brilliant moment, Graham Chapman's speech about democracy and its flashy conclusion perfect, and the part about a leg bite mildly funny, but had it concluded with Eric Idle soldier saying that he's given a medal for things that earn you hanging back home, while not funny, could've been a perfect way to end the 'fighting' but the tiger scene was just not funny, even by surrealistic standards. The restaurant scene after the explosion never called for an aftermath, and the ending with the Heaven Lounge didn't show something new from the Middle Age part. There must be a total of needless twenty minutes in the film. But this is Monty Python and even the less funny bits, age better than Sandler's comedies and they're enjoyable for the sake of seeing Graham Chapman and the group still making fools of themselves.They were past their prime, but what a prime! They still had it enough to provide three magnificent songs, the intro, the "universe" song, all full of scientific details showing us the pointlessness of the individual and of course "Every Sperm is Sacred", one of the most subversive and brilliant songs ever. I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for an Oscar (it was BAFTA nominated), the song has the feel of a Disney or old-school Hollywood musical and it's so well done we don't react to the lyrics, we just enjoy it. This is the proof that the group could stick make fun of religion with the kind of bad taste that rose above vulgarity. It's funny because in its own twisted way, it's true, that's how religion perceives our precious seminal fluids after all.This was the film that made it discover "Monty Python", my Dad couldn't believe I never heard of them. So, I took the VHS and the group won me with the "Every Sperm is Sacred" part and whenever I see it, I feel some genuine nostalgia. As raunchy and naughty as it is, there's some sweetness in the song that shows that Monty Python might have been vulgar but never mean-spirited, except for the liver's donor part, for the death, the birth with the machine that goes "Ping", well forget what I say!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but not great by Python standards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By almost all accounts, including that of the Python troupe itself, this is the worst of their films. Yes, it's still entertaining at times, but it comes nowhere near the wonderful absurdity and wit of Life of Brian or Holy Grail. So if you have high hopes for this based on other Python material, I strongly recommend lowering them. There will be parts of this that you enjoy, but as a whole it's not as funny as you might expect. My favorite segments were the Miracle of Birth part A, Fighting Each Other, and Live Organ Transplants.There's no story or plot to the film, just a bunch of sketches strung together in a somewhat cohesive order. The modern equivalent would be taking a collection of YouTube videos by the same person. The only purpose that the film as a whole serves is to comment on the meaning of life. Now this might sound obvious, but what I mean by that is that the inconclusive nature of all of the sketches points to what the group is saying the meaning of life is: there is no meaning to it. As the similarly themed Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy tells us in its own way, the ultimate answer that we're all looking for just isn't out there or isn't one that's going to satisfy everyone or is different for everyone. But otherwise, the movie is just for laughs.Personally, I thought the skits that were not set in modern times were the best. Somehow, it's more refreshing to see their comedy in a historical setting, as is done with the first two Python films, than in the present. This is not true of all comedy. John Hughes does an excellent job commenting on the culture of his time through comedy. But for others like Mel Brooks it's where they blossom. This was part of what made the war sketches entertaining for me.The role that each actor gets to play throughout is spread pretty evenly. There is no lead role for Graham Chapman to play this time, but there are plenty of women for Terry Jones to impersonate and room can always be made for John Cleese's versatility, Michael Palin's bawdiness, or Eric Idle's grins. The only place where they aren't featured much is the short at the beginning, which could have been a little shorter but was still fun.You can watch this movie in pretty much any order, so feel free to skip around and find scenes that you like or have a friend show you the best ones. It's fine if you watch it sequentially, but nothing is gained or lost by it. For this reason, I would recommend that you watch it all the way through unless you are completely turned off by the Python style and this is your first time. It probably shouldn't be the first Python you watch (Life of Brian is probably the best one to start with). If your interested, go in with low expectations and an open mind. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It took God six days to create the earth, and Monty Python just 90 minutes to screw it up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, let me start off by saying that this is definitely the least worst movie of the Monty Python series, and that I did laugh at this one somewhat more than the past three. However... that's not say there isn't certain things so very wrong with this movie, like for example 'Every Sperm is Sacred' is one of the creepiest moments in movie history. Jesus, It's sang by kids. But on the other hand, the scene with the big fat guy in the restaurant, as revolting as It is It does make me laugh, especially when John Cleese dumps that bit of vomit over that racist woman whilst they're cleaning. And to be honest, It kind of works like that for the entirety of the film. For every bad point there's a somewhat slightly redeeming factor to go with it, however that doesn't mean this film is good. No no, not by a long shot ... But compared to Life of Brian and The Holy Grail and possibly And Now For Something Completely Different, It's golden.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly bad taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not anti-Monty Python or anything, I quite liked the Holy Grail for instance. But this was just precious, pedantic, pretentious. Some comedic themes are fun if you try to play along, but over the hour's mark this is just complacent and over-the-top, to a point where you really wish you could agree but just cannot find it in you. The whole meta-thing, how this is an essential comedy that works in a 2nd or 3rd degree and 'trolls' the viewer and should absolutely not be taken literally at all, etc... truth is there just isn't all that much to it, so you can write up the most complicated analysis of it you want, it just isn't nearly masterpiece level and reeks of shock and self-indulgent superiority. Some bits are funny, others barely, others are just boring as hell and immediately figured out, and some are disgusting and meaningless. Just, no.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Monthy Python's worst films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie is basically a bunch of short sketches that purport to show the meaning of life (They don't). It opens with a laugh less and stupid 20 minute short about an insurance company being run by pirates. From then on it doesn't change much. About 90% of the sketches have no laughs in them at all and are just pointless. There are some bright spots--The "Every Sperm is Sacred" song and dance is cute; John Cleese teaching his students about sex with his wife is funny; the Zulu war bit was amusing; the liver organ donor sketch was VERY bloody but funny and a visit from Death at the end was clever. However there's a sketch about an incredibly obese man visiting a restaurant and constantly vomiting over everybody and everything. It's not funny...just sick. Also that comes towards leaving a bad taste (sorry) for the film as a whole. Python fans might want to take a look but you can safely stay away from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As heavy as lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly all of this film is crude and unfunny. But the Mr Creosote sketch more than redeems it! An unimaginably huge and ghastly man, displaying the most appalling of manners in a genteel restaurant, is a landmark in creative humour. The other diners there, high class people of course, shown nobly putting up the best in English stiff upper lip stuff as he steadily pumps the place with puke, is cynicism at its best. It's a shame that even that moment is tainted with the heavy and unfunny humour of the rest of the film when one of the diners gratuitously declares that she is 'suffering from a rather heavy period' as she rises to leave. But In the end the stoicism that has been such an example reaches its limit as Mr Creosote finally explodes, drenching them all with the contents of his guts and possibly body parts. A tasteful episode I'd say. For me personally this is the funniest comedy sketch I have ever seen on film, something which probably says more about yours truly than I would ever care to state. Shot in Porchester Hall (also a swimming baths) in Paddington West London, I doubt whether that unoffending venue has ever been the same since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comedy troupe Monty Python takes on the biggest question of all, the Meaning of Life, or do they? The group includes Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It starts off with life insurance pirates. The set design and imagination is the impressive aspect for that one. Ultimately, the movie is uneven but brilliant at times. There are sections that are utterly memorable and superior. My favorite is the song 'Every Sperm Is Sacred'. The surreal creatures are weird. The fat vomiting diner is brilliant. Not every section works. The movie is uneven but that are some really unforgettable bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you look on the bright side of life, you understand its meaning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From conception to birth, from death to eternity, life is explored through its many meanings. This series of vignettes attacks convention from the Catholic stance on birth control (which leads to a huge musical number straight out of "Oliver!"), the grotesque presence of an enormously fat man who can't hold down his dinner(s) in an elegant restaurant, the accidental poisoning of dinner guests at a country dinner party, and the entrance into heaven where every day is Christmas. These are for me the highlights, other segments on child birth and a man being executed having his choice of methods and choosing being chased by topless buxom women, not being so funny. It starts off with a prelude with tired bookkeepers taking over their office building and turning into pirates; Slightly amusing, but no classic.But when a pregnant woman drops her baby out simply while doing dishes and her husband tells their many children that they are being sold into slavery, the offbeat and deliciously bad taste begins with his breaking into "Every Sperm is Sacred", spoofing the big musical numbers in the 1968 Best Picture "Oliver!". "God looks down on those who treat their semen with more care" is one of the lyrics, and you know that the film is not going to be sensitive to those overrated politically correct standards. If you have a queasy stomach, you might want to turn away when the fat man enters the restaurant because this is not an easy sequence to take. You'll thank God that the film was not filmed in "Smell-o-Vision" in this sequence.Then there's the delightfully droll sequence of death visiting the country home of a dotty housewife who served her guests canned salmon moose resulting in all of their deaths including one guest who didn't EAT the salmon. This is one of those bits of comedy that when you watch it over and over, you'll start quoting the movie line for line. Their deaths are quick and painless and they head into heaven in their own automobiles where all the characters from the past (including those who didn't die in earlier sequences and were played by some of the same actors) greet them. It wraps up this well saturated cherry of a sweet little slap into the face of life very nicely, and even if on video, you find yourself fast-forwarding through some of the weaker segments, there will be enough to keep this in your cineramic comedy memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed Classic from the Monty Python Troupe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am only recently converted to join the massive fan base for the Monty Python team. I fell in love with MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL and I've kept my eye out for another chance to enjoy their particular brand of insanity. I finally stumbled across THE MEANING OF LIFE, of which I'd only seen bits, in the local Target and grabbed an anniversary edition, settling in for some off-kilter hilarity. In the end, it was?hard to nail down. I didn't dislike the movie but it sure wasn't at the level of laughs of HOLY GRAIL. No doubt it has some great moments but there was a lot that fell short and sort of leaves my final overall impression as less than memorable. The Python troupe (Eric Idle, Michael Palin, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, &amp; Terry Gilliam) has chosen the topic of their final film to be the most important, all- encompassing theme: the meaning of life. The British comedy legends will lead us from the miracle of birth, where modern hospitals seem more interested in machines that go "ping!" than the beauty of new life, to death and the Christmas paradise that awaits once we cross the pearly gates. Along the way, we'll be treated to singing, dancing, surrealism, philosophy, fish, and violent organ removal. THE MEANING OF LIFE is more sketch film than traditional narrative and the individual parts are mostly entertaining, with some lulls that wreak havoc on the pacing of the film as a whole.I'll approach this movie as I would an anthology film by comparing what worked against what failed. The less-than-stellar stuff first: the short feature before the actual film, "The Crimson Permanent Assurance", wasn't the greatest way of kicking it all off. It's an amusing premise. We've got a crew of old man working for an insurance company that has recently been bought out by the Very Big Corporation of America, and they stage a mutiny reminiscent of classic pirate adventure films. My issue is that it runs on way too long, going a full 15 minutes before we ever actually get to the real film. It wouldn't be so aggravating if the premise weren't so thin. Old men in makeshift pirate garb using accountant instruments as weaponry is funny for a few minutes, not a quarter hour. "The Crimson Permanent Assurance" is the film's largest weakness but a nearly two-hour film loaded with skits is bound to have some dips in quality. I didn't care for the segment where Palin and Idle are a middle-aged couple in a dungeon-themed restaurant struggling through a conversation on philosophy while Cleese puts on an ear-punishing Texan accent as their waiter. It occurs somewhere around the middle of the film and ruins the pacing of an otherwise funny film. The end suffers similarly with the "Christmas in Heaven" musical sequence that hopes to elicit some chuckles with Graham Chapman doing his best Tony Bennett impression while surrounded by women in weird plastic breasts.THE MEANING OF LIFE might have severe pacing issues and it's share of lulls but there's still some real great material that keeps the movie fun. Once we get through the Permanent Assurance stuff in the beginning, it all kicks off with some hilarious stuff regarding birth. The film's first (and possibly best) musical number kicks off with Palin as a destitute father in Yorkshire, England with "Every Sperm is Sacred", but my personal favorite occurs later in the film with Eric Idle and his "Galaxy Song" dropped in the middle of the inexplicable segment on live organ transplants. What have live organ transplants got to do with the meaning of life? No idea, it's just another fun bit of absurdity from the men who've mastered it. THE MEANING OF LIFE is at it's best when the Python team are at their weirdest: Mr. Creosote, the Find the Fish segment, and the strange bit during the Anglo-Zulu War when some British officers must handle an emergency situation where one of their own suffered a rather severe bite over the course of the night. It's stuff like this that makes any weak points forgivable over the course of THE MEANING OF LIFE and, despite finding myself frustrated or bored at times, it's still funny enough and origin to some iconic hilarious bits to be considered classic. It's far from the level of MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL but even the worst Monty Python is above and beyond most of the "comedies" we get now.</fullReview>

The Meaning of Life is Monty Python's dry humored look at the world we live in and his comical take on the big questions that people have been asking throughout history. His answers to the big questions are quite funny.To enjoy this film, one should have an open mind, get dry and odd humor and have enough curiosity about life's big questions and ready to receive a comical answer. This is a good film to watch as a Sunday manatee and would make a great double feature with films like "History of the World: Part I", "Wholly Moses!" or even "Monty Python and the Holy Grail".8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monty Python Going Out With a (Not Literal) Bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the death of Graham Chapman, an undisciplined man who curiously became a cultural icon playing characters who are highly disciplinary, Python as a group ended. "The Meaning of Life" was their last major feat together and it's a good one.I hate back-stories in reviews, but I want first to establish my Pythonic credentials. You may skip the next two paragraphs if you like.I was a first-generation Python fan. Python burst into America when I was rising into high school. My brother saw weird entries in the TV GUIDE for a show called "Monty Python's Flying Circus." I had no notion of the title's First World War connections, but as an adolescent I knew I hated circuses. Still, the GUIDE entries were intriguing and I tuned in. Fortunately, going in cold with no idea what Python was, my introductory Python show had the Ministry of Silly Walks, and the next week was the Spanish Inquisition, which I did not expect. I was hooked.I saw each Python movie as it came out, starting with "And Now for Something Completely Different" and I still think their finest achievement, and one of the funniest movies ever made, was the loosely themed half-sketch "Holy Grail." Their "Life of Brian" was overrated by people whose hatred of Christians and Christianity overflowed to flood out their artistic sensibilities. Python was always at its best at fast, rapid-fire sketches and in reality "Brian" suffered from the same malaise that affected stuff like "The Cycling Tour" and "Mister Neutron." In 1983 Python came back with a literal vengeance to their comfort zone in their final major group project, "The Meaning of Life" (Python movies can't be about small themes).Python started out as six young men overacting in sadly under-funded hit-and-miss television sketches, and culminated as six (or maybe five) recognized middle-aged geniuses, always more brilliant as a group than as individuals, doing slick hit-and-miss sketches in a major motion picture. It seemed a perfect career arc.I had spent ten years involved with Python (watching their shows, reading their group books, attending their movies) and was a college senior when "Life" came out, and was not disappointed, then or now.SPOILERSSome of my own tastes have changed in the intervening three decades. First seeing "Life" I laughed for ten solid minutes at a man vomiting in a restaurant; now I skip that scene altogether. On the other hand, thanks to the Internet I know that the little brunette leading the topless runners is a Page 3 stunner named Carole Anne Stephenson and I still think she's one of the prettiest women I've seen in the movies even after thirty years' time.Python has always had a broad appeal, running sex jokes aimed at the meanest mentalities alongside sketches that require a college education to comprehend. This mix is evident from their earliest show and is even more true.And as with their television show, some sketches simply lie there and die, though another zinger may come along at any moment. In "Life" after a boring sketch set in a restaurant, the movie zooms back into first gear with a graphic scene called "Live Organ Transplants." Yet there is a harder edge to their humor than before. Eric Idle in particular seems to have grown increasingly bitter over the ten years I followed ongoing Python. I don't know what happened to him (his private life is his own business) but he seems an unhappy man.Python still skewers their favorite sacred cows. They have a special venom for the Catholic church, which may put off some viewers, though it leads to one of their better songs, "Every Sperm is Sacred" (The Universe Song is cleverer but not so catchy).Even in their successful middle age they are still challenging the audience with bits like "Find the Fish" -- which is designed to bewilder even the hardest-core fan.My favorite sketch concerns two fellows desperately trying to explain why they are dressed as tigers. Python was often at its most brilliant in such situations.END SPOILERSWhile "Life" is their best movie after "Holy Grail" I would not recommend it to newcomers. Rent the television shows first to gear your mind to their unique brand of humor, and to recognize the actors and the parts they prefer to play.</fullReview>

I did know that Catholics couldn't. This was probably the best sketch in th film and I thought it rather funny.

		<shortDescription>Not my favourite Python movie, but still quite witty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the least funniest of the Monty Python movies. I remembered this movie as simply a lot of naked breasts dancing around and when I first saw it, thought it was quite dull. There were a couple of other scenes, such as the incredibly fat man who explodes in the restaurant, the scene where death walks into the house during dinner and takes everybody too heaven, and the pirate accountant firm.Like most Monty Python movies, there is a lot of very clever and intelligent jokes, such as the Crimson Assurance Company who sail the great accountant sea. The pirate accountants are my favourite part of the movie because it is very clever. The rest of the movie has its moments, but is not one of Monty Python's best.The movie is about the meaning of life and it travels through a number of scenes in life and makes us laugh, and as such it is mostly black comedy. The meaning of life is a series of comic sketches all strung together with a common theme. This does not degrade from the movie though because the writers created it that way.What does the movie conclude about the meaning of life. Well in typical Monty Python style is seems to say we are born into a place that we have no choice about, we kill each other, have heaps of sex, and then we die. The sex education class is a very clever sketch, though I will not dive into analysing it for that is liable to destroy the comedy.As a movie it is not the best that I have seen, but it is typical of Monty Python and I wouldn't expect anything less from them. I guess my favourite sketch was the officer sketch, which was paying out the nature of the British Army, especially in the early wars were the officers would sit in their own little worlds while their men were dying around them. It did have numerous satirical criticisms, and did win an award at Cannes, but still does not rate high on my list.</fullReview>

I still love the Holy Grail as much as this, and I unbelievably haven't seen Life of Brian, but this is definitely the movie for anyone who wants belly laughs delivered by Britain's funniest, Monty Pyhthon. A series of nine hilarious sketches and a Terry Gilliam-directed short film are loosely connected by the plot of a tank of fish attempting to discover the meaning of life. From the bizarre yet hilarious animated title sequence to the final revealing of the meaning of life, the film keeps you laughing from beginning to end. Some of the highlights include: -Michael Palin and his hundreds of children singing a shockingly hilarious song about an equally shocking topic -Eric Idle and Palin attempting to explain why they're dressed as a tiger -An incredibly strange "Middle of the Film" sequence called "Find The Fish" -Idle emerging from a refrigerator to sing a song to Terry Jones (in drag) about his/her insignificance in the universe -Graham Chapman's "Christmas in Heaven" musical finale Just a head's up though, the film is not for the squeamish or easily offended. These events include: -a quite graphic sex education class with John Cleese -an overly bloody "live organ transplant" -Jones's incredibly obese, constantly vomiting Mr. Creosote -Chapman's death at the hands of...I shouldn't spoil it for you, but I will say it isn't good to show your children.

Personally, i found nothing offensive in the film, but religious and narrow minded people were a wee bit upset. (What a shame). Python were always doing what comedians are supposed to do...make people laugh. As far as i am concerned...they succeeded. It is quite clear that most of the top American reviewers simply did not get this. They were confused by the content of most of the sketches...which is very surprising...they were all so simple, and did not need over analysis. It was right and proper that the Python team left us with a very naughty movie--after all--their whole careers were always based on originality, surprises with a healthy dash of naughtiness.

		<shortDescription>Monty Python's The Meaning of Life:The Director's Cut.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Checking the special features on the DVD for Monty Python's final cinema feature,I was surprised to find that one of the main special features on the disc was a "Director's Cut" of the movie.With having greatly enjoyed my first viewing of the movie I few days ago,I was thrilled to get an opportunity to find out the meaning of life again,this time in an extended form!The plot:The film is spilt into nine (and a 10th introduction short movie) 10-15 minute loosely interconnected sections.Starting from a baby being born,the movie goes through "chapters" in peoples lives,from birth,growth and learning,to the dark side of the human race with war,death and eventually ending up in an after life which suggest that the meaning of life might be found in a cheesy Los Vagas style hotel heaven.View on the film:With having in the past been a bit put off in taking a look at the movie,due to its most famous scene/sketch being of a very,very fat man vomiting in a restaurant,I was thrilled to discover that the first part of the movie was to be a 15 minute "introduction" film directed by Terry Gilliam.Opening with a wonderfully thrilling sketch that shows a building full of stockbrokers turn into a pirate ship that travels the financial high seas and ends up burning its main competition to the ground,the Pythons cleverly use the opening sketch as a way to create a razor sharp satirical mood,which gets darker and much more cynical as the Pythons near the completion of the cycle of life.Whilst the overlapping connection to each of the previous sketch/section is not as clearly defined as it is in the Pythons debut movie And Now For Something Completely Different,the extra 9 minutes that director Terry Jones (who directed all of the movie,apart from the intro sketch) has put back into the movie,do help to give the loose theme a much stronger cohesiveness.One of the now extended highlights being a now greatly extended section/sketch including the historical figure Martin Luther,with the Pythons showing a strong satirical bite in a sketch which looks at the different sexual principle's of Catholics and Protistants,set in "The Third World" of Yorkshire.Although the "vomiting man" sketch/section of the movie does initially appear to be just going out to be as grotesque as possible,Jones closely works with editor Julian Doyle so that the most gross moments are stretched to a hilariously long,a head of their time level,which also perfectly matches Jones impressive long tracking shots,which end up making the search for the meaning of life as a travel as superbly absurd as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monty Python's The Meaning of life (1983): Authorship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famous comedy group return after the huge if controversial success of 1979 predecessor Life of Brian to ask what is the meaning of life? Although not as memorable as Life of Brian and The Holy grail (1975), this film is still unmistakably a Python project most notably for its return to a sketch show format familiar with their Television work. Further examples of distinctive Python authorship includes Terry Gillian's iconic animation sequences- the most vivid in this film being a God like character bouncing the earth like a ball.The film then goes to break up an average person's life into stages the first being Birth, the last being Death and the Afterlife. All stages switch between different time periods possibly in an attempt to show how the answer to the meaning of life has plagued people for centuries; a very clever narrative device. One of the best scenes is one in which the group play World War 1 soldiers attempting to show their officer how much he means to them. As well as a Teacher (John Cleese) teaching pupil's how to have sex literally. All examples of the groups own unique brand of humour, encompassing complete daftness with underlying ideologies.Despite the high points the film drags slightly towards the middle and you have to resort to seeing which character, Michael Palin's playing or Graham Chapman and so on; just to keep the boredom away. Although this is redeemed later with perhaps the film's most iconic scene involving an impossibly obese man's visit to a French restaurant. The meaning of life is nowhere near as good as previous efforts The Holy Grail and Life of Brian but that doesn't make it any less deserving as one of their best pieces of work.All of the Python's individual strengths such as Terry Jones' Direction, Terry Gillian's animation sequences and Eric Idle's Music, staples that made their previous films a success all combine to bring a unique sense of authorship onto their final feature film. Definitely worth a look for fans of Monty Python and comedy films in general.</fullReview>

However, it was also clearly very expensive to make and they wouldn't probably have the money to pay for special effects such as these for the whole film. The rest of the film is quite good, but it is not great and it doesn't reach the same levels of greatness as Life of Brian and Holy Grail, which are masterpieces of comedy.Overall, it is still a very good comedy and should be in the watchlist of everyone who likes comedy. Thought it is not obligatory for the general film goer, who should watch only the masterpieces: Holy Grail and Life of Brian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this goddamn hilarious laugh out loud pee yourself movie!!I know that the python team one and all think it is their weakest effort but I disagree strongly. The sketch with eric idle playing the waiter where he walks them through the restaurant an then across the road and then eventually into the park and he divulges what he thinks the meaning of life is and the long pause when he begins to insult the viewer is hysterical and pure comic genius.But the most memorable and unforgettable sketch that everyone sites is Mr Creasote. The bucket to vomit, the extended and brilliantly observed vomiting on the cleaning lady, every pause in the sequence is hysterical, the wafer thin mint at the end the final insane cous de grace.I heard the pythons have a screenplay about the crusades written years ago which was never made, please make guys guys, the world needs more python chuckles.Its Christmas in heaven!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two beginnings, one middle of the film - and the meaning of life revealed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monty Python's last film is often also considered their weakest entry, put together as a last resort on a joint vacation when all other ideas failed. Sure, unlike "Holy Grail" and "Life of Brian", "The Meaning of Life" consists mostly of separate sketches and is closer to the "Flying Circus", but the theme of life's progress keeps it all together. The Pythons and their incomparable humor are the constants, only the situations change.It has to be said that there are some strong borderline scenes in this movie, but it wouldn't be Monty Python if they didn't go for something completely different. And of course some controversy has to be expected given the territory. Standouts are some of the best songs the Pythons ever put together, among them the "Galaxy Song", the superbly choreographed "Every Sperm is Sacred" and the "Meaning of Life". Aside from the absurdly fantastic Python fun formula there's also the remarkable debut of Terry Gilliam as a main director of the film in the film, which starts "The Meaning of Life", then unexpectedly ends, and the viewer understands that this was not the main film yet - however this curious way over budget Gilliam-oddity later invades the main feature, and with a vengeance! That treat alone is already worth the price of admission. Besides, this is a picture with two beginnings, one explicit middle of the film and an ending, which reveals the meaning of life - now top that, seriously!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Meaning Of Life" Has Little Meaning But It Is Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really too into Monty Python. I don't dislike Monty Python; I just haven't watched much of the group's work. "The Meaning Of Life" was not an unlikeable film. It's basically a series of vignettes about different stages of life from birth all the way to death. It's always done in a humorous vein - there are no serious philosophical reflections on the meaning of life; it's all just done for fun. And for the most part it is fun, and sometimes it's downright funny. There's no consistency to this. There's no plot to speak of. The various vignettes have nothing to do with each other, and the characters aren't the same from one to the other. I've never watched "Monty Python's Flying Circus" either, but the feeling you got from this was that it was like stringing together a bunch of short TV episodes and making it a movie. It has all the familiar faces (the Monty Python faces I've come to know because they've done more than Monty Python) such as Michael Palin and John Cleese. It's a very enjoyable movie with some very silly songs, more than a few laughs and nothing especially deep or important or noteworthy about it. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Collection of Uneven Sketches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most obvious characteristic of this movie is its loose structure. It is actually a collection of sketches that are not very relevant one to the other except the fact that they follow each other in chronological succession and as they progress they are supposed to deal with the stages of human life from birth to death and even the afterlife. Some are funnier than the other and two of them "Organ Transplants" and the "Autumn Years" are in parts disgusting, although it is difficult to say which is more disgusting since the first has concentrated and intense disgusting scenes reminding modern splatter films while in the second vomiting is evenly distributed in the whole time span of the sketch. Nevertheless, some sketches are funny in a surreal way, such as the sketch about the lack of family planning in Roman Catholic families or the sketch about British officers in Africa, whose setting is partially based on the film "Zulu". The match between professors and pupils whose moral is that the strong lord over and tyrannize the weak reminded me of George Orwell's portrayal of school life, in his essay "Such, Such were the Joys" where he writes:"That was the pattern of school life- a continuous triumph of the strong over the weak" The background music was the same as in the series "Once upon a Time, there was Man", a French educational/historical series based in a similar view of Mankind. I wonder if Monty Pythons were inspired by it when choosing the music theme for the match. The sketch about sport as war, was followed by a sketch on war in the trenches making fun about class distinctions in the British Army. Overall the best sketch was the introductory short film about a firm of insurers in which the employees after killing the managers become pirates attacking skyscrapers where financial institutions are based. It is an absolutely surreal short film that can not be described in words. In the disgusting sketch about organ transplants there is a very good song both in terms of music and words, which is repeated in the titles of the end. This movie leaves you with an ambivalent impression but I can not say that I did not find it interesting or original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Acquired Taste, Not Most People's Favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The humor of Monty Python is an acquired taste. The British taste may not appeal to Americans, and some of it may just be too weird. But even among those who do like them, I think "Life" is often seen as the lesser of the big three -- "Holy Grail" clearly being most people's favorite.This film has its share of good moments, though, including the tiger scene (the Zulu aspect is pointless, but the tiger part is good). Mr. Creosote is a classic part, as is "Every Sperm is Sacred". Other parts are take it or leave it... the birth scene is pretty much rubbish besides the machine that goes bing.I think repeated viewings make the film more enjoyable and easier to understand. And one has to respect how much can be done with so few people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Python riot is hit and miss but will live on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life never quite reaches the heights of its superior stable mate The Life Of Brian, but is another riotous romp through bad taste and jaw dropping humour by the team. This film resembles much more the original TV sketch shows, and, like its small screen origins, is very much hit and miss. As with all the old Python sketches, some are tiresome and slow, but it is the stunning brilliance of any given sketch that can hit you at any time that lifts this movie well beyond the mundane. I vividly recall watching this as a schoolboy and thinking it was one of the best movies ever made. Given another viewing as a (hopefully) maturer adult, it falls a lot more flat than I first remembered. Indeed, in some places it looks like patched up Python, made up of stuff originally on the cutting room floor. However, the saving grace of the film are the strongest points that hit between the eyes: the uproariously funny 'Every Sperm Is Sacred' song and of course the infamous Mr Creosote restaurant sketch, which is perhaps the best remembered part of the entire film. Enough in here for fans to relish, but this was perhaps evidence that the Python's celluloid timeline was coming to a discreet end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, dark, depressing and ambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Monty Python troupe have always had a subversive streak. Think the anarcho syndicalist communes of "The Holy Grail", Terry Gilliam's "Brazil", the religious irreverence of "Life of Brian" or the anti-consumerism of "Time Bandits". Monty Python's "The Meaning of Life" continues this trend.The film is separated into seven chapters, or "stages of life". The first chapter, "Birth", parodies British kitchen-sink dramas ("Look Back In Anger", "A Taste of Honey" etc) and big budget musicals ("Oliver", "Mary Poppins" etc), using the contrast between both genres (one of which stresses escapism, the other confrontation) and a tale which compares hi-tech hospital birthing for the privileged with a working class Catholic family comprised of hundreds of children singing "all sperm are sacred, all sperm are great", to mock everything from health care, religion, the Pope's aversion to condoms, hospital overspending, class divides, gender building ("Is it a boy or a girl?" a mother asks when her child is delivered. "A little early to start imposing roles upon it!" the doctor replies.), Puritan attitudes about sex and how glossy, expensive musicals pander to (and are embraced by) the working class whilst gritty kitchen-sink dramas are typically embraced by snobbish types.Ten minutes into the film and already the Python gang have touched upon more issues than most directors do in a lifetime. The film's second chapter, titled "Education", shows students witnessing a graphic sex education lesson. The metaphoric implications of classroom competition, a society indoctrinated into domination and subservience (sexual, economic, physical, psychological etc), are then carried to a literalized extreme as the "educators" brutalise their students during a sadistic sporting event, the kids forced to play a one sided rugby match between children and violent adults.The film's third chapter, titled "war", is introduced with a neat match-cut linking a boy on a rugby field with a soldier in the same position on a battlefield. From school and sports we therefore move on to the logical consequence, segueing smoothly from organised male team sports to team sports (war, nationalism, patriotism etc) by other means. The implication here is not only that gender roles and power relations are constructed or reinforced by social institutions, but that this microcosm of domination is merely boot-camp for domination (and corporate/national survival, and the survival of socio-political movements) on a larger, perhaps global scale.And so on and on it goes, the Monty Python gang constructing a series of philosophical comedy skits which aim at social criticism. The best segment is Terry Gilliam's "The Crimson Permanent Insurance", a skit about accountants who stage an ineffectual rebellion against wall street, bankers and corporate oligarchs, but there's lots of other good stuff strewn about as well. Consider the funny skit about a man charged "for superfluous sexist behaviour". He's given the death sentence by a judge, and allowed to choose the method of his execution. His choice? He chooses to die by being chased off a cliff by a dozen naked women. In other words, the "treatment" is as sexist as the victim, which, amongst other things, is a subtle jab at capital punishment.Other skits feature soldiers comically dying as they bring gifts, presents and clocks for their commanders (a clunky literalization of how soldiers die and are exploited simply so that leaders may acquire more "time" and "wealth"), whilst another has a ridiculously fat man consuming huge amounts of food before vomiting on everyone in sight. Encapsulating the all consuming, exponentially expanding ethos (and necessity) of capitalism, this rich slob consumes and consumes, barfing all over everyone, including a lowly floor scrubber who later confesses to hating Jews, a subtle allusion to the Holocaust and how the resentments of the poor are easily misdirected.Another segment features a song about man's inconsequentiality, a depressing jingle in which mankind is shown to be dwarfed by the sheer scale and indifference of his universe. Meanwhile, another features leaves committing suicide in autumn, another features a school headmaster celebrating those who died to keep China under the thumb of the British Empire, and another features folks discussing the "meaning of life" and deciding that such thoughts are morbid and merely serve to distract people from living life itself. Throw in jabs at Catholicism, Puritanism, Protestantism, the lifestyles of the ruling class and "middle class", the military, pretentious educational films, the irrational, blind faith man has in science and the ideological manipulations of the mass media and you have one massively angry film masquerading as light comedy.8/10 ? Starting with birth and culminating with death, this is a very dark film. Still, it's not all doom and gloom. If the Monty Python gang ever come close to articulating the "meaning of life", it's in the words of a French waiter who says "there are many people in the world, and in order to get along, you have to try and make everyone happy." Of course the waiter then looks directly into the camera and tells his audience to "f**k off!". And "f**k off" we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most sketch-oriented of the Python films delivers the crew's finest satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Meaning of Life" takes the Monty Python gang back to its sketch comedy roots--not that "Holy Grail" and "Life of Brian" weren't sketch-oriented, but they were sketches within a continuous plot line. "Meaning of Life" is tied together only with the thread that the sketches are all supposed to be about discovering the meaning of life. Not being loyal to a standard plot structure opens up a lot more possibility for the six comedians and the result is satire that comes across more clearly than any of their previous films. At the same time, there is a slight sacrifice of humor--specifically hysterics--but the brilliance of the social commentary wins out.Written in a series of parts, "Meaning of Life" travels along the life cycle (from birth to death) in search of reason for our existence. What the film discovers (and we find out), however, is that we've got a lot of meaningless crud in the way and we're too stupid and ignorant to understand life or appreciate its miraculousness.As a film built brick by brick using sketches would seem to, "Meaning of Life" is enjoyed scene by scene. Some will stick with you and make you laugh, others will twist and poke fun at your very understanding of reality. Most memorable are scenes like the musical romp "Every Sperm is Sacred" which is meant to show the benefits of being Protestant (you're allowed to put rubber on your John Thomas). Some are true to "Holy Grail" fashion, like a tiger in Africa, when a British general (John Cleese) during the conquest of Africa goes off in search of his main officer's legs to find Michael Palin and Eric Idle dressed in a tiger costume, attempting to deny such claims. The best satire of the film is when John Cleese shows his class of apathetic students a live demonstration of intercourse, a hysterical commentary on education, namely sex education.Other moments of satire that prod at the film's greater idea are scenes such as the two Americans on holiday in presumably Hawaii who go to a restaurant to order conversations off the menu, philosophy being one, for example. The point there is to highlight the meaningless chit chat over dinner that is often viewed as being important despite the obvious meaninglessness. Also, the Death scene with the grim reaper getting agitated by a few couples eating dinner together and treating him like anyone else makes a similar point about the phony ways people treat each other at times.Overall, the film constantly brings up the phrase "the meaning of life," but something always hinders it or distracts from it, or its significance goes unnoticed. Right from the start, the Birth scene where machines that go "bleep" are seen as more important than the birth itself, which is treated like a tourist attraction instead of a personal moment, Monty Python establishes its agenda.True, some scenes are total head-scratchers: the short film before the film involving old men accountants becoming business pirates and sailing their building in search of Americans to pillage, or the live organ donor scene. Not everything is poignant and certainly not everything is hysterical, but the fact that you can generally pick up on what they're trying to say makes it much more commendable.</fullReview>

There are even musical numbers, but with that same unmistakable brand of Python humor.Funniest Python movie ever, because I was bored in the Holy grail. This one is funny, but the guy throwing up is hilarious. I laughed so hard when he threw up on the menu. John Cleese and pals are hilarious, because others, I don't know what to say. But, funny film.

		<fullReview>Wildly uneven Python with some of their very best material but some scenes smack of filler. It's interesting to watch the interviews on the making of this one and I had read the book 'Monty Python Speaks'(my God, am I really a Python nerd?) and the Pythons almost seem apologetic about 'Meaning of Life' which is unfortunate, it did win the Jury Grand Prize at the Cannes film festival after all. Most of it is absolutely brilliant, just a true slap in the face to the politically correct. PC wasn't quite as rampant in 1983 but I think the Python's sensed it's oncoming and consequently made this movie. When the PC police took over the western world is when the Python's finally gave up, I suppose. Anyways, this movie takes on religion, yuppies, fish, obesity, live-organ donation, corporate greed, war, modern medicine, the after-life and a lot of British uptighted-ness which I suppose is why the French liked it so much. Again, not everyone's cup of tea, outrageous humour from some very repressed English lads that erupts into some very angry comedy that appeals to the demented ones such as myself. If you are truly upstanding and pathetically stunted then do not watch, this kind of entertainment is just going to horrify and offend you, if not, then enjoy to your heart's content because you will never again see anyone get away with this kind of humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with the power to change your whole perspective on life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder whether the Pythons realised quite how well some themes in The Meaning Of Life would hold up. An example that really sticks out for me is The Miracle Of Birth - Part One. Even though this film was made twenty-three years ago, every time I see this bit of the film I always think of those TV programmes that show labour and delivery (usually in hospitals). British programmes of this type don't seem quite as similar to this sequence in The Meaning Of Life but the American ones I've seen on Sky are so similar to this sketch, it's actually frightening.Living in the next county to Yorkshire, I really love The Miracle Of Birth - Part Two. I know people with accents like that. The whole idea of Catholics being unable (theoretically) to use contraception was a heavily debate issue in some RE lessons when I was at school, and everything in this sequence satirises it. I particularly love the Oliver-style musical set-up of Every Sperm Is Sacred - it's such a catchy song. The sexually repressed neighbour and her husband are a great end to this sequence - Terry Jones and Eric Idle make such brilliant women.The school sequence reminds me so much of some very boring assemblies at school and college, and Michael Palin's prayer and hymn are inspired. I'm undecided about how I personally might have responded to John Cleese's sex education lesson, but I do love his instructions at the start of the lesson regarding younger brothers, haircuts and putting clothes on lower pegs. In fairness, that sex education lesson was probably more frank and informative than any similar lesson I sat through at school. I sometimes think there's something a bit Blackadderesque about the Fighting Each Other scene. The sergeant is so concerned with the proper manners and laying out the crockery and being polite enough to accept his present and his cake despite the bombing and shelling, it reminds me of Melchett and Darling in Blackadder Goes Forth - he's sort of immune to the real danger that's literally all around them. Michael Palin is also wonderful as the sergeant-major "marching up and down the square" alone, after letting his platoon go off on their preferred recreational activities. The tiger sequence is mad but so very funny - for some reason, it reminds me of It Ain't Half Hot, Mum.I quite like The Middle Of The Film and The End Of The Film - it's quite unexplained and odd, but yet it seems to fit in well. The fish in the tank are also great commentators. The American couple in the mediaeval dungeon Hawaiian restaurant are brilliant characters - again Eric Idle looks so good dressed as a woman. The Liver Donor Sketch is similarly surreal, and the screaming and the spraying blood are so strange and gory and graphic, and it's equally surreal that it then flows into the wonderful Galaxy Song. Mr. Creosote is - of course - grotesque but the waiter's soliloquy afterwards is strangely touching.The Death sequence with the poisoned salmon mousse and the Grim Reaper is also reminiscent of the "Blackadder" scenario in the Fighting Each Other scene - the little details like whether to take their cars is just like the sergeant telling his soldiers to get plates and napkins when they're about to die. I'm sure some people would find this film offensive, but I don't. The marvellous thing to me is how well it satirises situations you don't automatically think to find satire in. It's worth watching for that alone - this film certainly helped me to identify what I disagree with about the medical view of pregnancy and birth, for one thing. And the meaning of life - while succinctly put - is very, very true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film on main circuit, and watched it (today) again on DVD. My impressions are still similar: this is an ambitious work, very funny in places (some excellent song and dance numbers, entirely unexpected!) and some wonderfully OTT moments (a brilliant John Cleese as a headteacher ho demonstrates sex to an unperturbed and rather bored class and the man who explodes! But there are also moments of too-long humour, particularly in the opening film sequence. Gilliam's overly expansive film is not in keeping with the film-- it tends to waver a bit and is too indulgent.I found DVD extras quite interesting, and would agree that the film does not hold together very well- it is a serious of sketches, some successful, some not.

		<shortDescription>Serving Up Some Acting With That Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Meaning of Life is not that funny a movie especially if you compare it with the other Python films, but what it does highlight is some of the finest comedic acting you'll ever see. Great comedic acting doesn't necessarily mean that you'll laugh until your stomach hurts, but it does mean that you will be reasonably entertained. It seems that with this movie even during the dull sketches the talented members of this comedy troupe can still keep you engaged because they are all marvelous actors. Take for instance Michael Palin in the Marchin' Up And Down The Square sketch. It is a one joke sketch, but his performance makes it seem so much more dynamic. When Death visits the dinner party each Python is fully portraying an original character and they pull it off so well. The Pythons were a funny lot and great writers to boot, but they could also act, which is something they never receive much credit for. So right here on IMDb I'm announcing the winners of the first ever IMDb Postie Award For Outstanding Achievement in The Art of Comedic Acting. And the winners are Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, and John Cleese for their performances in The Meaning of Life. They are taking the stage now and are about to thank everyone, but they instantly cut to a commercial, booooo award shows, boooooooo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin, the Monty Python troupe, play various parts in this zany, wacky movie, allegedly about "The Meaning of Life." Monty Python doing Meaning of Life? What? You think. And you're right. This movie shows nothing whatsoever about the meaning of life. And the guys realize this, of course. It's nothing serious, but at some points, it's dreadfully funny.You definitely need to be a Python fan for this one. A sketch movie more than anything else. Odd but enjoyable. As some of the guys say in the interviews on the DVD, they wanted to do a sketch movie, but they had to have a storyline. And they didn't. See, the thing is...a movie is very different from a television show. One of the major differences is that you're expecting very different things from a movie as compared to a TV show. A TV show does not necessarily require a storyline (such as game shows, Whose Line, Monty Python's Flying Circus, etc.) but it can (The O.C., some reality shows, The Simpsons, Family Guy, etc.). However, a movie, generally must. (There are exceptions, though. Mermaids. ;-) ) Anyway, a definite mixed bag. I enjoyed most of it, except for the fat man scene and of course, the liver donor scene. And the pre-show could have (and should have) been cut out, as I just didn't find it very funny. So, yes, a Python fan should see it and other people...well...don't expect them to actually TELL you what the meaning of life is.</fullReview>

Included are such sketches as a British officer who supposedly loses his leg to a tiger during the Zulu Wars, the surreal "Find the Fish" segment, and the classic gross-out moment of Terry Jones as Mr. Creosote. And let's not forget the catchy musical numbers "Every Sperm Is Sacred" and "The Universe Song." Does this movie reveal the Meaning of Life? Maybe not, but you'll have some laughs while trying to figure it all out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From birth to death, this is a hilarious view at the time we spend in between. The established cast of actors, in and out of drag, poke fun at everything from religion to vital organ transplants. My favorite scene is where "the fattest man in the world" pigs out at a fancy restaurant and eventually explodes to the disgust of the other guests. Another good one is where 3 couples at a house party get a visit from the grim reaper and give him several clever arguments before finally following him to Heaven. This is The Monty Python Gang at their very best. The little ditty at the end of the movie is priceless! This film is an absolute must for fans (but then again, if you're a fan, you've already seen it anyway). The 10 minute introduction starts out like a long commercial about a bunch of fuddy-duddy accountants, but it quickly turns into typical Monty Python stick. It serves as a "warm up" for the main act, so be sure to stay for the headliners. This one is a keeper!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Monty Python team's swansong is everything you'd expect it to be - dark, scathing, delightfully silly, shocking, surreal and intelligent all at once. Although the quality control is not as high as it was for 'Life Of Brian', and the fact that it's basically a sketch film seems problematic to some viewers, this is probably the closest the Pythons ever came on the big screen - in terms of spirit and execution, at least - to the anything-goes, stream-of-consciousness, funny bad dream approach of their television work. (And whilst And Now For Something Completely Different was fine, it was in effect just a 'greatest hits' movie that reprised a lot of their TV sketches for the cinema, whereas The Meaning Of Life is all original material.)Don't watch this if you're expecting feelgood entertainment - this is the darkest and most troubling of all the Python movies, with something to offend everyone and a very downbeat ending. But I wouldn't want it any other way. Several of the sketches have entered into movie folklore, such as the sex education lesson, Mr Creosote, the live organ transplant and Death's unexpected arrival in the middle of a dinner party, but there's plenty more to enjoy here - Palin and Idle's brilliantly silly double act as the front and back halves of a tiger, Jones and Chapman looking like characters from Dr Seuss on acid playing "find the fish", Gilliam's stunning title sequence (and the Crimson Permanent Assurance segment, which looks wonderful but is just a bit too long), and Cleese as a slimy, patronizing doctor who delivers one of the funniest lines of the whole film - when an expectant mother asks him "What do I do?", he barks "Nothing dear, you're not qualified!". Good stuff throughout, especially when compared to some of the team's later solo efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming from a non-Python fan, this is pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have quite a few friends and acquaintances who are fans of the Pythons, and two of them recommended I see this film and "Life of Brian," since I was disappointed by "The Holy Grail." I've never watched the Monty Python TV series, so I didn't have time to completely acquire their eccentric sense of humor. In "Holy Grail," the jokes are totally pointless, but it apparently satisfied die-hard Python fans. I found "Meaning of Life" much funnier. There are some truly hilarious gags, including John Cleese's sex education class, in which the students yawn like they're hearing their instructor lecture them on geometry. I felt that was an original approach, as well as the live sex demonstration between him and his wife. My problem with the film is it gets soggy in the third act, and at times becomes overly crude. The British sometimes fancy the bathroom humor a little too much. The most famous gag contains a morbidly obese man throwing up profusely. The funny thing is the Pythons were about to delete that gag, because they initially agreed that it wasn't funny. Well, they should've gone with their first instincts. Unfortunately, most people seem to disagree and find the gag hilarious. What can I say? I'm not a fan of vomit gags. I don't remember the last time I laughed at any comedic scene that involved vomit. I also didn't enjoy the musical numbers. Not because they're especially bad, but because I've never been a big fan of musicals. It would be better if they focused on comedy throughout. I watched the director's cut DVD, so it contained some gags that were snipped from the film, some of which are actually quite funny. I enjoyed the Martin Luther sketch. Rent or buy the DVD, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Though I hated "Holy Grail," I wanted to restore my faith in the Pythons, since I've seen Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin in other projects and they've always made me laugh. Now that I've seen "Meaning of Life," I'm glad I restored that faith, though I don't know yet if I could ever become a die-hard Python fan. (7 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smarter and funnier than Holy Grail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Meaning of Life, Monty Python's last film is very much overshadowed by Grail. The enormous success has forced this gem into the shadows but it is surely not to be missed. The film starts after a short accountancy piracy skit with the first part, child birth. It then goes through 6 other parts some including "Fighting Each Other", "Death", and "Live Organ Transplants". All of which are hilariously done. There is a lot of content in the film, however. Language isn't bad but there is a bit of nudity and some graphic content. A man explodes and his insides are visible, another has his organs removed with a saw (we only see the organs being pulled out but plenty of blood shoots out), and some people are stabbed with knife-like devices.It's definitely not for everyone. Some may not be able to handle the content (see above) while others think it is just stupid and disgusting. But if you look beyond that you will see the true genius of Python. The satire in this film is so tremendous and it is just an all out riot. The Meaning of Life definitely outruns Grail and comes close to Life of Brian. Don't wast time and go watch it. Final Grade: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true reflection of original Python-ness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly the only Python film that captures the essence of the original television series. Michael, John, Terry, Terry, Graham, and Eric put together a film that is not only a collection of sketches loosely bound together by the topic of Life (and, eventually, Death), but an intense social commentary as well. The Meaning of Life is not just about comedy; it's about shock value and making light of human experience. It's a film that allows us to laugh at ourselves and each other as we progress through life, from birth to death and all the stages in between. Touching on topics such as capitalism, sex, military, death, obesity, the vastness of the universe, fish, government, and bureaucracy, The Meaning of Life is educational, deep, and even funny at times. You'll be surprised how far the Pythons will go to try to offend you, weird you out, shock and appall you, and make you laugh in ways you never knew how to before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the last of the Monty Python films, it was also the last one I saw and unfortunately it's not nearly as fun as their previous work.The meaning of life is a very bizzarre and uneven film. Some scenes makes one laugh loud enough to make the windows in one's house to tremble (Mr. Creosot) while others are simply too long and boring (the intro).It seems that for every funny scene there's one that's just too strange for it's own good. It sometimes seems like the Pythons were too interested at making a zany flick than a good one, this never reaches the incredibly high standards that Monty Python set years befor with the amazing "The quest for the holy grail" and the even better "Life of Brian". That's not to say that it's bad though, it has it's moments and it still beats over 90% of all the comedies made today. But I still have to say that I expected more from the Pythons than this.Nice but no cigarre.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting It Together At the Last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the few first-generation Pythoners (that is, going to the show with absolutely no preconceptions or knowledge of the writers or the sketches, having tuned in on the strength of an odd TV GUIDE entry in the early '70s, I became quickly hooked and followed the career of the Monty Python troupe avidly for the next ten years.The place to start with Python really is the series. Unfortunately, when the Pythons turned their eyes on the cinema, they thought movies could be made like the tv shows: the shows were 30 minutes of sketches, movies were 90 minutes of sketches. In this they were mistaken, and their first movie, "And Now for Something Completely Different", a re-working of many of their funniest tv sketches, simply exhausts one and by the end there's no laughter left.Their funniest movie was "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", where they were able to tie sketches to the semblance of a plot. Their next attempt, "The Life of Brian", has too few non-sequiturs. Just as the sketches, funny though they were, became tedious in "Now for Something Completely Different", the satire became tedious in "Brian". It had the same feel of the television sketches that rambled on too long and outstayed their welcome (the Blancmange from Outer Space, the Cycling Tour, Mr. Neutron, etc.)."Holy Grail" was their funniest movie in laughs. "Monty Python's Meaning of Life" is perhaps their best movie. It plays to their strength, which is short sketch humor rather than the sustained plots and satire of the tedious "Brian". But, avoiding the trap of "Completely Different", they arrange the sketches in an a series of themes (birth, education, live organ transplants, middle age, death, etc.) with the overall theme of "the meaning of life" . . . which they never actually get around to explaining. This allows them to do another thing they do incredibly well (as with the earlier Summarize Proust Competition and the Bruce's Philosopher's Song) that allows these Oxford and Cambridge educated men to use the pretense of depth and erudition (which they do well) as a cover for cheap laughs.So, though the sketches are scattershot, and some are only loosely related to their ostensible themes, and some are creaky, they all cohere well. So, though it's not their funniest movie, it rolls along smoothly with plenty of humor, marred only by a few deliberately offensive barbs (such as an anti-Semitic poem).The true test of a fan having the Python mindset is the sketch where a large man vomits unceasingly for several minutes (warning: do not eat during parts of this movie, the effects are very realistic). Some of the tedious parts including a drawn-out sequence of a teacher (John Cleese) who is trying to teach sex education (graphically, with his wife) to a class of bored students and a British soldier who thinks his leg was bitten off by a mosquito. As is typical of Python, the best bits are the shorter ones: the Galaxy Song (a transcendent moment tucked inside the "Live Organ Transplants" segment); a World War I battle where, before going over the top, the soldiers insist on presenting their commander with tokens of their esteem; and an astonishing short feature by Terry Gilliam.Though "Meaning of Life" is their finest work, it should not be viewed before the series or "Holy Grail". One should fully understand what Monty Python is before approaching this work.</fullReview>

For fall-down, laugh-out-loud comedy, with a heavy dose of oh-my-god-how-can-they-SHOW- that?????-gross-out-humor, this one can't be beat. Mr. Creosote is notorious.

		<fullReview>I sure hope some of you didn't watch the movie because you actually wanted to know the meaning of life. Good, because all you'll get is a lot of laughs(which is not a bad thing). It's funny how they spoof the many phases of life such as birth, sex, death and a few other things. You'll enjoy the "every sperm is sacred" song, it's quite catchy. Watch out for Terry Jones in a big fat suit as he spoofs a glutton(there is a lot of vomit in this bit). And the funniest part in my opinion was the Grim Reaper bit. Even so, this movie doesn't explain the meaning of life as it says in the title and you would be a big idiot if you saw the movie expecting an explanation of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and possibly my favorite for that. Given the greed of the 80's and 90's (which had only begun in 1983), even "Permanent Crimson Assurance" takes on adisturbing air. It is certainly their most cinematic and elaborate film, though I agree with some who say that the humor suffers (or, more correctly, changes)because of that. I regret that they did not do another just to see how far they could push. I recognize that much of it is deliberately offensive, but anyone who likes their comedy with a does of bitters should enjoy it.Also, to correct an earlier reviewer - Graham Chapman died of cancer that had metastasized from his throat (he was a heavy pipe smoker much of his life) to his liver (he drank heavily as well, as the comments on "Holy Grail" note.) Gay men do die for reasons other than AIDS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best or Worst Python Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will either think its the best work they`ve ever done, or the worst. There is no in between. I find it to be the best purely on the edginess of the material. Almost every sketch has the potential to offend and shock. It can be extremely depressing too, but you`re laughing anyway. I truly believe that the Pythons have lost their minds here. They look crazy (watch Cleese`s eyes as the doctor and in the organ donor sketch). It`s not lighthearted fun, its quite serious humor and that is perhaps why most people dont like it or dont get it. If thats how you like your comedy, this movie is for you.A Note on the DVD: I dont think the transfer from video to DVD worked too well. Anything that moves on the screen is pixilated (I dont know what the exact term for it is). There are weird lines that show up on anything that moves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not everybody´s movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Meaning of Life is the Monty Python group´s last actual work together, not counting some meetings and video games and stuff that was made later (mostly without the late Graham Chapman). The Pythons were clearly making this movie their last one, because they put a lot of bad taste to this movie just so they would not be forgotten very soon. So fans of Peter Jackson´s or John Water´s early movies may enjoy this quite a lot. Remember when in Holy Grail the Black Knight´s all limbs were slashed off and King Arthur got a bucket of Sh*t on his head?Well, that´s nothing compared to Mr. Creosote, the world´s fattest man exploding or a cleaning woman getting a bucket of puke on her head.So, this could have been the greatest comedy masterpiece the Pythons ever did. Alas, it was not. Most of the sketches are overdone and unfunny. There are still two extremely funny moments; the first is a song called Every Sperm is sacred. If you won´t laugh, when you see the choreography and other gimmicks they use in this sequence, you must be made of wood or catholic. The other is the surreal and weird sketch at the middle of the film called Find the Fish. It may loose some silliness when watched at home rather than in an english movie theater, but nevertheless, it is hilarious.Though this is not a very funny movie, it´s, in my opinion, a very good one. This movie´s best moments are in the outrageous song sequences (Songs like O Lord, Please don´t burn us, Penis song (Not the Noel Coward song) and the Sperm song I mentioned earlier. Also the Pythons´ acting is great. John Cleese is the best Grim Reaper I´ve seen in a film. Because I like Terry Pratchett´s discworld novels, I love this Death sequence even more.The most touching moment of this and any Monty Python movie comes in the end after the secrets of life have been revealed. A television is playing the opening tune of Monty Python´s flying circus and floating into space with the music fading, and the credits start to roll with Eric Idle´s Galaxy song playing in the background. That´s how the career of the funniest comedy group of all time ends. This short sequence alone makes me want to remember this movie with such warmness as the other Python movies so there must be something "magical".As I said, this is not everyone´s movie, not even all the Python fans like it. But something in the athmosphere, maybe some deeper truths under the cover of bad taste and fish obsessions makes me like this movie very much and I can´t wait for the great new Special Edition DVD I heard was coming. Though MOL is not a Python classic like Life of Brian, it´s still greatly entertaining.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like old times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three main reasons why I like this movie. First, The Crimson Permanent Assurance is a great short going appropriately before the film. Second, the film has some great camerawork which helps quite a few of the jokes.Third, and most importantly, this movie brings back the feel of the original Monty Python. The boys started as six people cramming as much as they possibly could into a thirty-minute BBC programme. Apart from "And Now For Something Completely Different," this is the movie that most closely captures the original spit-fire delivery of the original. The Birth Scene is a fine example: Once the baby comes out, the doctors "frighten" it, carelessly throw it into a towel, give the mother a quick glimpse, throw the baby into isolation, give the mother lots of happy pills, and then leave without another word. Classic.Another great example: We get to watch the British Army at its finest. We find them to be friendly enough to give their officers some clocks and a cake. We find the officers democratic and humanitarian in letting the soldiers go see a movie. We watch as the soldier is calm in spite of the fact that he has one sock too many, and just when we think the army is just super... we go to "Find the Fish," a dada exhibition of curvy arms, elephant heads, and faucets for naughty bits.A rugby match literally becomes a war zone. Guys come out of fridges to sing while someone else is getting his liver cut out. The obese Mr. Creosote eats immensely and throws up just as much. A man chooses to die from being chased off a cliff by nude women. The Python boys are in their old territory: sketches with no endings, inventively deranged concepts, and only the cartoons are loonier than the guys. And, of course, fish.The movie ends appropriately enough: we've come to expect an anti-climax for anything Python. And so, this movie is (obviously) for the fans. It's also a treat for anyone who won't mind watching some disgusting things for a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has it's moments but still the weakest of the Python movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant*WARNING* POSSIBLE SPOILERSI believe it was John Cleese who quite openly stated some time ago that he regarded 'Monty Python's The Meaning of Life' to be 'Something of a cock up'.Basicly a series of sketches beginning with birth right up to death and the after life.This last entry for the Python team is merely a series of unconnected surreal skits(That only they could do) with the running theme of the meaning of life.Having seen it I think Cleese was being a little hard on himself and the rest of his colleagues.Sure 'The Meaning of Life' is the weakest in the series of the Python movies.But compared to some of the movies the likes Cleese, Idle, Palin and the rest made after it it's a simple masterpiece.There's Graham Chapmans's very last movie,'Yellowbeard' for instance or Eric Idle's dire 'Splitting Heir's'.Both embarrassing travesty's in their own rights.Indeed this is a mixed bag of a movie.There are some fairly embarrassing moments that make you wonder what the team were smoking when they were sitting around the table and brainstorming ideas.There is for example the hideous sight of Chapman dressed in some bizarre brightly colored corset, stockings and wig.Wearing makeup,very much like David Bowie would have worn as Ziggy Stardust.With him is Terry Jones dressed in what apears to be a waiters costume with incredibly long arms.Both of them are warbling on with over the top voices about looking for a fish.You know.Something like 'Where's Wally' but more disturbing.The whole scene is just ridiculous and to top it all of we have some elephant like abomination thrown on to the screen to freak us out even more.The scene set during the crimean war doesn't help either.Something to do with a soldier who's leg has been stolen by a tiger.Sadly these are not the only scenes.There's a sketch involving a birth in a hospital that partly sends up 'Dr.Kildare' that is just down right baffling at times.This is just one more in a number of less than inspired moments.But for those scenes that do not work there are those moments of inspired genius that only Cleese and Co. could come up with.The sketch set in Yorkshire with the working class family with too many kids that satarises the catholic church's attitude to contraception is an instant classic.The amazing song and dance routine, 'Every sperm is sacred' is brilliantly put together and performed.It just wonderfully sums up the ignorance and the naievity, not to mention the dogma of catholosism.It harkens back to the lampooning of the fanatacism in the christian faith that was seen in the superb 'Life of Brian'.One of the better Python efforts.Then there's the other musical number 'The Galaxy Song' that makes you look at the possible insignificance of your life and it's problems when compared to the size and magnitude of the cosmos.It's a song brilliantly delivered by Eric Idle in a wonderfully surreal sketch that deals with the subject of live organ transplants.But who can forget the repulsive sketch not too far from the end of the movie.The vomit inducing scene involving the most vile and repulsive character ever created by the Python team. The grotesque Mr.Creoste who is wonderfully and disgustingly played to perfection by Terry Jones.I won't say any more as it would spoil the surprise.Though I believe the reactions of the loyal fans out there might be quite mixed.It is a scene not for the easily offended and it's denouement is certainly jaw dropping.It also contains a little epilogue which will certainly upset some religously.There is a poignant side to the movie.This of course was Graham Chapman's last movie with any of the Python team as he sadly passed away as a result of the AIDS virus shortly after the film and his very last feature 'Yellowbeard' were completed.It is very evident how ill Chapman was in a scene fairly late in the film where he looks quite gaunt.Not the way i'm sure we the fans or his close friends, relatives and colleagues would care to remember him.It's little wonder that a dedication was never placed at the end of the movie.It's not hard to see why the Python's made this there last film.It seemed quite obvious that they were running out of ideas and were beginning to repeat themselves.It's funny when you look back now to see were each of the teams career moves took them afterwards.It seems safe to say that out of all the stars involved, Terry Gilliam had the most lucky and successful.Although now a big name director in Hollywood I think he would probably sooner forget the debacle that was the failed attempt to film his 'Don Coyote' project.Anyway.If you get the chance try and get a hold of it on video or DVD,Or better yet if you see it's going to be screened on your nearest television station. Tape or watch it.It's worth seeing.If only for those brief flashes of Python genius.It's a shame you have to wallow through some lamer moments.But trust me.The moments that do work are worth the wait.Robs Rating:* * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most brilliant Python film. Without a doubt. While it wasn't as laugh a minute as Holy Grail, and it didn't suck me into the story like Life of Brian, this is a brilliant and odd commentary on life, death, and Americans. The easily offended or fanatically religious should steer clear, but everyone else (Except small children) should see this movie. Cleese is hardly in the film, which follows an odd trend. He was practically every single character in Holy Grail, less in Life of Brian, and now he only plays three characters. Idle is hands down my favorite and does a wonderful job in this film, as does Palin. Chapman and Jones didn't play many characters, but had some very memorable bits. The songs are catchy and, trust me, you'll get them in your head for days at a time. There are some bits that are deep and disturbing, some that are just plain weird, and some that are crude, but every sketch has a meaning, almost a moral, if you will. You try and figure out what that message is. It's half the fun of watching this delightful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is preceded by a brilliant piece of live-action by Terry Gilliam titled `The Crimson Parliament Assurance'. Then we go into the tasteless world of Meaning of Life. The skits are at times very funny, but you must have a strong stomach if you want to get through most of them. This movie was in some ways a, `Lets see how offensive and tasteless we can make this!' movie. In some parts it was lacking the originality of the previous films and the series, but some of the brilliant skits (Death, Crimson Parliament Assurance, The Middle of the Film, Live Organ Transplants, and The Miracle of Birth) more than make up for the lack of Python originality. If you're a Python fan like me, you might feel a tear roll down your face at the end. Short: A+, Movie: B+. Overall Grade: A-Rated R for non-stop vulgar crude/sexual humor, nudity, graphic comic violence, and strong language. Suggested for ages 15 and up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it is not really a comedy in the strictest sense (it is more like a series of comedy sketches that are imaginatively strung together without breaking the theme or the joyful spell that this film puts on you), it has to be one of the funniest 90 minutes or so of film ever dedicated to the big screen.One scene after another is hilarious, but my personal favorite is when a dignified Grim Reaper halts an upper-middle class dinner party to summon the guests to the after-life, but is treated without an ounce of recognition or respect. When the English host chastises the Grim Reaper for rudely interrupting the party, Death incarnate bursts into a classic rant against British politeness and etiquette, followed by another equally classic rant against American familiarity. And then Death pulls the coup de gras by revealing the means by which all the dinner party guests were done in: "The SALMON MOUSE!"Of course, Mr. Creosote is one of the best and most memorable scenes in the movie, but I especially cherish the two small secenes that follow it. First there is racist mop-lady, who seems to be giving an insightful soliliquy on the meaning of life, but ends up only with the shocking punch-line "but, at least I don't work for Jews!" And that scene is followed by another small gem where we follow the waiter on a nostalgic journey to his birthplace. Again this scene seems to be on the verge of revealing something about the meaning of life, but when the waiters monologue starts to falter, he angrily turns on the audience. I love how that scene starts with the gentle invitation to "come follow me" as we follow the French waiter on his journey, and ends with "F#%$ You! I don't care if you don't like it. F$%# off!" There is something hilarious about the British Pythons doing charicatures of French insults.Only in a few places does the film fail to be less than outstanding. The burlesque "Christmas in Heaven" complete with topless dancers is a fine bit of satire but not quite as glorious as most of the movie. And the scene which precedes it, where the tourist couple "order" conversational topics from a menu as if they were ordering appetizers is weak. But for these few exceptions the movie is packed with memorable scenes.The "Crimson Permanent Insurance" is both incredibly funny and ingenious. I still can't get over how they turned a crumbling office building into a pirate ship with swords made from ink-blotters and ceiling-fan blades and filing cabinets convereted into cannons. Another small but wonderful scene involves a man choosing his own method of execution, which turns out be being chased off a cliff by a pack of beautiful topless female models on roller-skates. How perfect!Although "Christmas in Heaven" is only fair, TMOL contains a couple great songs that are turned into perfect musical numbers. "Every Sperm is Sacred" is, on its own, reason enough to see this movie. The set-up is so hilarious beginning with the serious introduction "The Third World," which is then revealed to be Surrey, England. Then a close-up of a baby being born by simply dropping from between a mother's legs while the mother works at the kitchen counter. "Could you get that for me, Dear?" she says to her daughter working beside her. Another wonderful bit of musical-comedy is "The Universe Song," which I won't even attempt to try and explain its meaning or context. Suffice it to say it is classic Python logical absurdity, with a catchy tune.Python are never shy of lampooning the British, and both the famous Rugby match and the WW I "cake" scene are sharp jabs at "civilized" violence ingrained in the British psyche. I also adore the school Church scene with the the sermon that goes something like "God, you are so big...so really really huge...please don't kill us."There are many other classic comic moments in this film (e.g. "A Tiger?!?... in Africa??) any handful of which would be enough to make a very funny film. There is probably enough good material here to make two, maybe even three funny films. But, Python blessed us with all of this sown up into a pretty tidy package, considering that this movie has no plot, and no dramatic arc to speak of.The experience of watching this film is like having your brain super-saturated with endorphines. Its like having a really good laugh times two. I have never understood why movies that are capable of making you laugh extremely hard are not considered to be great artistic achievements on par with great drama. Most entertainers realize that making people laugh is the most difficult way to entertain an audience. And making comedy films is the most difficult and most easily-gone-awry of all film genres. That is why I believe that Monty Python's movies "The Holy Grail," "The Life of Brian," and "The Meaning of Life" are among the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!............ in little pots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good evening ladies and gentlemen, it's truly a real honourable experience to be here this evening a very wonderful and emotional moment for all of us, and I'd like to sing a song for all of you. This movie went above and beyond funny. Nothing short of a comedic masterpiece. I laughed my way right through the movie; from the machine that goes 'ping', to Graham Chapman singing "Christmas In Heaven". This movie will keep you laughing and laughing as Monty Python make their way through each stage of life up to the after life showing us the absurdity of human nature (slightly exaggerated at points). Monty Python never fails to make me laugh, be it their 'Flying Circus' t.v. series or the hillarious 'Quest For the Holy Grail'. The 'Meaning Of Life' is the epitome of all that is "Python". A darn good movie that pokes fun at just about everything, even Noel Coward. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good comedy. Do yourself a favor and see this movie, you'll thank yourself for it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a movie of which you start with the thought of "brilliant!", but after an hour you have had it... In fact movies like Quest for the Holy Grail and Life of Brian have a true story, but this was more like an extra long part of the series. In the series the problem of "too much of the same" was always put away by "and now for something completely different!", though, in this movie they went on a little bit too long with stuff. The first hour you're laughing all the way, but then you're simply exhausted. Also, just like all Monty Python movies, don't drink any (or more then 1 liter of 5%) alcoholic stuff while watching, or you won't understand anything of it anymore...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monty Python deserve some respect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Monty Python's worst debit has been their fans, who to outsiders often come across much the same way Trekkies do: people lost in some sort of alternate reality, spouting all sorts of irritating in-jokes and incomprehensible catch-phrases-- in America, people who seem to think everything is funny when said in a British accent. The "cult" status Python has achieved effectively obscures just how remarkable their talents are. "The Meaning of Life," the "Life of Brian," and the "Holy Grail" deserve recognition alongside the movies of Luis Bunuel, the Marx Brothers, and Godard: the great surrealist satirists of cinema.Particularly this movie. It is not as consistently funny or as viciously focused as "Life of Brian," but it has real meat inside. I like to think Bunuel would have loved "Every Sperm is Sacred," the find-the-fish game, and the absolutely wonderful Mr. Creosote, not to mention the hideously tacky (and suspiciously tourist-friendly) Heaven waiting for us all. (If Bunuel made it there, let's hope they stock the DVD.)Python even at their best tended to be uneven, and the movie has one or two slow spots: the battlefield sequence and the "Zulu" parody never quite come together and go on a bit long. But this movie, like "Brian," adds up to more than just a stack of jokes. Whether the Pythons as individuals are (or were) geniuses is open to debate. Their collaborative works, however, represent a full, coherent, dark vision of the world that seems much more unified and powerfully satiric than one might believe possible. As a collective they had no rivals in their time or since. This movie deserves more than cultist enthusiasm. It deserves to be looked at as art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film classic but definitely not to all tastes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is typically Python. It ranges from from the extremely surreal, (Find the Fish), to the sickeningly vulgar, (the liver donation scene), to the downright hilarious, (the obstetricians), constantly. Of particular interest are the 'Every Sperm is Sacred' scene, which every Catholic in the world will understand (but the principle is upheld by the mickey-take on the upright Protestant), and the Mr. Creosote restaurant scene (Wafer thin mint, anyone?) which has become infamous in its own right. The humour is often very, well, let's face it, incomprehensible but there is plenty there to satisfy any Python fan. Having said that, if you are a fan of "The Life of Brian", then think twice before seeing this. The humour is a lot darker and more complicated than in TLOB. Don't expect laughs a minute or even every five minutes. Watch this only if you are familiar with the rest of Monty Python (see "The Quest for the Holy Grail" first) and like such comics as Tom Green, etc. Some of the content is offensive and sickening but the highbrow comedy is there (even if you don't necessarily understand it). A masterful swansong for the best and most influential comedy team to come out of England. I personally like it but found it an acquired taste. I would rate it as about 4/5. For any younger people wanting to see this film, be warned... Don't show this film to your parents! There is a bit of (quite graphic) reference to naughtiness!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic!! Monty Python's second best film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people have said that "Monty Python's the Meaning of Life" is the weakest of all of the Python movies. I thought it was hysterical, right from the short film "The Crimson Permanent Assurance" to the end credits (watch for a little message at the end.)While it lacks the low-budget feel of their previous efforts (Holy Grail was still better,) all the sketches and songs are memorable. "Every Sperm is Sacred" is an all-out Python classic even if you hate this movie. Probably the most famous bit in the movie is with Mr. Creosote, possibly the fattest man in the entire world, but before this skit, there's a short song that Eric sings about a certain male body part (not as memorable as the sperm number, but still very funny.)One of my favourite sketches in the movie is the short film "Find the Fish," which is just so plainly weird it's hilarious. Just a bunch of weird-talking people dressed like Dr. Seuss characters, while audience members yell out where they think the fish is. Then the MOL narrators give rave reviews for the film.If you're a Monty Python fan, you've got to see this movie, but not until you've seen "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." If you're a fan and you haven't seen that one, do it right now! Quit reading this review, go to the video store and rent it (and maybe this movie too.) I assure you that you won't be disappointed.My rating: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily Monty Python's best original film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)This film is far less cohesive than "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" or "Life of Brian," but the film is all the better for it. Without the need for a real storyline, the film is able to go off in its own tasteless -- but hilarious-- directions. Highlights include a sex-ed class in which John Cleese demonstrates proper technique, "Hawaiian food served in an authentic English Dungeon atmosphere," and the unusual death of a criminal "convicted of making sexist jokes" and allowed to choose the method of his execution. Best of all are the two big musical numbers: "Every Sperm Is Sacred," which ridicules Catholic attitudes towards birth control (with the chorus "Every sperm is sacred/Every sperm is great/If a sperm is wasted/God gets quite irate"); and the gloriously tacky "Christmas in Heaven". While the occasional bit fails to amuse, on the whole, this film is strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, but not for all tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is vintage Monty Python humor. The gang of enfants terribles from the UK have made a movie with no discernible plot, just their vision of what life is like and what the hell the meaning is of this.This vision is exactly what we could expect from these guys. The sketches are chronologically placed from conception, a hilariously funny musical sequence that could have been taken from Annie if it weren't for the adult content, to death where the Grim Reaper is an unwanted party crasher at a dinner among friends. And in between these sketches the Monties accomplish in making the viewer wonder what the hell they are talking about. The sketches are often so ludicrous that it is hard to figure out where the joke is, and the jokes are all there, you just have to work to find them.Although this movie is incredibly funny, it may not be that funny for all tastes. If you don't like British humor, people vomiting, cross-dressing actors, gratuitous nudity, and downright blasphemy, this is certainly not the movie for you. Beware. But if this is your game, you will absolutely not be disappointed.8/10</fullReview>

Before I saw this movie I didn't know who Monty Python was, then a friend recommended this movie to me and I watched it and enjoyed it. Now I'm a Monty Python fan and think this was their best work.In this movie, Monty Python takes a shot at all of life's stages: The miracle of birth, growth and learning, fighting each other, middle age, live organ transplants(?), the autumn years and death. Also check out the opening Crimson Permanent Assurance sketch.I think the highlights were the Every Sperm Is Sacred was priceless(If South Park can get an Oscar Nomination for that stupid song, why can't this get one?), the teacher teaching the kids about sex was good, the live organ transplants and who could forget the Mr. Creosote scene, that is classic.Good for Python and non-Python fans. 10/10</fullReview>

I can picture the production meetings... "Well john, what would you like to do?" "I'd like to have sex in front of a collection of school boys." "And you?"

What can you say about a movie that features a full, 200-cast 10 minute musical number about the virtues of condoms? What can you say about a movie that makes a parody of pirate ship movies by having a giant building sailing around a giant city? My point is, it's pretty funny in many respects, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I think it's because you're more shocked at how bizarre it is rather than how clever or surprising. Personally, I thought the Holy Grail was their masterpiece, but if you need a walk on the wild side (like everyone does, if they wish to remain sane), see this movie. Please.</fullReview>

The boys are at their best here, the songs are great, and sadly the film was their biggest box office failure.

		<fullReview>While neither the Python's funniest (MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL probably takes that honor) nor their most cohesive (MONTY PYTHON'S LIFE OF BRIAN), this film is certainly their most polished, best-looking and most outrageous.Though the expensive-looking skits tend for the most part to run a little long, most are hilarious, some downright brilliant, with the usual misfires here and there.After years of re-defining sketch comedy, it appears, however, the Python's themselves had trouble maintaining their own velocity. Returning to a sketch-oriented format for the first time in ten years, MEANING OF LIFE has none of the off-the-cuff, stream-of-consciousness mayhem that made MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS so unique and original. It tends to meander a bit here and there.Don't get me wrong; I love this movie. It is perhaps my favorite Python product of all. It was the perfect early Reagan-era kick-in-the-pants in an age of bland, inoffensive cinematic junk. I went and saw it repeatedly just to see how many people would get up and walk out as Mr. Creosote spewed vomit all over a posh restaurant.

		<fullReview>The Meaning of Life is not for everyone. It is very tasteless, but it is often brilliant too. The film is uneven of course but it is very funny. It looks good, the direction is solid and the dialogue and gags are witty, unique and inspired. The acting and comic timing from Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Michael Palin and Terry Jones is impeccable too. And there are some genuinely funny moments such as the sequence in which a financial institution is boarded by swashbuckling pirates and Every Sperm is Sacred. However, some of the middle half borders on the dull side, while the war parody is overlong and the sequence in which a glutton explosively overeats is incredibly grotesque(one word of advice: don't watch this sequence while eating). Overall though, it is funny and clever. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unluckily repetitive and old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monty Python has a tendency to use, reuse and even overuse some tricks when he has invented them. Here he will definitely overuse and abuse the after-dinner mint. And yet, even if I have never thought Monty Python to be the genius of the second half of the 20th century some think he is, the film has some marvelous scenes that are worth the watching, for example the attack of the old City of London clerks against the super-tyrannical City of New York Stock Exchange, generally known as Wall Street. It becomes a pirate tale and it is funny, even as a satire of the excessive power of the financial market in and on our ordinary lives. A new slavery? Probably. The restaurant scene is overdone unluckily and the vomiting is by far too much to be just funny. It is disgusting, gross, funnily gross for sure but not in any way, at least for me, hilariously gross or funny. And we all know in a way or another this famous after-dinner mint that has been used or hinted at in so many occasions. It is a classic and like all classic it loses its edge, it becomes a little bit blunt or dull.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This cannot be considered a "real" movie, it's more like an extended Flying Circus TV Episode. Which means it has sketches from beginning to end.Now onto something completely different ... No don't worry, I'm still commenting on The Meaning of Life. It's just this sentence at the beginning of this paragraph that you will be hearing a lot in this movie. It's a trademark. Something you also have to get used to (especially if you don't know the TV series or any other Python work, is the really crazy and unusual comedy they have (it depends on your taste if you like that or not).John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones are the ones responsible for this movie as they are the group of people behind Monty Python. The gags are on point and if you enjoy them as much as I did, you will have a great time watching this "movie" ... maybe you'll even watch it more than once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great piece of work, only slightly below holy grail and life of brian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, put simply, slightly less hilarious than the other 2 Monthy Python movies. To me, who found the holy grail and the life of brian fantastic, this is also a very good and funny piece of work. Now it is a bit less accessible than the other 2, and reflects more of the Monty Python TV series. The reason why some people have not really liked it, I think, is due to the lack of a story or plot. Indeed it is an assemblage of many little stories under the title The Meaning of Life. And while the other 2 movies were funny nearly throughout, there are more ups and downs in this one. It's the same humor: silly, physical jokes, mixed with more refined puns and references, that made the glory of Monty Python. I don't see why anyone who liked the other 2 should particularly dislike this one, it is still very good, and scattered with phenomenal and classic moments : the stories on birth/the 3rd world children, and on death are the best, especially the former, which is in my opinion the most hilarious monty python act across all movies. The movie is worth it be it for that part only. It is a pity that some more mediocre parts made it into this film, such as the one they termed "middle-ages". Of course if you did not like the holy grail or the life of brian (something beyond me, but you do meet the occasional person who dislikes this humor, especially people not accustomed to British culture and therefore who possibly lack the necessary references that makes a lot of the jokes really funny), then this Meaning of Life is not for you. Finally, this humour is not outdated at all, because there is often reference to religion, human instinct &amp; stupidity, death, poverty, food... and these guys really have a proper go on all of these and more. I would really love to find funnier movies out there, but to date I have not. The only contemporary anglophone movies I could link to this would be Leslie Nielsen's first naked guns,or Shrek...maybe, with obviously much more satire and historical context. It is in fact difficult to find recent comedies that can even compare in style and quality to the 3 Monty pythons. I can only think of one, La cite de la Peur, a french film, which is great if you speak french. So just see for yourself, it's far more than worth a try if you happen not to know Monty Python, but as i said above, start with the other 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop being pompous, this movie is brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so much better than it gets credit for. First of all, the Crimson Permanent Assurance is absolutely genius, and what's more, it is CLASSIC Monty Python. The Pythons thrived on criticising various elements of British (western) society, and just think about it now. A bunch of old accounting guys, rising up and commandeering their oppressive corporation like pirates, is this not funny just thinking about it? The song is one of their best. (We'll up your premiums semi-annually!)And what about this film lacking unity? the point is not to have unity, the point is to be funny! I think they made a good choice in simply filming a series of scenes--it allows them to get to the comedic parts better. Everything (ok, except for the scene in the dungeon restaurant, which was funny but dragged on wayyy too long) about this movie is brilliantly hilarious.In scene one, we get the apathetic modern doctors, who have totally lost any shred of humanity. And of course the machine that goes 'ping' (and the accounting joke: "You see we lease this back from the company we sold it to and that way it comes under the monthly current budget, and NOT the capital account" and he is oh so proud.) Scene 2. birth in the third world, everyone already seems to think it funny, which it is, but i would sooner get on to other parts that people seem not to enjoy. (Although the heads singing in the 'Papal discount house' is one of my favorite scenes. Not to mention the protestant scene. 'We can take precaution. .. What do you mean, lock the door?) scene 3 growth and learning. Brilliant lampoon of church services. listen to the prayer, and the lyrics of the song. brilliant. Then, more absolutely brilliant absurdist comedy from the Pythons. Perfectly represented by the class which is calm and behaved, and when the lookout sees the teacher coming, they all get rowdy--perfectly opposite the stereotypical classroom in movies. The tedious, seemingly endlessly complicated instructions on whether to "move you clothes down to the lower peg" (which, if you listen "wymer, it's perfectly simple') Every scene deserves a valiant apology in the light of these criticisms--however I will not bore you all with them. I will however mention the funniest scenes in Monty python, i.e. the live organ transplant, Mr. Creosote, and, funniest of all, Death. (when their spirits are following death, they ask if they should take their cars, then drive off in the spirits of their cars--again, absolutely brilliant.) With that out of the way, I believe Life of Brian is overall their best movie, but Meaning of Life might possibly be their funniest. I now leave you with a few more funny lines from the movie, as I have now angered every pompous, elitist Monty Python fan."I am the grimmm Reaperrrrr" .... " hardly surprising in this weather..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of the few people who think that this is the best Monty Python film. That doesn't mean to say that the others are crap but this one certainly is not as bad as everyone says. I guess it's because of the sketch format of the film and people are not used to that as opposed to a straight-forward narrative film. Who here doesn't find the Protestant sketch funny? That is almost all in one take and it is brilliant. The live organ transplants is another bit of inspired lunacy; definitely very gory for any film but it is in keeping with the dark tone that broods over the whole film. This is a film for every geek's DVD collection (like mine)! Well worth a watch and easily a match for Life of Brian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A series of rather loosely connected sketches, The Meaning of Life is an up-and-down journey. Sometimes brilliant, sometimes mundane. When it works it is pure comic genius. When it doesn't, well at least you know there will be something entirely different coming along in a few minutes and maybe you'll like that better.Before the film proper begins we are treated to a stand-alone short which doesn't feature any of the Python troupe at all. Featuring a group of elderly disgruntled office workers who stage a mutiny, turn their building into a ship (really, I couldn't make this up) and sail the high seas seeking vengeance, this rather bizarre sequence hints at much of the surreal lunacy to follow. Once the film proper begins the Pythons examine life in all its stages, birth to death with a whole lot of silly stuff in between. Inspired sketches include a bit on birth control featuring a brilliant musical number, "Every Sperm Is Sacred." Who else but Monty Python would come up with something like that? And make it work brilliantly? It's fall-off-your-seat funny. Another highlight is John Cleese teaching a sex education class in a way only John Cleese can. There are other high points but there are also some sequences which miss the mark entirely, most notably a scene involving a grossly overweight man and a lot of vomiting. All in all though, The Meaning of Life is an enjoyable experience. It's really not one movie, more a whole bunch of short movies thrown together. And the good outweighs the bad. Hit and miss, but more hits than misses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Variable in Quality of All the Python Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pythons, Britain's greatest and most influential comedy team, ceased producing TV shows in 1974, largely because of creative differences among the members, but they nevertheless continued to work together on feature films. The results were 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and 'Monty Python's Life of Brian', two of the greatest British film comedies of all time. Both of these films consist of a number of sketches in the typical Python style, but strung together so as to form a coherent narrative linked by a historical theme. 'The Meaning of Life' likewise consists of a number of linked sketches but without any coherent narrative. What links these sketches together is the theme of a journey through life, starting with birth and progressing through childhood, adolescence, war, middle age, old age, death and the afterlife, although some of the sketches- notably the first one, 'The Crimson Permanent Assurance'- do not fit into this scheme. (Despite the title, there is- fortunately- no attempt to put together a philosophy of life). I found this film much more variable in quality than either 'The Holy Grail' or 'Life of Brian', or even the first Python film, 'And Now For Something Completely Different', which consisted of sketches taken from their television programmes. Although there is some material which ranks along with the best of the classic Python sketches, some of it is very poor. The good:-1. 'Every Sperm is Sacred'. This was the one part of this film that really did make me laugh out loud. Essentially it is a satire on Roman Catholic attitudes to birth control, presented in the style of a large-scale musical song-and-dance number set against a grim Northern industrial town. (The model seems to have been musicals such as 'Oliver!', which could perhaps be criticised for presenting a rather prettified view of 19th century working-class life). To add some religious balance, there are also some laughs at the expense of Graham Chapman's dogmatic but confused Protestant, who seems to assume that the Reformation was all about the right to use condoms. 2. The school sketches. Especially the 'sex education' scene in which the headmaster (one in a long line of John Cleese's pompous authority figures) teaches a class of bored schoolboys about sex in precisely the same tone of voice he might use when teaching them about trigonometry or Greek verbs, using his wife to give them a practical demonstration. I also liked the parody of a typical school assembly which reminded me vividly of my own schooldays (even if my school did not actually have a school cormorant).3. The Zulu War sketch. Not particularly structured, but it did catch (in an exaggerated way) the tone of the nonchalant officer-class and plucky other ranks familiar from filmed epics of the British Empire, especially 'Zulu' itself. I also liked Eric Idle and Michael Palin's increasingly surreal reasons to explain why they were dressed as a tiger.4. 'The Galaxy Song'. Pure Pythonic brilliance. 5. 'The Crimson Permanent Assurance'. Perhaps overlong, but the concept of an insurance office metamorphosing into a pirate ship struck me as brilliantly surreal. Also caught the tone of those old pirate films like 'Treasure Island' or 'The Crimson Pirate'. On the other hand, there was much that I disliked about the film. The bad:-1. The 'birth' sketch. The idea was presumably social satire at the expense of the medical profession, portrayed as more interested in their expensive technology than in the welfare of their patients, but this never quite rang true. (Expensive anything? In a hospital? With all these NHS spending cuts? Chance would be a fine thing.)2. 'Christmas in Heaven'. This was presumably a parody of tacky Christmas variety shows, but those are generally beyond satire. 3. 'Find the Fish'. I didn't get the point of this, unless it was to send up pretentious art-house movies. (Which are way beyond satire!)4. The Organ Donation sketch (apart from the Galaxy Song). Crude and unsubtle.5. Mr Creosote. Need you ask why?In general, in fact, I tended to enjoy the first half of the film much more than the second. Without the coherence given by a narrative story, the Python style of sketch-based humour seems more suited to a thirty-minute show than to a two-hour feature film. By the end, they clearly seemed to be running out of ideas and inventiveness. It is probably a good thing that this was the last of the Python films; I suspect that any more would have been very tired and repetitive. After 1983 it must have been clear to them that the future for their talents lay in working apart rather than together, a path that John Cleese had already pioneered with his 'Fawlty Towers' TV show. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big screen version of their tv show - and the least of their films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the eternal question of why we are all here, the Monty Python team tackle the issue in several stages in order to provide a thorough answer to the question. Looking at all the life stages from birth, education, battle, middle age right through to death, the film may or may not succeed in finding some meaning in what we call life.If you do not enjoy the humour of the Monty Python tv series then it would be best if you just skipped this film altogether, even if you enjoyed their other films outings prior to this one. Unlike the earlier two films (Life of Brian &amp; Holy Grail - themselves not exactly traditional narrative-wise) this has practically no structure to speak of. The only thing that frames the film are the various captions that introduce the next stage. The effect (and the intention) is for this film to be no more than a series of sketches with more nudity and adult material than was allowed in the tv show. The problem with this of course is that some hits and some misses - sadly too much of it misses.The best bit comes early - `every sperm is sacred', but the rest of the film is quite average with too few big laughs. Even the bit that everyone quotes (the `wafer-thin-mint') has it's humour stolen by the fact that the whole scene is actually pretty gross. Of course if you are a forgiving fan then it is likely you will love it, but I found it to be disappointingly light in laughs. It wasn't so much the lack of structure then that caused me the problem, but more the fact that the sketches mostly didn't work very well. The heavy crudity doesn't help either, as at times the team seem to have assumed that this will have a bigger impact than good jokes - and making a joke about the need for crudity to get audiences into the cinema doesn't excuse the fact that that is exactly what they seem to have done!The team themselves are always welcome, and quite often their delivery will turn an average sketch into a better one, but they can only do so much. If you have seen the tv show then you pretty much know what to expect from them. The one member of the cast that I did laugh at was more down to an unintentional in-joke that I can only assume someone noticed, even if the film didn't highlight it. Towards the end of the film, Simon Jones has a small role and, for the second time in his career he finds himself in a restaurant at the end of the universe!Overall, fans of Python will enjoy this but even they could be pushed to admit that this is way below the standard of their other previous films. The format is lifted from the television show but features heavy nudity, language and crudity - sadly mostly used in the place of humour rather than complimenting it. Has it's moments but mostly it is only amusing rather than funny as the good and bad sketch ideas come in an unstructured flow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. Admittedly, it's filled with very dark, biting humor with undertones of criticism on the human condition. It's very different from anything else Monty Python attempted but it retains the marvelously silly quality of the other works.I think just how much someone appreciates this movie depends much on how tolerant they are of the themes and ideas being presented, mocked, and toyed with. A deeply religious person would be more offended than usual. Anyone offended by the viewpoint that life is ultimately meaningless will also not appreciate it.I remember some critics were bashing it stateside when it came out by pointing out the Grim Reaper character's negative comments regarding Americans. I always found this profoundly ridiculous since on the balance, they bashed themselves, the English, in the same sketch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monty Pythons the Meaning of Life is undoubtedly the group's best film together. Its hilarious yet anarchic view of the world is aw inspiring and the writing and directing is top notch. It has a surreal look that could even be compared to such surrealistic masterpieces as Luis Bunel's Un chien andalou.There is one question on all our mines all the time, and that question is? What is the Meaning Of Life? No one really knows, but the Pythons took this question and strung 9 or 10 vignettes together involving it. Some of the best material they had ever produced is in this film including Every Sperm is Sacred in which a man is forced to sell his children for scientific experiments and Death in which death visits a bunch of people at a dinner party.Something odd happened today while I watched this film for perhaps the 15th time. During the end credits, I shed a tear. Not because I was laughing, but because this was the last and final dose of Monty Python?forever. Not only is Monty Pythons the Meaning of Life one of the best comedies ever made, it's one of the best films ever made period. ***** (Out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Monty Python absurdity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monty Python's The Meaning of Life doesn't tell a straightforward story, but instead is told in segments of life, such as The Miracle of Birth, Growth and Learning, Middle Age, The Autumn Years, and Death. Every segment of the film features the classic Monty Python absurdity that fans love.Though The Meaning of Life isn't as hilariously funny as The Holy Grail, it still has those same jokes that are so stupid you can't help but laugh. The best segments in the movie to me are Growth &amp; Learning and Death. Some scenes are really great at poking fun at real life issues such as Catholic beliefs, organ donation, and other things. However, one of the funniest scenes in the movie comes not from a segment within the film, but from a 5 minute intermission. The scene is so pointless and so stupid that it ends up being the funniest scene in the movie. It involves a man with a 10 foot arm span striking poses as he wonders where his fish has gone.Overall, it's not the funniest movie in the world, and for some people it might not even live up to the hype, but it's still pretty funny.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Always Life of Brian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all these years I finally caught up on seeing the final Monty Python film, and to be honest it was easy to see why I waited so long. This film revolves around 'The Meaning of Life', which so happens to be a dumb life if you ask me. The jokes are sporadically funny, but there are some segments that don't really work at all.The film starts with several fish, voiced by all the MP actors, looking out their fish tank trying to decide what life really means. Then, the film diverges into multiple segments. I personally thought the Birth segment wasn't funny at all, even though I'm an MP fan, but as the film continued I began to enjoy it a little more. The only two segments I can say I thoroughly enjoyed were War and Death, the final one where an annoyed Grim Reaper strikes, hilariously mistaken for a dinner guest.A lot of the segments I thought either went a tad too far, or didn't go far enough. The film did contain some classic MP humor here and there, and the soundtrack is actually quite good, laced with some pretty good songs. But all in all this was a rather mediocre installment in the MP series. I don't know if it was just dated or what, because I'd say only about 20% of the humor worked. If you're a MP fan, then see this, but be warned that its nowhere near MP and the Holy Grail or Life of Brian. If you're just looking for a funny film, this probably can wait seeing that its the most mediocre film in the series and not really laugh out loud funny, it isn't even very funny that often, but it still has its moments.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wow, what a flick!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I have ever seen a movie quite like this one. And I mean it!! This movie is beyond in your face. My husband had seen it but it was a long time ago, and I hadn't seen it yet, so I asked him if our daughter (she's 10) could watch it. "Are there any sex scenes or boobs or anything like that?" "I'm not sure, I think so." So anyway, we settle down to watch the movie. She watches with interest about the accountants at the beginning of the movie, but then goes to her room to study. Boy, not a moment too soon, either. Before long, there is a birth scene, which, is not too bad in itself, but then there is the chanting -no-ode, if you will--"Every Sperm is Sacred!" and then the actual talk of vaginal fluids(that is actually what they say!!!) and a demonstration(not full-from the shoulders up with complete commentary) of the sexual act. I guess what I am trying to say is,it didn't seem offensive, somehow, and even porn pales in comparison to this, again, somehow. I guess the actual talking about it was so direct it overshadows actually seeing someone do it!! The guy in the restaurant was beyond gross, I could have went a lifetime without seeing that one! ;) The Death scene was also pretty awesome, too, with a twist! I would have never seen that coming.Everyone at the dinner party dies from eating a tainted fish dish. Even the person that didn't eat it died!! It was just very humorous! ANd the guy dying from falling from a cliff when all those naked chicks were chasing him? (They even show them in slow motion!!!)Now THAT'S the way to die!!! It had a LOT of laughs and is good all the way around. However, not a show to watch around the kids. Very entertaining, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Monty Python team made some of the funniest films ever made, actually they might have made THE funniest film ever made, its called The Life Of Brian. This film however is not up to the standard of the others, some bits are quite funny but overall its a major disappointment. I think the team had kind of grown apart and gone their separate ways by 1983 and it shows in this film. Eric Idle did come up with another great song though, but apart from that watch The Holy Grail or The Life Of Brian instead. ***6/20***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as light-hearted as Flying Circus or Holy Grail or Matching Tie and Handkerchief, more thoughtful like Life of Brian, while still managing to be screamingly funny, it was only nominally about the meaning of life.If you look for the common thread, every sketch touched on formalism. That figures, since being English, it's an issue for them. Probably the best example is the schoolboys in the chapel saying the responsive reading, "Oooh, You are so big, so ENORMOUSLY huge! Gosh, we're all awfully impressed down here, I can tell You..." to the organ donor collection guys, "We've come for your liver!" (Hey, he signed the document, they get the liver, there was nothing in there about having to die first..oops!) to the unforgettable vomit scene in the French restaurant.Meaning of life...merely a pretext.</fullReview>

Oh, and Terry G. in hideous drag ... The jury's out on Mr Creosote. I can see *why* it is thought of as funny but its just a bit too gross for me. Not the first Python film to watch. See Brian or Grail first, the tv episodes, anything. This one is really a swansong in taste as well as everything else. Has its moments but ultimately flawed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was on Sky again last night and I took another look, having seen it many times already.I read in the Python autobiography that the original intention was to make a final film based around the seven ages of man. However, because the team had become so generally disparate when they did this there was neither the time nor the inclination to undertake the additional work required to hedge the film within this framework. Several Pythons apparently resented Cleese's apparent indifference to this overall aim, and I get the impression that by this point JC had pretty much moved on and wasn't inclined to put more effort into the thing.However, for my part, I still think it works. I was thinking last night that sometimes, general affection for the troupe and its best work, plus the cache these people have in the minds of those that hold their work dear, means that sometimes you feel you OUGHT to laugh at the material, rather than actually wanting to. Comedy draws its standing, like so much in life, from the propensity of the viewer to revisit it. Music is the same. Many people have heard Revolver or Abbey Road literally hundreds of times yet they come back to them again and again simply because they MEAN something. Comedy, in a sense, is also defined by longevity. Without wishing to rubbish a contemporary example, I wonder how many people will revisit 'My Family' for inspiration in twenty five years time. Yet, Python endures. Why? I disagree to an extent with another reviewer who said that by the early 80's Python generally was becoming passé and had been superseded by 'alternative' comedy like Ben Elton and Alexei Sayle. Personally, I never found that sort of aggressive humour even remotely funny, but leaving that aside, it's worth remembering that even during their swansong the Pythons were producing material, like the 'went wherever I did go' section that was hugely influential on the likes of The League of Gentlemen and many others who became famous and were cited for their originality years later.Of course, given the sketch format, and the mercurial nature of the material per se, not all of it works. I found 'live organ transplants' not funny, just for-the-sake-of-it shocking, yet they trump you in a way because of course at the end of that you get the Galaxy Song, as catchy a number as Idle ever penned, upbeat, melodic, and of course hugely informative both astronomically and philosophically. They knew what they were doing, and the mixture of juvenile slapstick and cultural erudition is still there to be had for those that can be bothered to look, appreciate and laugh. Be warned though, some of it is pretty dark stuff.</fullReview>

I did know that catholics couldn't.

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Monty Python's finest hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really grows with repeated viewings, and even more so than other Monty Python efforts. I've probably seen it fifteen or twenty times. It feels more mature than their earlier work, and in my opinion it's only rivalled by Monty Python and the Holy Grail for funniest movie ever.The greatest star of this film must be Eric Idle, who comes up with a number of shining songs. They're not only totally hilarious, but also have quite an enormous bit of pure musical merit to them. The movie has received some criticism for being sketch-based, but I think they pulled the continuity off well enough. However, I think Terry Gilliam's contributions are rather mediocre, but if they helped him launch his extraordinary directing career later on, it was worth it.In sum, it's incredible how silly intelligent humour can be.</fullReview>

I would say go out and see this movie if you have seen the other two. If not see them fist and then see this one. They are all great and worth checking out. this is a very good movie even though it is not my favorite from them I still enjoy watching it. Go and see it if yo have yet to, you will definitely find yourself laughing at it.

		<fullReview>The Monty Python's explain to us what the meaning of life is in this sometimes hilarious movie. They have cut the film in seven parts, beginning with the miracle of birth and ending with death. In between we have growth and learning, fighting each other, middle age, live organ transplants, the autumn years and the meaning of life itself.Every part has some great sequences but unfortunately not everything is that funny. There is a scene with a fat man, a very famous scene, that is a little too disgusting for me, although I can understand why people do like it. The last part about death starts great with a man chased by half naked women, and dying leafs falling from a tree, but has a terrible middle part. The closing musical number makes up for that.There are great musical numbers like "Every Sperm Is Sacred", "Penis Song" and "Galaxy Song". The lyrics are funny, the songs are nice and the choreography is great too. Although it is not as good as 'The Holy Grail' or 'Life of Brian' I had a very good time. Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin are all great in every little part they play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've come to the conclusion that perhaps I just don't have the correct mental-wiring required to love a Monty Python film. To date, both 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)' and 'The Meaning of Life (1983)' have left me strangely cold; there's certainly a few good laughs to be had in both, but neither is a film that I'm likely hold dear until the end of my days. After catching 'The Meaning of Life' on late-night television just yesterday, I have just the compilation 'And Now for Something Completely Different (1971)' and 'Life of Brian (1979)' to watch, and I can only hope that these ones strike the right chords with me. Unlike its two direct predecessors, which have something of a normal narrative, 'The Meaning of Life' is comprised of numerous short sketches, each loosely dealing with different elements of a person's life: The Miracle Of Birth, Growth And Learning, Fighting Each Other, Middle Age, Live Organ Transplants, The Autumn Years, and Death.'The Meaning of Life' opens with Terry Gilliam's irrelevant but visually-magnificent short film, 'The Crimson Permanent Assurance,' a satire of globalisation that ran grossly overlong and consumed double the allocated budget. The remainder of the film is an uneven combination of segments that work brilliantly, that work poorly and some that don't work at all. Apparently, the Monty Python team had been bent upon offending as many people as possible, targeting jokes at the expense of doctors, Roman Catholics, Protestants, soldiers, organ-donors, obese people, waiters, and ? appropriately ? the Grim Reaper himself. The entire film has an incredible visual style that makes up for the occasional flat gag, and also offers the entire picture a sense of professional respectability that I didn't notice in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.' In honour of the fragmented, sketch-comedy structure of the film, the remainder of this review will simply list the moments in the film that I thought worked, and also those that I thought didn't.MOMENTS OF GENIUS: The Crimson Permanent Assurance; "the machine that goes ping!"; the generous WWI soldiers; the British officer whose entire leg was stolen by a tiger; singing about the wonders of the universe; Death visits a country-house. GOOD MOMENTS: the philosophical fish in the restaurant tank; "Every Sperm is Sacred!"; a teacher's demonstration of sex to a strangely-bored student audience; an uninteresting restaurant conversation about the meaning of life; removing an organ donor's liver; the impossibly-huge Mr. Creosote's satisfying meal; a waiter's philosophy on life's purpose. MOMENTS THAT DIDN'T WORK: The Middle Of The Film; "Find the Fish"; the resort-style depiction of Heaven, with a serenade by a Jeff Goldblum-lookalike lounge singer (actually played by Graham Chapman).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry Pythons, it just didn't work out for me this time. And don't assume I don't know how to appreciate British humour. On the contrary, it's my favourite kind. From Blackadder to The Vicar of Dibley to Catherine Tate, even the Python sketches or the classic Holy Grail, and the list goes on? But The Meaning of Life was just disappointing.Simply put, there is no coherent plot. As for the title itself, it's handily summarised by a line ("It's nothing very special" a lady says) in the very last scene (the rest of the film is totally unrelated) that ironically makes a whole lot of sense: "Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations." What were they trying to achieve? A compilation of sketches doesn't quite work, as evidenced by this film. It ranges from the mildly humorous ('Every Sperm Is Sacred' is a well-known classic) to the downright absurd and disgusting (An obese man vomiting multiple times and eventually blowing up in a restaurant? Stand By Me's vomit scene was by far superior).But then again, that's what the Pythons are infamous for ? to stupefy, to bewilder, to disgust, to shock. On that note, it worked. It's just unfortunate I couldn't derive any enjoyable entertainment from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Monty Python's the Meaning of Life" is a really bizarre addition to the boys' resume. It's darker and far naughtier than the PG-rated "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." It may not be as controversial as "Life of Brian" but it's still pretty risqué all considered. For example, the sperm song - sung by a group of pre-teens and very young children - would cause an outrage today. I'm surprised it didn't back then.But if you know anything about me (which I'm assuming you don't, or at least I hope you don't) I prefer dark comedy most of the time and I like the bitter edge of "Meaning of Life." Yeah, it's scattered. It's silly. It's not perfect. It's a bit redundant at times and lacking a point. But that's the point. You'll find a lot of Gilliam's and Jones' work is like that.Gilliam opens the film with his short about office workers who set out to sea in their buildings and attack neighboring skyscrapers. It's an odd little film, but inventive and typically Gilliam with all the outrageous colorful sets - similar to sets he'd use later on in the late eighties with "The Adventures of Baron Manchuesen." Then Jones takes over and delivers a series of gags involving life - birth, adolescence, maturity, sexual education, adulthood, romance, eating (and over-eating of course), retirement, tourism, death, and so on and so forth.The funniest skit is probably the organ donor bit, although Eric Idle's song gets a bit long. Nevertheless it's a trippy and well-animated sequence when he does begin singing. (The lyrics are pretty raunchy at times, too, as is the background animation.) The DVD is cool, a 2-disc collector's treatment with insightful documentaries and commentaries.I overall kind of prefer this darker edge of the Pythons and think it's funnier and more daring than "The Holy Grail" in some ways. For some reason this is considered the weakest Python film - I can somewhat understand the reasoning behind it, but nonetheless I find it very funny at times and quite beautifully filmed.</fullReview>

I think people who like it sort of think it's 'intelligent humour'. Does it flatter them? Thing is, it's neither intelligent or funny. It's so unfunny. It's puerile and silly. I keep coming back to it like this piece of boredom, 'The Meaning Of Life', thinking I may have missed something but am left cold again and again each time. It's a childish humour I suppose is a bit 'in' with people who went to Oxford and Cambridge but means nothing to real people. Thing is, John Cleese was so good in Fawlty Towers and that really was funny and intelligent. I find it really snobby too and is so liberally awash in 'We're so English and eccentric aren't we?' that as an Englishman I feel utterly embarrassed to think that foreigners have to watch this. It's like watching someone masturbate. Like in the film itself where John Cleese has sex in front of a class. Ugh!!

		<fullReview>I had seen a tiny clip of this in a college General Studie lecture, and I saw the image of Terry Jones as that mega fat character, and of course I had to see it after I liked Holy Grail and Life of Brian. The first ten or so minutes of the film see a mickey-take of the rise in business power, called The Crimson Permanent Assurance, with an old clerks or something building rebelling and sailing off to find a new city, and all workers in it defeating the rivalling business. Then it gets to the main film, which basically shows us the stages and trials of life with various characters and sketches. Starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and brief appearances by Matt Frewer (aka Max Headroom). The parts I remember best are the opening title song and animation, the BAFTA nominated song "Every Sperm Is Sacred", Cleese as the teacher literally showing students how to have sex (with his wife), Idle's "Galaxy Song" and "Penis Song", and of course Terry Jones as that overly fat character. It may not be as memorable or hilarious as the other two films, but it is certainly more vulgar, more sexual humour, ruder and almost more offensive than them. It was number 45 on 50 Greatest Comedy Catchphrases ("A wafer-thin mint"), John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Eric Idle was number 21, and Cleese number 2 on The Comedians' Comedian.

		<fullReview>By 1983, it was pretty obvious that Monty Python had run out of steam, The individual members didn't really enjoy working together any more, and they just weren't coming up with clever sketches. That shows in this movie. There are half a dozen hilarious skethces, and a few clever jokes, but not nearly enough. There are far too many painfully long stretches during which nothing funny happens.They really should have called it quits after the great "Life of Brian."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Monty Python, but I hate this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love every movie and show Monty Python have ever done, except this one. It felt as though instead of trying to be funny they were only going for shock value. Nothing in this movie is particularly funny, while there are several segments that are particulary offensive. There are some good points to this movie, such as Eric Idle's Galaxy Song but most of the movie is falls pitifully short from the hilarious comedy I have come to expect from the best comedians of all time. This movie is not only completely offensive but also not very funny. The only part of this movie worth seeing is the little segment at the begining called "The Crimson Permanent Assurance" which was directed by Terry Gilliam. This 15 minute episode is absolutely hilarious, which sets you up for a hilarious Python movie, only to be dissapointed. Even if you are a Python fan I cannot recommend this movie. I love Monty Python, but I hate this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bottom of It All. Simply The Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie twice - one time in late 90's and I still remember that I simply said I enjoyed it just to please my then girlfriend who really liked this one. Now I watched it again. I see that I was of the same opinion like 15 years ago - this is a terribly vapid one. Monty Pythin to me is an absolute pinnacle of low taste, bad humor, below-the-waist jokes, nothing sacred, no sense of limit or measure. JUst a horrid mash of cartoons, shameless slabs, bashing of everything and everybody. Yes, songs and dances. I see them as the hooligans who just wanted to spit on all they saw. They did. It did not succeed. That was terribly silly then. It remains the bottom of any imaginable low point of poor joke. I am very sorry for Terry, Neil, Eric, all of them boys for wasting so many years of their lives on such stupid stew. My rating is the same - 1 out of 10. Must be 0. Or worse. Not recommended to anyone. Never. Your sanity is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Python's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie comes off as nothing more than a selection of MP's Flying Circus-type skits writ large and vaguely connected. This was nothing even approaching 'Life of Brian' and 'Search for the Holy Grail'.This is not to say that the skits themselves weren't quite amusing. They just weren't slapped convincingly together into a whole movie nearly as well as 'Brian', 'Holy Grail' or even 'Time Pirates.'As a devoted Python fan, I must say that this is the worst of their movies. Most of the sketches here would have been better played out as skits in the Flying Circus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monty Python's the Meaning of Life: 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say that I love Monty Python. MP and the Holy Grail is one of my all time favorite comedies. But this one wasn't funny.Britain's bad boys conjour up a series of sketches that they always wanted to do and put them together in a format that is supposed to make sense. Those fish were right, nothing in the movie had anything to do with the Meaning of Life. Basically, we went through seven stages of life, from birth to death. Most of the skits didn't really have much to do with the time slot (such as the world's most obese man).In some ways, it reminded me of History of the World-Part One. An early 80's movie from once-great people who are trying to come back by having a sketch movie. While HOTW had some funny skits, it was still hit-and-miss. Same with The Meaning of Life. All of their jokes were either laugh or don't, but for me none of them hit. I laughed some times, but it felt forced, since I love the group and I wanted to like this movie. There were only a few genuine laughs.One more part of the movie that I really hated was the opening (our short feature presentation). It was stupid, unfunny, and went on for way too long. It would have been OK if it was five minutes, but 16? No, I don't think so! I did like how it was incorperated into the movie, but way too illogical.If you take a George Carlin show, add a few touches of Mel Brooks, put a dash of Sam Kinison, you've got The Meaning of Life. Sure, some of the skits are memorable (such as the sperm song) and the movie in general is entertaining, but it doesn't deliver the laughs that I have known them to deliver.My rating: 4/10Rated R for nudity, sexual diologue, and some language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw The Meaning of Life again recently. I originally saw it about 10 years ago. My memory of this movie was really fixated on the "Birth" and "Death" segments of the film, which are by far the funniest parts, and are in my opinion funnier than anything from Holy Grail or Life of Brian. The middle segments however are nowhere near as good. Still, Meaning of Life is worth seeing just for the beginning and end; it's still better than most of the schlock being produced today as "Comedy". Just keep the remote handy to skip through the dull and unfunny middle segments. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even close to the best of Monty Python</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This doesn't even come close to Monty Python and the Holy Grail and the Life of Brian.Part of the problem is that it is really just a bunch of short skits, rather than a single, long story. This alone is not an insurmountable problem, but it prevents the film from having the depth and development seen in the others, and thus makes it more like a big television show.The other problem that is the final blow to this film is that much of it really is not good. There are certainly some brilliant parts and other parts that are at least pretty funny, and their strength does just barely keep the film afloat as a whole. However, some skits are simply so inane, gross, or otherwise crude that they really hurt this film. A few of these do have some trace of humour, but their negative aspects thoroughly negate this while some are not funny in the least, and are simply off-putting, tedious, or downright annoying. Some give the impression that the crew ran out of inspiration and simply tried to throw in moronic gross-out material just for shock value.Perhaps this one is better for those with shorter attention spans who aren't interested in the greater depth of the other films and just want to see shorts, or for those who actually like some of the lame, crude humour of the bad skits. Otherwise, it simply pales in comparison. I honestly think some people, even though they are critical of the film, give this a higher rating than it deserves simply because it is by Monty Python.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the "Short Feature" at the beginning, FFWD to the Gilliam animation &amp; then turn it off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only watch this if you are a die-hard Python fan who must see all films/shows the group has done.I am a Python fan. I love their show. I love Holy Grain &amp; Life of Brian and enjoy many of their individual side projects/films. However I don't like Meaning of Life.The short featurette at the beginning is brilliant. The way the old accountants being taken over by a "big corporation of America" revolted and turned into pirates was surreal, amusing and excellent satire. It goes downhill after that. The film degenerates into just barely connected skits which barely fit the theme of the film. Most of them are not funny enough for the length of time you are required to watch them. (It's like Saturday Night Live is now, there's a gem of a good idea, or one good line, but then the skit itself goes on way too long until you are bored) There is too much gratuitous nudity and grossness that is there merely for shock value, but not humor. It starts off well, there are random and amusing fish, there's a nice song about us being coils of DNA. Then there is "Birth" which was funny for about 3 seconds when the doctors were obsessed with their expensive machinery that they forget about the patient, but then went on too long. "Every Sperm is Sacred" was kind of funny in it's taking on of the ridiculous anti-contraception stance of the Catholic church. The idea of teaching sex ed to bored schoolchildren is mildly amusing, but it just goes on too long. The WWI/WWII sketch is fairly amusing, but the Zulu sketch meant to ridicule military officers doesn't even seem to think about the fact that they are perpetuating some seriously racist stereotypes about African "savages" - so there's more offense than the moments of humor. Plus it just seemed to be a random segment thrown in - there was no connection with the "ages of man" theme. The fat guy eating &amp; barfing was just gross - no humor there. It then led into a segment with Eric Idle that builds up nicely but then is a total let down. Why they felt they needed to mock organ donation I don't know but after the few seconds of humor about how they take them from live people, it was just gross. It did segue randomly into a witty song about the universe by Eric Idle, but not enough to make up for the sketch. The Death visits a house party was kind of amusing, but by that time I was just trying to make it to the end of the film....which unfortunately was one of the worst moments featuring, for no apparent reason other than to insult and objectify women... a LOT of topless women.The best moment in the film was the Terry Gilliam cut-out scene where the leaves all commit suicide. It might be worth fast-forwarding just to see that scene.They are great sketch artists/writers &amp; great actors (John Cleese as a waiter in the dungeon restaurant (a deleted scene) was brilliant), but for some reason this film just does not work for me. This is probably because most of the skits barely fit the theme of the film. Finally, and most insulting to me as a viewer was the needless nudity just so they could show naked women. It was pointless and was the final straw in ruining the film for me. (and where are the pictures of penises they said they were going to show at the end of the film??)</fullReview>

I found the musical parts boring and sometimes even annoying. I really wanted to like this film but I didn't. The only things I found funny was the Grim Reaper in the house scene and the battlefield scene.The film was quite absurd which is a good thing but I didn't understand why there had to be so much blood, puke etc. After this disappointment I think I'm going for the Holy Grail.

		<shortDescription>Good if you like this type of humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Monty Python's The Meaning of Life' is a film that you will either enjoy or hate, depending on your sense of humour. Like the sketches, this film consists of dark humour and pokes fun at society, religion, and virtually anything that it can make fun of. This film is not for everyone, and only watch it if you have previously seen Monty Python and thought that it was good. Some of the jokes were funny, and some were not funny, but everyone is entitled to their own sense of humour. As a comedy, it will only appeal to a certain audience, and I cannot say that this is a great film because it all depends on your perception of the humour and how hard you laughed - along with all the technical production traits. And this one just did not have me rolling on the floor in laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What i think and I'm not biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I love Monty Python and the holy grail...but this was horrible...I finished the movie only for the respect of Monty Python. I only laughed twice and wanted to turn it off far before intermission. I suggest not watching it for it my actually take away respect for "stupid humor". The movie itself was broken into parts to explain the meaning of life. Most parts had little relevance to the Meaning of Life at all. I would suggest trying a different movie. To compare for someone who is thinking about watching it it is like watching a "trainwreck", where the only reason you continue watching is that there is a faint hope it will be funny. Some people recommend seeing movies like this twice how ever i will not, because any movie that was bad enough for me to want to turn off within the first 15min is pretty bad. I only gave it a 2 because of the two laughs i had. I'm sorry if you disagree this is only my opinion I hope this was useful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe me, I did not want to dislike this movie, but ultimately I thought it was just awful. They Pythoners show none of the comedic dexterity on display in "The Holy Grail" or "Life of Brian," and this movie put me sadly in mind of the worst "SNL" skits, when one lame joke is drawn agonizingly out over a 10 or 15 minute skit. "The Meaning of Life" is much edgier in subject matter than its predecessors, but so what? Making something edgier does not inherently make it funnier.I have to believe the high rating this film received at IMDb is a tribute more to all of the love out there for Monty Python and not for this film in particular.A movie that may cause you to crack the barest of smiles once or twice, if it's lucky.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how could this movie have gone so WRONG?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVED Monty Python and the Holy Grail, And Now for Something Completely Different AND I have seen every episode of the original series many times each (including the 2 German episodes), so I am entitled to have this somewhat negative opinion.The problem is, this movie came out in the 80s long after the Python troop had all gone their separate ways and the spark that made them funny just was no longer there. This is a great example of not knowing when to quit while you are ahead. It was very sad watching this knowing what might have been.First, let's talk about what I liked.The best segment, by far, was the pre-movie about the elderly accountants. Many people I have talked to about this who also saw the movie said they never saw it. I don't know--maybe it wasn't shown when it was on TV or in the theater. I can't remember which, but apparently it was missing in some instances. That's crazy since it was SO GOOD! Also, though it not VERY funny, I mildly liked the Sperm Song and the dinner party interrupted by the Angel of Death.And the not funny? I can't remember them all but there were many instances.John Cleese taking off his clothes and having sex in front of a group of school boys to teach them sex ed was just not funny (big surprise), nor was the enormously obese man who literally ate until he exploded. I didn't so much mind because the latter skit was so gross (after all, I loved the CRUNCHY FROG skit from Live at the Hollywood Bowl--and it was far worse). The problem was it just wasn't funny.My advice, see the other Python work (movies, TV, recordings)--it's all great. Well, Life of Brian isn't great, but it definitely has its moments and far surpasses this surprisingly bland film.</fullReview>

It's the old class system that destroys English films. The Oxbridge graduates spewing endlessly clichéd scripts about working class people they've never lived with. It is pathetic. Monty Python wasn't funny, neither was anything from Oxbridge. it's just not funny.Let guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic failed class system let the working class people and the real talent that comes through the system properly take over the writing and the British and English film industries will rise again what next prince Edward to write a modern day Oliver Twist?</fullReview>
