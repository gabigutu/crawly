		<shortDescription>Best entry in the "American Pie" series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I admit it. American Pie movies are tasteless, goofy and hilariously stupid...but I love them! This movie, in my opinion, was the best in the series because it was...well, the funniest. And also a little touching. You grow kind of attached to the characters and it's nice to see them moving ahead in life. If you don't like grossness and ridiculous situations, then this film is not for you. It'll probably appeal to people in the 13-18 age range most, but pretty much everyone who watches it will laugh at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's one thing you have to say for `American Wedding': like the two `American Pie' films that came before it, it is unapologetically unashamed of its shamelessness. Here's a film that doesn't try to hide its gleeful perverseness under a bushel of coy double entendres; instead the film revels in its frank and openhearted treatment of sexuality and lust. `American Wedding' is clearly a comedy about sex and it doesn't pretend to be anything but. Whether this is a good thing or a bad will, I suppose, depend on your own affinity and tolerance for jokes and images that routinely push the boundaries of common decency and good taste. In fact, the film wears its tastelessness almost as a badge of honor. And just in case you're unfamiliar with this series and its brand of humor, subtlety and wit are not considered virtues in an `American Pie' world.In `American Wedding,' Jim and Michelle - he a self-described pervert and she a self-described nympho - have finally agreed to tie the knot. The film centers around Jim's attempts to convince Michelle's square, uptight, sexually repressed parents that he is indeed husband material for their less-than-innocent daughter. The problem is that his efforts are consistently being undermined by the inane, out-of-control antics of Steve Stifler, the foulest-mouthed, dirtiest-minded professional adolescent this side of Bluto Blutarsky. Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious.Indeed, without Stifler, there would be precious little to recommend this particular `American' outing. The jokes and setups, for the most part, are crude and graphic without being very imaginative, and writer Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan, even when they hit on an inspired piece of silliness (as when Stiffler winds up dancing mano a mano with a guy in a gay bar), end up diluting the humor by letting the scenes drag on well past the point where they're truly funny anymore. This is not to say that there aren't a few good laughs in `American Wedding,' just that they don't come often enough to really lift the film much above the ordinary. Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie. In the film's defense, I would also add that, like its two predecessors and unlike many sexually charged teen comedies, `American Wedding' conveys a certain affection for its characters. In addition to Stifler, Jason Biggs as Jim and Eugene Levy as Jim's befuddled but strangely tolerant and supportive father come across as decent, well-meaning and likable individuals.The film itself may be uneven, but as a character actor who makes an indelible impression on the material at hand, Scott is the genuine article. He transforms what is essentially cinematic rotgut into sweet-tasting vintage wine. All hail the Stifman!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first american pie, but was so dissapointed with the second. it was too direct, lacked creativity, and got old. (sorry to anyone who loved it). but ii was delightfully surprised with American Wedding. The sexual jokes flowed much better, it was all situational as opposed to 'hahaha look at my wang', and in general just got more laughs. It is a great movie to see in the theater while your in the mood for something like that, and a lot of fun. although half the original cast is now gone, the remaining few are a good mix for the last of the american pie trilogy. stifler is kinda crazy and unbearable in the beginning but bear with it, it eventually works with the story and gets better. This is such a cute movie.. and yes i use the word cute. Its hilarious, but not so over the top that it looses the sweetness of it, being the fact that the main point of this movie is the wedding of jim and michelle. What a great, mindless piece of entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third installment in the life of Jim Levenstein and his friends. "American Wedding" seems to point out there will be follow up movies perhaps. Why not? This formula has produced three films and could "American Children", "American Divorce", "American Single Dad", etc. will be too far behind? Jesse Dylan directs this one.The film is typical of the gross movie genre. The only excuse to watch this one is Seann William Scott, who as the obnoxious Steve Stifler, is at his nastiest self in the film. Stifler has great moments, such as in the sequence involving the rescue of the ring that one of the dogs has have swallowed! Jason Biggs, the groom of the film, seems to be playing second fiddle as Seann William Scott's part was made more important to his own, which in a way is what keeps the film alive because the nerdy Jim doesn't elicit much fun when he shows on screen. Eugene Levy, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush have good moments in the film.Let's just hope the people behind these installments will see the light and put all these characters to rest and give us more of Mr. Scott in his own vehicles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked the other two then you'll like this one despite it being a weak end to the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite an embarrassing scene at a restaurant, Jim proposes to his long-time girlfriend Michelle. For their wedding Jim enlists the help of Finch and Kevin to make everything smooth ? and keep Stifler out of the way. However a ceremony is hard work and is made harder when things just always seem to go wrong and when Stifler seems to be determined to f**k the bride's sister ? even if it means pretending to be mild mannered and polite.Trying to think about this film or the series itself is like trying to argue with mud, basically you just need to accept that this is a silly, stupid gross out comedy that relies on poor taste jokes and unlikely set ups. If this is a problem for you then don't watch it. If you have accepted it and are watching it then it all comes down to, is it a GOOD gross out comedy with poor taste jokes? As much as I know I should be above it, I did laugh at the other 2 films and was happy to go and see this and, for the most part, I laughed at this. However this was the weakest of the three and the silence in the cinema was quite often uncomfortable ? usually silence in a cinema is a good thing, but this was often an uncomfortable `I should be laughing more' type of silence.In my review of part 2 I said `lets not do a 3'. Watching this I'm sort of glad they managed to do it but I can see the strain despite their best efforts. The main set up sequences are gross and funny but the gaps between are where the silence comes, there ain't enough comedy to cover the whole film. I'm not talking about the sweet stuff near the end, I just talking about all the scenes between the banner scenes. Plus the sequences are very forced at times (many you can see coming for miles), but this isn't too bad as they still manage to be hilariously gross! For those who like the nudity (and who didn't like the bi-sexual teasing scene from part 2?) there is a long sequence of strippers with large fake breasts, if that's your thing (I'm a man, so yes!) which is funny but also serves up the mandatory t&amp;a. There are also some scenes that are TOO forced ? eg the dance in the gay bar is funny but is too long and feels like a good idea with average delivery.The film bravely loses something like half the cast and makes the film better in that regard. In fact Kevin has so little to do that they could have lost his character all together. However this is offset by the change to Stifler. In the first 2 he is obnoxious and rude but he is also the brunt of more jokes than he is the punisher. In the first half here, he is very rude and annoying and you hate him for how he treats his friends. That makes all his early antics hard to laugh at because now all you can see is a jerk hurting people. In the second half this is less of an issue as he changes a little and gets what's coming to him (and how!). I have a theory that Scott knows he has been pigeon holed in this role and is desperate to get out of it ? in fact when I saw Bullet Proof Monk I did think to myself that he is just playing a kung-fu Stifler. Knowing this I think he played Stifler at full volume so that his next role would be nowhere near this performance. Thus he has a weird crazed sneer on his face, he is ultra cruel and rude and is a real jerk ? hard to laugh with (but luckily still easy to laugh at).The rest of the cast do quite well. Biggs manages to make more of his role than the victim and is sensitive when he needs to be ? I think it will be hard for him to shake off Jim (pardon the pun) but he shows he can do acting when he needs to. Hannigan's innocent girlie voice is a little grating now and doesn't sit with her image as a woman ? it suited her to be a geek. Luckily she doesn't have that much to do after the funny opening scene. Thomas is OK but Nicholas just kind of hangs around with a half smile of his face and nothing to do. Levy is still brillant as Jim's Dad but misses his `awkward moment' relationship (which they give him with Michelle to repeat it). Jones is eye candy and the return of Stifler's Mon (forget her name) is pointless and a mistake that is happily kept to a few moments.Overall this is as poor a film as you expect ? rude, in poor taste, lacking a strong plot or performances, but none of these things are really fair comments as the film still manages to be funny. The character of Stifler makes the first half very hard to enjoy and there are too many bits that don't work or where I didn't laugh but I still laughed. Many viewers will feel that the series has simply fizzled out despite it still being funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good conclusion, but missing some good characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding is exactly the type of ending that suits the American Pie trilogy. It's not like the typical TV sitcom where it's feel good and lacking on humor. The traditional gross out honest humor is still present. Unfortunately not all the characters are due to scheduling conflicts.The directors do a good job of covering the absent characters by simply not mentioning them but there lack of presence is felt. Oz isn't present during Jim's speech with the best men. Michele is the only returning female lead. Even some of the returning characters play a smaller role. Kevin is almost not seen in most of the film. He serves very little important role and is more in the background. Finch and Stifler seem to be the lead story, at times more than the wedding itself. It does work to create a funny story.The story is well wrapped up and that hopefully means that no additional and poorly conceived sequels are made. There seems to be three rules that follow in all of these films.1) Jim does something bizarre sexual act that embarrasses him.2) Stifler ingest some bodily excretion3) Finch has sex with Stifler's MomObviously they've hit Stifler with about every funny excretion. The only options left are blood, pus, or earwax. Rule #2 is going to be hard to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an awesome closure to the American pie series (with the original cast) Stifler is pretty good in this, he always steps it up. The cast kinda gets smaller and smaller as the series goes on, but we are left with the core of the group. Jim again has some great comedic moments, Jason Biggs by now has perfected the role of Jim. This as the second movie, plays it's part as a sequel, series or a trilogy. If you have seen the first two, this will be a good ending to the story for those who haven't seen the first two, or only part one, go out and get caught up before seeing this one. You missed a lot of the action. icing on the cake9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking thru out takes on this movie yeah, I would have added the scene were there at the head table of the wedding and were Michelle said yeah Steve you can be like Jim brother n law. that would have made a great opening for the next movie. I've seen band camp and the naked mile also wonderful movies, going to far with movies on stiffer but you might bring back where Michelle and Jim just had their baby,(naked mile) and want Steve and Michelle sister as the god parents also Steve just asked Michell's sister to merry him and kinda have a reunion of all the cast from the first American pie at Steve wedding. But idea- at the bachelor party instead of the parents catching them. They go to a night club, well strip club and LOL one of the strippers that come's out is Nada, Like I said reunion. well I have great ideas but you probably don't want to hear me just jabber my mouth so maybe you can take these into an effect and put it into the movie. Thanks a lot and I have every movie and I'm looking forward to so many more. You have made a American pie to be come were you can take something off a movie or your past movies and keep going with so many more American pie. Love it.sincerely, mark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good wholesome piece of, movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...If you have seen the first two American Pies, you should also see this one. American Wedding doesn't have all of the original cast, but still caps off the climax of the series. This movie in my mind would have been the best of the series if Stifler (Seann William Scott), was still in the role of Stifler. Actually, it probably is the best of the series. Stifler just didn't talk the same, he just wasn't as smooth as usual, except for that one part, ha ha, you have to see it. But really that was the only downside, Stifler was out of character, but he was still hilarious! Overall, the movie was still filled with hilarious antics, smooth one liners, and of course Jim's dad (Hilarious). Go see it, it really is funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because for a comedy it made me laugh continuously. Not a minute was wasted. Even if the situation was totally absurd, as many were, the conviction of the actors in their roles was enough to keep it going. Stiffler and Finch's rivalry reached new highs and lows in this one as they compete for the affections of Michelles virgin little sister Cadence. Fred Willards addition in this third movie was welcome, even if his role was subtle.I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. The plots were simple but believable.. How complex can a wedding story be anyways. It made sense, it was funny, it was definately funnier than the second american pie movie.. im not going to say it was funnier than the first but I definately laughed longer and harder in this one. Well done. Plus Alyson Hannigan is somehow getting hotter as the movies progress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid ending to a great comedic trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I reflect on a movie I've just seen, I try not to pull it apart and examine each piece under a microscope. For me, a movie is more than just good or bad scenes stuck together. I try to base my reviews on how the movie made me feel overall. Upon that basis, American Wedding was nothing short of fantastic. This movie is a solid end to a great comedic trilogy. Not only can you expect a theater roaring with laughs throughout the film, but the same memorable characters you've come to love are back and better than ever. Everyone's chemistry seems to work perfectly and (**Spoiler, I guess**) at the end, when Michelle and Jim are doing the first dance, I practically felt like it was my kid who just got married ('sniff', 'sniff'). Full of laughs and gross-out scenes, but this one carries a lot of heart as well. 5 stars, 10/10, 2 thumbs way up!</fullReview>

It was funny, but what could you expect from the people who created the movies. Of course there would be no movie without the nudity. I took my dad and we was laughing harder than I had ever seen. It was a piece of work, but it will be a classic just like the other two. If you haven't seen the others watch them right away and then o see this, you'll love it. I recommend it to anyone.

		<shortDescription>A Grand Finale!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding is the funniest film in the American Pie series. Most of the original gang is back to see Jim and Michelle tie the knot. But, the two characters have to overcome a couple of obstacles. One obstacle is making sure Stifler behaves himself. Does he... not really. Stifler throws a bachelor party when Michelle's parents are supposed to turn up, eats dog crap while saying it's chocolate, losing the ring, and having sex with Jim's grandmother. Stifler is by far the most funniest character in the film, especially when he plays nice boy. Jim and his father are funny, too. I liked the part when Jim shaves his privates and throws the shavings out the window and into people's mouths and wedding cake. The characters are original and hilarious. The acting was great, so was the directing. As with the first two films, there is a great soundtrack. I recommend seeing this grand finale. I rate this film a 10/10.</fullReview>

This is a great (supposed) finish to the AMERICAN PIE series. Id say AMERICAN WEDDING had more laughs that both its predeccesors, even though i never thought that would be possible. It also was a little sweeter. Id consider it more of a Wedding cake. if you liked the first one and second, or at least one of those two, u like this one equally or better. AMERICAN WEDDING delivers a super slice of guilty, raunchy pleasure. You laugh and laugh, and still laugh even the 20th time u watch it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weakest of the Series but Still Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding is the weakest of the series but its still very funny and very enjoyable to watch. Jim and Michelle are getting married and Jim wants nothing wrong to happen. Stifler is going to the wedding against the wishes of Jim and Michelle. He is more interested in Cadence who is Michelle's sister and one of her bridesmaids. The wedding is close and there are a lot of things left to do. However, some of the wedding plans go wrong and it looks like this wedding is going to be a disaster, Can Jim pull it together and make it through the wedding? The plot is interesting as one of the guys get married. With this type of film though, the plot is a non issue. People who see this type of movie just want to have a good laugh and they won't be disappointed. The bets thing about this sequel is defiantly Stifler. Sean William Scott gives a really funny performance and pretty much carries this film. He goes over the top sometimes but for the most part he is pretty good. Jason Biggs gives a god performance as Jim. He is pretty much the same as the first two films so if you liked him before then you will like him again. Alyson Hannigan plays Michelle and I find her character really annoying and not funny. Eddie Kaye Thomas does an okay job as Finch, he just isn't as funny as he is in the previous films. Thomas Ian Nicholas plays Kevin and he is sort of just there. He doesn't do anything memorable his character is kind of countless at times. Eugene Levy is back as Jim's dad and he gives a funny performance. Compared to the first two though, its not as strong. January Jones plays Cadence and does a really bad job. If she wasn't pretty then she probably wouldn't be in Hollywood. Fred Willard and Deborah Rush play Michelle's parents. They both are very funny and nice additions to the cast. Missing from the film this time around are Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Natasha Lyonne and Mena Suvari. They are not missed and their characters wouldn't really feel right in this film either. James B. Rogers directs and does a good job. The jokes in the film may be funny but they are not as good as the first two. Its surprising how good this film turned out to be as the second sequel is usually stale and bad. Running time is 106 minutes with the directors cut and it's the version you should see. The movie is also a bit more serious at times then the other two. This isn't a bad thing but its just a little different mood then expected. In the end, this is a very funny sequel that's worth checking out. Rating 7.2/10</fullReview>

Jim is basically getting married to Michelle and the wedding planning is on but of course there are a few hiccups. The funniest character in this film is Stiffler and he really makes the film to be honest. Especially the dance scene in the night club. (Enough said) Finch and Stiffler renew there rivalry and Jim makes a fool of himself on a few occasions. There are plenty of funny moments in this film and I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rude and Crude End... Sort Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the wedding of Jim and Michelle and the gathering of their families and friends, including Jim's old friends from high school and Michelle's little sister.I was never very big on the whole crude humor craze of the late 1990s. The "American Pie" films and "Van Wilder" were funny, to be sure, but also stunted by their juvenile and often grotesque situations. With "Van Wilder", the dog cream pies should never have happened, and in this film there are a few moments that might be disgusting to many viewers.But there is a little bit of sweetness to this one. Despite all the sex and poop, there is still a bond of friendship and a romantic love. Well, sort of. So, in many ways, this is on par with the original, maybe even better in some ways. But, of course, why am I so concerned about a film series most known for Jason Biggs making love to a pie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting Finale To The Then-Intended American Pie Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third instalment &amp; then-intended finale of the American Pie series, American Wedding is a definite improvement over the previous chapter that packs in a more developed storyline that further advances the arcs of its characters, is even more raunchy than its predecessors at times, and never leaves out its heartwarming tone over the course of its runtime.The story of American Wedding follows Jim who finally musters the courage to propose to Michelle, which she accepts, and now their wedding is being planned. With Finch &amp; Kevin serving as groomsmen, everything seems to be going smoothly until Stifler arrives in town, finds out about the wedding, invites himself to it, and takes it upon himself to plan a secret bachelor party for Jim.Directed by Jesse Dylan, American Wedding not only brings back the relevant characters of the series but also adds more meat to their arcs by developing them a bit more, and it does so without eliminating the crudeness for there are plenty of downright hilarious moments in store here. The technical aspects are finely executed and the reprising cast exhibits greater comfort in their roles &amp; deliver better performances.On an overall scale, American Wedding ticks all the right boxes for a finale, brims with truly outrageous moments of unabashed hilarity, promotes Stifler to main character status which Seann William Scott does full justice to, is expertly paced from start to finish and, in every regard, stays faithful to its origins. Arguably the finest of the three, American Wedding is a fitting finale to the then-envisioned American Pie trilogy that's going to please the majority of its fanbase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Wedding (2003): Dir: Jesse Dylan / Cast: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Seann William Scott, Eugene Levy, Jennifer Coolidge: Poorly titled and about as bad as American Pie 2. Jim proposes to that dimwitted band camp girl Michelle and makes failed attempts to impress her folks as well as keep pal Stifler at bay. The first American Pie was sufficient but the sequels are just an encore of vulgar jokes. Directed by Jesse Dylan effectively sets up particular jokes, one involving a bachelor party gone wrong. Some scenery towards the conclusion appear horribly blue screen projected as if the actors just stepped out in front of it. Seann William Scott once again highlights the gross humour as Stifler whom Jim approaches for dance lessons. Jason Biggs as Jim continues to stumble through the transfer of adolescence to adulthood. After an awkward proposal in a restaurant he is met with even more awkwardness when factoring in dance lessons and Michelle's parents. Alyson Hannigan as Michelle seems placed when screenplay conveniently needs her. She has lost than goofy awkward disposition that made her funny in the original. Eugene Levy as Jim's father gives the same advice. Jennifer Coolidge returns once again as Stifler's mother whose nature is overwhelmingly promiscuous. Pathetic demonstration on the lows of society and common decency. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

I did laugh a ton, but those laughs didn't contribute a lot to the enjoyment value. However, when the jokes fell flat, they made me laugh but were also somewhat irritating at the same time.Actually, what made it worse was that there were many boring moments. The beginning scene at the restaurant and around the second half were the better bits of the movie. A fair amount of it was boring. Extremely boring. When I look back, I should say that I am surprised I didn't fast forward those parts, because they were practically unbearable. Even though they were only a few minutes long, they happened multiple times.+ Many LOL moments- Lots of boring parts- Some jokes fell flat, and others were just annoying- You probably just want to watch it once- Missing many charactersScore: 5It's a movie that made me laugh a lot, but didn't really grab me. IMO, it's debatable whether I should've watched this or not. There were some moments, but also incredibly boring parts. The somewhat enjoyable (and laugh out loud, but sporadically irritating) parts just barely made up for the shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not funny. It is just gross and stupid. It's pooh pooh that is all it is. There is part in it about eating pooh pooh with just proves my point. Because only a movie that's pooh pooh would ever dare to have something so sick and awful and so not funny it would have to be pooh pooh. The original American pie is better and that was awful. It is worst then American pie 2 and that was awful. There are to many comedy movies being made by people who don't even no what funny is. I don't how any one could laugh at this awful movie. Don't wast your money. Don't see this movie. Because it is pooh pooh. Pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seann William Scott Steals This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not all the cast from the original movie return this time around, but that doesn't mean that their is a shortage of laughs, as this for me is on par with the original movie.Plot In A Paragraph: Jim and Michelle are getting married, but in true American Pie style their are a few mishaps on the way to the alter, as Jim tries to impress Michelle's parents and Stiffler and Finch compete for a bridesmaid. The genius of this movie is that although the movies main plot focuses on the wedding of Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Flannigan) for the first time in the franchise, the movies main sub plot focus's on Stifler, and his crazy antics including trying to organise a legendary bachelor party for Jim, accidentally going to a gay bar, teaching Jim to dance for the wedding, and competing with Finch to win Michelle's younger sister.Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) doesn't return, and isn't really missed, ditto Sherman (Chris Owen). Vicky (Tara Reid) doesn't return either, which may be down to Reid's problems in real life (However this leaves Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) with less to do. Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) doesn't return, but with no Vicky, she is not needed. The big miss is Oz (Chris Klein) who also does not reappear in this movie and his absence isn't explained. Although according to the trivia section on here, a deleted scene mentions that he and Heather (Mena Suvari) are in Spain. In reality Klein was filming "We Were Soldiers" with Mel Gibson and scheduling conflicts meant he could not make it. If all the absences made it possible to give Seann William Scott more screen time as Stifler, I'm all for it, as he completely stole this movie. Eugene Levy is again brilliant as Jim's dad, January Jones is OK as Candice, Michelle's sister Candice, Fred Wilard and Deborah Rush are both a lot of fun as Michelle's parents, as is Eric Allen Kramer as Bear. Sadly, despite her wedding being the main focus of the movie. Alyson Hannigan isn't given as much to do as one would hope, but is as great as she always in the scenes she has. With several laugh out loud moments I rate this on par with the original and I find it is maybe more rewatchable that the first movie. Stifler having a dance off at the gay bar was comedy gold and is hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wedding that you've waited for, finally happens...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like this movie. The third installment from the American Pie franchise, the real ones anyway, not like The Naked Mile, is so witty and funny. It's nice to see the characters you've grown attached to, moving on with life. And what shows moving on with life better, than a wedding? It's nice to see the last movie in the series, go out with such a bang. Even though American Reunion happened in the last few years, I will always count this movie to be the end of the American Pie trilogy, and American Reunion, the beginning of a reboot.The beginning is so funny, Michelle going underneath the dinner table to give Jim some early dessert. Priceless.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing Some Things. But Very Enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a couple years of dating, Jim and Michelle are getting married. They just want a great time with their family and best friends, but Stifler's desires for a hot bachelor party and having sex with Michelle's sister (Jones) are sure to ruin their plans.Like the previous films, this one contains raunchy comedy that will make you laugh yourself silly and many memorable moments. But the other thing these movies are known for (strong characters) are done very differently, in a way that may disappoint some fans. The only retiring people are Jim, Michelle, Kevin, Finch, Stifler, Stifler's mom, Jim's parents and the two MILF guys. I can see why most of the other character like Sherman and Vicki were gone. Characters like them didn't seem to have much use. But the one definitely missing is Oz, one of Jim's best friends and most popular of the four. Perhaps the presence of him would have made the movie better. But due to scheduling conflicts and a tight budget, he is not in this film at all. Another unhappy use is Kevin. Kevin and Oz are the most serious and cool characters, but Kevin only has like 5 or 6 lines throughout the whole movie, so he might as well have been gone. It would have been better if there was more of Kevin. None of the characters needed less, Kevin just needed more. But I did like their usages of Finch and Stifler. Finch is the least spoken and weirdest character, but he gets more lines and is developed better in this. Stifler, the meanest character and most destructive, is shown to actually be a caring and sensitive man deep inside him. So for every flaw this movie has, there is something good in its place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Wedding is a laugh-out-loud, tickle-your-ribs rom-com with dirty humour and funny surprises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like its predecessors, American Wedding is a hilarious, dirty and awfully funny romantic comedy - the only thing added in that's different from its predecessors is that it's more romantic and has a huge focus on that kinda thing. Jim and Michelle are getting married - their friends Finch, Stifler and Kevin are helping them plan it all - and they're in need of a special dress, Jim needs to learn to dance, they need to meet up with other family members, etc. It's a comedy-blast and it's excitingly funny. Each scene gets better and better. When the guys hit the road to find the dress, it's as funny as ever - and Stifler and Bear, a guy they meet at a club/bar, that they soon find out to be a gay-club/bar, have a dance- off. It's intriguing and hilarious. The dance off is definitely one of the funniest scenes ever. And there are plenty of funny scenes to go along with that particular one. American Wedding is hilarious, different and fun to watch - with very funny scenes, some unexpected moments, new characters, etc. It's all good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are getting married. We get introduced to Michelle's family (Fred Willard, Deborah Rush, January Jones). The gang is back. Sadly for Jim and Michelle, so is Stifler (Seann William Scott). He insists on butting in on their lives. If only Jim doesn't need Stifler to teach him how to dance.It's one outrageous setup after another. Certainly the humor level is the expected level we've come to love from the previous two movies. There are some missing actors like Chris Klein and the girls. The franchise is resting on much fewer hands. It is mostly Stifler going crazy and embarrassing Jim at every turn. Without the rest of the cast, this is too much Stifler. It becomes a slapstick sitcom with much of the heart missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, so if you liked the first two as much as I did, you'll probably fin this movie fun and entertaining. Here's the thing though, it's not really an AP movie. The movie isn't about bro-mance, and it's not even REALLY about Jim, Keven, Chris, and Finch, it's about Stiffler. You can say whatever you want about how it's the wedding of Jim and Michele so it's about them but it's not. The majority of screen time is given to Stiffler and his antics which is too bad, because Sean William Scott can't carry a movie very well, and he because old and annoying quickly. This being said the movie has a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, and, yes, bestiality jokes. The main problem is that it is not original, or even really an AP movie. American Wedding is pretty much a slightly raunchier rom-com. I was let down a great deal by this movie, even though I liked it. I'm a huge Alyson Hannigan fan, so I was excited to see her as a lead, and had she have ACTUALLY been the lead, alongside Jason Biggs, the movie would have been much better. It's also not really an AP movie because it's not a bromance, and where the heck is Chris?! So yeah, watch it and enjoy it if you like the first two AP's, but don't expect anything as good as the first two. Basically, it should have been a bromantic comedy not a romantic comedy, and it's American Wedding, not American Stiffler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have mentioned before that American Pie 2 is a better movie than the first in my opinion. American Wedding is not as good as it's previous encounters at all It seems the writers were starting to lose ideas of what to do with the characters. The drama isn't as strong as it used to be and things are seem to be focused a little more on Stifler who was a supporting characters in the first two movies. Still it makes out for a lot of fun. The jokes seem to be hit-or-miss in terms of good writing but even the lesser jokes still get a laugh out of me. Guilty as charged I guess. It's not the best movie ever made but it's a good one and it makes me a laugh a lot. Some silly fun and I love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Funny As The Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the release of "American Pie II", a major milestone came into effect that rarely has ever been done before. It was great to see a sequel actually produced more laughs than the original "American Pie". This is thanks mainly by producer Chris Moore and producer Adam Herz. The sequel provided more sympathy for the characters; you get a better understanding of their personality traits and their behavioural patterns in a clearer picture. In addition to that it was purely comical.Sadly though, the third instalment to the series "American Wedding" failed to live up to the expectations of the previous two films. Partially because a lot of the cast members from the original two movies are nowhere to be found, which is not particularly a bad thing because Oz (Chris Klein), Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari) were never really that appealing to me? But still Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) was greatly missed. What really made this sequel really disappointing was that the characters have been badly demoted to wooden clichés of themselves. Sue the series was saturated with crude, rude and lewd jokes and I guess it's just not right to pull away from that tradition by continuing where they left off as opposed to adding new and original humour. So now we see another situation where Jim finds himself at another disadvantage involving his genitals. In the second instalment, Stifler gets urinated on, so it comes to no surprise that the third instalment feces will come into play here. I guess my rant is that the routines that follow tend to be too tiring and predictable.If the absence of characters from the other two movies wasn't appalling or the tiring routines that follow from the other two instalments, the ultimate letdown in "American Wedding" is the character of Stifler (Sean William Scott). I mean of the series, Stifler was one of the funnier supporting characters in the whole series. Mr. Herz really outdid himself when he created a character like Stifler, person who we may have seen and hated in high school. He not only provided the most laughs of them all, but was never a caricatured cliché. In "American Wedding", Stifler becomes a shell of his former self and seems to act more retarded than funny you end up getting the impression that there are a few screws loose somewhere about him. Seriously, he acts the whole time like he needs a mental health evaluation. Sure he's on quite a lot which is fine because I really enjoyed his character over the years, but in "American Wedding" his comical intentions are not featured here.To conclude, "American Wedding" will appeal to some, but not to this film critic. I'll just have to pass on this. I saw it once and I think to me that's enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wedding you actually want to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding acts as the wrap around story for the beloved American Pie characters we know and love. In the first film, we were acquainted with their goofy, oddball ways and followed a group of four high school Seniors as they made a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the year. In the second film, we saw them not as naive high schoolers, but naive college kids, who rented a lakehouse to endure more of their activities. Screenwriter Adam Herz, who wrote the first two films, returns to freshen the formula and continue his trend of infecting goofy characters with traits of intelligence and soul.Let's get one thing straight here; the first two films are pretty much the same. Basically a group of guys trying to score and trying to assure a safe relationship with their girlfriends. There are minor differences, but the film got lucky by having memorable dialog and one-liners said every so often so the film didn't feel like a monotonous excursion. The inflation of gross-out gags in the second films received mixed reception, though. I found some of them funny, but after a while, familiarity came into play. Especially with the "you touch, we touch" scene which is referenced here, as well.The story centers around Jim (Biggs) and Michelle (Hannigan), who are finally tying the knot. When Stifler (Scott) gets word of this, he makes the bachelor party his main responsibility, while the rest of the gang including Kevin (Nicolas) and Finch (Thomas) are noticeably growing weary of his deviant plans. Inevitably, Stifler winds up screwing up majorly, and is looking for ways to redeem himself near the end of the film.This is the first American Pie film where the whole cast doesn't come back. Kevin Kline's Oz, Mena Survari's Heather, Shannon Elizabeth's Nadia, and the extremely underrated and often overlooked Natasha Lyonne's Jessica are all extracted from the script, with no explanation. It isn't a crisis that Nadia isn't here, but not having Oz, one of Jim's closest friends, is sad and not having him even mentioned is a bit depressing. Much of the focus here is on Stifler, who we can see begins to vaguely mature as the film goes on. He seems a bit sweeter at times, yet he also seems a bit more crude and indulgent at points as well.One character that hasn't lost even an ounce of his humor is Jim's father, played by Eugene Levy. I am beginning to sound repetitive, but his character is yet another one that doesn't seem to get well-deserved recognition. Mainly because other characters, like Jim and Stifler, seem to take center stage a lot of the time.Still, aside from the disappointing element of characters not returning, American Wedding hits home with the level of love, sentimentality, wit, bravery, humor, and satisfaction. It is a lively, cheery sequel in films that still have yet to become oppressive and winded, despite being erected from a similar formula every time. They are quite possibly the most pleasing and well-done comedies of the early 2000's decade.Starring: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Seann William Scott, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Jennifer Coolidge, January Jones, John Cho, and Fred Willard. Directed by: Jesse Dylan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun..actually too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So i had an American pie marathon (1,2,3) in preparation for the upcoming one. This movie was epic with every meaning of the word. The thing is, too many things is happening that you cant keep a straight clear storyline in your head. The scenes of the movie are really crammed into each other, specifically around the middle time where a lot of scenes just appear randomly where there are lots action but no preface talk. Sure you can think of an explanation but there is no direct explanation delivered to you and that annoys me, and makes the movie feel cheap too. Too much is happening in very little time its outrageous really, and makes the movie feel unrealistic, so i didn't connect with this one as i did with the other two. Also some characters needed to be exposed much more, like Kevin which the movie did not even mention any news about his girlfriend. The problem with this movie is that it has too many outrageous hilarious events but without the rich paving in the original as a result, you don't appreciate these hilarious occurrences like you did with the first one.</fullReview>

Thomas Ian Nicholas supports well. Eugene Levy, January Jones &amp; Fred Willard, are fabulous.

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't have that same irresistible "gang getting into trouble"-feel the first two had, but I reckon it's still pretty good. It really tries to recapture the "magic" once again, so it goes primarily for that good old gross-out factor we've learned to love throughout the original. The dialogues lack a bit of punch, but at least the awkward situations are still as awkward as can be. The characters have gotten weaker though. The whole Stifler/Finch rivalry has gotten a bit old (even though the Stifler's Mom running gag is still as hilarious as ever), Kevin is just barely there (seriously, he doesn't do ANYTHING) and even Jim has gotten a bit dull. It's mostly about the humor though, and I'm glad to say this movie provides a lot of laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly, I hadn't seen the two earlier efforts in this trilogy, so had no expectations going into this movie. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. Adolescent, puerile, yes, but relatively well done without insulting too many people's intelligence. No one is a complete idiot, no one is a mere caricature, and there are a few good scenes (MILD SPOILER: granny's response when surprised in the closet with Stifler has got to become iconic). Overall, a credible effort, especially at the end when Stifler's mom (Jennifer Coolidge) shows up ? I finally got the references I had been hearing over the years. Still, one can't help but note how low American comedy has sunk. The problem is that all these people are well beyond their teenage years, establishing a new demographic embodied by a new style of acting that's popping up all over the tube and in films. Ageing as such has been banished. It's no longer a question of merely keeping one's looks, but of establishing a style and an attitude towards society that refuses introspection, wisdom, insight ? all the things that were once supposed to accompany getting older. This film embodies this perfectly, so in fact manages to elicit a weird sense of nostalgia when Eugene Levy takes the screen: we laugh at him, yet his interpretation of the kindly dad is far from unintelligent. Beneath it all there is a strange bittersweet feeling of reverse nostalgia: we long for the past because this kind of film refuses to acknowledge there is a future.</fullReview>

So, it is a great surprise to me to find myself handing out kudos to the script of a racy comedy.Partway through this film, I sat back and asked myself, "Am I dreaming, or is this actually a really sophisticated screenplay?" The answer -- of course -- is a resounding yes.So, bravo to Adam Herz and anyone who assisted in the brainstorming sessions that led to this film becoming what it is. It's not often that a bawdy comedy is also intelligent and richly layered.Well done. I've placed this one on my top list of comedies -- in the same league as the writing talents of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and the directorial approach of Ivan Reitman.Cheers!</fullReview>

If you've watched the good old time classic of "Revenge Of The Nerds", "Porky's", "Road Trip" and "Van Wilder" then you'll like American Wedding which also can be called American Pie 3. The only flaw of the movie is some characters are missing. Oz, Heather, Vanessa and that other chick that had no interest with Finch. The Sherminator was left out too. What's the deal with that? But it still was a good flick. Stifler still made us laugh like never before. He goes in to ruin Jim's party. He was almost convicted of raping a dog while Stifler fell down because one of the dogs knocked him down and licked off the cake frosting to you know where. Makes you wonder if Stifler is gay. Well, he didn't hesitate to kiss with Ashton in "Dude where's my car?". And poor Stifler lost the wedding ring while the little dog ate it and "dumped" it in the grass. Boy was that funny trying to play it off like it was chocolate and you should've seen Finche's reaction. Once again, it hasn't lost its touch where Finch scores with Stifler's mom at the end. But poor Stifler ends up scoring with the band chick's grandma-Uuuggghhh! Gross! A good comedy indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Wedding (2003, Dir. Jesse Dylan) Jim Levenstein (Biggs) has finally found the courage to ask his girlfriend, Michelle Flaherty (Hannigan) to marry him. She agrees to get married, but the problems don't stop there for Jim. Now along with Paul Finch (Thomas) and Kevin Myers (Nicholas), Jim must plan the wedding. Unfortunately Steve Stifler (Scott) is in town and won't let the wedding go past without having some fun himself, which includes setting up a secret bachelor party.The American Pie gang return in a third instalment of the successful franchise. Unfortunately, the charm from the first film really feels missing from this movie. There is more of a plot than the second film, but still doesn't match up to the plot of the first film. There are some funny jokes and some good sequences, but not clearly enough as the previous two films. With the plot not being as expanded as the first two films, a lot of the characters fail to appear, but fortunately many of the entertaining characters still feature. Eugene Levy is great as always, and Eddie Kaye Thomas gets a lot more screen time and is able to play it out effectively. Seann William Scott reprises the character of Stifler, a bit too much. In the first two films, his character aimed to annoy the other characters. In this film, his character really begins to become annoying to the audience. Thomas Ian Nicholas returns as Kevin, who ends up a very disappointing character in this film. He just added nothing to the plot whatsoever. Although it's a disappointing finale to the 'theatrical' trilogy, American Pie fans will love it.Not Jewish! No wedding, Jimmy! ? Grandma (Angela Paton)</fullReview>

No.Stifler returns to spice up the wedding with a bachelor party, and to hit on bridesmaids, and other sick, and disturbing antics. This one is worse than American Pie and American Pie 2, but they could've ended the trilogy a lot worse.

The second is his uber competitive dance-off in the gay bar (Michael Jackson's "Beat It" starts dramatically out of nowhere...classic!).The third is the funniest scene of the film by far, when Stifler is forced to eat the "chocolate truffle", which produces my favorite quotes of the film: "It tastes like twigs and berries" and "Look man, I really have to go." Seann William Scott is hysterical in this scene, the faces he makes are out of control, very funny.Fred Willard has some great moments in this film as well, notably when he walks in on the bachelor party and meets the French "cleaning lady".The rest of the cast provide solid filler, but the real star is Seann William Scott, reprising the role of Steve Stifler. Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm hearted teen-age comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good comedy -- if you know what to expect.Obviosly targeted to teenagers, so there's a fair share of four letter words, and there are some gross scenes. I actually had to shut my eyes at one time.But all-in-all, a good and enjoyable comedy about what happens when you are trying to set up your wedding and some of your more 'lively' high school friends 'help' you along.Audiences well past their early adulthood should also enjoy this one -- if they have a liberal sense of humor and don't balk at some below-the-belt stabs.Written and directed with a good heart, and with love and empathy for the characters. The cast is also quite good and their looks do match their characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the Levy Breaks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have consider myself a fan of the American Pie series. The first two were admittedly funny, but as you watch the third installment of what should have been a two movie series, you have to wonder what will be the legacy of these films. Frankly, I thought this movie was bad, really bad. Like lets gouge the public one last time before we let Thomas Ian Nicholas make A kid in King Arthur's Court 2 bad. The premise was fine, but what they did with the characters was ridiculous. Stifler's nice guy routine was brutal. No one buys Sean William Scott as a cognicent human being, watch The Rundown and Bullet Proof Monk and you'll see that Hollywood producers feel the same way. Finch as a bad ass, good God. Eddie Murphy the Daddy Day Care years was a bigger tough guy. The only benefit to watching this movie was the realization that the biggest satr out of thesae movies is Eugene Levy. These three movies define going to the well too often. The water removed from said well was placed behind the churing waters of the Levy and the Levy broke. He has spun his role as "Jim's Dad" into starring roles. Cheaper by the Dozen 2, The Man, A mighty Wind granted not blockbusters but when everybody else is searching the Indy films for work, Levy emerges as the clear star from the American pie series and I say Eugene Levy you have given all middle age actors who need to star in sex romps to get a pay check that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</fullReview>

They are some really funny scenes in this movie tho - michelle giving jim a bj at his proposal dinner is hilarious and stifler having sex with an old woman (jim's grandma) - but really when it comes to the spark the other pie's had this one's just not bright enough - American Pie 2 is and always will be the best!</fullReview>

Other than that, this is a sick- in a good way and very very funny movie. The jokes are original and in true American Pie fashion, the movie makes all your inner kinky fantasies come true. While I liked the Finch/Stifler fights over Cadance, what was the point of Kevin in this film? Wouldn't it be funny if he turned out to be gay and hooked up with "Bear"? I enjoyed the bachelor party maybe a little too much but Nikki Ziering was HOT HOT HOT and all guys should love the lady action. The movie is best in the beginning and the end, where Jim gets a "" in front of people with his pants down and Finch and Stifler's mom get it on in a bathtub! Outrageous scenes and the fact that the film takes such huge risks make the film unique and impossible to repeat. The best slice of pie yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than American Pie 2, Stiffler stole the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding in my opinion was better than the second film but of course not as funny as the first one. First I'd like to say I'm a fan of this franchise, thought American pie was hilarious and very entertaining movie with some young actors showing some talent (well, some of them). In this film, Stiffler takes over, he is the show, he is hilarious and makes the movie worth watching. Jason Biggs was also good, same Jim performance, hes good at it. The rest of cast wasn't that great, although eddie kaye thomas and eugene levy were really funny. I thought this film was funny at times, a bit ridiculous sometimes and sometimes a little too "slapstick". Anywayz it was good though, entertaining for the most part. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It never gets old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's good they did the third one. Why? Because the first one was original and good, the second one almost sucks, but the payback was missing. So, with the lack of some actors, the same writers and the same groove, American Pie came back. There's a wedding; Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and Jim (Jason Biggs) are getting married, and in the movie that put up one hour and a half with this simple situation and wasn't boring, there are good and bad aspects.The bad aspects first; amateurish director Jesse Dylan hasn't got the eye to put the funny material in the screen. His camera goes up and down with insecurity and lack of conviction. That's also negative for the good team working behind him that can't be appreciated because of his silly decisions. Totally underused characters I didn't remember existing because they've never has the necessary presence in the trilogy. Molly Cheek as Jim's Mon, who is barely noticeable, even more when she doesn't actually have a name; but that was a nice detail anyway. It also sucked not see Chris Klein back, because I considered his character as one of the best (same said for Mena Suvari). With Tara Reid out of the picture now, it wasn't obligatory to bring Thomas Ian Nicholas (Kevin Meyers) again, because there's no point to his character other than being one of Jim's friends. Oh?Tiring repetitive and nonsense punk music all the way?Come on! You can cut that crap already. Let's put it straight; this is Jim and Michelle's film. I don't know if it was just the director, but I didn't find much else wrong with the picture. Considering mainly that Adam Herz wrote the entire movie again, giving his characters the essence that they own. He didn't forget about the movie's main objective (which by the way he accomplished again): making people laugh. And that he knows how to do; sometimes subtly, sometimes grossly, he put his words in the correct places. He gave some characters the chance to shine (, he made me laugh out loud during more than a couple of scenes (the strippers in Jim's house), and I must admit the film wouldn't have existed if he hadn't came back to take care of it.In that story, where he tries to put some sentimentalism (the strong bond between Jim and his friends, the father-son relationship) that we get without giving much importance to it, the people involved make their "thanks and goodbye" (for expressing it some way). Jason Biggs proves once again the talent he has for comedy and that he is better than her companions, reasons that assure him a future in the business. Alyson Hannigan could have got more importance, but she did what she had to with her funny voice and personality. Parents were good, but nothing that Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad), who keeps stealing scenes with his advices and recommendations for life. Eddie Kaye Thomas (Paul Finch) is fatter and more cultured than ever, but still good (Stifler's Mom!!!!!!). In a wonderful and surprising appearance, Eric Allan Kramer triumphs wildly as Bear. January Jones (Cadence Flaherty), well?She's beautiful and when she appeared I knew I had seen her before. It was on "Huff", and she was also in many movies I've seen, but is now that she shines in a leading role, proving she's got a lot to give.All those things said; Seann William Scott steals the show. His Steve Stifler is much more improved than in the previous deliveries, and is given his main appearance, so that he can curse, go crazy, be good hearted, dance like a monkey and screw every situation he takes part of. He even gets the chance to "screw" grandmothers, if you know what I mean (out loud funny appearance by Angela Paton as Grandma). "You're a grandmother-f***er", Finch says to him. "And you're a motherf***er", Stifler answers; and we know why.It's fair enough to say "American Wedding" is a good comedy in all its ways, and that when you have a gifted comedic cast, everything is possible, and it will be OK. There are millions of examples to prove that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Sean William Scott has graced us with another complete waste of film making time! Like Dude Where's My Car, Wedding offers little or no clever comedic material. In its predecessors, Stiffler was a hilarious meat-head! In Wedding, he's an unfunny, bumbling idiot--so much, in fact, that it's as if it's not even the same character! Jason Biggs once again one is the most annoying character in all of comedic film history. *Spoiler* And why the heck would he throw his pubes out the window??? LAME, LAME, LAME! For a second I thought I was watching a made-for-TV movie on LIFETIME. The film is painful to watch from start to finish. 1 out of 10 would be a generous.

		<shortDescription>A funny ending to a funny trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I missed this on the big screen, and only recently saw it on DVD. Having seen the first two films, I was aware of what I was going to get. And I still enjoyed it. The story is simple (Jim's getting married to the band geek, Stifler comes along, Jim has to impress Michelle's parents etc). This third film follows the exact formula of the original two, which is probably why it has become one of the most successful trilogies in years. We start with an opening scene, Fade to Black, big red title, story revealed, gag, scene with nudity, Jim experiments, the film comes in for a smooth landing, obviously with a happy ending (For who? I wont say). While some of the main characters from the original two films are not back, they are not missed. In fact Kevin (Returning from the first 2) didn't even seem in place. A funny ending to a funny trilogy. Check it out for a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, but Gross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It was really funny in areas, but sometimes it went a little too far and got disgusting and almost hard to watch. Some of the events that happened to the characters, like Stifler for example, were outrageously gruesome. But when I laughed, I really laughed hard. The movie is pretty fast paced, so I never lost interest. Yes, it's pretty much a movie about sex, but if you look hard, pretty hard, you can see the deeper meaning in it. You can see the transformation of some its characters, and their learning experiences. American Wedding is not a bad movie, it's not bad at all. It can be gross, but it's just how the characters normally act, so there's nothing too wrong with that. Not a bad threequel to 2 pretty good movies before it, see it if you really enjoy sophomoric humor. Some do, some don't. This is a movie you're either going to really hate, or really love.</fullReview>

So hilarious it made me cry and fantastic performances from the hilarious Seann William Scott and Jason Biggs.

		<fullReview>Fans of the ?American Pie' series will undoubtedly love American Pie 3: American wedding. My feelings after seeing the third film in the series in four years, is that I am unsure if I like it or not. Perhaps I am just showing my age, then again it could be that this series has run its race, with the ?sex comedy' genre past its used-by date. It is my opinion that ?AP3', while not a great film does not mean it was a bad film. The big questions are being asked, strange and disgusting things are being eaten, and now the ?band camp' geek and ?apple pie' rooter are about to tie the knot! In American Pie 3: American wedding, Jim and Michelle are getting married -in a hurry. Jim's grandmother is sick and wants to see Jim walk down the aisle, so they are going for it in two frantic weeks. Stifler plans to be invited, for the bridesmaids, and so he can throw Jim the ultimate bachelor party, with strippers! Finch is all for the hedonistic rituals, but not for letting Stifler steal the maid of honour, Michelle's sexy younger sister, Cadence. But while everybody else sweats and frets, Jim's Dad is cool as ever, getting ready for one of the proudest days of his son's life.Most of the usual cast are back for a third time. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Allison Hannigan) are very much in love. Jim wants to take the next step which means getting hitched. The opening of the movie shows this ridiculously funny proposal, involving Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy) just typical of these films, making Jim look totally crazy, (I am still wondering if salami was used once again for his tackle?) Both Biggs and Hannigan suit each other onscreen, sharing a good chemistry together.Then when the other members of the gang hear there is to be wedding bells, guys like Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Stifler (Sean William Scott), cannot contain their excitement. While Kevin has a quite unusual, and for me, unsatisfying role in this film, it is Stifler that steals the limelight. Sean William Scott does many things that are very funny, disgusting, slimy and classy, all typical of the Stifler character.One of the best scenes in the film involves Stifler at a gay bar, up against this huge gay guy. When Stifler is totally embarrassed, he comes back, having a very entertaining dance contest with the gay guy, both being very good on the dance floor. Stifler also continues his battle with ?Finchy' or ?s@%tbreak', as Stifler affectionately calls him. The changes in their characters make the film very entertaining. I guess I would have liked to see other cast regulars back for a third time, as they would have made the film even better. Characters like Chris ?Ozzie' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Heather (Mena Suvari), Jessica (Natasha Lynne) Vicki (Tara Reid) and Jim's first love, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) all would have been entertaining to see once again. But I have been told that many of these actors did not want to return for another ?American pie' sequel.With the wedding come some new characters for the series. In this film we meet Michelle's family, her Mum Mary (Debra Rush) and Dad Harold (Fred Millard). They are very strange parents, and when they first meet their future son-in-law, it is a totally embarrassing moment for Jim. Also, the scene involving two strippers organised by Stifler, is another hilarious moment in the film, as Mr. and Mrs. Flaherty are totally oblivious to what the girls actually are. We also meet Michelle's gorgeous sister Candice (new comer January Jones). The battle for her affections between Finchy and Stifler are very funny, with what Stifler does to win Candice just amazing.The screenplay for ?AP3' was written once again by Adam Hertz. The comedy he wrote for the film was cleverly incorporated especially the opening, the dance scene and the stripper's sequences. The story also has some quite disgusting moments, with what Stifler has to do when he loses the wedding ring, just vulgar. Also seeing Stifler getting on with someone he thought was ?Cadence' in a closet was also hard for me take. I also believe the wedding scenes could have been written better, as I felt that might have done something totally crazy for it, but alas they did not.Directing ?AP3' was Jesse Dylan (son of rock legend Bob Dylan). He continues on the American Pie tradition, and creates some of his own. I love the way that he directed the dance sequence, because it gave the film a touch of class. But as I have said, I wished that the movie had done a lot more with the wedding sequence at the end of the film, with the director being the first person I have to blame. The problem I have had with all these films is the way that they abuse the great gift of sex. They make sex feel very cheap, unfulfilling and something that has to be ?won'. The quote that Jim's Dad says to Michelle before the wedding, about ?making love' is a valid one, one of the few times where love and sex is thought of to be very a ?sacred' ideal in the series.Having heard a bit about the film in the Australian media, it was great to see a TV interview with Sean William Scott, which has helped me appreciate how good an actor he really is, who in real life, is nothing like Stifler. I also read that Jason Biggs said nothing he does in these films are embarrassing, considering that Jim has screwed an apple pie and super glued his member to his hand. American Pie 3: American Wedding, will keep the fans entertained for yet another year. CMRS gives ?American Pie 3: American Wedding': 3 (Good Film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the first movie is becoming a classic (if you think that "Porky's" is a classic as well) and the second was just funny, this third "American Pie" brings more romance to the series. Ok, the comic and disgusting scenes are all there, but here we have more about Jim and Michelle, and more about the fantastic Jim's father (Eugene Levy).If you watch it like a romantic comedy, you might find it better than the lasts Sandra Bullock's flicks, for sure.Now, some characters are missing (the boring couple Chris Klein &amp; American Beauty doesn't matter... but where is the Sherminator???) so Stifler gets more space - what seems to be a huge problem. Seann William Scott overacts every time he appears. It's a shame. I liked Stifler as a supporting character at the 1st and 2nd movies, but in "Wedding" he lost control.Now let's wait for the 4th movie, when we'll probably see the lovely couple Jim and Michelle having kids.

		<fullReview>Having just seen American Wedding for the first time on DVD, I am mad I didn't see this in the theater. American Wedding was definitely the best of all three movies. Sure, not all the cast moved on with this movie, but just like in life, not everyone from your past makes it to your present. The movie was gross, uncomfortable, and in the end made me laugh and really like the characters. The pinnacle of the trilogy is smarter, wiser, and more grown up than the previous two, but of course, it is still immature. As I graduated high school with the 1st one, was in college with the second, and am graduating with the third, I see a definite correlation between real life and the movies. You will watch, laugh, and have fun, because that is all a comedy should be about and thankfully, it is.</fullReview>

This was way too obnoxious and over-the-top to even be funny, though the movie did have a couple (two exactly) funny parts. The Stifler character was just downright annoying and the scene with him eating the dog doo was, again, not funny, just gross. Mostly, the over-kill with the unnecessary grossed-out humor is what ruined this movie, along with the fact that it was predictable and you could of made bets as to what stupid event and stroke of bad luck would happen next to Jason Biggs' character. This movie was as big of a let-down as "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion", another movie which could of been good, but was ruined by a bad script and unfunny dialogue. They really missed the boat on this one.</fullReview>

Each of the scenes appear pasted together with no real plot development.

		<fullReview>I have not seen all of the American Pie films, seen bits but not fully. This is the first one I have seen fully. I watched it in the cinema, and I was laughing with the rest of the people in the room. A bit later I watched it again in a friends house, and after seeing it for a second time I still thought it was a brilliant, hilarious, comical film. Maybe I am easily amused and that is why I enjoyed it, but I recommend this film to anyone with a bit of humour :D No real disadvantages, wish that there would be more "near-tears" moments when im laughing so much. Best parts of the film - Eating of the sh*t, F*cking of the Granny. Stifler was brilliant, his laugh had me laughing - his comments where great also. But he acted so gay for a person who is obsessed with woman! Same with Finch. But the funny side is the Stifler - Finch "b*tch fights!".Sure, some of the films compared to this one might have some differences, faults and odd bits. But I think its so funny, you dont really notice anything strange like that unless you go in to watch the film to "find all minor and major faults!".Great film, really recommend it to all.- Sully</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American pie? That was funny. The second one? Alright, it was cute. The third? It was kinda vile. It seems like when movies in a series start, they're new, and edgy, and the writers and actors have nothing, so they give it their all... but over time, they grow fat, and lazy, and complacent. This is a perfect example of that. The few laughs that it gave us did nothing for the plot which you could have sliced up and eaten it with some ham and wheat bread because it was cheesy and full of holes. How can you not get the plot right. That's the basis for a story? The BASIS, not an option. How can they go from engagement, to marriage in one week, before meeting the brides parents, to suddenly at the alter? Sooo lame! Get your timeline in order, people! This is a rental. Most of the comedy you've seen in the trailer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AMERICAN PIE: THE WEDDING (2003)Reviewers Note: I watched the uncut edition of "American Pie: The Wedding".THE GOOD:--It is an expectation that the American Pie films will be funny now, and in that respect "Wedding" definitely doesn't let it's audience down. There are quite a few utterly HILARIOUS sequences that will have many rolling in the aisles. The standout set piece is definitely the bachelor party. It has everything you could want - T&amp;A, some truly hilarious physical comedy, and the scene is also well-constructed, especially the aftermath scenes where Jim is trying to cover up all his mistakes. I also loved the dog-raping scene (don't worry, nobody really rapes a dog) and most of the Stifler stuff was enjoyable - especially the gross-out pooh-eating scene, which had me and my sister gagging.--"American Pie: The Wedding" works with a bigger canvas than the first two films. There are more sets and all departments for the film are made to work much harder. Of course, it isn't as hard as one would have to work for films like The Lord of the Rings trilogy or "Moulin Rouge", but for a film of it's type, "Wedding" takes some new chances and goes for a 'bigger' feel. For instance, the cast is required to dance in a number of scenes (the night club dance-off was actually EXTREMELY well constructed), and the wedding looks very expensive, and a few sequences look like they were shot on location.--As always, the cast is extremely enjoyable to watch. Jason Biggs is still bursting with his knack for wonderful geeky physical comedy. Eddie Kaye Thomas proves he can work the dirtier side of Finch here. I love Alyson Hannigan and she's cute-as-a-button here and is obviously enjoying the heck out of herself, and I'm enjoying the heck out of myself watching her enjoy the heck out of herself. How about some more challenging roles for this superb Buffy actress? Eugene Levy is once again an absolute scene-stealer as Jim's Dad; the dude is just so goddamn funny and has that charming understanding with the characters and the audience too. However, you've probably guessed the stand-out is Seann William Scott, he's simply wonderful and absolutely hilarious as Stifler, once again waltzing (literally) through the role with an aura of confidence and understanding of his classic and endlessly entertaining character.THE BAD:--It annoyed me that many of the actors were missing from this movie, the least the screenwriter could've done was at least make up an excuse for why the characters couldn't attend the wedding. Shannon Elizabeth's Nadia would've been happy for Jim and definitely would've attended (they had the friend vibe at the end of "American Pie 2"). Chris Klein's absence was especially unforgivable as he was one of Jim's best mates and would so be there for him, and would've brought along his screen girlfriend Mena Suvari as well. Natasha Lyonne and Tara Reid's lack of appearances were understandable, but the rest were definitely an annoyance for me, in particular Klein.--I guess this isn't exactly much of a surprise to the fans of the first two films, but "Wedding" doesn't have much of a story. It is basically - for the first half anyway - a bunch of funny skits put together, ending with a sweet enough wedding (which didn't seem as satisfying to me as a viewer as I thought it would, might I add). Though these skits are funny, I would've liked to have seen more of a plotline. Oh well, this is the American Pie films after all?RATING:7/10 - These movies continue to be lots of fun, and though it is the weakest of the three films, that doesn't mean I won't be hanging out for "American Pie: The Honeymoon".IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:American Pie (8/10) American Pie 2 (7/10) Road Trip (8/10) The Wedding Planner (4/10) The Wedding Singer (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay being a fan of the light hearted "American Pie" films beacause it gave the best modern world rendition of out of control teenage antics since "Porky's" means i can say that nothing new can be excepted of this third entry except for even more improbable situations and the usual "Jock" references flying in abundance.Seann William Scott however does steal the show as the indeniable "Stiffler" who pretty much re-invents the story's turns as well as the ultimate "Jock" cum clear the cobwebs hero to the brainless blonde mass.The American Pie Franchise is One of the only teenage franchises to survive the new millenium...and survive it does well.No in depth explanation is deserved for a non in depth film..Just watch and appreciate for it's ability to amuse and provide blase' characters (Although Kevin's character could easily disappear)Recommended for the easily amused and non anally retentative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahhhh... the college days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie captures the spirit of college for me more than any other film I've seen. Laughing with friends, hanging out, working crappy jobs, looking for chicks, beer fueled mayhem - it's all there. The way everyone relates and the situations everyone creates are top notch. I laughed from beginning to end.For example, there's a scene where the guys are searching a house trying to prove the occupants are lesbians. The two women eventually find the guys hiding. They all work out a deal where the women perform kissing and touching on each other IF the men kiss and touch each other FIRST. It gets outrageous with lines like "I'm confident in my masculinity" and "I'll take one for the team." If you don't find this funny, none of the American Pie movies may be up your alley. It's all outrageous, over the top.Relatively speaking, I found American Pie 2 to be better than the first one. The situational jokes are top notch. Even though some may find the humour to be of the "embarrassing" type, it's a good watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny in parts, but the Pie's gone stale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to start by saying that I really don't understand why people would post comments like "I didn't like the first two movies...and I didn't like this one." If you didn't like the first two movies, then you probably don't like the genre. A) Why watch the third in the first place? B) Why bother commenting on it?! It's obviously not for you, just go watch a movie that you might like!Anyway, now I've got that out of my system, onto the Pie!In my opinion, American Pie 2 was the highlight of the series, closely followed by the original. Unfortunately I can't rate American Wedding up there with them, but it's still pretty funny in places. There are one or two classic lines that had me in hysterics, and a few scenes that were laugh-out-loud funny. For those alone I would watch it; but I have to say that it wasn't anywhere near as good as the previous two, and as a film, it was pretty awful.The main problem lies in the fact that the editing of the film seems to have been done by some sort of 3-year old chimpanzee, who clearly hasn't watched a movie before. The scenes, quite simply, don't fit together. You are left wondering where you are and what you are watching in the film, as you jump-cut from one location to a completely new one without any explanation. An example is the cut to the bachelor party, which came without warning and without explanation. This isn't a movie you want to have to think anything about, you just want to get lost in it for a couple of hours! Even if you have no interest in how films are put together, and no idea about the concept of editing, you will be able to understand what I'm talking about here, as the cutting is so ridiculously bad. I would go so far as to call it the most amateurishly put together film I have EVER seen. Translated into a sentence the editing would look something like this:"Once upon a time there was, hello dear where did I leave my, crash on the highway left fifteen people, just about to watch TV, night then."Makes no sense, does it?! Nor does the film! It's like they've just taken individual Takes and stuck them together with glue, not bothering to see where they've put the pieces!Add to that my personal annoyance at the fact that exotic camera shots are used, which in itself would be ok, but they are so pointless that all they do is serve to confuse. Why, for example, does the camera focus on one of the female actors, pan left and look at her through a mirror, and then return to the first shot?! It serves no purpose! There is no-one behind the mirror. We know she is in a bathroom. What the heck is the point in it all?! Experimentation is ok, but not in a film which follows such a set, simple format.The man and the legend Stiffler is also transformed in American Wedding, in fact it might as well have been called "The Stifler Movie". Not that that in itself would have been a bad thing, Steve Stiffler is absolutely hilarious in the other two movies and has the lions share of the best lines in this one. But why, oh why, has his character been changed so that he's more like Doofy out of Scary Movie, than Stifler out of the previous two Pies? It gets really annoying in parts, although he does get better towards the end. I would add that this is not the fault of Seann William Scott's acting, rather it is the fault of bad direction.Also, both the situations and the comic timing are no-where near as good as the other two movies. The latter is partly due to the fact that, again, the editing is soooo bad! You need a beat after a line to make it funny in some cases, but they deliver the line and again jump-cut to a new scene - very annoying! And as I say, nothing in this movie compares to the lesbians in the second, or the pie in the first. Jason Biggs' "Pie" moment in this film for example - involving pubic hair and flowers - is cut to all of 90 seconds so that we can get back to Stiffler, again, annoying!Other agitations include the disappearance of Kevin from the film entirely after the wedding without any explanation, and the fact that the pool-scene wasn't included, as it was actually pretty funny.I would go and see this movie, and I'll undoubtedly buy it just to complete the trilogy, but its a real shame that what could have been the highpoint of a series has been turned into the worst of the three films due to awful post-production.2/5, but fans of the first two, go see it anyway!Best lines spoilers:1. Stiffler: "It makes me lethargic." Cadence: "What do you mean?" Stiffler: "...I don't know."2. Stripper is talking about her hobbies... Stiffler [whiny]: "I don't care!!! Just strip!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as the first Pie, and not even up to the level of the second one, it's still a teen comedy that works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really wincing the first ten minutes or so of this movie -- the performances were so forced, especially by Stifler, that I thought the whole movie was doomed. Everyone soon settled into their characters, though, and it became the American Pie experience we all know and love. They've pared down the cast a bit: no Tara Reid, no american beauty Mena Suvari, no mini-Keanu Chris Klein , no Nadia, and thankfully no that guy that plays Kevin). No, wait, I think Kevin was in the movie, but did he even have any lines? Glad to see Fred Willard, but I looked around and couldn't find Harry Shearer much to my surprise. Not nearly as good as the first Pie, and not even up to the level of the second one, it's still a teen comedy that works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stiffler Must Die!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie could have been good. It really did have potential, but for some reason the writers got carried away with that dumb-ass Stiffler character. I always thought his character was annoying, and in this one he does not disappoint. Practically everything that came out of his mouth was some embarrasingly vulgar cliche that would have sounded more at home coming out of the mouth of a 15 year old puberty stricken boy. The scene at the gay club was just plain awful. I don't know if it was meant to be funny or not. I certainly didn't think it was anywhere close to being funny. The bachelor party was just plain horrible as well. What man has only three guys at his bachelor party? What was up with that?If they make another movie in this series, hopefully it will be all about Stiffler's funeral. If this movie was any indication, then his death will have resulted from drinking too much booze and insulting a club full of gay people.</fullReview>

I was aching with laughter as poor Jim was trying to conceal his friends from Michelle's parents. And of course, I cannot forget Stiffler and his "chocolate truffle" mishap. Despite this, it wasn't as fresh or funny as the first two films.American Wedding is a funny, gross, and entertaining good time. Go rent it!7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you remember what made American Pie a good movie, you'll be sad to find that it's no longer present.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I get in to my review of this film, I'd like to give my thoughts on the first two films in the series.The first movie is damn good and I make no apologies. Admittedly, it's a Porky's for the 90's and some of the humor is pretty lowbrow. Honestly speaking though, I find it to be a touching take on the pains of growing up and overall, it just has an honesty to it that makes it resonate a little more than your usual teen sex comedy. The vibe in the movie is pretty strong and if you haven't seen the first one, you should make it a point to do so. It is one of those films that have you laughing out loud more often than not.The second movie actually manages to capture some of the original's magic but it falters in one crucial spot: character development. While it's always a cool thing to see all of the characters from a particularly good film return for a sequel, including those that you wouldn't have expected to return, history has proven many, many times over that all sequels are not destined to succeed. Several of the returning characters are given really shoddy plot lines, especially Chris Klein and Mena Suvari and it hurts the film. Their performances are on point but they just aren't given anything to work with. I also could have done with less of those moral "messages" that I felt I was getting beat over the head with. To be fair, the storylines in the first were exercises in morality also, so I guess it can be passed off as an attempt at trying to stay true to the original. I liked the second one but it was nowhere near as funny as the first. Not to say it doesn't have it's moment.Now, we finally get to American Wedding. The story in a nutshell is basically that the pie humper and the flute humper are getting married. All sorts of things go wrong of course and there are several humiliating experiences to be had by various characters during the course of the movie's progression. I am going to be upfront and say that this movie should never have been made. The first sign that lets you know you're in for it: at least five of the original characters from the first two do not make it back for this one and their absence really takes away from the film. Given that they should have ended the story with the second film, you can color me nonsurprised. Gone are Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Natasha Lyonne, Shannon Elizabeth with the worst loss of the bunch being Chris Klein. They don't even mention his character in the film and I felt that to be a betrayal of how important his character was in the beginning. He was an equal part of the core group of friends and his absence is pretty glaring. That's not even mentioning the other bit characters who still added to the formula, like the Shermanator and even that little monkey with the boxer shorts who somehow made it onto the second one. Well, that sucks, you say but maybe, you know, it could still work. So, you'd think having less returning characters would open up some more time to do something interesting with the characters, right? No, I'm sorry. That's definitely not the case here. I'll give you a perfect example. Thomas Ian Nicholas, the kid who plays Kevin, returns but to do what? If you can recall, he served a purpose in the first two films. In the first, he initializes the pact to lose their virginity by prom time, which was pretty much the main plot of the story. In the second one, he sets up the beach house idea, where the second movie takes place. As you can see, he was active in those films. He returns here to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. The poor guy doesn't even have Tara Reid to work off of and I guess because she didn't return for this one, they were probably hoping that he'd get by on his smile. The other characters, including the couple who the movie is supposed to be about by the way, have thin storylines that place attention on characters that aren't really all that important. Which is my main beef with this movie. Why does it feel like Jim and Flute Chick are making a cameo appearance in a movie that is supposed to be theirs but is more about the hijinks of one Steve Stifler? Don't get me wrong, I'd rather have Stifler than no Stifler at all but the movie revolves around his character a little bit too much. That coupled with the fact that he's even more obnoxious than he was in the first one just when he was starting to be sort of cool in the second one makes this movie very grating. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that the movie shouldn't have been called American Wedding, it should have been called American Stifler. I think nearly ninety to ninety-five percent of the film's big joke pieces revolve around him. My guess is that they probably had no choice but to bump him up in character importance because they needed someone to make up for lost space. Trust me, if you didn't get enough Stifler in the first two movies, you will here. To the point that you may want to punch yourself in the face repeatedly with a roll of quarters in your fist. Stifler's funny at times but there are moments that are supposed to be funny but instead will cause you to cringe and possibly bury your face in your hands forever, especially the scene at the gay club, which I will leave you to endure without my company. Jim and Michelle are bit players in the Story of Stifler. You will remember that I told you that after or if you've already seen the film. The new characters don't hold any weight, especially January Jones, who plays Michelle's equally nymphetic sister, Cadence. This is a character that is so poorly written that it's not entirely impossible to end up hating her by the end of the movie. I'll just ask you to pay attention to her character, what purpose she serves in the movie and the choices she makes. You'd think overall that stupidity was auditioning for a new poster child. Lastly, in what may be the biggest travesty for movies of this type, the bachelor party scene comes off as being corny and way too tame, even on the so-called, "UNRATED" version. Man, Tom Hanks should have been brought in to consult. Watch "Bachelor Party" if you don't know what I refer to. A big boo to the bachelor party scene.There are a couple of minimal positives. Finch comes back and fares better than most of the others in this film. His anemic storyline, which consists of battling Stifler for the affections of Band Geek's sister, provides for a couple of funny moments and that's really just me being generous. The "MILF brothers" come back in a cameo and while it is a trivial thing, the two of them still manage to crack me up just by thinking about them in the first film. That too, is me being generous. Jim has a couple of embarrassing moments that even though they're pretty ridiculous in their set-up, will still get a laugh or two.You know what, I'm through writing about this stinking heap. If given the choice to leap to my death or watch this movie again, watching the movie again would win by an extremely narrow margin. I'm sorry to be the one to say it but if you had your hopes up thinking you were gonna get something entertaining, I'd suggest you get ready to get angry. And please, no more American Pie movies. Please.RATING: *1/2 of ***** and that's me being generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it has its laughs ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching the last installment of the American Pie series. The first American Pie was just ground breaking and brought us so much laughter. We saw mostly new actors being introduced with a high school story about loosing one's virginity. Then the second one came and I was very excited to see more of the lives of the Michigan gang. It was just as funny. That movie was based after their first year of college and it brought them to a summer vacation home. This movie felt like a remake of American Pie. It had its connections, but it was a different setting with allot of the same formulas. It accomplished making another great American Pie. I felt after that one, they should have folded while the winnings were good. They didn't and I knew I would see the third, but just didn't think it was necessary. American Wedding takes place after they graduate college and Jim and Michelle take the next step. Don't get me wrong. This was a good movie and it had many laughs, but by the third movie there isn't much we haven't seen. It seemed like they were trying just a little too hard to make another American Pie. Allot of the original cast were not in this one and even though it didn't bother me, I thought they should have at least mentioned where they were. Take this for what it is, the third in a very funny series. It is a good movie and if you love American Pie you will enjoy this movie, with no doubt. I just don't think you will have the same experience as you did after the previous two.If I sound too negative, then I say watch this for Stifler! Seann William Scott is one funny man and he brings us some more classic Stifmeister moments.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Wedding is the third in a trilogy which started with American Pie. For once the sequel was some what original, but was slap stick and some what banal. There were moments of raucous laughter and much humor, such as the gay club and the bachelor party. Seann William as Steve Stifler played the obnoxious jock trying to be a gentleman and did it well. Jason Biggs, the lead actor, playing Jim Levinstein, was good as usual and who can not appreciate Alyson Hannigan as Michelle. Funny and ease to watch, if you liked American Pie 1 and 2 you'll like American Wedding.</fullReview>

After the first 10 minutes of this film, I was GLAD that they weren't in this movie. This, in my opinion, is the funniest movie from the American Pie series. The other movies had pointless scenes that seemed to just drag on, whereas this movie was funny in every single scene. This is one of the only movies that made me laugh out loud in the theater, and had many others cracking up as well.The only thing I don't understand is why Kevin was in this, he really did nothing at all for the film in any way other than being tied up and stuck in a closet.Stiffler really stole the show as well.I can't wait till the DVD comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHY TWO THUMBS UP FOR THIS TRIOLOGY??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply...Since Dumb &amp; Dumber there were practically no laughable comedy coming from U.S lately. And this triology brought us some laughs... And than came American part 1. It was o.k., nothing special (5 out of 10), except for beautiful topless Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and few humorous moments. Followed by much better sequel (8 out of 10), filled with "dark humor" and surprisingly a one from puritan Hollywood, who dared to show us some naked skin...And with a character who stole the show...Sean William Scott a.k.a. The stiffler. In American wedding Sean does it again. He's simply the funniest guy in the movie, like Homer Simpson in The Simpsons. Plus, he gets the most beautiful girl in the set. Others are pretty much the same as they were in previous parts. Allright. All in all, don't have a very high expectations, because we are not talking about Oscar material here, it's just a comedy where you, if you have some sense of humor, laugh till the end and after ending quite soon forget all about it and that's why 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Squels Of 2003, This Is One Of Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Remember being 13 and dying to see "American Pie" with all the sex content and the nudity. I ended up finding that the movie was awsome, one of my favorite comedies. It inspired me to watch other teen movies liek "Porke's" &amp; "Road Trip". Then I found out that their was an unrated version and I bought that on VHS (before I fell in love with DVD and Letterbox). I was hoping to see more of Shannon Elisabeth, but still it was cool. Then I heard of "American Pie 2", the sequal where everyone comes back. And that was true. I actually saw this one at the theatre, twise. I also bought the Ultimate Edition of the first one on DVD during this time. I became a hugh fan. I gave it a 10 on here at IMDB and wrote a positive summary. I still love the movie to date. Then i found out "American Pie 3" was coming out, then they changed the name to "American Wedding" which i thought was a good idea. Jim &amp; Michelle getting married what a good idea for a third movie. BUT, yes i said but, the movie lacked many great quality that made the second the best. Not everyone returned, and i understand why. Chris, Tara, Shannon &amp; Mena did not return. Shannon's charcter ended during the second one, so I didn't even want her in the third. Chris said in one interview he didn't want to return because the second was so great, that they can't do better. (which was correct by the way). Seann said one on Conan that he didn't want to, but he read the script and liked it (also know he also felt the same why for the sequal to "Dude, Where's My Car?" and as far as i know is still doing it). The movie could have done well without Tara or even Mena, but without Chris it did not help the movie. Plus i didn't like it that they didn't even talk about the charcter "Oz". I did like how "Stilfer" ended up be the most unliked. But over all comared to all the sequals the came during 2003 (X2, Terminator 3, Matrix 2 &amp; 3, Return Of The King, Freddy Vs. Jason, etc.) the movie did not match up to par.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One question: WHY THEY DIDN'T STOP AFTER THE FIRST AMERICAN PIE?C'mon people, American Pie 2 was already bad enough, then came "American Wedding'? I may be wrong, but this has to be the worst movie I've seen this year. Aside from the fact that most of the original characters are gone, this film is tasteless, boring, and it's not even funny. Full of crappy jokes and very predictable efforts to make the audience laugh. And what in the world those writers were thinking when they were writing the script? They think that by making this film more nastier than the first two parts, this movie will still have the "American Pie" magic? NEWSFLASH: The magic's gone! Even Jim's dad is not that tasteful anymore. He is one boring character. This film is basically a waste of time and a very cheap addition to the American Pie Saga, if you call it that way.If you want some tasteful, intelligent humor, avoid this film. And if you really want to see this, wait for it on TV, that way you'll see this film without spending a dime.1/2 star out of 10 stars..... for the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i dont know where to start with this film.Ok the jokes whilst some are among the best in the trilogy they dont hide the fact that stifler(sean william scott)has gone from being a guy who was immature,stupid,rude but at the same time cool and always funny into a complete moron i couldnt stand it any longer when he was on the screen i suppose he will appeal to people who find tom green funny but for me its not comedy its just damm right irratating.And the theres michelle(allyson hannigan)Her charachter has gone from being a band geek that no one liked in to everybodys best friend it seemed like the writers just decied to give stifler all the bits that made the other charachters so annoying in the first two films.The only charachter in this film that deserves merit is jims dad(eugene levy)His timing and acting is just as good as the prequals.The story is of course jim getting married to michelle and the "funny"(belive me the jokes are very hit and miss)antics that arrive as a result of nerves and getting all things ready in time for the big day.I would tell people to wait till this film is on t.v before waisting money buying it.Below average 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you sure that this is the end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having written my first user comment on the second American Pie, I feel obliged to say something about this one.For a start, the story's slightly different, but the recipe and the ingredients remain basically the same. The characters are by now well established, so you know what to expect. Jim's hapless attempts at impressing everyone naturally lead to the most embarrassing situations, often courtesy of either Stifler or his Dad. But with the help of his friends, he finally manages to overcome the obstacles on the way to his wedding. Throw in the requisite amounts of nudity and gross-out humour, and you've got American Pie 3.This is all well and good, even if not quite as spectacularly funny as the first time BUT (and, as you see, it is a big but) why, oh why did they have turn Stifler into one of the most obnoxious characters ever, and expand his role at the expense of everyone else? I appreciate they had to overcome the loss of a large part of the original cast, but this character almost spoiled the film for me - that, and one scene that literally nearly made me sick.That said, even in its third instalment American Pie manages to knock most of its imitations into a knocked hat (Ashton Kutcher, are you listening?). I was, as in the review to AP 2, going to express the hope that this might be the end of the series (trilogy, and all that), but surely Jim as "American Dad" will be far too tempting for the producers...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, but better than Part 2 (***)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A definite improvement over the weak, lackluster "American Pie 2", "American Wedding" is a return to near the quality of the first film.As is clear from the title, this installment is about the wedding of Jim (Jason Biggs) and band geek/nympho Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). It's proof how likeable and memorable these characters are by how much I was moved by the very first scene, when Jim pops the question and Michelle says "yes". It just felt good to see them again. The good-natured nastiness of the the series remains intact as well, because of course the proposal follows a very funny oral sex mishap. A great deal of the cast of the first two films don't return again, like Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, and Shannon Elizabeth, and I missed them, but the movie doesn't suffer for it. The core characters (Jim, Michelle, Jim's parents, Finch, and of course, the walking id known as Stifler) are there, and they do the job just fine. In fact, Seann William Scott reaches near-epic heights with his performance as the infamous Stifler this time. He owns all the biggest laughs in the movie; too many, almost. There is so much Stifler that I kinda wanted them to get back to Jim and Michelle sometimes. Still, I ain't complaining. Stifler is one of the most interesting doofuses to "grace" screens in years, and Scott plays him to the hilt without overdoing it. The middle of the movie is a little dry, and there are a couple setpieces that aren't as funny as they may have seemed on paper (especially a lengthy, rather lame bachelor party sequence), but for the most part, this is a very funny movie that gets the mixture of gross-out humor and sweetness almost as right as it was in the original. Plus, it's got a great soundtrack. There are good songs by artists like Foo Fighters and Badly Drawn Boy throughout, and when we get to the actual wedding at the end of the film, Norah Jones' "The Long Day Is Over" and especially Van Morrison's classic "Into The Mystic" are put to absolutely perfect use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis Spoiler! This is the third movie in the American Pie series with Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) getting married. (NOTE: I must say at the beginning, this comedy is rated R for sexual content and crude humor.) If you saw the first two movies, then you know what type of humor is in this movie, and this one goes all the way. Stifle played by Seann William Scott stole the movie with his tasteless and boorish behavior. Stifle was not invited to the wedding, but he gets an invite when he teaches Jim how to dance. Without Stifle at the wedding, this movie would only be a small comedy. You hate Stifle at the beginning because he is an inconsiderate person with no respect for women; and then you give him a break and begin to like him even after he almost ruins the wedding by killing all the flowers. The movie is a collection of site gags that were hilarious. I laughed very hard through the entire movie from beginning to end. I am sure there will be an American Pie 4, because the series is so funny. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how much I laughed during this movie. Not for ages have I laughed so hard. OK, so some of it was childish and stupid, but for the most part, this movie is very, very funny. It is eons funnier than the horrible American Pie 2, for which the stars were all contractually obligated to make should the studio have a hit with the first movie. That movie stank, it was obvious no one was really interested in making it, it was boringly sentimental, and simply not funny at all. However, this movie took a complete turn and competes with the original in gross-out humour value!In every scene there is something to laugh at, from the obligatory Jason Biggs compromising positions, to the endless putdowns from the ever-annoying Stifler. In fact, for the most part, Stifler steals the show. One of the funniest moments in the film is when he is gathered by the groom and just before Jim starts to thank his wedding party, Stifler spouts "This sucks!". It caught me off guard and basically made me laugh my head off.Fans of the series will certainly be pleased the third installment returned to it's roots instead of moving off into shallow sentimentality. There is no end to the crude jokes, sight gags, and basic ribaldry. Obviously, this type of humour is not appealing to everyone (my grandmother wouldn't find it funny at all). However, if you know you are not going to see sophisticated highbrow humour, you will not be disappointed. A terrific comedy! I'll give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grosser, but nicer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie last weekend, and I enjoyed it to an extent. While it tops the previous two in gross factor, it also tops them in sweet, romantic niceness, primarily because of the wedding setting. Here, Sean William Scott steals the show. His antics and self discovery provide the drive for his character. Meanwhile, Jim and Michelle are quite adorable as the engaged couple. And Fred Willard, it seems he's become typecast as the gentle, innocent to the ways of the world father. And while many don't recognize her, I've been watching for January Jones since her appearance in Bandits, and here she turns in a respectable first timer performance. Again, the real focus is on Jim and Michelle, and on a sidenote, the only recurring friends are Finch, Kevin and Stifler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And they all lived hornily ever after.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie was a revival of the kinds of movies that teenagers of today need. American Pie 2 was an important bridge between the first and third movies. Fans of the first movie criticized the second partially because Jim(Jason Biggs) dumped Nadia(Shannon Elizabeth), but she ended up with another geek to love, who I'll refer to later. Now, there's what is hopefully the final movie in the series. Of the three movies, this one had the funniest opening segment. The first two had standard introductions, but here Jim is about to propose to new college grad Michelle in a fancy restaurant, when suddenly she decides to give him oral sex under the table, over the presumption of lesser plans than marrying her. Most of Jim's Friends are invited. I say "most" for two reasons; 1)The missing cast from the first two movies, which shouldn't distract you from enjoying this one, and 2)Steve Stifler, who is the same A-hole he was in high school, but is now in a position of power at his old high school. Jim, Michelle, Kevin and Finch(especially Finch) are determined to keep him out because they KNOW he'll ruin their wedding, but Stifler has something he can hold over poor Jim's head --- Jim can't dance, and Steve teaches him how in order to get an unwritten invitation. Yes, Sean Williams Scott steals the show, but his antics are still important to the story. He's the only one who can teach Jim to dance, and is determined to make Michelle's sister Cadence(January Jones) another sexual conquest of his by acting like an angelic preppie. No matter how much his friends try not to invite him, he's determined to go to the wedding, because he knows the groom needs him and the bride's family thinks he's a decent guy...at first. He even goes as far as to help Michelle's family get a better wedding dress from a designer who turns out to be a patron of a gay disco in Chicago, where Stifler's homophobia nearly gets the whole gang in trouble. Be sure to spot an interesting cameo in there, where Scott's character learns that calling himself "The Stiff-meister" is just as uncool as Chuck Sherman(Chris Owen) referring to himself as "The Sherminator." Determined to prove himself irresistible even to gay men, Stifler and Bear(Eric Allan Kramer) have a dance-off with every disco and new-wave song from the 1970's and '80's. Too bad they overlooked such an obvious gay song like "Situation," by Yaz. If the presence of Stifler isn't enough to ruin everything, there's Jim's crumudgeonly grandmother(Angela Paton), who rejects the young ethnic-Irish lass for not being Jewish. It's becoming quite clear that our heroine is not going to have the wedding of her dreams, even if Stifler eventually makes up for nearly destroying everything. Hopefully for his sake, Sean Williams Scott won't have to play characters like "The Stiff-meister" anymore, because it's well-known that he hates such typecasting, and it makes me feel guilty for not seeing him in "Bulletproof Monk," earlier this year.One thing that can't be denied is that Jim and Michelle make a cute couple. Both are geeky and horny, but Flaherty is more willing to take advantage of whoever she's with. Who wouldn't want a relationship like theirs? I do admit, however that I would've liked more scenes of the kinds of sex eluded to in the "break-up" segment of AP2 though. And it's fitting that Alyson Hannigan is actually on the verge of getting married in real life in the Fall of 2003. Well, Ms. Hannigan I wish you luck in the future, and hope your wedding turns out much happier than that of Michelle Flaherty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Wedding (2003) Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas, January Jones, Eugene Levy, Molly Cheek, Deborah Rush, Fred Willard, D: Jesse Dylan. After a three-year relationship, Jim proposes to band-geek girlfriend Michelle, which means bringing members of the gang to help him tie the knot (excluding the leading ladies), a lot more embarrassing shenanigans, and a bachelor party for the obnoxious, one-track-minded Stifler.Third helping of PIE makes room for more sexism and tastelessness, which can't cure its phase for showing its age mark. The heart is left out here from the film digging so low for more funny stuff, but all we get is the cake topped on with pubic shavings and some masticated doggie poo! If you prefer potty humor like so, here's a pie in the face! Directors of the first, Paul and Chris Weitz are co-producers. Running Time: 96 minutes and rated R for sexual content, language, and crude humor. RATING: ** (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just watched this film, both my wife and I agree that this was the best slice.Never before have I sat in a cinema where the whole audience was simply bursting with laughter. This really was a great night out.Jim is played exactly the same as he always has been, and really shone in this film. He did have a more mature streak to him, but he was still the same trouble magnet he always was. Finch and Stifler were also top form, especially in their competition for the affections of Michelle's sister. Kevin was a slight dissapointment, in that you could probably count the number of lines he had on your fingers. I had no problem with the other regulars being missing, eg Oz and Co , as there was simply no room for them in this film. I think Kevin was only there to add a bit of window dressing, as the character didnt have a great deal to do, and no real impact on the storyline.Jim's dad, the wonderful Eugene Levy was again an absolute star in this, I never get bored with this character. Michelle seemed a lot more normal after the initial scene in the restaurant, but don't let that put you off.It would be a funny old world if we all liked the same thing and all had the same prefferences, and no doubt a lot of American Pie fans won't find this movie exactly to their taste, but I for one think I have found my favourite piece of pie. My wife also thinks so. A brilliant end, to a wonderful series of movies.10/10 and even that score does'nt do this movie justice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine wedding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: *** (out of *****)We all make mistakes. And I'll begin this review by admitting that I overrated the sequel to American Pie. Yes, it was a fun diversion (indeed, it was good to see all the characters again) but on repeat viewings I noticed what was wrong. There were plenty of laughs, but not all of them worked and there was no plot. It appeared that the makers were more concerned about getting the original's cast back together than the creative side of things (making the film an obvious cash-in). Something was missing.Well, part of that "something" has been restored in the less workmanlike part 3, The Wedding. It's slightly more grown-up than the other two, and unlike the second, has a story of sorts. This story relates to the wedding of Jim (Jason Biggs) &amp; Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), and the events leading up to it; those who have seen the trailer will know what I'm talking about. Essentially, the film sticks to the same formula as its prequels - that is to say, filthy, rude and simple comedy with a little heart. And I'm ashamed to admit that it works again. The typical crudity remains and is higher than ever before (sometimes too high; one scene had me almost looking away from the screen). No doubt the fans or those looking for easy laughs expect this sort of thing, and they get it.I had my reservations about a third entry, but when I heard it was regarding Jim &amp; Michelle's wedding, I was oddly optimistic. How highly you regard these films depends not only on whether crude humour really is your thing, but also on whether or not you like the characters. If you don't like them then I doubt you'll like the film. If, however, you're wandering into this film without having seen the prequels, I think you may still laugh a fair bit, even if the time you spend with the characters won't mean as much to you. Just relax your brain and laugh at the characters and their situations. As usual, Jim's unintentional ineptitude leads him into some embarrassing circumstances. Michelle is as kinky as ever, but now she's a little older we see a more human side to her. As for Stifler...well, what can I say? Seann William Scott cannot play any other character like this one. This time, the makers even try and humanise him a bit (with limited success), playing on Scott's ever increasing popularity. Just watch him as he tries being gentlemanly to attract Michelle's little sister Cadence (January Jones).Fred Willard plays Michelle's Dad, and even though I've heard that he can be really funny, he is actually restrained here (but he does have his moments). Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are their usual selves, with a few unexpected developments taking place on Finch's side. And to round the ensemble off we have Jim's Dad, the ever-reliable Eugene Levy (although none of his conversations hit the heights of the original's). Other `old friends' like Oz, Heather and Jessica are gone - but, quite frankly, they're not missed.The best thing about Wedding is that the heart seems to have returned to the series. Under the direction of Jesse Dylan (son of Bob Dylan), the cast look like they're having fun again. This isn't likely to live long in the memory and will never have the "novelty" feel of the original, but it is entertaining and a fitting conclusion to a saga that modernised the teen sex comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the other two films, read bad reviews, and put off seeing this one for a while. Just shows you can't trust critics. I think this film had the most laugh-out-loud funny moments of the series (I don't see many films where people keep going for minutes, there are two scenes which involve dogs...well, you just have to see the film).The characters, for the most part, are rounded out beautifully (a few aren't given enough to do). Sean William Scott's "Stifler" will go down in movie history. Kudos also to Biggs, Hannigan, Thomas, and Levy, who add subtle shades to characters we've come to know. The biggest surprise for me is that this wasn't a sloppy sequel (um, unless you mean messiness, like the scene where...see the movie). The opening scene in the restaurant, to me, was the funniest moment of the whole series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny And Gross To End The American Pie Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: These comments may contain spoilers so you have been warned!!! The last movie in the American Pie series entitled, "American Wedding" and from the beginning to the end of this wonderful comedy I laugh myself silly. Just like the name of the movie, the two main characters Jim and Michelle (Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan) about to "tie the knot" and they do their best to have the best wedding in the world. Easy said than done when they are forced to invite Steve Stifler ( Seann William Scott) to the wedding of the future nupitals. Stifler has did some really gross things from the past movies but this one he does in this movie takes the cake or should I say "truffles". Overall, this movie in the last of the "Pie" series really was emotionally towards the end. I personally hope that this series is finale and don't do anything ridiculous like an "American Baby" movie.  The Dark Gengar gives this American comedy from a rating of one Gengar to Ten Gengars: Nine Gengars. The soundtrack is pretty good and hope you enjoy the movie one and all. Ciao babee!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed American Pie 2, but felt it struggled to find new laughs following the success of the first film.. I was therefore rather hesitant about watching American Wedding, my worries were over after the first scene. Even though this is a film about a wedding, they have dropped the soppy scenes that were so apparant in the first two films and realy gone for all out laughs. Well Done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why spend the first 30 minutes of the film trying to turn Stifler into the next Jim Carrey - it just doesn't work.Very disappointing - only one excellent scene, where the 'policewoman' and 'maid' come round to Jims house - very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding was a funny movie because it's the last movie from American Wedding. The things I found funny was when Stifler walked into a gay bar and like competed to dance with this guy I forgot his name.This movies circles around, Jim, Michelle, Stifler, Cadence, Finch, Michelle's parents, and Jim's parents. The movie was great but one or few more important people are missing from the movie like Oz, heather, Vicky, Nadia, Sherman , and etc but mainly Oz. He's one of the four but I guess Stifler replaced him. In my opinion I like this movie, I hope everybody will see American wedding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw American Pie, and thought that it was hysterical. At first I was skeptical about AP2, but I saw it anyway and it was even funnier! By the time of American Wedding, I was not sure if it would be as good as the other two. Plus the fact that like half the people weren't in it. But as a faithful fan of the movies, I saw it anyway. I do not know if I've ever laughed so hard in my life! In fact, I almost peed myself! I hope they end the movies here, because the three of them so far have been great, and I want the perfect end to a perfect trilogy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious but can be offputting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get things straight right off the bat. This is extremely gross. It is over the top in it's depiction of disgusting and lude acts. In all the "Pie" series the center motivation has always been sex. And it is here loud and clear in its brutal determination from one and only Seann William Scott. He is a maniac here and is the basis for the most sickening and funny moments of the film. There are some critical hits to this movie's formula and one main problem is the deletion of previous cast members. Also, some of the characters in this film are completely in cruise control mode(Hannigan,Thomas Ian Nicholas)while Scott's character gets major screen time. My disappointment was not seeing Biggs getting his usual star treatment in these movies. He pushed to the side in some ways so Stiffmeister can run rampant with his constant cursing and sexual overrdrive. Also I never connected to Hannigan's sister(the girl from Anger Management). She was basically there to go through the motions so that Stiffler and Finch could do hilarious battle(the best parts of the film). That said I laughed all the way through it. It's humor is sophmoric, but that didn't stop me from laughing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but they did, and it is just as entertaining as the others, plus the characters have all moved on, with the exception of one (Stiffler?) who is as obnoxious, irritating, funny and familiar as always.So, Jim's getting married and we know it won't be easy since he has a knack for disaster, but all in all, this is a great movie, just like the other two were - great for a laugh!Considering there has not been one decent blockbuster movie all summer, I would have to rate The Wedding as one of the top 5 seen recently.You should go and see it if you don't shock easily, and appreciate the type of humour found in the other movies, or in movies like Austin Powers, etc, very irreverant, very silly, quite slapstick and laugh out loud funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of the American Pie movies. I saw the firstone when it came out in 1999. I was too young at the time to see itat the theatre. Then the second one came out in 2001, at that pointI was old enough, so I went and saw it. I enjoyed both thoroughly,and laughed...well...my ass off really. Now that the thirdinstallment is released, I couldn't help but to go see it. And Iwasn't dissapointment one bit. The comedic formula used in the firsttwo, has clearly been pushed up a notch in this one. 6 charactershave been cut from the last, namely, Oz, Heather, Vicky, Jessica,Nadia, and Chuck Sherman (aka the sherminator). However, some newcharacters where introduced, and those are Michelle's parents, andMichelle's younger sexy sister, Cadence. The old gang is there,Kevin, Stifler and Finch. Stifler hasn't changed, he's the sameparty animal he always was. His relationship with Finch is still thesame. Only in this one, it gets a little more twisted. Kevin has hisregular moments, there few, but there good. In the end, the overall picture is most satisfying. I doubt therewill be a 4th installment, cause...well let's face it, the actorsare getting too old. Move on, what next? American Pie 7 Old Folks Home?But, it now stands as a trilogy, and let's hope it stays that way. A comedy rarely spawns a sequel, let alone a trilogy. I do however suggest this movie to anyone who wishes to laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting enough conclusion to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantWARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*It seems fashionable at the moment in Hollywood for filmmakers to come up with a trilogy of films. What with the likes of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Matrix movies raking in the big bucks. It comes as no surprise that screen scribe Adam Herz would want to bring most of the cast from the previous two movies in the series for this final outing. That is it should be the final in the series if Herz is wise.The story this time around focus's on the impending nuptials of Jim Levinstein(Jason Biggs)and Michelle Flaherty(Alyson Hannigan) who got together at the end of A.P.2. With the help of his friends from the last two movies, Jim tries to prepare the upcoming wedding while trying to impress his future in laws.Cue once again a series of comedic set pieces as Finch and Stifler struggle for the affections of Michelle's attractive,cultured younger sister Cadence(January Jones).Not forgetting incidents involving strippers at a bachelor party,Stifler dancing with a homosexual man at a gay night club,dog humping and dog shit to name just a few.With Jim's eccentric Dad(Eugene Levy) there to offer much needed wisdom and fatherly advice.Things couldn't get any worse.Or could they?Being the conclusive part in the American Pie trilogy, some would hope for the whole of the last two instalments cast to be involved.I personally am not that disappointed that Chris Klein,Mena Suavari,Tara Reid and Natasha Lyonne chose not to sign up for this outing.None of the above characters were really funny enough to want to be seen a third time.Suavari most of all.Herz's decision to not even offer an explanation to why these characters don't make it to the wedding at all sadly smacks of laziness on his part.No mention is given to any of Jim's so called pals at all.It's as if they had never existed.On the plus side though it is good to see the franchise's funnier, more amusing characters brought back for a third piece of pie.Jason Biggs is as endearingly and charmingly befuddled as ever as Jim while Eddie Kaye Thomas is fun as the slightly nerdy, yet cultured and charming Paul Finch.Thomas Ian Nicholas sadly though proves to be the weak link in the chain as Kevin.His performance as Kevin is decent enough but his character although mildly amusing is no where near as memorable as those others around him.This is more than made up though by Seann William Scotts once again scene stealing performance as the smarmy and obnoxious Stifler. It's Stifler who is the centre point for most of the movies most amusing moments.Where the movie is let down is in it's mediocrity.Much of the movies set pieces though amusing enough,lack inspiration and have a sense of de ja vu about them.Lets face facts. Scenes involving bachelor parties and strippers have been done so many times in other movies of this ilk.One such movie being 1984's 'Bachelor Party'. The movies earlier scenes also feel rushed as if Herz was trying to hurry proceedings along too quickly. Stifler's earlier scenes when we see him for the first time appear a little sloppy and certainly could have done with some fine tuning. That said Stifler's insincere attempts too get inside Michelle's sister Cadence's knickers early on as he turns on the sickingly sweet charm are worth a titter or two.Watching the usually in your face creep fawn over Cadence's parents is worth a look in.What also is amusing is the movies sense of irony as Cadence appears to become slightly interested in Finch when he pretends to act like Stifler.Thus winding up the big goof ball who has been really putting on the charm.An opportunity that is sadly missed though is in upping the screen time of another scene stealing character.The chance to give Jim's Dad played with lovable,eccentric charm by Eugene Levy more to do is one that is reprehensibly wasted.The scenes that we do get with Jim's old man don't quite reach the heights of merriment that we recieved in the previous movies.In the end though the movies conclusion is a bit too anti-climatic for my liking. The wedding service it self pretty much goes with out a hitch.The opportunity to allow for something to go awry during the service or the reception is unfortunately missed.Not only that but a couple of losse ends involving a couple of the characters are left up in the air and with no real closure,while the inclusion of Stiflers Mom(Jennifer Coolidge)in the movies climax feels to be gratuitous if not a little repetetive.Oh, and what happend to Sherman aka the Sherminator.It's a shame that Herz could not have included his character to the script.Maybe even up his part a little.He would have made a more entertaining character than Kevin after all.In the end American Pie: The Wedding is not a bad end to a successful movie series. It does suffer from what befalls most third movies in a franchise.Just look at Scream 3 and Lethal Weapon 3.But with good direction by Jesse Dylan,decent performances and decent enough amount of laughs this is a reasonable enough if not totally successful conclusion to a trilogy.Robs Rating: * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'American Wedding' loses alot of it's cast but it focuses on fewer characters which makes for a better movie. Jim (Jason Biggs) is getting married to band geek Michelle (Alison Hannigan). But all this means to Stifler (Seann W. Scott) is BACHOLER PARTY! Along the way we meet Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones) who melts Stifler's heart and makes him more than a one-dimensional lunk head. The gags are still here, which will bring the teen audience, but also returning is the franchises ability to tell a good story that makes you care about the characters. By now, they feel like old friends. Some people think by now, they must of run out of steam. But I hope for an American Pie 4, perhaps with Jim becoming a dad. Maybe Stifler can plan the baby showerRATING: *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen the first two American Pie movies, I found it al little hard to get into. Too many sex jokes, one right after the other, is just not my thing. It always seemed so unintentional which sets it up for the laugh.The movie doesn't really pick up in my opinion until they mix the surprise bachelor party with dinner party with Michelle's parents. It was okay up until Finch destroys the flowers because you knew he would redeem himself somehow and by making up for it. Finch having sex with the grandma was also in the previews which spoiled the whole thing.The movie went down hill in the ending with that nerd having sex with Finch's mom it just wasn't a great ending. But I'll tell you this, I'll never look at pubic hair and cake in the same light again. That goes for the chocolate truffle too.B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on the first day of release and i really enjoyed myself. I laughed so many times i ended up coughing towards the end. The script was sharp and the acting, while it wasn't Kevin Spacey quality, was decent. Sean William Scott was fantastic, you end up rooting for Stifler especially in the dance off with the gay guy in the club. The decisions to get rid of the dead wood (Chris Klein, Mena Suvari and Tara Reid) made the movie work better and the end was sweet. But one thing i have to say is, don't make a fourth movie, I would really want the end to be this series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is proof of how good sequels can be if you keep the same people in the creative process. So many sequels have been ruined because they are done by completely different people. There is a different director, but the writer is the same. The exception to this rule would be James Cameron's Aliens, but that rarely happens.Even though it's got a different attitude from the other two movies, it's still clever and fun. The big gross-out did gross me out a little too much, but was still funny. Plenty of chemistry between the two leads. It's true that a pervert and a nympho can find happiness together (just look at me and my husband).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the second one was a waste of time until I saw this one. I am now convinced that somebody is out to destroy what was once a great movie. Have these people never heard of quitting while they're ahead. American Pie was a fantastic movie. It had originality; it had a stunning cast, a funny story and a brilliant soundtrack to back it up. The direction was superb and you would never have guessed that all this came from two people who were producing their first movie. It was one of those unexpected massive hits that went down a storm. But having a movie that is successful and makes lots of money does not automatically pave the way for a sequel.American Wedding, the third installment in the American Pie series, is set around Jim and Michelle planning their dream wedding. Jim, notorious for messing things up, is trying his very best to impress Michelle's parents at the same time as planning the perfect wedding for Michelle. As per usual, things don't exactly go according to plan and Jim and his buddies end up in some very sticky situations when Stiffler decides to invite himself to the wedding and take charge of the bachelor party. Set three years on from American Pie 2, we seem to have lost a few of the usual suspects along the way. There is no Vicky, no Jessica, no Oz and no Heather. However, we still have the likes of Stiffler, Finch and Kevin to support their buddy through this challenging task. As expected, everyone pulls together and shows us a pure example of just what true friendship is all about (yes even Stiffler). The exact same message the first two American Pie films were giving us.One of the major problems in this film is the pure fact that we have already seen Jim get caught with his pants down, make love to an apple pie, have a very premature situation broadcast on the internet, get his hand stuck to his privates whilst having a video tape stuck to his other hand and that's just the beginning. How many more tricky situations can we sit and watch this boy get himself into before we start to get bored of it. The same goes for Stiffler. We have seen him drink a `pale ale' so to speak, we have seen him urinated on, so what next? Well I'll let you find out for yourself but needless to say, it was obvious something disgusting was going to come into contact with his body in one way or another.As for the cast?There's not really a lot to say. I do feel they haven't put as much effort into this one as they did the first one or even the second one. Alyson Hannigan wasn't her usual bubbly, ditzy self this time and was actually playing the part of Willow from Buffy. I guess that's what happens when you spend 7 years of your life being the same character. Jason Biggs seems to be the same as always. Eddie Kaye Thomas and Thomas Ian Nicholas don't have a lot to do as Finch and Kevin but seem to get on with it. The only actor that really stands out is of course Sean William Scott as the legendary Stiffler.There are a few parts of the movie that raised a smile but none that made me laugh. They say it is supposed to be the best out of the three but I think it's the worst. The story is dull, the script is dull, the characters are dull and well?I think it's safe to say, the film is dull. So let's just hope they have finally decided to put this one to rest now. Or are we going to see American Baby next?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't want this film to end, there can be no greater compliment.I thought it started off well, the restaraunt scene was a superb start, very quick out of the blocks. It then slowed to a crawl, with just a couple moments of acceleration. The early Stiffler stuff was forced and came off poorly. The Gay bar dance scene did nothing for me also.The scene with the dogs was excellent and after the bar scene, this movie picked up and took off. The next 40-50 minutes were laugh out loud funny, well pieced together and very touching in parts.I didn't think the missing actors were missed. Tara Ried was dull as dishwater in AP2, and Mena Suvari (sp?) and Chris Klein weren't needed.Jim pulled off his role as usual, Michelle was inconsistent but overall came off well and Jim's Dad was great as usual. Kevin took a background role, which was necessary while Finch took a more starring role and carried it off well. The casting of Michelle's sister was terrific.The decision to make Stiffler the feature role looked dodgy as hell after half an hour, but turned out ok. It almost seemed like Sean Scott-Williams took some time to get back into the role.Overall, not as good as the first 2 (but what sequels ever are?) but a very funny film and a satisfactory addition (conclusion?) to the AP family. Having watched some rubbish lately, like the abysmal Old School, where the film tries to play off shock value alone, American Pie is very refreshing. Shock Value? sure, but supported by good story telling, good acting, casting, writing, beautiful women, handsome men and loveable, funny characters.I echo the Sherminator sentiment, but I really missed Stiffler's brother.To address a comment from someone earlier. They said they hated the first 2, but watched this one anyway. If you didn't like the first 2, why would you watch this one? And why would you come online to bash a film you never intended to like?American Pie aims at a certain person. And as a 23 year old male, it was right up my street. Although my Wife is also a massive fan of the trilogy.8/10 for Me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American wedding is as much fun as i expected. all the 3 movies american pie, american pie 2 and the american wedding have the four most pleasant "boys" together playing the fun loving but normal grown up kids. It really does not matter who the girls are...Tara Reid, Shannon Elizabeth... Deborah rush as alyson hannigan's sister did a great job as a good looking chic making the boys drool all over her in front and from the back. sean William Scott as Stiffler was very good , in the flower shop behind Deborah wooing her and even on the lawn before the wedding with his mouth full of dog's poo. his expressions of disgust and then glad it was over after swallowing the poo were appropriate and made the audience want to throw up. Jason Biggs as the bridegroom was as usual calm and very nervous about life. Why does Kevin Myers, so pleasant say so...little? Eddie kaye as Paul Finch was good switching from NYU sophistication to stifler's urban argot. He did a great job of stooping to Stifler's level of uncultured upbringing and then reverting to his clean sophisticated self, realizing that there can only be ONE Stifler. Adam Herz wrote for all the 3 movies and i admire his writing. Though the Directors for all 3 movies ( jesse Dylan (american wedding), James B R (2) and Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz(for 1)in trilogy are different, they all had a similar style. Even though American wedding is the last of this trilogy, i hope these 4 grown -up boys get to work together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first American Pie was a delight. There was a lot of funny stuff in it. Some of it tasteless, but it worked within the reality of the movie. I found APII was kind of forced, but it didn't suck. I just didn't have any desire to go back to it like I did with the first. Now we have American Wedding and this one is like the old joke about the elephant having been designed by a committee of blind men or something like that. There are a few guffaws, but even for a dumb comedy, there are a lot of holes in the plot. For example, Jim and Alyson met a high school graduation party in the first movie ("there was this time in band camp..). It was already set up that she went to the same school as him, yet in this one, her parents come from out of town never having met Jim IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DATING!!!! This is one among many dumb things in this movie that just seemed forced. Even worse, there are moments of sappiness that just don't belong here. Let's hope that it's the end of the line for this half baked series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final slice of the grosse yet wonderful pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS INCLUDEDWell here we are, the final part of the American Pie trilogy and it rounds off the story with style.In this third &amp; final chapter of the lives of the highschool friends, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs) pops the question to his love Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) and the film develops as the group develops in preparation for the wedding. In a similar pattern as regular, the film moves along this route in a sickening pattern with hilarious consequences (the first moment being the proposal itself which must go down as the strangest proposal in film history).During the course of the film, Jim &amp; Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) both get themselves into tricky situations, one after another, until eventually the ending when surprise surprise, the predictable happens and we get an ending which satisfies everyone.After talking about how good this film is, it might be worth mentioning some flaws. The one key problem with this film, if you see it as a problem, is the extreme focus on Stifler. Even by usual standards, Stifler seems to take control of the film, meaning as a result that Jim's other friends Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) get pushed to the background mostly of the film and the actors don't really get to show their talents fully. This however, is only a fault if you enjoy the characters of Kevin and Finch, whilst if you prefer Stifler, it might be a good thing.Other than the flaw of certain characters getting small parts, the only other negative aspect of this film in my personal view is that certain characters are completely absent. It's understandable that Mena Suvari and Chris Klein would command fees and be absent, however the film doesn't explain at all why they are absent and simply ignores the existence of Oz alltogether. This is a mistake, however I feel this is probably to avoid confusing people who might have not seen the first two (whoever that person might be in the world).This film may not win awards for originality and for it's scripting, acting or anything else, but at times it is hilarious, at times it makes you feel close to sickness and at times you genuinely care for the characters.American Pie was the best of all this teen comedy type of film (although I do like Road Trip, it isn't in the same league), American Pie 2 was just as good, if not better, and now with American Wedding, the creators of this trilogy have chosen an amazing conclusion.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll almost vomit, but most of all, you'll love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the movies I've seen this past summer have been flops at the box office. However, American Wedding was a hilarious movie that I personally enjoyed. It has been a long time since I've seen a comedy where the audience has laughed all the way through the movie. Loser and Saving Silverman both bombed at the box office, so it's nice to see that he can still make a good movie. However, I would suggest seeing the first two American Pie movies before seeing this.  In this one Jim proposes to Michelle and Finch and Stifler fight over Cadence, Michelle's sister. As usual, the gang finds themselves in hilarious and provocative situations throughout the entire film. However Thomas Ian Nicholas' character doesn't have a big role and is mostly used as window dressing. It was a good movie and I would rate it about an 8. It was funny throughout the whole movie. I would recommend seeing the first two American Pie movies before seeing this. Some other Jason Biggs' movies that would be good to watch include Saving Silverman and Loser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Stiffler's dog crap eating scene was silly and his dancing at the bar with the gay dude was pointless, but I thought this was an entertaining movie. I mean it wasn't made to win any awards or anything, but it brings the american pie series to a fitting end. This was made up of a whole lot random events strewn together, some focused on a lot while some weren't. The pubic hair scene seemed to have been put there just coz it HAD to be there. That made it seem quite pointless and unconnected to the rest of the movie. Some of the actors who voted out of participiating in this project were noticably absent and that was a little dissappointing. Sean William Scott basically carried this movie, via plenty of over acting but some genuinely funny bits. It was entertaining but badly directed and produced and therefore unrealistic as usual.</fullReview>

Jim has yet to meet Michelle's parents, and their meeting is very funny. Now what would an American Pie movie be without the Stifmeister? It wouldn't be nearly as funny! So of course Stifler is back (in his biggest role of the series) and thinks of only one thing...the bachelor party! Many mix-ups and gags ensue, making it the funniest of the three. Now I had one problem. The jokes are now even more gross-out and sometimes those jokes can bomb (notably the "chocolate truffle"). The movie is very funny, and a great way to end the series.PS: I actually hope there wont be AP4, so they (the series) could end on a fresh note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it really over?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty darn funny throughout most of it, but I really have to say that Stifler out-shone the rest of the characters, comedically. Kevin was really there as more of a supporting actor, but Finch had some good lines. I'd put this one a tiny bit above the first, but below the second. In the first, it was a bit more forced, but in the second, everything just came together so well. 8/10 for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is funny! Go and see American Wedding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to see American Pie:The Wedding at an advance showing on Sunday evening. It's taken me a few days to gather my thoughts and here we are. The third installment of the Pie series opens with Jim trying to propose to Michelle in a restaurant. As we know things never go smoothly for Jim and in no time Michelle has got the wrong end of the stick and she's under the table pleasuring him. More mayhem ensures when Jim's Dad turns up with the forgotten engagement ring. Cue more mayhem and the titles and we're on the road to American Wedding. Things have moved on a bit since we last saw the gang in American Pie 2. All have graduated from college and we're now watching them grow into young adults. Jim has remained friends with Kevin and Finch during his three years of being with Michelle and Stifler is still around being his usual pain in the arse. But gone are Oz(Chris Klein), Nadia(Shannon Elizabeth), Vicky(Tara Reid), Jessica(Natasha Lyonne) and Heather(Mena Suvari). It seems they have just drifted away without explanation because even Oz supposedly one of Jim's best friends is absent without reason. In fact only Nadia is mentioned during the entire movie and even then it's not explained where she is these days. Despite the missing characters the film moves on and you find yourself forgetting who they were. Because there are less characters to focus on it made it easier for a funnier script involving several major characters as opposed to trying to fit everyone in to the action. And this film is funny! I had my doubts about it but in some respects there are as many laughs as the previous two flicks if not more. The audience in the cinema was in stitches on several occasions. It is constant gag after gag for the first part of the film. There are some hilarious altercations between Stifler and Finch. I won't give too much away but look out for an interesting role reversal between Stifler and Finch as they compete for the affections of Michelle's hot younger sister Cadence and Stifler in a brilliant dance off competition in a gay bar. We're introduced to Cadence as she flies in for her big sister's imminent wedding and we also get to meet new characters such as Michelle's parents Harold and Mary Flaherty(Fred Willard and Deborah Rush) and an interesting character called Bear played by the brilliant Eric Allan Kramer. There is also new female eye candy for the guys at the bachelor party. Stifler and Bear arrange for two very interesting strippers called Officer Krystal and Fraulein Brandi to entertain the boys. Both cause mayhem when Jim returns home unexpectedly with his future in laws. For once though Jim is not the only main star of the show, in fact he actually takes a step back in this one and Stifler is the centre of most of the laughs. Seann W. Scott is excellent at playing Stifler, it seems to come so easy to him but at times in this movie it seemed he was a bit over the top, and that he had to swear constantly to make people laugh. He still manages to get into all kind of mishaps even almost ruining Jim and Michelle's wedding but redeems himself somehow. Despite rumours that only Stifler and Cadence would feature heavily on screen this is not true, Jim and Michelle feature constantly and Finch has a larger role than expected. It's the character of Kevin that seems to have been drastically down sized. Although he is featured in the background of various scenes he has hardly any lines in this movie, and you tend to forget he is even there. Thomas Ian Nicholas was chuffed to be in the third Pie installment but he must have been disappointed with the way his role was reduced. His new girlfriend who he mentions and we get to see very briefly sitting at the wedding table also had her scenes edited out. I guess the producers are saving some deleted scenes for the dvd expected at the end of the year. Well I know they must be because the returning Lacrosse and Football coach from the first American Pie(played by Lawrence Pressman) also appears without any lines. The film also has it's tender moments with a touching scene between Jim's Dad and Michelle, and Stifler finally realising the error of his ways. Although the film has near enough the same running times as it's predecessors it seems we get to the wedding too quickly, whether this is because I enjoyed the film too much or because I knew how much footage was missing I'm not sure. I'll go with the former because although half the original cast was absent and it was a second sequel, it still stands up as a decent comedy in it's own right. There will be calls for American Pie 4(a la American Baby or American Honeymoon) but I think they should leave it here. Adam Herz has pulled off a third movie without half of it's so called stars and turned in a really funny script and the ending to the movie is possibly the best way of wrapping the series up. At the end of Pie 2 I doubted how they could possibly do a third and I feel that way again now. As big a Pie fan as I am and as much as I want to see the story go on, it's a good way to go out on. Go and see American Wedding and enjoy these characters one more time you are guaranteed a good laugh. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was another trilogy that remarkably kept up the quality level throughout all 3. It seems that the producers have done something hard to do...matured with their audience. Each movie has a more mature feeling than the last. First one, very gross (but funny gross), identifying with high school, and such and such. Second one, the more mature theme of dealing with separate paths during/after college. And now, the third one, ready to face the real world. Very well done indeed. And after watching the second one, it's quite clear that half the cast is missing because they were superfluous, meaning they were useless (although a Finch/Jessica story could have been interesting). All in all, this is one trilogy not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FUNNY movie that could have been a GREAT movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, it had a lot of potential.The movie showcased its best character...Steve Stifler. It had one of life's most emotional moments...A Wedding. It already had characters we knew and loved...we had emotional attachment. It had some absolutely hilarious scenes.This could have been something special. Don't get me wrong - it was a funny, entertaining movie. I could not hear lines of dialogue because the theater was laughing so loud.But it ends up feeling a bit emotionally empty. It's just too bad.The difference between a classic and a very good film is so fine. The original had "laugh-out-loud" scenes, and it still had emotion and a human element. The second American Pie was not as funny as the first, but still had a heart and was entertaining.I blame the director. His father was a legendary Rocker, but Jesse Dylan as a director needs work. The elements are all there, but Dylan does a poor job in bringing everything together. First off, he shoots the film too close to the character's faces and the movie is dimly lit. It feels claustrophobic and dark. The brightness of the original films is gone, instead we are really in tight with the characters. This is not the most attractive cast and the constant close ups reflects this. In some instances it becomes quite annoying.Secondly, the idle conversation of the original movies is lacking. The pacing is poor and it seems to be racing to the next "big" scene. Part of the greatness of the first two films is when nothing happened. Whether it was the fast-food place in the original, or the "on-the-job" conversations of the second one, it was this dialogue that did an excellent job keeping the film grounded and us, as an audience, caring.So by the end of this movie, when the emotions of a wedding could be overflowing, you just don't have that feeling that something special is happening. It could have had the emotion of a "Father of the Bride" - where slapstick humor abounds, but in the end the wedding is still the centerpiece.What this also does is take characters like Kevin, and even to a lesser extent Michelle, and make them complete non-factors. Kevin was the glue of the group in the first two films, and now he has virtually nothing to say or do.And the fact that there is no mention made of the old friends, particularly Oz, is disappointing. Sure, their characters became less of a focus in the last film - but Oz was a key cog in their group. His absence must be addressed. Whether it is a comment like - "Hey what is Oz doing?" or "Is Oz going to be able to make it?" It could have been addressed in a scene with invites going out. But we had nothing.Despite the deficiencies of its Director, American Wedding is still one hell of a funny movie. Criticism aside, the humor here is spectacular. American Wedding may be the funniest film of the three for sheer number of laughs. But that fact alone does not make it the best of the trilogy. American Pie 2, despite not being as funny, was a better overall movie.The American Pie films may go down as the best comic trilogy in recent history. What other comedy went three movies into its run and still is as funny as this American Wedding is? I can not think of another.And that, is something to be proud of.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of the other two movies in this trilogy, I place American Wedding a solid second. While nowhere near as hilarious and fresh as American Pie was (is), it's quite an improvement over the disappointing American Pie II.The movie has plenty of funny moments, and a couple downright hurt-yourself-laughing ones as well. The botched bachelor-party scene is classic, and I was left wishing that it lasted longer. And similar to the first couple of movies in the trilogy, Eugene Levy's character steals all of the scenes that he's in.On a negative note, the acting of Sean William-Scott (Stiffler) seemed very forced and his character had virtually none of the charm that he had in the original American Pie - in fact, he almost seemed like he was playing a caricature of his original role. My other major complaint would be that the movie, at times, seems more like a string of gags than it does a cohesive story and it lost a lot of its believability and charm in the process. It's also a shame that some key members of the original cast like Chris Klein, Mena Suvari &amp; Tara Reid did not make an appearance.All in all, I enjoyed American Wedding but it could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be as blunt as the Stiffmeister: this film sucks! Attempting to bask in the glory of its first two instalments- American Wedding shows itself wanting in almost every single department. Keeping the tone going, this film is so obviously a cash cow attempting to re-create the financial success of the previous films, albeit by simply extending each character's idiosyncrasies and running jokes over enough time to classify it as a movie. Not even the cast who have returned for the third helping seem all the enthused, particularly noting that Sean William-Scott, now famous for the role of Stiffler seems content to turn the character into a caricature of itself reducing the comedy cult icon to ? basically? unfunny!But let me stay my hand for just a second, there were some surprises and a few very funny moments. But even then, the funniest of all the jokes and gags in the film seemed to receive the smallest screen time. The characters of Stiffler and Finch swap roles in the film over a girl, a sub-plot in itself that would of out-done the real plot as a single film? Instead it receives approximately 3 minutes of film and disappears into the convoluted mess.Definitely leave this to a Saturday night video rental; maybe after a few drinks the movie may seem funnier? Perhaps that reflects the state of mind of those involved in producing this recap of what was originally some really funny stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of the first movie, and a pretty big fan of the second. I didn't go into the movie expecting anything more than a nice piece of slap stick comedy, and that's about what I got. I was kinda ticked that they didn't even explain why Oz(Chris Klein), Vicky(Tara Reid), or Heather(Mena Suvari) were not in the movie. As much as I hated Sherman, I would have liked to see him in it just so we could also enjoy Nadia some more. Many plot lines of the movie were sped through and they didn't really develop a lot of the story, which is ok considering this isn't supposed to be some great piece of cinematography. The jokes were quite hilarious, a couple parts were just disgusting, Michelle(Alysson Hannigan) was pretty funny, and Stifler just acted like a complete and utter moron. It's rather different in several ways from the first two movies, but still should be enjoyable for any fans of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!The original "American Pie" (1999) was exceptionally funny. "American Pie 2" was so-so. But the final film in this trilogy sucks donkeys.Nothing in the movie made me laugh near as hard as the first one did. Also, the part where Stifler eats doggie doo, and has it stuck on his teeth, was really gross.And you have to wonder why Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia), Tara Reid (Vicky), and Oz (Chris Klein) weren't in this movie. I wish they hadn't made any sequels, because neither of them were worthy enough to be made. Plus, I find it hard to believe that Jason Biggs (Jim) would have chosen Michelle,the band geek (Alyson Hannigan) over Nadia.The only bright spot was when the gay guy, Bear, brought two naughty girls for the bachelor party, and they did a nude scene. But that one little moment wasn't near enough to carry the film.Strangely enough, "American Wedding" was written by Adam Herz, who also wrote the first "American Pie". But he fell way short of hitting the mark this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original pie is a classic portrayal of adolescence. It was funny, moving, and inspiring. The friends and friendship everyone would want. They even nailed it again, better the second time w/ ap2.. Coming back from college missing something and finding it once again.well done on the sequel. But if ur going to make a third to wind up a great duo, at least make it mean something and have at least sum bearing to the epic of pie f***ing and glue-jacking?! Don't get me wrong I was laughing my ass off when finch goes `well I did f**k your mom' But cmon seriously how can u make two great movies and then ditch half the cast, and turn one of the best characters.stifler, into a joke? He was totally unbelievable and strayed so far from his character, disappointing for Sean W. Scott. And Thomas Ian Nichols? Did he have any lines? Oh yeah the attempt at a `next step' toast was amusing but a mockery of everything those first two movies stood for, life and change. A funny film sacrificed into a teen movie to make sum $$. It had some good laughs but no story in between and absolutely no character development much less character expression. The director should have paid more attention to the first two movies before attempting to do them justice. An amusing flick but a thorough disappointment for the American pie legacy lacking heart and fun.personal suggestion.forget u guys made this mockery and go right for American pie 3.and please give Tara Reid, Chris Klein, Mena Suvare, and Shannon Elizabeth a call too.or just stop butchering two good movies. thanx</fullReview>

American Wedding has it, in spades. it goes from crude humor to sappy romance to great sight gags. I only have one question- why did it take Finch so long to get this funny? he came off as a slightly annoying character in the first 2. but his scenes with Stifler are the best in the movie, to this humble critic."Grandma F***er" "Yeah? Well you're a Mother F***er" "...Yes I Am, Yes I Am"great stuff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Slice Of Pie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding, has to be the best of the 3 movies, they had a very good story and told it well, all characters were played brilliantly, Stiffler especially, many people have said that he was more meaner in American Wedding to the other 2 movies but I think it worked because you could see in the film that the boys didn't like him and this would of made him a little angrier which would make anybody act angrier and more obnoxious. American Wedding for me is a movie to go and see straight away, you will leave the theatre feeling completely different, the film gets to you and makes you want to propose marriage to your girl friend right there in the theatre. Also another thing about the movie it doesn't have any of the boring characters in it like `Oz, Heather, Vicky,' so the story moves a lot faster unlike American Pie 2 where you were moving around the unimportant characters like a carrousel. I would love to think there would be a fourth but the story has ended unfortunately and it ended too excellently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Wedding is a shallow, comic book look at a group of individuals with a serious case of arrested development. So what! We've grown to love them for their enduring, truly human frailties. If the scene between the bride and the father of the groom just prior to the ceremony didn't evoke a warm and fuzzy, you just haven't gotten to know the family well enough. To get the most "laughter medicine" from Wedding, you must accept these clowns for what they represent; the misbehaving but well intentioned child inside all of us. Since most of us simply cannot let this aspect of our psyche emerge in real life, laughing at the foibles of imaginary characters without judgment has got to be good for the soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of "whack" with the first two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I really enjoyed the first two American Pie movies. Especially the second which I own on DVD. But American Wedding just can't compare to the first two for many reasons.Why the movie was called American Wedding is beyond me - the movie is very rarely about the wedding itself. Stifler (or Stifler/Finch conflicts) take up most of the movie. And Stifler isn't even the same character. In the first two he seemed to be the stereotypical asshole guy friend. The person that the main characters are only friends with to get something from. And it worked. In American Wedding, Stifler's IQ level seems to have dropped significantly and he's a loser high school football coach. I was going to argue that the guy did get into college, deeming him at least marginally intelligent...and why didn't he get a better job? You could argue that maybe he failed out or dropped out of school. This would be a reasonable argument except that the movie never explains this. Logically, Stifler would never be in this movie in the first place as he was really only ever friends with Oz (therefore allowing him to tag along for hilarious crudity, etc.). But Chris Klein (Oz) didn't return for this movie - providing no reason for Stifler's character besides the fact that the movie makers needed the character for his antics - which were poorly written anyway.Michelle also seems out of character. While there is no denying that she has been a sexually open character, we do get to see a caring side in the earlier movies. She doesn't embarrass Jim about his "episode" with Nadia while everyone else in the school does (in AP1), and she teaches Jim how to please a woman in AP2. In American Wedding, we see only two sides - worry (about the wedding) and pure horniness. While we do see love for her from Jim, you never see any evidence that she loves Jim.What made the first two movies so funny were the sexual "complications" so to say. This movie has plenty of crude humor just like the first two. But in AP1 and AP2, the sex jokes played off of the fact that the boys (or just Jim in some cases) were insecure in their sexuality. By this time in their lives, that has passed - especially since Jim is marrying Michelle. This time around the jokes are played purely for laughs (which they do get) with little or no connection to the actual plot. And the MILF guys are back. Why? We've never seen them interacting with any of the main characters except Stifler (with the exception of a minute during AP2 when they talk to Finch). Jim and Michelle don't even want Stifler at their wedding, why these guys? Because the film makers wanted to be able to say, "See! It's the MILF guys! Just like the first two movies!"Jason Biggs and Thomas Ian Nicholas do perfectly fine as Jim and Kevin. No complaints there, besides their lack of screen time. Jim's dad is always hilarious due to the awesome performances by Eugene Levy - the man can do no wrong with this role (and besides, he rarely sticks to script). But the best parts are the ones between Finch and Stifler. American Pie (1) was Eddie Kaye Thomas' first movie role ever and he has perfected the role of Finch. Great facial expressions and great line delivery - especially when he remarks to Stifler that Stifler is a grandmotherf****er, Stifler contends that Finch is a motherf***er and Finch replies, "Yes, I am!"Not a horrible movie at all, but it really doesn't live up to the first two. By all means see it if you're a big fan of the series (that's why I did), but if you're not, you might as well wait for video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to see this movie because I crave conclusion. Going into the theater I was filled with negative thoughts; but that gripping need for conclusion had me pinned. When the second film came out I was not nearly as concerned over its quality since all the original cast had agreed to return. This time however I was worried. When the Universal logo appeared I began to panic a bit, I genuinely believed I was in for a horrible experience. Stifler who was of course my favorite character from the first two movies was a bit over done at first. However as things got rolling I began to laugh and laugh.All in all the movie had its low points, probably more low points than the first two; but it was definitely a positive experience over all. The biggest negative factor of this movie though is its lack of replay value. I find many of the mainstream American comedies that have been released since Something About Mary have had this lacking and I cannot see watching American Wedding again and laughing as much. However for my movie ticket's price I definitely think it was worth it.Its also really interesting how many of Eugene Levy's Waiting For Guffman mockumentary friends appeared. I have to wonder if he had some behind the scenes responsibility for this movie actually being good. This film is definitely truer to the first American Pie than the second and its very interesting to see how they one up the same old jokes. Unlike the third Austin Powers movie, American Wedding actually one ups its jokes at a level that makes them relatively new.All in all I recommend this movie to anyone that liked the previous American Pie films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating... like a train wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm too old (41) but I've never been a huge fan of the American Pie series. Admittedly, there were plenty of yucks for the dollar, but the mediocre acting and lack of convincing camaraderie among the main characters always left me wondering, what if? So when the early buzz on American Wedding sounded too good to be true, I was quite skeptical.But after watching American Wedding last night with two other couples, I think I've been sucked into vortex of vulgarity. Why the turnaround? It surely isn't the acting. Many of the prime players from the first two efforts sat this one out. Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, and Thomas Ian Nicholas have clearly outgrown whatever adolescent appeal they had back in 1999. Fred Willard simply reprises his reluctant Father-in-Law-to-be role from "Everybody Loves Raymond." Even the wonderful Eugene Levy isn't given as much material to work with here as in the prior two installments. So that leaves us with the ever-annoying Seann William Scott. Yes, I hate to admit, but he carries the show. His grossfest is so over the top this time it really worked for me. Eddie Kaye Thomas' counterpoint as Finch only heightens, or maybe I should say "lowers" Stifler's appalling appeal.Most of set pieces are brilliantly executed as well: The gay dance sequence, dog humping, bachelor party, and granny in the closet to name a few. Heck, I was so overcome with crudity even the Pomeranian Poo Feast nearly had me in tears. I don't know if director Jesse Dylan took any pointers from his famous songwriting father, but he handled the timing of these scenes quite well for a newcomer.As a fan of "The Price Is Right", it was also nice to see ALL of former Barker Beauty Nikki Zierling. I'm not sure how much gross grist is left in the American Pie comedy mill, but if "American Divorce" or something similar opens in two years, I'll see you in line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still funny as ever, but where was everyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding was just as funny as its two predecessors, but it seems to have an even lower-budget feel to it. There were some passing references to occurrences in the previous films, but where were Oz (Chris Klein), Heather (Mena Suvari), Vicky (Tara Reid), and Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth)? Couldn't the producers afford their salaries since the "PIE" franchise made them stars? At least there was a conversational reference to Nadia. The other characters weren't even mentioned. The debate will rage for ... the rest of the summer ... (?): "Too much Stiffler? Not enough Stiffler? Just enough Stiffler?" Seann William Scott is the next Jim Carrey but don't burn us out on him by overexposure here. I can't wait to see his next film co-starring "THE ROCK". By the way, "Bear" the gay dancer, was NOT The Skipper from Gilligan's Island. He was "The Mighty Thor" from Marvel Comic's "Incredible Hulk" (Bill Bixby) reunion TV-movies of the 1990's.</fullReview>

And enough of the Stiffmister, he was great in the first two movies but way over the top and unbelieveable in this one.

		<fullReview>Same childish comedy as the first one. (I skipped on the 2nd.) I went with friends who are fans of the franchise and they loved it. While I generally prefer drier, more sophisitcated humor, I did find parts of this movie to be quite funny. Eugene Levy &amp; Fred Willard are are so subtle in their delivery that they add a bit of comic substance to the flick.As many have (and will) point out, the gay bar scene was very entertaining. Some of the other formulaic crap, however, felt like it belonged in "Threes Company: To Hot for TV". Yawn.If you're on the fence, wait until it's out on video. If you're a fan of this kind of humor (Am. Pie, Van Wilder, etc.)... go nuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third film in the "American Pie" series, this one has lost half the cast, and focuses on the preparations for the wedding of the characters played by Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan. I loved the first film and was somewhat disapointed by the second.. With lowered expectations this time around, I found the film to be somewhat entertaining with a few really funny jokes that will make you laugh out loud... Sure many of the other jokes fall flat and the cast is mostly going thru the motions, with the exception of Seann William Scott as Stifler who gets all the best lines and makes the most of it. For fans of the series, this is a fine conclusion of the series, for others.. maybe it wont work as well. GRADE: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment of the American Pie series American Wedding continue's the story of the group of high school friends and their journey into young adulthood. I saw this movie the first day it came out and I realized that there were some things I liked about it and some things I did not. I always thought the Pie 2 surpassed the quality of the oringinal, the story was priceless, the jokes were very funny and the message that the sequel delivered was very good...Not to mention the excellent soundtrack. American Wedding kind of takes the step foward, I must say that I found it funny and I thought the story was entertaining but it was missing a few things. The movie makers think that they could make 2 excellent movies, and when the 3rd installement comes around and not all the cast members return, not a word is mentioned about them in the movie...There was one or two vague references towards the characters that didn't return for a second sequel, Another weak spot was that Thomas Ian Nicholas had basically no role...He had very few lines in this movie and he did nothing to contribute to the story...I did enjoy the conflict between Finch and Stifler...I thought it was very amusing, I also thought Jason Biggs came back with just a good of a role as the two previous films...However, the character treated Stifler as an outsider...There was actual talk about him not attending this wedding which i thought was slightly inappropriate. The movie had a decent ending and the soundtrack was very good as well When it gets right down to it, I would say that American Wedding was better than the original American Pie but it does not surpass American Pie 2. After seeing this movie, I would hope that one more sequel would be made, perhaps further down the road...Where the characters could meet up and see where everyone stands at a different age in life perhaps in their thirties...Something of this sort may happen or it may not, Either way it has been an awesome series and I'm looking foward to seeing the DVD and all the extras that are included on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American Pie gang is back, well not the whole gang since most of the girls from the past two movies are missing. Anyways, Jim(Jason Biggs) and Michelle(Alyson Hannigan) are getting married and everybody knows that it's going to turn into a big ruckus when Stifler(Sean William Scott)arrives. Stifler is determined to sleep with Michelle's younger sister Cadence(January Jones) while acting like the perfect guy in front of her parents but still showing his real face to his friends and to the people that know what a jerk he is. This was a very crazy, disgusting and very funny comedy. It's just what American Pie fans should expect and love. The only problem that I had with this movie is that the whole story focused way to much on Stifler, it's supposed to be about this wedding but really, it's all about the Stif-meister! But anyways, I did enjoy this movie and Sean William Scott and Eddie Kaye Thomas who played Finch gave a hilarious performance. I would give American Wedding 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that Chris Klein, Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Mena Survai and Natasha Lyonne were not going to be in AMERICAN PIE 3, I was shocked. These were all such key characters in the first two films it was hard to imagine how the final film would be made without them. Plus, I also had the "3" rule to worry about. Very few films have a good third movie, with the exception of RETURN OF THE JEDI, CHASING AMY, TERMINATOR 3, ROCKY 3 and AUSTIN POWERS: GOLDMEMBER. Surprisingly enough, it was done and it was done pretty well. The movie does not give us an explanation where they are, but it really doesn't matter. AMERICAN WEDDING takes place three years after AMERICAN PIE 2. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) have just graduated from college and have gotten engaged. As you know, the film deals with the events leading up to the wedding. Some of your favorite classic characters from the original movies are back--Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and of course, Steve Stiffler in his finest hour. The fact that the characters I mentioned in the first paragraph are not in the movie does not put any sort of damper on the movie. I really feel there were no room for those characters. Even Kevin has a minor role in this one. Not a lot of rehashed jokes here. The opening sequence, as in the previous films, will have you laughing your tail off. There are a lot of fresh, funny jokes in this one that go beyond the previews. I won't spoil it, but go see the movie. You will NOT be disappointed. Overall, I liked the way they ended the trilogy. Throw in Michelle's little sister, Charisma (January Jones), another great performance by Eugene Levy as Jim's dad, the MILF guys, two hot strippers and a VERY funny dance sequence by Stiffler, this is an exceptional third movie. The fact that this film was original and didn't have to rely on rehashed jokes made it so great. The funniest movie of the year.</fullReview>

Like i said it is very funny however it is dissapointing that there is not even a mention of past charectors like oz and vicky it's like they disappeared off the face of the earth that is a bad job by the director they should have in the very least been givin an excuse as to why the didnt show up . on a scale of 1 to 5 i would give this one a 3 and hope that there is no american baby</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts out with, of course, Jim(Jason Biggs) proposing to Michelle(Alyson Hannigan), and her accepting, which gives the name of the film. From there on, the movie keeps the sick-out and gross jokes from the pervious two films(thought I felt the second one really lacked what the first film gave us), this one finishes off the series with pride. It contains all the jokes that make you laugh-out-loud and hold your stomach and cringe as well. It has the great preformances from all the returning cast, including Stifler(Seann Williams Scott), Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Jim's Dad(Eugene Levy), which give their series a great send off. New editions to the cast are Cadence(January Jones), Michelles sisters, and Michelles parents(Fred Willard and Deborah Rush), which add their own flavor to this series. This film is just a great addition and great finale to the popular series which has made us laugh on many occasions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sincerely had my doubts when stepping into the theater last night to watch 'American Wedding.' A third 'American Pie' movie seemed like a stretch, and with almost half of the cast missing, I wondered where they would take the story. Needless to say, within the first 10 minutes, my worries were cast aside. Plain and simple, this movie is hilarious. My ribs hurt walking out of the theater. Sean William Scott owns this movie. He steals every scene he is in and most of the humor revolves around his character. Perhaps this movie would have been more aptly named 'American Stifler.' Thomas Ian Nicholas' character (Kevin) seems to be the only actor to not serve a purpose in this movie (baring many resemblances to his role in 'Halloween: Resurrection.') It's a shame that he is always wasted and never has anything interesting written in for him. Aside from Alyson Hannigan, all the previous ladies are missing, which definitely hurt for me. But then again, it was easier to laugh when I wasn't being bombarded with eye candy (but then again, there's some of that in here too). There are plenty of memorable moments and lines ("hang out with my ____ out!") that this will definitely go down as a comedy classic in my book. As the third film in the series, this one stands well. If you liked the first two, you will love this one. Give it it's fair chance.8/10</fullReview>

I thought that the story was good although I expected more at the bachelor party and where Chris Ostreicher was. I also thought Cadence was a good addition and if they continue and make one more that they can have Jim and Michelle have a family and jobs and have Jim's dad show how to be a good parent. Just a thought! The DVD will hopefully have some good extras and I look forward to seeing it again in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****10/10***** The movie isn't everyone's idea of what a comedy should be, a little gross or crude for some. American Pie did for the 2000's what Porky's did for the 80's, except even better! If you don't mind that sort of comedy, this is one of, if not the best. Bottom line, they tried to make a certain movie, and hit it exactly on the mark. My, only two negative comments, 1) watching the first few minutes of the movie, with the exception of Jason Biggs, no one else seemed like they wanted to be in the movie. We see a VERY p888ed of f Seann William Scott. Maybe some people will notice a feeling of negativity in the actors, maybe it's just my imagination. Anyhow this quickly gives way to a masterpiece of comedy and filmmaking. Second, it didn't have the fellowship of the previous movies, with an uneven focus on Stifler and Jim, and nearly nothing for Kevin. A must see for anyone wanting pure entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>did i see the same movie you all did?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first 10 minutes of this movie came and went, my fears had indeed come to fruition: this sequel didn't have a prayer. You just knew that the opening scene would be a riot (you could argue that the original Pie's opening was one of the best in recent comedic film history), so I, of course, was pleased by Michelle's nympho antics and Jim's father's on point delivery of his dry humor. Then, a body double who looked a whole lot like Seann William Scott came in and played the role of Stifler.They could've casted someone else and maybe he could remember how to play Steven Stifler. Stifler degenerated into a Ritalin-binged, two-brain cells remaining shell of his former self. Did new director Jesse Dylan even see the first two Pie's for God's sake? Stifler's jokes were forced, delivered poorly, and suffered from a far inferior comedic script. I never thought I'd miss Oz from the third installment, but the presence of Stifler's lacrosse buddy was sorely missed on my part because there weren't many other redeeming qualities to this swill of a performance. Furthermore, Kevin was a mere afterthought, Finch's intellectual additives were unimpressive, and the new Stifler was distracting and gut-wrenching to watch. In the first two Pie's, it was Stifler's original, almost witty one-liners and the things that happened "to" him (semen cup and urine drenching), that made him the comedic stud he was. The old Stifler wouldn't care if gay guys were attracted to him, he'd rather avoid them and be on his heterosexual way. The old Stifler would've thrown together a much more highly attended bachelor party than the pathetic 3 in attendance. The old Stifler would've toned down the ADD and not cared about being the center of attention at someone else's wedding. My feeling is that the filmmakers decided to make Stifler the center-piece of this movie and let him steal the show. We all know Stifler has been the funniest cast member in the Pie movies, but did we not laugh for Jim's dad's dry humor, Jim's foolish antics, Michelle's closet-freaky sex drive, Kevin's one-liners, Finch's idiosyncracies, and the Shermanator's ignorance in the first two? I know I did and that's what made the first two great. Everyone made you laugh, especially Stifler. By removing Jessica, Heather, Nadia, and Vicky, one key ingredient was missing: the abundant eye candy. By removing Oz, Sherman, and (essentially) Kevin from the equation, you lack the ability for many male audience members to identify with the characters and enjoy what they contribute to the total package. The filmmakers prided themselves on making a comedy that had realistic humor with believable characters and believable high school drama. It's clear that they were out to make a quick buck with this one, please the cult masses by over-exposing Stifler, and call it a day.A more logical approach could have been for Oz and Heather to get married, throw a bigger, more blockbuster bachelor party, return all the original cast members, and have Michelle catch the bouquet and open the door for a fourth one if they felt so inclined.All in all, I wish they would take a mulligan on this one. I wish they would do it over again and make a film worthy of having the title American Pie 3 (as it seems that this one clearly was not worthy of being tagged American "Pie").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie offered more laughs than it's predecessors combined. Anyone who says that they went too far to get laughs is an idiot. The whole point of these movies is to tweak your sick streak, and in a society full of toilet worthy entertainment (reality tv) it's nice to see someone knows where the sick streak really is, and it's in humor, and always will be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I have seen em all in theaters, and was not disappointed by any of them. This one was as good as the other 2 and was just as funny as them as well. Stifler was as great as ever and as sick as ever too, but this movie was totally him, and if you want to see it for just him you will be very entertained because I sure was. Finch was equally hilarious with his duels with Stifler, Kevin really wasn't anything to the movie, then again he really wasn't much to begin with, he just had a hot girlfriend (Tara I miss you!!) All the scenarios and running gags are all there. Jim's character seems a bit more mature and really wants to please his bride to be Michelle, which I thought was cute. In the end they both look very happy together and it ends with a great cap. At the end...keep your eyes opening for something special :)My last few summers have been greater thanks to this trilogy, thank you so much. American love, from a Canadian fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geeks Win in American Wedding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wonderful way to end a trilogy with the marriage of the two geeks from American Pie. The stars of this third installment are Jim (Jason Biggs) and Stiffler (Seann William Scott). Everyone else here is pretty much cameo. January Jones gets more screen time than the rest of the original cast. But that's OK. We have no Nadia, or any of the girls from the other movies except Alyson Hannigan. And that's really the only negative here, but this story is about moving on. Jim and his friends have completed college, so now its taking that next step (cheers Thomas Ian Nichols). Alyson Hannigan is so amazingly sweet and cute and when she did get to speak (towards the end), you just wished they gave her more lines like the ones she had in a conversation with Eugene Levy. Seann Williams Scott steals about every scene he is in and pretty much steals the movie. Eugene Levy is still his marvelous understated self as Jim's Dad and the man just gets funnier in the more films he appears in. All in all the movie is a sweet story. Biggs is still his goofy vulnerable self, Hannigan wins, Scott is the great comic relief and the rest of the cast fits in nicely. Bravo to the writers and directors of American Wedding and the American Pie series. Thanks for inviting us along for the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say at the end of American Wedding, I was sad, sad to see these people I have loved through three movies go, I was sad for them to grow up, I was sad that we all have to grow up. Now to the movie. American Wedding was better than the first one but not as good as the second. Half of the cast of the first two movies is not in this movie but that is not a bad thing, as this movie centers on the stars Jim, Michelle and Stifler, as it should. American Wedding is everything the first two movies are, it is gross, juvenile and after all is said and done, sweet. American Wedding is one of the top 10 best comedies of all time.watch out for Grandma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of American Wedding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again. The summer season always starts off so promising with such big event films as this year's X2: X-Men United, The Matrix Reloaded, and Finding Nemo bringing in the masses for some solid entertainment. But as the season goes on, more and more films are released that don't seem to quite live up to the films the summer started off with. And finally as we arrive to the final month of summer fun, the studios seem to repeat their ploy for the summer in this one month. After the surprising success of The Sixth Sense in August 1999 as well as the success of films like Signs and xXx in the same time period three years later, the studios have began to stand up and take notice that the last month of the summer doesn't have to be entirely disastrous. With the right story as well as a decent marketing campaign, a studio can still open a film big in the first two weeks of the month while dumping any low budget trash in the closing weeks of the summer. Since there seems to be no Shyamalan film in sight this year, Universal is willing to fill up the slot with the third, and possibly final, installment of their successful American Pie series. After the surprising success of the original in 1999, the box office saw the rebirth of the teen sex comedy genre though few films following in the foot steps of the American Pie film failed to match up. After a successful sequel in 2001, the cast comes together one more time to serve up a slice of pie to the movie-going public. But in a time when sequels have underperformed at the box office, will American Wedding be able to break the curse or will there be nothing but wedding time blues?The story centers around the marriage of Jim and Michelle as the rest of the American Pie clan clamors to get ready for the big day. The sexual confused group of kids from East Great Falls High has finally grown up and two of them are readying to take the big step into matrimony but there seems to be problems around every corner. Jim, who has subjected himself to a huge amount of public humiliation, has enough trouble trying to please Michelle's parents but soon realizes he has another problem: He can't dance. While Jim tries to figure out how to dance, his friends, Kevin and Finch, try to control Stifler, who seems to have plans of his own for the big day. Not only is he excited to through a bachelor party for Jim, with strippers of course, but eyes Michelle's younger sister, Cadence, who just happens to be a virgin. Like the previous American Pie films, things just seem to go from bad to worse as the day draws closer. The story for American Wedding seems to take itself seriously more then the previous efforts which works wonderfully. Even with that said, the film does seem to offer plenty of gross out humor that continues to surprising even the hardcore American Pie fans. Some of the gross out humor, as funny as it is, is a little too much especially one or more scenes involving Stifler, which the film seems to focus on more then in previous ventures.Though several cast members of the original two films don't make appearances in this film, the remaining cast works well enough together that you barely notice the changes. Jason Biggs, who has subjected himself to public humiliation involving a pie as well as superglue, continues his hilarious antics in the third installment in the series that made him famous, in more ways then one. Biggs should have a real promising comedy career seeing that he is willing to do anything for a film including making himself look like a weirdo especially in scenes that showing off his rear end. Alyson Hannigan, who returns as Michelle, isn't given as much screen time as she should have had but when she is featured; she gives the film its heart which greatly needed outside of the gross humor. Sean William Scott, who returns as the eccentric Stifler, seems to subject himself to as much humiliation as Jason Biggs including a scene to that is so disgusting and so funny that you won't believe it even when you do see it. Though the character of Stifler seems to be focused on more then in the previous films, he isn't focused on too much that film distracts the audience from the real story. The real highlight of every American Pie film has to be Eugene Levy, who returns as Jim's father. Levy, who was the only real funny character in the comedy Bringing Down the House earlier this year, is absolutely hilarious as usual and will hopefully have a long and fruitful comedy career outside of this franchise should this be the last film. The only part of the cast that didn't seem to work well was Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin. He doesn't really do much for the film and, in fact, doesn't really even say much through the course of the two hour feature. Why was he included while other members of the cast were cut? Did they really need all the male leads back for the last film? Is that why he was included? There really seems to be no clear answer.Overall, American Wedding is the one sequel this year that seems to outshine the previous efforts. Though the film is an achievement in that area, there are a few things to pick at. One of those things includes the number of cast members from the original films that were cut from this film. No clear explanation is given to why certain members of the original cast are not invited to the wedding. In fact, they are barely even mentioned outside of a passing note of Nadia. This isn't a big factor but does seem to pick at the back of the minds of a few fans. Another small problem about the film is some of the gross out humor. Though many of the scenes are very funny and don't seem to be retreads of scenes from the two prior films, some of gross out humor seems to be too much to take in especially the scene involving Stifler's search for the lost wedding ring. Outside of those small problems, American Wedding is the best comedy of the summer as well as the year so far. If this is the last film in the American Pie series, it is a wonderful thing to know that the comedy franchise went out on a huge high note.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I give it a B-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something missing from this latest American Pie movie. I can't put my finger on it, but the fact is it didn't feel like an American Pie movie. Yes, the gross out humor was there. Yes, most of the cast was there. And yet, it felt more like a spin-off than a sequel. Here are a few reasons I've decided it comes off that way: for starters, the lack of half the cast is much more evident than I thought it would be. While it's completely understandable how Nadia, Vicky, and Jessica would be left out of this one, it really would have been nice to see Oz back with the gang (and by extension Heather, even if she just gave a cameo). I know he wasn't all that funny in Part 2 and writer Adam Herz said there wasn't a lot of comedic potential left for his character. I remember going in thinking "As long a I've got Stiffler and Jim's dad I'm a happy guy", but I really did miss the other characters. And no Sherman??? He could easily have had a small role somewhere. I mean Lord, they gave Stiffler's mom a cameo that makes absolutely no sense. So I'm not buying the "I couldn't find a way to work him in" excuse. It was a family reunion with only half the family. There's something strange about seeing Jim, Finch, and Kevin sitting at a bar without Oz right there with them. I wasn't expecting that. I thought by getting rid of some of the less amusing characters, trimming the fat if you will, sounded like a good idea. But the absence is felt. Oz should have been there. There was even a great oppurtunity to bring back Nadia had they chose to. There's a subplot that they start to explore and then forget about where Jim wonders if he's sure he's making the right decision. He asks his dad if he was wrong to pass on Nadia. I thought it would have been logical for him to test himself by contacting her. And of course he'd have realized his true love for Michelle in the process yada yada yada... but it would have been a better personal story for Jim. As it stands in the finished film, he does not have one. He, like the other friends, exist only to tell Stiffler what a horrible person he is.Another thing that bugged me was the shifting of an ensemble story to a strong emphasis on just one character. And it's not even Jim. It's Stiffler. He is essentially the main character of the movie and while Sean William Scott is unbeliavably hilarious, that character worked better as a supporting role. I did enjoy seeing another side of him, but not at the expense of reducing Jim to his sidekick and cutting Kevin out of the picture completely. I know Stiffler's a popular character, but I think the film would have been better had it focused more on the pre-wedding fiascos of Jim and Michelle(Hell, that's the title!). I also didn't like how out of character some of the cast behaved. Michelle was just not herself. She was not the same person she was in the last one, which was a great performance. I know they had to make her the leading lady, but even when they try for some genuine "Michelle Moments" they come off as forced and illogical. This is the girl that shoved a trumpet up Jim's fanny. This time around she had little to do except cry over some dead flowers. They completely wasted her and Kevin. A lot of people didn't like Kevin in the last one and I say it's because they never gave him a chance to do anything good. His best scenes were cut from Part 2 and in this one he's just set dressing while the spotlight shines firmly on Stiffler. Big mistake. The whole bond of these four guys (Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch) is thrown out the window so we can see the sensitive side of Stiffler.Don't get me wrong, the movie accomplishes its most important goal: it's funny. Very funny. I know this review sounds negative, but I don't feel like I wasted my $10. I came to laugh and that's exactly what I did. The gross out humor and fantastic one liners did not disapoint. I just wish it had stayed true to the tone of the first two. It's not a bad movie at all, but like I said it just doesn't really feel like an American Pie movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The studio has been using the old marketing technique of boasting this as being the last in the series of movies, and I hope that comes true. Firstly, I think "American Wedding" is slightly worse than its predecessors, whom I thought were both of the same quality. It just begins to get thin here. The second did the same, but I guess I just found it funnier. Things here just don't seem as funny. Stifler still gets me everytimes, but even he started to get a little stale by the end of this third entry. It's still a pretty funny movie, though. Stifler and Finch do a little role reversal in this one, and it's hilarious. And if all else fails, you can always count on Eugene Levy for some laughs. There is at least something in here that's bound to get a rise from you (haha, get it, "rise". Okay, I'll stop now). The film is more like the first in that there is a little more coming of age wisdom than just pure out comedy. It's not the deepest of material, but it helps numb the effect of going for one joke after the other. I was a little peeved that Chris Klein didn't come (obviously due to his blossoming career). It felt funny seeing all the friends together without Oz by there side. So, the humor is low brow sure, but if you saw the first two and enjoyed them you shouldn't find a problem liking this one. It's not as consistently funny as the other two, and as with any comedy some of the other story elements are lacking, but I think it's a nice way to end the trilogy. Jim came full circle, and I'd like to see it stay that way.6/10* * ? / * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw American Wedding and it was great. The cast that did return was the core cast anyway and the movie was awesome without the missing members. As usual Sean William Scott stole the movie and Eugene Levy was awesome. This is one of the funniest movies to come out this year. All the gross out over the top humor from the first two movies is abundant in this one but does not overtake the story. I know American Pie is not for everyone, but all three of these movies will be classics of the teen movie genre. They are without a doubt some of the funniest movies to come out over the last few years. This movie does tie everything together, but there is still so much more to explore about these characters. I would love to see an American Pie 4, but I am not too confident that one will be made. Most of the cast and crew have said this is it, but how often have we heard that before and when the box office comes in at 40 million or so which I am predicting for opening weekend their tune may change. We all know money talks. If you are looking for a good time with a lot of laughs this Wedding is one you don't want to miss!Remember you are your own best critic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, I have to say that this is an hilarious movie with a good plot. But in my opinion the movie is missing something. With only a few characters returning, it doesn't have that same feeling you had with the other two. None of the other characters are even mentioned in the movie whatsoever. While "Wedding" is based on Jim and Michelle's marriage (obviously), the movie seems to focus more on Stifler than anything else. There isn't as much attention on Jim and especially Michelle as there should have been. Although I enjoyed the movie and I would definitely see it again, it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Series Ends with Class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding is a perfect end to a very funny series. It sticks to formula, but adapts it to each rite of passage, in this case the wedding.Interestingly, the wedding almost becomes the B plot as Stephen Stifler (our favorite jerk) actually comes of age as the main protagonists are crossing the threshold. I laughed out loud in the theater a number of times, and even got a little misty.You'll get your share of grossness, your share of laughs, and you'll even see Stifler's Mom one last time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man. I can't get enough of it lol. I really wished the movie was 10 hours long or something. After the first two installments, watching the third you really get a sense of knowing these characters inside and out. You know what to expect, know whats gonna happen and how they'll react but something about it just makes it hilarious.As far as another sequel, sure the ending wasn't left open, BUT... think about it. Hollywood dosn't stop making sequels because they don't know where the story goes, it's all about money. By now you should know, DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE ADAM HERTZ!!! The man is genious. He can take ANY of these characters and put them into a story all their own. Who knows, AP4 could be have Finch as the main character. NEVER SAY NEVER because you probably didn't think AP2 would ever happen, and now look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely hilarious! I was somewhat dissapointed when i heard that Chris Klein (OZ) wasn't appearing... but that was quickly replaced with the same sick/demented/and hilarious humor that the first 2 brought to the theater. Not to give away any spoilers but it was more along the lines of the Finch vs. Stiffler movie... which is amazing. i give it 5* out of 5*!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very pleasantly surprised....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into this one expecting it to be similar to the first two installments, except for the exclusion of some of the main cast members from the first two. For the first 25 minutes or so, I was a little disappointed. It didn't have that "American Pie" feel to it. The camera work and set designs were very different from the other two. So it took me about 25 minutes or so to really get into the feel of the movie. When I did, I was very pleasantly surprised. The dialogue picked up, the humor got better, and the characters showed their true selves. The trailor kind of spoiled some of the really funny bits, so I'm not going to mention any of them here. Just go see it for yourself. Be prepared to feel a little out of sorts for a little bit in the beginning. But once you really get into it, I promise you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Slice is as good as the First!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw American Wedding and it was great. The cast that did return was the core cast anyway and the movie was awesome without the missing members. As usual Sean William Scott stole the movie and Eugene Levy was awesome. This is one of the funniest movies to come out this year. All the gross out over the top humor from the first two movies is abundant in this one but does not overtake the story. I know American Pie is not for everyone, but all three of these movies will be classics of the teen movie genre. They are without a doubt some of the funniest movies to come out over the last few years. This movie does tie everything together, but there is still so much more to explore about these characters. I would love to see an American Pie 4, but I am not too confident that one will be made. Most of the cast and crew have said this is it, but how often have we heard that before and when the box office comes in at 40 million or so which I am predicting for opening weekend their tune may change. We all know money talks. If you are looking for a good time with a lot of laughs this Wedding is one you don't want to miss!Remember you are your own best critic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, I have to say that this is an hilarious movie with a good plot. But in my opinion the movie is missing something. With only a few characters returning, it doesn't have that same feeling you had with the other two. None of the other characters are even mentioned in the movie whatsoever. While "Wedding" is based on Jim and Michelle's marriage (obviously), the movie seems to focus more on Stifler than anything else. There isn't as much attention on Jim and especially Michelle as there should have been. Although I enjoyed the movie and I would definitely see it again, it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where did the real Stifler go? The funniest character in the first two installments is, by far, the weakest link in this one. Stilted delivery from Seann William Scott takes the zip out of a lot of scenes, whereas the rest of the cast feel like old friends, and once again Eugene Levy is fantastic. It isn't as bad as it could have been but it is a bit of a let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Less Kevin, no Oz, more Stifler, and more of a less annoying Finch makes for a great conclusion to the American Pie series. More importantly, this movie does not follow the same framework as the fist two films, two films which I am not a big fan of, but could tolerate. I couldn't help but feel that they were the same movie, only with different scenery and a slight change in the situations. This movie is different though. And for a change, Jim is not the focus of the film. While he is the catalyst for the plot of the film, it seems like the movie is more about Stifler and Finch, mostly Stifler. In this film the Stiff-meister actually develops as a character, something that I thought was impossible. This film does not rely on potty humor as heavily as the previous films, but more so on the humorous changes to the Stifler character, and his constant conflict with Finch. Mr. Sensative Oz isn't in the film, and the constantly whining character of Kevin is barely a factor, he probably had 10 lines total. And when the film is not focusing on Finch and Stiffler, it is showing the hilarious steps that Jim takes trying to prove to Michelle's parents that he is worthy of taking care of her, which in true Jim fashion always turns out badly. This is by far the best of the series, and probably the funniest movie I have seen in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering most of the girls aren't back for this one and the directors/writers aren't the same, I was somewhat impressed. Some parts of this movie are downright silly and there are some really good one liners. There is a one liner that Finch tells Stifer that almost had me out of my chair and had the audience clapping. I thought the trailer showed a little too much, but it left plenty to be desired. I really like the music that was used in this one, especially the bar scene that Stifer walks into alone. Go see this one, it's worth it, and it will be interesting how it does at the box office after opening weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the cliche about porn films: "hello, I'm Ramon the Gardener," 3 minutes of inane dialogue and then !bam! right to the sex. Lather, rinse, repeat ad nauseum. Well, as is the case with most low-budget porn, so it is with American Wedding: miniscule shreds of a story taped together to form a spastically shot, shoddily written, poorly edited, forgettable piece of trash that serves only to connect a series of otherwise unrelated sight gags and comical misunderstandings, each more ridiculously grotesque than the last.This should be shown in every film school as an example of what NOT to do in filmmaking. From a purely technical standpoint, it's hard to believe this was released by a major studio at all; I've seen a better sense of pacing and visual communication in freshman student films. But over and above that, the script reeks of firstdraftitis, abandoning any sort of scene establishment at the outset and glossing over character details that could have made the players more than just stick figures made to out-gross one another.In a few short sentences, we're given the premise and a quick summary of what the boys have been doing since the last film and then off they go to engage in wacky antics. Am I supposed to care about the marriage of characters I hardly know? There are more than one of the major players here that could have been completely removed from the film without any effect at all.Every single element that made the original film charming and endearing is forgotten; there is no story here, just filler between stunts. Levy and Scott and a few of the more clever setups save the film from the trash heap. But Stifler wears out his welcome by the end (it's clear the producers know he is the most interesting character of the ensemble and thus use him TO DEATH) and more often than not, the film just grates one's nerves with amateurish inanity.As I walked out of the theater, I heard a pre-teen boy squawk "best movie ever" as he gleefully began quoting Stiflerisms. This made me realize that American Wedding will most likely be number one at the box office this weekend, thereby provoking the creation of yet another unnecessary sequel. God help us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me Stifler ruins the movie, but there are a few funny moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care for the Steve Stifler character. I know why he is there, but he is just too dirty, too often. In real life his friends would have punched him out long ago.Aside from that, the movie has funny characters with the likes of Biggs, Hannigan, Willard, and Levy. I could never recommend this movie to anyone but I came away with a few chuckles. Jason Biggs is back as Jim Levenstein, and in the first few minutes he pops the question, but only after a somewhat embarrassing scene at the restaurant where randy Michelle gets under the table for "you know what." The movie would be nothing with cute, funny Alyson Hannigan as Michelle Flaherty. She can get away with a few dirty comments and make it seem almost innocent. We are introduced to Michelle's family, January Jones as her cute sister Cadence Flaherty. And always funny Fred Willard as her dad Harold Flaherty. Plus Eugene Levy is great as Jim's dad.An alternate title could have been "How to Keep Stifler From Ruining Everything" and for me that got old. I absolutely detest that character. Not high art, not even art in the lowest sense, the movie's redeeming value, if there is any, are the actors. Plus it was a DVD set (all three American Pie movies) from my public library. It makes me wonder why they spend taxpayer money on dirty movies like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Wedding" is the third installment of the raunchy series where the films are more fun to watch than the "Porky's" trilogy and yet play out like them as well. The first American Pie movie dealt with a bunch of young high school kids wanting to get laid before graduation; the first sequel in 2001 showed all of the characters both main and supportive back in their shenanigans with more raunchy moments than it's predecessor, yet having too many characters can take away from the plot. In this second sequel, the other characters that went nowhere in AP2 (American Pie 2) from Oz, Sherman, Vicki, Heather and Nadia are crossed out leaving only to follow Jim, Kevin, Stifler, Finch, Jim's parents and Michelle in the last adventure of the trilogy."American Wedding" deals with Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) getting married after graduating college where they get Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Stifler (Seann William Scott), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) as the best men while dealing with more riot moments than usual from Stifler dancing with gay members in order to get a decorator, a bachelor party gone awry before Michelle's parents get home; Jim still embarrasses himself in some moments and yet, his father played by Eugene Levy represents the coolest dad on screen where he's not embarrassed by his son's antics.The film gets funnier through scenes where they even outmatch it's first sequel's gag out moments. Yet, it is sad that it is the final of the "American Pie" series with the original characters (with the exception of Jim's dad) before new characters hit the DVD shelves. Who knows? Maybe a fourth movie with Jim and his buddies may be in the works.</fullReview>

Its full of obscene and vulgar humor so its not suitable for the audience who doesn't like this kind of stuff. There are some touchy moments too when stifler screw the things up. Michelle looks great in this movie. There are moments you cant hold your laugh. The comedy between the finch and stifler was very hilarious. A must watch if you like the last two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Wedding is a decent conclusion to the American Pie trilogy, although several characters from the first two films are sorely missing in this one (including Chris Klein). However, unlike the second film, this one is as original as the first film, with the main focus being the wedding between Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan as Jim and Michelle. Joining the cast again are Seann William Scott as the funny Stifler and a hilarious Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. Jennifer Coolidge also again makes an always hilarious cameo as Stifler's mom. Another thing to point out, all 3 films were either written or co-written by Adam Herz, thereby bringing a cohesive glue between all 3 films (which would otherwise be lacking if different writers handled all 3 films). A still funny 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is a good sequel that will make you laugh and feel good. There were some crass parts, though. Even thinking about one of them makes me feel queasy. However, in my opinion, Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) wedding dress was absolutely beautiful. When I get married, that's the kind of dress I'd like to wear. If anyone managed to cause mishaps during the events before my wedding the way Stifler (Seann Willam Scott) did, I'd never forgive them. Oh, in case you're wondering, the name of the song that Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle choose for their first dance is "Into The Mystic," by the Wallflowers. Now, in conclusion, if you liked its predecessors, you should see this movie, that is, if you haven't seen it. You're in for a real treat, a good time, and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with some friends, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching it more than 50 times I still enjoy the movie as much I watch it the first time I watch it. This time Jim goes all the way and proposes Michelle, she agreed. The story follows our gangs into the fantasy - Bachelors Party, Stifler first love (for Cadence), which he have to fight with Finch to get her, The gay bar dance, and the actual family and wedding things.Even though I was kind of disappointed about the lack of our beloved Oz, Heather, Nadia, and Vicky, this doesn't make this movie any lesser than the last two. The movie still very enjoyable and humorous as before, especially to the hardcore fans.Reason To Watch: · It is probably the last of American Pie, · Still as funny as before, · Fans wouldn't miss it for the worldReason Not To: · None.Rating: 9.5/10 (Grade: A+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hidden Meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People just aren't getting this because they haven't looked below the surface. Here's my theory:The character of Stifler is actually brain defective because his parent were crack and/or alcohol addicted. This is not funny, of course. What's funny, though, is that after all these years, his defective brain is causing him to act out. Notice all the uncontrollable cursing all of a sudden??? And the stupid giggle that comes after each dumb joke? Okay, well this takes us to the hidden meaning...American Wedding is actually made as if Stifler, brain-defective that he is, wrote the screenplay. This explains the half-a$$ed attempts at recycling the last two movies, the non-stop profanities, the fact that Stifler is now the central character with the most screen time (ughh) the constant humping and the lack of any real plot (a road-trip in order to find the gay man that will make the wedding dress, which ends up in a very unfunny dance-off between Stifler and a gay hulk hogan that 'saves the day'?? Oh god help us).Okay, I'll admit I only got through about 20 minutes before choosing to watch Wolf Blitzer instead (he's funnier) but the theory is still good, I think.Watch only if you have trouble following any kind of plot and you laugh easily at potty jokes and swear words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of the three films, avoid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I come from the camp that liked the first two movies, but wasn't very impressed with the third one. It seems to me that the creator was just trying to make more money off of the characters without delivering the same humorous charm as in "Pie" and "Pie 2". Apparently, they couldn't pay some actors enough to appear in this movie, because it is devoid of Chris Klein, Tara Reid, and Shannon Elizabeth. Kevin's role has been drastically declined, and the acting overall has gotten much worse. Since when was Stifler such an annoying twerp? The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that Eugene Levy is always funny, and the creator managed to get Jim into some ridiculous situations yet again. Stifler seems to be the focal point of the movie, which seemed awkward to me. Don't expect to laugh like you did before. I felt there were 2 or 3 funny moments, and the rest was just stupid. I sincerely hope no one decides to make a fourth one of these movies. The jokes are old and the characters are no longer charming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER!!!! I don't understand how any film maker could let it slide. I don't understand how any producer could let it go. I don't understand how any audience member could accept it.....WHY DID A**HOLE STIFLER GET THE GIRL IN THE END??? That doesn't make any sense! Poor Finchy gets treated to an ending almost exactly like the one in Pie 2!! Stifler's mom shows up out of nowhere and gives him a happy(?)cop-out ending??? Am I the only one that wanted Finch to get the girl?What does this teach the horny teenage boys watching? The bigger prick you are the more likely you'll be to get the girl? And "apparently" young women are too stupid to see through this! Insulting all around.Next...why wouldn't Jim use the garbage for his trimmings? Does he also cross an entire other room to throw other bathroom "refuse" out the window? I get that it wouldn't be a joke without the window...it was just poorly thought out... The first American Pie movie was fun. The second more of the same, but okay....the third was INSULTING CRAP!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move Over PIE...Get Ready For The CAKE!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all knew that the PIE was going to end soon.But how was it going to end.Are good buddy Adam Herz knows how to end it.By moving the PIE over to the CAKE.That's right guys and girls it an AMERICAN WEDDING,and were all invented to this and Jim's bachelor party.So with the help of director Jesse Dylan(How High),we will all find out that the CAKE is better than both PIES. Jim(Jason Biggs) and Michelle(Alyson Hannigan) have decided to get hitch.And with the help of Jim's Dad(Eugene Levy),Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas),and Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas),the wedding seams perfect dosen't it.But guess who decides to show up and throw the bachelor party.Yup,our man Stifler(Seann William Scott).But will he ruin the wedding.Or win the bet he and Finch had,to see who will score with Michelle's sister Candance(January Jones). This is in my book one of the funniest movies ever made and ten times better than AMERICAN PIE 1&amp;2.What makes this film amazing is the presence of Stifler.Not only including him in almost every scene in the movie and being responsible for 95% of the laughs in the whole movie,but also the way he acted was so different than what he acted in the first two.And better yet he gets top billing,will he's actually the second star of the whole film.Some of the charecthers are gone,but they will be missed.</fullReview>

Unless your homosexual, that part was definitely over-done and generally, it's a tired horse.My rating was "1" because I couldn't make it lower. It's actually minus 10.

		<fullReview>American Wedding (2003)American Wedding was a good movie, and it had some laughs, but it wasn't nearly as funny or nearly as good as the first and second films. The good thing about this movie is that it ends the "Pie" series with a happy ending. Jim and Michelle's wedding is constantly messed up by Stifler, and then brought back. The bad thing is that some of our favorite characters don't return for the third finale. Vicky, Oz, Jessica, Heather, and Nadia don't return for the end of the series, which was the disappointing part about it. Otherwise, it was pretty good and I recommend it to fans of the series. I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

The trailer of this movie seemed to bring another success story like the original movie. But no, it's just another movie that starts off right and ends as a cheap teenage pr0n movie.Not even funny, it makes one feel uneasily when watching those sick kids. In part 1 they were naughty and enjoying adult behavior, in part 2 and 3 it's just a test to see how much kinkyness and extremity one can bare. Simply a no-go movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually comedies coming in trilogies suck. But this was, as the previous two, very funny. Stifler is the character that made the whole thing worth the while. His character was even more extreme than before and totally bemusing. When juxtaposing American Pie 3 with the previous two, the story outline is more compact, but thus focusing more on certain aspects as the actuall process of getting the dress, which later adds to the progression of the movie. Though I expected more of the bachelor party scene, it was in it's own quite funny, and for the people who can relate to Stifler in any way, worth watching the film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gang is back again in this third installment of the American Pie franchise. This time around preparations are being made for the marriage of Jim and Michelle, but complications ensue when Stifler?as vulgar and outrageous as ever?invites himself to the wedding and threatens to ruin the proceedings. As if that's not enough, both Jim and Michelle begin to have doubts as to whether or not they can make the wedding?and more importantly their marriage?work effectively. Crude and silly, as fans of the series would expect, yet sweet and funny with an ever-appealing cast of characters, especially Levy in an ideal role as Jim's gawky father, and Scott who's wildly over-the-top in the role he was born to play as Steve Stifler. Not a lot of surprises, but plenty of heart and laughs, making this an entertaining third chapter of a very popular series. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest since the first one!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The gang is back for some more gut wrenching laughs. Its been three years and the gangs graduated college, now what? Well Jim thinks its time to marry the band geek. I loved American pie the original. It had a true story behind it that many people could relate to. The sequel American pie 2, well lets just say I did buy the DVD. The laughs were descent, but it did lack a real story line. It seemed to me that there was a bunch of jokes and they filmed a story around them. There was no real objective to the movie unless one considers it to be a big party. Lets just say the second American pie was just a interlude to a real GEM. The third instalment was NO DOUBT THE FUNNIEST SINCE THE FIRST. It also had a main goal and who knew STIFLER was forced to take 3 years of dance lessons. The sad thing with this film is it did not provide us with the presence of Chris Klein. It does seem to feel a bit unusual with out the OZ!! I hope this isn't the last one. When I left the theatre my sides were really hurting. I couldn't breathe though some parts of this. This film shows the brilliant genius of each actor and actress' craft, from the facial expressions to sure embarrassments to plain out grossness. This movie was well worth it and I would pay the exorbitant ticket price to watch this film again. I cannot wait until the unrated DVD release. A few last final thoughts. Never go to a comedy an expect a drama or thriller film like The Patriot or A Few Good Men. One goes to a comedy to enjoy it and laugh. Movies like this well bring the movie industry back from the fall of their income. Its not people pirating films that causes this. Its caused by lousy movies and extremely high price, which is driven by GREED, enough of my views on that. Well back to my final thoughts of the movie. Each character in the film Jim, Finch, Stifler, Jim's dad, and Michelle all had the movie revolving around them it was spectacular. I want to say to all those American Pie haters get over it and get a life. Stop being such an uptight critic and relax and watch a good comedy when you see one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think Police Academy, think Superman III, or any other series that went downhill by the 2nd sequel... notice how they could not top the previous movies in their respective series. American Wedding accomplishes that.While following some of the same cues from the previous American Pie movies, it definitely sets itself apart enough to deserve the name it received (instead of American Pie 3). You can see where they drop some of the stuff that really gets old, (the stuff about "the next step", etc.) and make this movie very different, and you'll see where some of our key players grow up. Yet, some things never seem to change.Go watch it and you will see what I mean.</fullReview>

I can still remember a packed theatre screaming "What a piece of Cr#p" as they were leaving the second movie.This third one had me and my buddies laughing our asses off. The theatre was a riot.

(Got to admit Stifler got boring in the second, but youll love him here)Just wait till the BAchlor Party. After the flick I was talking with my friends as we discussed if this was better than the first. Well, happy to say that its on the same lever and i think its even better. This movie is supposed to be the "final chapter" but im sure they'll make a fourth (everyone wants to see the gang back after this).A great feel good flick. The TRUE sequel to american pie.

Chris Klein is absent so there's a testosterone vacuum that needs filling. More to the point, a new vein of humour uses the 'Meet The Fockers' joke of prudish bride-parents and Scott's brutishness sets up many of the confrontations that make that gag work.They overplay it though. In fact, plenty gets excessively milked, including a remarkably awful disco set-piece and the most tediously protracted 'stag night' since... zzz 1/10</fullReview>

Jason Biggs and co-star Alyson Hannigan look bored with the whole ordeal, and they are clearly just going through the motions. Jokes about being in a gay bar and eating dog waste just feel forced and contrived, and other jokes like the destruction of a wedding cake because of Jim is completely out of place. The first one was lacklustre, the second one was half decent, and this one is just a slap in the face to anyone who liked the other two.

		<fullReview>American Pie works best as its own entity. It was a tight story in which each character was able to maintain his or her own story arch. Would Jim overcome his fumbling, goofy nature and lack of confidence and rise to the occasion with Nadia? Would Oz be able to pull off his facade as superficial jock to sentimental choir boy? Would Kevin, the only character in an establish relationship, be able to take the relationship to the next level? And just what was Finch up to? In defense of the people behind American Wedding, they simply did not have the necessary tools at their disposal to pull off a fulfilling third slice in the American Pie trilogy. In fact, signs of diminished resources were apparent by the second film-- and I am talking not merely about the absence of some of the key actors to reprise their role (which hurts this film greatly), but more importantly, there simply was not enough for these once central characters to do.The strongest apparent example is Kevin, who, without any side plot whatsoever, is left with nothing to do but stand around and throw around toasts "to the next step." His character could have been completely removed from this film without it having any impact.Of course, the other problem is that the absence of the complete ensemble (or even a mention as to what became of them), strikes at the friends-to-the-end theme of these American Pie movies. Who though, at the conclusion of the original American Pie, that if some day in the not-too-distant future Jim was getting married, Oz would not be in attendance. It rings hollow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch the Unrated DVD of "American Wedding" check out the "writer's commentary." I just assumed this was a new writer who was brought in after the guys who did "American Pie I &amp; II" got tired of this. Not so -- incredibly, the same guy wrote all three! This is a tired movie -- it should be entitled "The Stifler Compromise" because, really, it's all about the writer's obvious love for the Stifler character who grows old and weary after 5 minutes. He's kind of like the funny friend you remember from junior high who never grew up. Do you really want to see 90 minutes of Stifler jerking around like an idiot, screeching potty mouth language and trying desperately to be funny? For some reason Ebert gave this a good review and I can't figure that out. The scene he cited as hilarious -- Stifler on the gay disco -- was dumb and pathetic. And this is from a guy who thought the first "American Pie" was and is a classic!Pass on this. Save the dough and watch "Napoleon Dynamite" instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The debut was fair, the sequel fell in the gutter, this one digs itself out but is still in dire need. In usual sitcom or movie fashion, an impending wedding is met with nothing but disaster. For the "Pie" gang, they bring their usual naked and gagging humor along. Straight from the opening scene, Biggs butt is visible, the tired sex stuff is dove right into, and there's yet another new girl to lust after. But much as in part 2, everything is so labored and then lingered on. They manage a few more hearty laughs then the last film, but writer Herz's problem is that he can't help but kill the joke. Scenes run for too long 'till they're into the ground and not funny anymore. The gay disco sequence, the business with the grandmother, and Scott once again subjected to something disgusting. It gets a good laugh, but is forced and then won't die. The cast remains strong, though not always likeable. Stifler is once again a junior high school-ish moron, though not as hateful as the previous movie. He still can only speak in obscenities to his friends, again begging the question of who would let this guy in their group? Surprised Nicholas agreed to be in this, his character given absolutely nothing to do, he's pretty needless. The Finch and Jim characters stay middle-of-the-road, thereby being bearable. Though Finch gets to flex his uncharacteristic raunch muscle while competing with Stifler for the girl. Hannigan is a tad annoying as a girl who's only affection for Biggs is being "boned" by him, with not other deapth visible within her character. Levy again provides a good turn as the most horrified dad in screen history. But it all just barely passes as a fair time and hopefully the oven has been shut down on these. Even right down to the final moment, you're expecting one of those kingdom come jokes to end everything, they can't even manage that. If anything these characters can sail into adulthood with plenty of stories to share with their kids someday.</fullReview>

Unless you're homosexual, that part was definitely over-done and generally, it's a tired horse.My rating was "1" because I couldn't make it lower. It's actually minus 10.

Now that the second did that, I had serious doubt that they could do it a third time.They did.They absolutely did.Sure, some gags are totally disgusting, but that has always been a part of the series.And even the lowest gags work, because we care about the people. That's the whole secret.Should it end here? I think so. A complete trilogy. A great one. And a COMEDY trilogy ... rare. Very rare!10/10. Oh yes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I am passionately in love with Seann William Scott. I think he's one of the finest pieces of man ever to grace the screen, for so many reasons.Secondly, I'm a huge, HUGE fan of both American Pie I and II. I could watch both of them over and over again, and have, as a matter of fact.But American Wedding SUCKED. It felt hollow, empty, and painful. It was like watching a former beauty queen drunkenly struggle into a pair of too-tight pantyhose. There was no dignity about this movie, no joy, no lighter-than-air charm. What happened to all the strong, delightful females? What happened to Oz? Nobody even mentions him. How sad, and what an unforgivable oversight.Even my beloved SWS came across as gimmicky and self-conscious. Stifler isn't endearing anymore; the actor knows he's a hot commodity, and that all eyes are on him. Quite frankly, he buckles under the pressure. (I'm sorry, Seannie, but it's how I feel).I came away from this movie feeling quite forlorn. I'd been expecting so much, but received so little. Even the audio commentary with SWS did nothing to allay my blues, because he ends up sounding like nothing more than a typical San Fernando Valley "like, ya know, oh man, dude, kinda like"...doofus.Sigh. I've heard he's a doll in real life. And maybe he's a pistol in the sack. We can only hope.</fullReview>

So tell me, you're in a restaurant getting serviced under the table when your Dad walks in and you jump up with your pants around your ankles and your girlfriend still under the table. Not only doesn't the restaurant throw you out on your a**, but the patrons give you a standing O when you propose to her, with your pants still undone? How charming! Funny? Not in the least! But I hang in there for a while until stifler shows up,ranting neverending curses like he was Joe Pesce in Casino.

		<fullReview>Michelle and Jim get married in this rather outdated and profane slice of pie. A wedding maybe sounds a slightly ridiculous proposition, if you consider Jim's inability to control his sexual desires and the general lack of commitment of all the characters in the films to their partners. However, instead of being imaginative and diverting the genre into the intelectual category, they could only end the trilogy with a rather weary line of childish jokes and smutty dialogue.The teen comedy genre has died a very sombre death it seems, but at what cost? I am not a great fan of these types of films by any means, however I do want a change of strategy by the directors of such films. Instead of shock value, how about value for money for a diverse range of people, including middle aged graduates such as myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this really the worst movie I've ever seen? Well, darned close to it. I really don't know where to begin in criticizing this mess.First of all, I haven't seen anything funny yet. I taped this from HBO and have been watching it in 30-minute segments while I do the treadmill. At least I haven't been wasting my time totally while watching it.I learned from reading the reviews that this is the third movie in a trilogy of movies of bad taste. Now I'm not immediately turned off by bad taste. I really liked "There's Something About Mary" and "Caddy Shack," for example, both of which contained many tasteless gags, some of which were repeated in "American Wedding."All I can say is that if this one's at all similar to its predecessors, I'll avoid the earlier ones like the plague. Actually, the plague would be funnier than "American Wedding."Did I say I didn't like this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first two ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it has it's share of terrific scenes and Seann William Scott is a comic genius - American Pie - The Wedding (which it's known as here in Australia) isn't quite as good as the first two. The reason seems to be that things seem much more contrived this time out, and not as spontaneous as the original was. The highlight is obviously the bachelor party scene which has some great moments for Finch, Stifler and Jim, but there aren't as many laughs as in the first two, which is a shame. Add to this a dull opening act (things don't get going until Stifler enters the scene) and lots of filler where not much really goes on, American Pie - The Wedding is a good but not great, possible end to a nonetheless fine comedy series. But here's hoping that Stifler and the rest of the team have one more of these in them, because they're such appealing movies even when they're not laugh-out-loud funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's At Least Better Than the Previous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Wedding (2003) ** 1/2 (out of 4) When Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) decide to get married everyone agrees that Stifler (Seann William Scott) shouldn't be invited but he keeps popping up no matter what and soon he puts the entire thing at risk. American WEDDING is certainly a step up from the previous installment but it still falls well short of being a good movie. I think the biggest problem here is that the Stifler character leaves the supporting bit behind and becomes a major player in the game. Yes, he had a fairly big part in the first two movies but he had certain limits on him, which isn't the case here. I found there to be simply too much of his character and after a while the over-the-top nature just became rather annoying. I think the director could have calmed down his act a little bit and it probably would have gone a lot better. The screenplay also has a rather boring subplot involving Stifler and Finch trying to seduce Michelle's sister. This includes the two of them "acting" like the other and while we do get a couple laughs from this it really ends up dragging the film down. With that said, there are still some very funny moments scattered throughout the film. This includes a pretty funny opening bit where the proposal doesn't work out as planned and a raunchy but hilarious bit dealing with dogs. I won't ruin the gag but Jim and Stifler getting mixed up with cake and dogs made for a great gag. Another funny bit happens towards the end and again involves Stifler but the less said the better. As with the previous film, the entire cast has no problem getting back into their characters and we're greeted with some fine performances from all. American WEDDING could have used from a re-write and there's clearly an overall feel of just wanting to milk the series but there are enough laughs to make it worth viewing even if the film doesn't completely come together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude, funny and irresistible - that's American Pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim finally pops the question to his long-term girlfriend Michelle who he has been with since prom night in the first movie. Any hopes or beliefs that his humiliations and mishaps are going to end right here and now couldn't be further from the truth, and despite him trying to keep the wedding low key by organising it with his two best friends Kevin and Finch, it isn't long before Steve Stifler gets word of the engagement and hits the scene, determined to have a bachelor party for Jim. First impressions go terribly wrong for Jim with Michelle's parents, and Jim's father (Eugene Levy) is on hand as usual to give advice to his sexually-awkward and accident-prone son even on his wedding day. Stifler sets out to sleep with Michelle's younger sister, which makes him adopt a sweet, innocent personality as he goes against Finch to win her over.As typical with the series, "American Pie: The Wedding" has a basic, simple storyline loaded with crude humour and gags and derives most of it's laughs from the awkward situations that the boys and girls get themselves into. Most of the characters are here, with the exception of Oz and Heather. They had to be written out of the film because Chris Klein, who plays Oz, was in Europe at the time of filming and funds weren't available to get him back home for only a small role. Instead there are some references to the character being in Europe with Heather, so that I feel covered it all up nicely. The well hated and despicable Steve Stifler returns, and as usual, you have to admit, Sean William Scott steals the show whenever he is in a scene. He hasn't changed at all, and is still a jerk so to speak, and spends his time driving a school bus (Yes, Stifler is now a bus driver for young kids. A great role model) and he coaches a football team. Just like the two films before it, it has an excellent soundtrack. Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and crude moments to make you squirm, "American Pie: The Wedding" is an excellent sequel, wrapping up the original characters before the next films, starting with "...Band Camp" would head down a different road altogether two years later, with Stifler's younger brother heading the cast of characters. A film is currently being made to bring all the original characters back together. I really look forward to that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking It Up the Aisle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "American Pie" gang gathers for the "American Wedding" of hesitant perv Jason Biggs (as Jim Levenstein) and eager nympho Alyson Hannigan (as Michelle Flaherty). In the opening restaurant scene, Ms. Hannigan misinterprets Mr. Biggs' proposal as a request for oral sex. She goes under the table to give him lip and in walks Biggs' father Eugene Levy. With double-entendres spilling out of his mouth, Mr. Levy delivers his son's forgotten wedding ring. Soon, we discover Biggs has left "Stifler" off the wedding list...The prospective couple takes the back seat as Seann William Scott's "Stifler" grabs the starring role. He endeavors to wangle himself an invite as Biggs' "best man" while romancing Ms. Flaherty's comely "Blonde on Blonde" sister January Jones (as Cadence). But there is competition from Eddie Kaye Thomas (as Finch). The raunchy comedy involving bestiality and dog excrement is done well, for what it is. The inevitable "bachelor party" sequence is hilariously written, blocked and performed. Some work, some don't...****** American Wedding (7/24/03) Jesse Dylan ~ Seann William Scott, Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Eddie Kaye Thomas</fullReview>

From the plot,dialogs,visuals to mannerisms, this one has 'em all.Now Jim has grown up and is about to get married and all the hassles that happen in the arrangements of the marriage forms the major portion of the movie. The plot is simple but so well depicted. Some amount of crude comedy and dialogs make their way into the movie. Like for example, a scene where Jim gets ready to meet his future in-laws and his dress gets screwed up and he's about to clean it. The dogs of the in-laws creep in. He tries to get them away. But when his in-laws see it, they get an impression that he's indulging in bestiality! and of course stifler having sex with Jim's grandmother as well.The review can never be complete without a special mention of the great Steve stifler(played by Seann William Scott)!!he carries the movie with such an ease that he on your side, mirth is assured. Superb characterization i must say. One may watch this movie only for this person's sake. A big thumbs up for American pie-the wedding!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I just finished watching this movie (10/30/09) on TV and I found it to be hilarious and very entertaining. American Wedding seemed funnier and better than American Pie 2. As the series went on, the group faded (less people). In American Wedding, OZ is not in the movie, along with his girlfriend, Nadia, and Sherm. But its alright, because that meant more time for Stifler, and he was hilarious and very funny in this one. He seemed a little different but was the same guy from the first two. Also, Kevin had a minor role in this one (he's rarely in it) which is great, considering the fact that he was very annoying in the previous two American Pie's. American Wedding centers towards Jim and Michelle's wedding but Sitler seems to have the most camera time. There were many funny scenes in this movie including the dance comp. in the beginning in the bar, Stifler and Finch arguing over the girl, the beginning of the film with Jim and Michell at a fancy restaurant (wont give out details), and many more.All together this movie was really funny and very entertaining, a great way the end the trilogy</fullReview>

That being said, we've found it for this one: "American Wedding."Even though the plot from the first two films were kind of vapid and this is the first real storyline in the series, it's not given a fair treatment. When it comes down to the wire, every good sex gag was done in the first two films (even in very disturbing ways), and by now it's just irritating, all of it: Stifler's horndog attitude, Finch's obsession with Stifler's mom, and Jim's dad's constant intrusion at every turn. Eugene Levy does give another solid performance, but it's really not the grand return one would have hoped for.No "American Pie" will ever be my all-time favorite movie. Heck, they won't even be runners up. But as far as they go, this one goes the shortest distance.</fullReview>

I loved the development of Stifler's character and the growth that he goes through throughout the film. Alyson Hannigan is lovely as always, and Jason Biggs is hilarious. The only thing that made me mad about American Wedding was the fact that many of the original cast members don't return. One of the main characters in the first two is gone without a trace. They don't even mention him! Besides a few minor inconsistencies, I really liked American Wedding. The plot was good enough, and it was a great way to end the American Pie series, although it is continued through surprisingly good direct-to-DVD features.

		<fullReview>I found it quite hard to review this film thoroughly - the pace moves faster than you think and the film itself is not particularly long. Admittedly some scenes are pretty crude, but this isn't meant to be an especially high brow film, especially when the demographic it's aimed at is probably the teenage/ twenty something audience and the characters themselves are in the older end of this demographic.Michelle is such a brilliant character - she is written to be so "sweet and innocent" and then she does something like get intimate with Jim at the restaurant. There is a sort of endearing honesty about her character - she's not affected, she says what she wants but her voice is so innocent and honest it tones down her content.I sympathise with Jim - he's desperately trying to do the right thing, he knows Michelle's parents probably won't think he's good enough and he's trying to prove that he is, but he's still got his hormones and needs and urges raging all over the place. I also feel for him and his father in different ways - his father wants to help and give advice, but so often this comes across as a "too much information" moment. (Equally funny is when he tries to help Michelle with her vows.) Jim is too embarrassed about such topics as sex, as you might expect his father to be, yet his father is quite open and ready to talk, and this makes for an interesting role-reversal.His friends are a bit cruel but I suppose in a good natured way. Stifler manages to make fun of him not only for not being able to dance but also for looking at him in a certain way during their first dance attempt ("lesson" seem over-generous). I suppose this highlights, or maybe even parodies, the idea of men being scared to show their emotions.There is an interesting intimacy between Jim and his male friends - at times they sincerely talk about personal grooming, as such, which you would expect to be more in the realms of a female platonic friendship. Sad indeed that it is stifled by one or the other worrying that it might be too intimate.On balance, I liked this film very much. I can't compare it to either of the previous two because I haven't seen them all the way through, but judging it on its own merits, I can't find anything lacking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, if you've read my reviews of the first two movies in this series, then you have an idea of my overall view of these movies. But if not, here's the basics.I loved all three movies (I still don't count the newer direct to DVD's that have come out) on their own but really loved them when viewed as a series of movies.The first two were hilarious for both younger folk (ok, not too young, let's say maybe as early as preteen but most likely the high school students) and the older folk (because it's funnier to look back on some of the things that we did or knew that others did when we were younger) and this movie follows suit. It's just as funny when viewed on it's own, but for the best result, it makes an awesome ending to a trilogy.I think that if you watch all three movies, you'll see the growth of the characters as they mature from ignorant (but in a funny way) young people to mature (or at least what passes as such) people entering full adulthood. They do so without being too serious but also touching on a lot of subjects that young people (and some older people) think about and have experienced in their lives.See these movies for the humor, the growth of the characters, and for one of the few sets of movies that actually use all of the same actors for all three movies.</fullReview>

I would guess good common sense on the part of actors that want to keep from having a brown poo stain on their film resume would be a more suitable reason. The whole plot revolves around Stiffler more than the main 2 characters who are supposed to be getting married. The DVD adds "bonus" footage the consists of all these bizarre out takes from a bachelor party scene. These scenes were so bad that I had to walk out of the living room on 3 different ocassions. It just wasn't funny. I was actually screaming in horror during one scene where stiffler puts something really awful in his mouth. I'll say no more. It was just a really bad movie. It was as if everyone was just trying too hard to be funny. In fact the whole "Stiffler" character was completely blown way out of proportion this go around. The whole plot line where Stiffler is trying to get in good with his buddy's future inlaws so he can be invited to the wedding and bed their daughter is just idiotic. The screen writer for this film should be beaten with soap wrapped in a towel. It's that bad of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to say I was disappointed by by the film after hearing people completely over rating it. The film still makes us laugh as the previous two had also done but the film goes too far and over the top. Most parts of the film i kept saying to myself 'that would never happen.' The film is missing many of the old characters and one of the main four guys 'Oz'. Stifler who has always been the main source of American pie still brings comedy to the film but doesn't seem like the Stifler from the first two. The film lacks the original style of the film series, that's the main let down of the film but still it makes us laugh but if you want the best of American pie i suggest American Pie 2; by far the greatest of them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what Adam Herz (writer) and the producers of the first two Pie movies were thinking when they decided to do this sequel-to-the-sequel. Pie 2 was superb (way better than Pie 1, which was already great). What was the frigging point of doing a Pie 3? And why did they mess it up so badly? In a few words, this movie is empty. Over half of the key characters from the first two flicks are gone (Shermanator, Nadia, Vicky, Oz, Jessica). Jesse Dylan, directing, doesn't seem to have a clue - except about the photography and lighting (which is great). Jason Biggs does better than he did in Pie 1 and 2 - it doesn't sound like he's reading off cue cards this time - but there wasn't any physical comedy for him to do (and that's what Biggs is best at.) Somehow, Stifler seems like he got even more mentally messed up than he was in the first two (overacting by Seann Scott, which was probably the director's idea). It's like it's not even the same person. Michelle has grown up a bit, but some of her lines....ugh. The best parts of the movie are the bachelor party, with ultra-sexy Nikki Ziering and Amanda Swisten, complete with Ziering shoving Deborah Rush's face down into her tits (in the unrated version)A couple more classic heart-to-heart's between Jim and his dad are quite funny, too. Finch does shine a bit brighter - he's less geeky now. Good job, Eddie Kaye Thomas. January Jones mixes things up well as Michelle's sister...would have been nice if she'd gotten together with Finch. But these are just a few bright spots amidst a dark cloud. The whole sexcapade with Jim's Grandma is just stupid, as is the Stifler dog crap-eating scene with the wedding ring, and Jim removing his "other hair". The completely unnecessary character of Bear (a gay guy played to the hilt by Eric Kramer) is just that...completely unnecessary, and the sequence in the gay bar where he and Stifler break-dance was clearly just a time-filler. It was good that Jennifer Coolidge once again made an appearance at the end - although she looks about 50 pounds heavier than she was in Pie 1. But unfortunately, even the two M*I*L*F guys seem somewhat uninspired when they see her, ending the trilogy on a very pale note. I think a good assignment for film school students who are looking to write comedies, would be to go back and write a new Pie 3 script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely does a sequel surpass or even match the original. American Pie 2 managed to pull that off. Instead of leaving well enough alone after that success they decided to try again. And the third time is definitely not the charm.The story here revolves around the impending wedding of lovable loser Jim, played once again by Jason Biggs, and his bride-to-be Michelle, played by Alyson Hannigan. Also back for more antics is Seann William Scott as the over-the-top obnoxious Stifler. Thank goodness for Scott's presence because he is just about the only thing that even remotely livens up the otherwise dreary proceedings. Many of the familiar faces from the first two films have vanished, most notably Chris Klein whose character of Oz is mysteriously absent from one of his supposed best friend's wedding. Also missing in action are Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne. For this I hope they all sent their agents a well-deserved thank-you note.Anyhow what we have here is a movie with no plot whatsoever. Jim and Michelle are going to get married and all kinds of things that are meant to be funny but aren't happen to them leading up to the big day. And that is American Wedding in a nutshell. Apparently they used up all the good gags in the first two and here they are left to resort to trying to repeatedly gross you out. Gross, yes. Funny, no. Much of the movie is just an exercise in time-wasting with scenes, most notably a bizarre bachelor party, going on forever because the filmmakers apparently couldn't think of anything else to do. Stifler has his moments and Eugene Levy is wonderful as always as Jim's dad but they can't save this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie (The First) was a great film which dealt with what its like being a teenager in high school. Fair Enough? American Pie 2 continued that, but this was AFTER high school, and was all about sticking with your old friends, but realising everythings changed.American Pie 3 is about.. what? The wedding of two of the characters. To me it seems like that was the film makers only option. They can't have after high school again! That would be boring. But to be honest it is anyway. The same predictable things happen.However! The fresh ground it treads does bring with it new opportunities for comedy, and i will admit this film is very sweet, and does have its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Pie: The Wedding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film is a brilliant teen movie, and easily the best in the series, and the second film is good fun, this third instalment pretty much completes the storyline between two characters, until of course the Reunion nine years later. Basically Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) proposes to his girlfriend Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), after they have been dating for a couple of years, and after an embarrassing restaurant incident with a blowjob under the table she accepts. His good friends from East Great Falls High School Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are happy for him (Chris Klein was unavailable, making We Were Soldiers and Rollerball), and obnoxious Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott) causes Jim to embarrass himself in front of Michelle's parents, Harold (Best in Show's Fred Willard) and Mary (Deborah Rush). The first thing Stifler wants to help with is a bachelor party, an excuse to see women naked and dancing, while also trying to help Jim learn to dance for the first wedding dance, while the other guys want to help Michelle get the perfect dress. They find the wanted dress maker Leslie Summers (Reynaldo A. Gallegos), who they assumed was a woman, in a gay bar, after Stifler impresses gay Bear (Eric Allen Kramer) and all the other homosexuals in a dance-off. Stifler and Finch have been enemies for ages, and their rivalry is increased by the arrival of Michelle's beautiful sister Cadence Flaherty (January Jones) who is attending the ceremony, and in an effort to win her over as they both swap personalities. Stifler is only teaching Jim to dance so he is allowed to attend the wedding, and of course plan the bachelor party, and Bear on a night with Jim's house empty provides strippers Fraulein Brandi (Amanda Swisten) and Officer Krystal (Nikki Schieler Ziering) for a bachelor party. This party is interrupted though as Stifler, Finch and Kevin didn't realise that Jim and Michelle's parents were having a special dinner so he can explain why he would be a good husband, and with everything coming at them they have to make up a story, and by the end the parents seem to understand, and liking a nice Stifler give him the ring as best man. The ceremony approaches, and more disasters happen in the preparations, such as Stifler feeding the ring to the Flaherty dogs and picking the poo up with a cake cup, and when Mary almost eats it thinking it is chocolate truffle Stifler quickly steals it and puts it in his mouth, kept there as they ask him what he thinks of it. We also see Michelle meeting Jim's Grandma (Angela Paton) and her being displeased that the bride is not Jewish, and Jim shaving all his pubic hair which thrown out the window gets sucked through the air vent and gets blown onto the wedding cake. Seeing an encounter with Finch and Stifler, Cadence finally sees Steve's true personality, unaware she is behind him, and at the same time he turned off the lights helping the ceremony flowers to grow, everyone is devastated and angry Jim tells Stifler to leave. With a rare feeling of guilt Stifler sees no choice but to help and get the florist for the wedding to prepare a new batch of flowers, with his football squad that he coaches helping the arrangements. Cadence is at first hateful of him, but she is glad that he has done a good deed for the big day, and agrees to have sex with him, but not before he has a meeting along with Finch and Kevin for Jim to say thank you to them. While Michelle turns to Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy) for advice, like he does for his son, for the right words to say in her wedding vows, Stifler is in the closet with someone he assumes is Cadence, but it is in fact Jim's Grandma, who was put in there by the ushers who put up with her complaining. Despite all the chaos before, the ceremony begins, Grandma smiling and winking at Stifler, with Jim's Dad assuming her happiness for the wedding, and Jim and Michelle are happily married. Jim and Michelle have their first dance which goes very well, and everyone else joins in, including Stifler with Cadence, while Finch has Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge) take him to her room to have sex in the bathtub. Also starring Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Lawrence Pressman as Head Coach, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1 and John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2. Biggs is still the awkward one trying to do things right, Hannigan is a little less seen but still nerdy and weird, Scott overdoes his sex-obsessed character that it is near crazy, Levy gets his moments being embarrassing but also helpful, Thomas is still lovably odd, and Nicholas does not much but give advice and smile. It is certainly nothing original like the first, there are more over the top sequences full of rude and crude humour, the strippers and dog poo eating being the highlights, and of course there is the happy ending with sentimentality, so overall it is a likable enough comedy. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i saw this film, I have to admit that Stifler appeared ready to be committed to an asylum, and was very OTT. I now think it's possible the best of the three. The 'dance off' in the gay bar and the dog pooh scene alone were works of comedy genius, but to see Finch come alive after being just plain odd in the second one also improved the film. Fair enough, it was a blatant Stifler Show but you play to your strengths, I just thank god they sidelined boring characters like Kevin and Oz. Anyhow, it's all about entertainment and the gags in this one were great... just sit back and enjoy it. Anyway, i'm sure everyone will have their own slant on this movie, but it's well worth checking out... just watch it more than once, the gags will still be funny the 10th time you watch it, and if your sense of humour is in the gutter like mine, you'll laugh till it hurts.</fullReview>

Jim (Biggs) and Michelle (Hannigan) are getting married, but of course in true Pie style nothing's gonna run smoothly with Stifler (Scott) around.This is a very funny movie and features a great and hilarious Stifler dance-off.Jim and Michelle have to get everything prepared and organised such as the FLOWERS before the big day, off course their will be help from both their parents. With Jim's Dad's (Levy) great wisdom and encouraging words the wedding goes as well as it can.There is also a pretty lady called Cadence (Jones) that catches Finch AND Stifler's eye, and the usual way that they get the girl switches, with funny consequences.This is a movie well worth watching if you liked the last two American Pie films.</fullReview>

The fans only disappointment in the third installment was the lack of Oz, Jessica, Vicky and Heather. The Wedding is more about the characters lives ahead and growing up it has more seriousness to it, which the first two were lacking.

		<fullReview>It leaves some men breathless, some speechless, all scared. It's a wedding... the single event some men fear more than anything else, and it's the reason we were gathered at the movies in 2003 with the third chapter of the "American Dopes" series of movies. Much like the other movies starring Jason Biggs as Jim Levinstein, the hapless kid from Michigan, there is a certain amount of sweetness and downright disgusting humor in American Wedding. No superglue this time, instead we have a "special haircut" ruining a wedding cake, a Caddyshack-type Baby Ruth bar incident, and Stifler being confused with which woman he's in a dark room with. The film chronicles the events leading up to his marriage with Michelle (you'll remember her as "One time, at band camp..." girl) from proposition to the full blown wedding. In between, there are hijinks involving the families getting along (By the way, Fred Willard plays Michelle's father, always a plus when you get to see him do comedy), bachelor parties that go awry, and Stifler being Stifler. Just when the viewer thinks this movie has been a complete waste of time, there is a certain amount of sweetness with Jim, his dad (Eugene Levy), and the whole wedding itself. Almost everyone is happy by the end of the film, even Finch when Stifler's mom stops by just to stop by. Thomas Ian Nicholas' character, Kevin, just seems to be there though, as he has very little to do or say, and Chris Klein's character from the first two movies is eliminated altogether. As vile as the humor occasionally is with the American movies, there is always an underlying message that time goes on, things change, and we all have to keep up, something other Hollywood movies sometimes forget. All in all, it's an alright movie, just don't each the chocolates.</fullReview>

But it was still kind of old and lacking in gross out comedies. They're getting weak and predictable. Unfortunately, what most audiences find amusing is people getting hurt or doing something very stupid and harmful to others. I would recommend this to finish up the trilogy. Just so you can see how it ends. Other than that, it's nothing I found hilarious. The "American Pie" trilogy was very over rated.

What an annoying character! I'd say that this was an enjoyable, solidly "B" movie, and worth the time. Allyson Hannegan is charming, and Mr. Levy was wonderful as well. I hope they follow up in a few years with something along the lines of "American Family." It could be rich with rips on the "family values" crowd in all their unbelievable hypocrisy (think Cheney refusing to photoed with his gay daughter, how Dubya tolerates his twins' penchant for following in Dad's footsteps a la drinking like "absolut" fishes, etc., yet showing up for church and acting as if they are "more Christian than thou" to everyone and their dog).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when the first two American Pie movies were great. I loved the first two, I laughed out loud so many times. But with American Wedding, I never even laughed and I only found 2 scenes even remotely amusing: Stifler at the gay disco and Stifler and grandma in the closet. This sequel is definitley a case of an overused idea. Even the opening scene that always involves Jim being embarrassed by his dad fell flat. Also, for some reason they made Stifler so much more obnoxious and disgusting. Plus, there is no way he would get the girl at the end. And the joke with Finch and MILF was funny the first 2 times, but isn't funny any more. Even the thrown in nudity wasn't too great. At least in the second film, we got the kiss between Jim and Stifler. Funny!FINAL VERDICT: I don't know what happened. Maybe they used a different writer or they just ran out of ideas. But, I can't recommend it. As a matter of fact, I feel this one brings down the greatness of the first two.</fullReview>

This film starts out promisingly with the same old Eugene Levy embarrassing Jason Biggs. Alyson Hannigan is cuter than ever but that's the only real bright spot. Sean William Scott suddenly can't act as he turns Stifler up to 11, Biggs is consistent, Eddie Kaye is also a bit over the top but is still OK. January Jones is exquisite in her attempt to make up for the lack of Tara Reid! But everything else in the film is too contrived. Bottom line...4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first American Pie movie. Great jokes and acting. In the sequel, American Pie 2, you got basically the same as in the first movie, but I liked it. However, this third and hopefully last movie of the series, is a major disappointment. First of all, this movie is devoid of the charming lack of seriousness, which characterized the two first movies. This time, it seems as if, the producers wanted to pass on some kind of cute message of love to the audience. In a movie like American Pie, this falls totally flat!Second, the plot is terrible. There is virtually no connection between the various scenes, they just seem as 25 independent scenes more or less glued together. Some scenes are actually awful. For instance, the scene in the gay bar, which must be one of the most appalling scenes, I have ever seen. Another example, the bachelor party. This scene is complete chaos. It makes no sense whatsoever, though the two girls are nice to look at. And what about the scene, where Stifler persuades the florist to open her store in the middle of the night after having abused her verbally. There is no explanation for this and it is completely unlikely.Third, the cast and acting. Several of the good characters from the first two movies have been omitted, which is a major drawback (perhaps these actors turned down their parts after having seen this awful script).I was wondering about the Kevin character in this movie. He does appear in the movie, but he is completely superfluous. I think, he may have 5 lines or so throughout the entire movie and there is absolutely nothing in the movie to defend his presence. Very strange.Stifler was cool in the two first movies, but this time, it seems as if he has lost the timing of his jokes. He is just not funny. The actor seems like he is annoyed having to play this stupid part, which I do not blame him. Jim is a shadow of himself due to this seriousness the producers obviously thought necessary to give him. The pubic hair cut scene is nowhere near the great glue/massage oil or the pie scenes from the two first movies.Go rent the two first movies, but forget about this one.This movie stinks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching AMERICAN PIE for the first time was a very nice experience, the movie made the humiliating scenes fantastic and it was very often funny I must say. But hoping really that it would be a lonely movie, in my dissapointment the second instalment were soon out on the cinemas. Having a bit hope cause the first was surprisingly funny I were really dissapointed seeing the not-funny AMERICAN PIE 2. So I really hoped that it wouldn't come another, but it did. Thinking that they really had done a bommer I was very surprised seeing the third and last. It is a funny movie!AMERICAN WEDDING is a movie that really made me laughs several times, and it has really got some really good scenes and my without doubt two favourites are; the scene with Stifler challenging super-gay on the dancefloor and the dominactress scene with chocolate souce, aggressive women, a really into dad and more. The movie switches with a nice cocktail between moral and wild imbaressing and stuff like AMERICAN PIE really know how to do!The whole thing opens with Jim sitting together with his girlfriend and coming wife, speaking and is really about to propose. So, she misunderstands a thing and caves under the table and starts blowing Jim! Jim gets to know that his weddingring is not in the box and soon his dad is on his way to help him! Well, typical AMERICAN PIE but again, it's funny...especially in this one! Stifler has gone really crazy and thinks with his dick 24 hours a day and really getting into stuff in this third movie. AMERICAN PIE: THE WEDDING is a bit dirtier and it is a bit more weird, but all the way it is more romantic, funny and well made than any of the others.STARS: 4/5</fullReview>

Not as horrible as some people say, and if you think that the truffle scene was gross, just watch Van Wilder. Then again I wouldn't watch this again, nor would I really watch most comedies of this type twice (a lot of the humour evaporates after the first time). Though I eventually forgot all about the missing characters, I was kind of ticked that they didn't even mention Chris Klein &amp; Mena Suvari's characters. After the movie was over I assumed that those guys had read the script and wanted nothing to do with AP3. Stiffler was ridiculously obnoxious right up until he "redeems himself". Why was everyone treating him with such hatred? I didn't understand why all of his supposed "friends" were so against him. Especially Michelle since she barely knew him. I would have felt sorry for him except he was being such a tool. Anyway, when all the other characters reacted like Stiffler was just some as*hole offensive jerk who should just leave because he was ruining the wedding, Stiffler came off, in effect, as unfunny, rude, and like he was ruining the wedding. Then out of nowhere he acquires a conscience and helps save the wedding? Oh, I see... growth. Yeah, that really goes with Stiffler's character. Anyway, as I said before, this movie is not that bad, but it is mediocre.Overall I would give this a 5/10 and not watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of charming American Pie I am soooo disappointed. They decided to make Stiffler main character; he is trying so hard he is overacting in almost every scene. There is no conflict: the only attempt at it is so Jewish grandma calling Michele "shiksa" and parents catching Jim at stupid moments. The actors are trying but the writer's failure to come up wth any plot cannot be saved by profane jokes. The only success is dancing scene at the bar and Paul Finch and Stiffler Mom scene as it brings back the memories of first movie back. So worth watching for those scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I didn't really like the first two movies, but I watched this with a friend who bought the DVD. It was horrible. There was not one funny moment and I think the role of Stifler ruined the entire movie. It might have been decent without his over-the-top dialogue and completely ridiculous antics.And why was Stifler the central plot of the movie? Every scene he was in (which was more than Jason Biggs) was like watching a train wreck. Nothing he said or did was funny.The entire movie sucked. Jason Biggs should have have been the star but he was awfully upstaged by Sean William Scott (whose face now makes me cringe).I don't recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time is precious. Especially when there are so many interesting and stimulating movies just waiting to be watched. That is why I think American Wedding is so bad: it kills time like a vacuum, leaving nothing after it. In fact, after having watched it I felt empty, stupid... just like after having eaten an insipid fruit or tasted spaghetti with no salt!It's just not my style to watch movies that work very hard to entertain and to provoke laughter, while failing miserably at both. I'm not against the idea that movies should be fun and relaxing: that's why I decided to see American Wedding in the first place. However, instead of feeling relaxed and amused, I felt tense (trying to figure out when the plot was actually going to start...it never did!) and bored.I think next time I'll go with Home Alone... Better yet, I'll go see one of IMDB's top 100 to bring some real taste into my evening...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first American Pie. The second one was okay. I almost walked out after a half hour of American Wedding, but gave it another half hour before I finally pulled the plug.The storyline seemed incoherent - which I can deal with if there were lots of funny moments. There weren't. I have no idea what everyone here was laughing so hard at, I didn't hear a lot of laughter from those in the theater today. Nor did I laugh much. Eugene Levy was still funny, he ALWAYS is funny. But there was WAY too much Stiffler, and he really wasn't interesting at all. It was really painful to watch every time he was on screen, which pretty much was ALL the time. The movie pretty much ended for me at the time that SWScott came onscreen.I didn't understand why they were following her around either, and going to Chicago, etc. It seemed really stupid. But whatever. At least I only spent $4.50, and some of the previews were good.</fullReview>

The story is pedestrian, the characters are one-dimensional and actually take away from the past enjoyment of watching these individuals grow and deal with life's issues (i.e., Stiffler), and they have to resort to old/seen it before toilet humor to try and score laughs. This movie was obviously made to cash in on the American Pie name, though same writer. I highly suggest you stay away from this.

		<fullReview>I am half way through viewing this film for the first time (the first of any of the American Pie series) and I have come here to express how pathetic a project this is; the writing is so dire, the script should never have been given the green-light for production. The whole bachelor party scene is just utterly devoid of inventiveness, rhythm, or pace. It is painful to watch. The editor must have had the absolute worst time cutting this to try and create some sort of comedic tension. My God. These films try so hard to be like Ferris Beuler's Day Off or any of the other amazing John Hughs films of the 80s but they fail so miserably.So lazily put together. So lazily conceived. The people running the studios are a**holes frankly. Young lawyer/Harvard types who don't have a single creative bone in their body and couldn't tell a paintbrush from a pencil.This is tragic. A film so desperate to become a cult hit but will never stand a chance. The John Hughes films of the 80s will live on for many years, this cr*p will just vanish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really hate to give a movie a bad review but this one just plain stunk and it did so needlessly. An obvious attempt on the part of the producers to squeeze a few more dollars out of us.So what was wrong with it? 1. This movie leads us down side stories that we think will go somewhere or at least end and yet many do not. I had to ask myself, "What was the point in that scene?" several times. 2. The character, Stifler (Seann William Scott) who was a favorite character from the first movies is played WAY over the top in this one. From frat-boy in the first two movies to the point of being clinically insane at times. 3. Many of the gags from the first movies are re-hashed and can be seen coming a mile away. There were a couple of laughs, but it certainly was not worth sitting through the whole movie.So much material to work with and so much potential in these characters and situations and yet it just does not work. It leaves us begging the question - did we need to see this? The answer would be a resounding - NO. Should have stopped at 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible waste of two hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite simply a terrible movie, with the bitter realization of time wasted tempered only slightly by a uptick in quality during the last half an hour. Stiffler, the "star" of the show, in this outing has degraded to a vicious, mentally handicapped individual with a bad case of tourettes (and a wicked case of over acting), distilled into a one dimensional caricature of the the "frat-boy" that we knew from the first outing. The other characters are pretty much more of the same -- take the fist movie and simplify each character to the most rudimentary first impression, and that becomes who they are entirely, with absolutely no breadth of character.This script is so weak and grasping that it obviously is a cash-in on the franchise before it's forgotten. The first one truly was a great movie with a lot of fairly innovative "it's funny because it's true" comedy (or at least a return to a type of comedy that had disappeared for a decade or so), the second was more of the same just with a bit of the quality and newness worn off and with the comedy reaching more into the realm of the horribly unrealistic slapstick, and this third was is just a terrible, horrible, almost criminal cash grab that's basically two hours of elementary school gross-out humor.</fullReview>

Uproariously funny and always raunchy closer to the 'American Pie' franchise this time with amiable schmuck Jim (Biggs) proposing to nympho Michelle (Hannigan ) and enlisting Finch (Thomas) and Kevin (Nicholas) as best men while failing to attempt the barring of the ever-horny Stifler (Scott, who clearly steals the entire movie every time he's onscreen in one of the funniest performances ever committed to celluloid) who manages to screw things up despite his (surprisingly) warm-hearted attempts not to. From its time-capsule hysterical opening sequence of Jim asking Michelle as his to the outrageous slapstick/double entendre bachelor party Stifler arranges (and kudos to major babes Swisten and Schiler Ziering) while Jim juggles his future, stuffy in-laws (Rush and the ever flappable Willard) to Stifler's unfortunate lengths of rescuing the wedding ring (the clear show-stopper) and oddly enough the genuinely funny warmth of Jim's ever calm dad (Levy, the greatest Canadian import since LaBatt's beer) the film has no reason to be so excellent in its executions of a tiring genre that has life for ? dare I say ? another installment. Never a big fan of the first two films overall but I admit when I'm wrong and whole-heartedly say one of the funniest films of the year. (Dir: Jesse Dylan)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as tasty as the previous two movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Wedding" is a still good and original comedy but it unfortunately never comes close to the high level of the previous two American Pie movies. There are several explanations to why this is.The first thing is because of the formula that already has been milked out a bit now in the previous two movies. All the freshness is gone and because of that the movie also becomes predictable at times.Second thing are the characters. For some reason the characters don't work out as good as in the previous two movies. They are not in college any more and they're no longer teenagers and are now part of the normal everyday society. The normal world doesn't exactly suit the characters and they work better in a teenage college environment. The characters had been changed a bit too much to fit into this movie with as a result that they are less funny and especially the sidekicks get very little interesting to do in this movie.I'm sounding negative but it still is a good and enjoyable movie that has some well conceived moments in it that are good for some serious laughs. Also what makes this comedy better than the average movie is the Stifler character played by Seann William Scott. He brings real life to the movie and his character is even more prominently present as in the previous two movies. His character truly carries the movie and is the main reason why this movie is a fun one to watch, even though compared to the first two American Pie movies it isn't nearly as good and fresh.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, they should have stopped after the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very much looking forward to the final part of the American Pie "Trilogy" after the disappointment of number 2 having heard that this would be a significant improvement. Having removed the supposedly more boring characters it was going to be an equal to the first of the series. How wrong they were. From the start it was clear that dialogue and direction were not going to be a strong point. Then throw in Stifler whose character development throughout the 3 films has been to swear more. Gone is the clever humour we saw in episode 1, replaced by very obvious set pieces that just are not funny. The film just comes across as a real mess, with Michelle out of her quirky environment of band camp, she has little to do that can be funny. Kevin is basically omitted (probably because he can't act), at least Jim's Dad is still there so that someone can actually deliver a line. I could probably see this appealing to 12-16 year olds that want to hear lots of swearing and naked women, but this is just a series of over-the-top, poorly done scenes. The audience is asked to believe that these kids that still look like there in High School are actually grown up now and it just doens't fit.Lets hope they stop here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent conclusion to a decent series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, here we are then with the third installment of the American Pie series. The first one was a refreshing take on the teen comedy. I'm not a massive fan of the genre, but thanks to good writing and interesting characters, the film worked. The second one was more of the same, but in spite of that it still managed to be entertaining enough to be considered 'good'. This third part again can be considered 'more of the same', except this time there's a wedding theme and, thankfully, the writers have isolated the dead wood from the other two films and dropped it. The dumb jock, Mena Suvari (good actress, crap character), Kevin's girlfriend...you get the point, have been dropped. This leaves us to concentrate on the more interesting characters - Jim, obviously but more notably Stifler, Finch and Jim's dad; who are the real stars of the series anyway. As usual, they're the ones that are relied on to bring in the laughs, and they do it to the standard that you'd expect. None of them are quite as funny as they have been and Stifler's character seems to have become more outrageous, rather than keeping in with what's gone before...but who cares in a film like this? Character coherency isn't too much of an issue anyway.The central theme of the wedding is how most of the jokes come about, and it creates four big set-pieces; two of which work, and two of which don't. Seeing Stifler dancing in a gay bar is hilarious and sure to delight everyone that sees the film, but even funnier than that is the part where Stifler hires two exotic dancers to 'entertain' the boys...at the same time that Jim has invited Michele's parents round for a 'chat'...oops! The two that don't work are more disgusting than funny...and I'm sure you'll see which parts I mean upon seeing the movie. As you might expect from the conclusion (hopefully!) of a series and one that sees two of it's characters tie the knot, there's a degree of sentiment here; but it does work, and it's even kind of nice to see after watching the characters 'develop' (somewhat, anyway) over the last two films.American Wedding is a decent comedy, and one that I would recommend to anyone that liked the other two films.</fullReview>

The characters seem well drawn, but it's not this film that's doing it. There are some pretty good moments of comedy, especially with Biggs and Levy discussing "father son" stuff.

		<fullReview>Wow. There are few things more interesting than the evolutionary forces of the market that push and pull something to ensure survival. I'm a strong believer in how market forces shape film, even our most exotic art films. This isn't art, of course, not in the usual sense. But it is a great example of how, in three simple installments, the form has adapted. The forces are shaped by TeeVee. Back in the 30s and 40s, the serialization model in films was driven by radio. So the features, the core of the meme, were imaginative. Its just the way radio works. Radio is a matter of words inventing vision in the mind, so is closer to literature. TeeVee is a matter of packetizing images and ideally branding them. Its a different approach to narrative, and a different set of market shapers.So the things that survive, do so because of the success of the selfishly branded image.This particular instance is interesting because it has adapted and survived. Indeed, the series may last a very long time. Its interesting because it focuses entirely on different dimensions of teen sex. Because the story here comes from an offhand joke in the original about "band camp," and the unusual use of a flute. That joke was expanded in the second one to involve a trumpet ? and to actually trigger story elements.Here, the joke has become entirely personalized and has transcended the implement. Oh, and its of interest because the recipient of the flute's attention was a nerdy surreptitiously sexy redhead in the first one. Here, she's the star, with a highly engineered personality, someone that other characters interact with.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return of the Stiffmeister</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two successful first installments everyone just about thought "American Wedding" was going to be the ultimate cash cow. Surprisingly it received better reviews than both prior installments (check out RottenTomatoes.com) -- and although it is indeed a marketing product (aren't they all?) it's a lot funnier, and sweeter, than it could have been.As far as stupid teen comedy films go, the "American Pie" trilogy is a lot of fun, mainly due to its quirky characters -- particularly Stiffler, who was originally intended to be the subject of jokes and cruelty in the original film (check out how he's just a co-character). His popularity grew, he was given a larger part in the sequel, and in "Wedding" he practically becomes the lead character.This is about Jim and Michelle's wedding. It does get sappy towards the end, just like "American Pie 2" did, but the beginning (like "Pie 2") -- preferably the first hour -- is an absolute hoot.Perhaps part of the reason these films are so successful is that they lampoon American traditions -- high school, sex, graduation, wedding, bachelor parties, etc. -- that have become awkward for first-timers and, as a result, can be quite funny when exposed for humor.Stiffler eating the "chocolate" is one of the funniest things I've seen in years.</fullReview>
