		<shortDescription>Best acting performance I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman's performance as Raymond Babbitt is,bar none,the best acting performance I have ever seen.I have never seen an actor get so deeply immersed in a character than Hoffman does in this film.He is excellent here,and he deserved nothing less than the Oscar he won for it.As for Tom Cruise,his performance as Raymond's childish and hotheaded brother is also worthy of note.To watch his character slowly shed his ignorance throughout the course of the film was indeed a delight.If you have not seen it,don't deprive yourself any longer.Buy it.It's a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie probably 7 or 8 times in the past three years, wrote a paper about it for my college film class last semester, and basically regard it as my favorite movie of all time. Where to begin with the praise for this movie? Let's start with the acting. Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor, and has been for a while. I'd watch him in any role. I was amazed at the way he was able to pull off this role. I've never seen a more deserved Oscar win. The vacant stare, the monotone voice, the screaming, it was unbelievable. Each time I watch it I am floored by his talent. Tom Cruise is also good, the villain of the story who undergoes such a subtle change that it's almost not visible until nearly the end. He is, however, perfectly suited for the flashy, egotistical character of Charlie, and I think he did a great job. The directing was unobtrusive and beautiful, for the most part just letting the action unfold, which is exactly the way it should have been done. It's a feel-good movie that does that and more, and I think nothing I've seen in the movies is as touching as the scene in the motel where Charlie discovers who "Rain Man" really is. I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. Absolutely wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why has it become "cool" to hate this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Levinson is one of the great screen directors of our time. He's most notable for being able to evoke subtly comedic discussions amongst his leading characters, save the rare occasion when his strained efforts backfire ("Toys" comes to mind). "Rain Man" (1988) is his crowning effort, his best achievement I can think of off-hand. It's considered a drama but it's also a true odd couple comedy, about two opposites who learn they have one common bond: their kinship.The Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a wealthy car dealer living the high life in California. He's just gotten in a shipment of Ferraris and he's going to make a killing on an upcoming deal for all of them, when his entire background comes back to haunt him in a single unfortunate moment during his newly acquired and quite happy life.Charlie's father has just died, leaving him an old sports car and rose bushes. But more painful than the fact that his father has died or that he was left simply with a car and some prize-winning rosebushes is the fact that Charlie had tried to put his ill-fated past behind him, and now it has caught up with him again. He has to face the reality of his father once again.This isn't really evident the first time you watch the movie. Charlie is angered at the fact that he got nothing more than some bushes and a vehicle, sure, but he admits he expected nothing more. What really angers him is that he has to face his father, dead or alive, once more; either through faded memories or by the realization that he is now dead and their friendship was never repaired.When Charlie finds out that his father's entire estate has been left to a single trustee, he schemes around and unmasks who the trustee really is -- his older brother he never knew he had, Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman), who lives in a homey mental institute and quotes the Bud Abbott and Lou Costello "Who's on first?" charade when he gets nervous.Charlie confronts his brother, who seems as though he doesn't recognize him. And in a moment of weakness, Charlie kidnaps his brother from his home, drives him back to California, and attempts to squeeze the money out of Raymond, who has no holding on the concept of money at all.Despite his lack of understanding regarding monetary value, Raymond is an idiot savant, and Charlie takes advantage of Raymond's mathematical skills by taking him to Las Vegas to count cards. After achieving a fortune they are thrown out of the casinos and left to face charges of kidnapping. The problem is, by the time it's all over, Charlie has formed an odd sort of bond with his brother. Long after the laughs settle the emotional impact of the story sinks in.The ending is the sort of rare conclusion that brings tears to the eyes. Throughout the film, Charlie is an arrogant, ignorant, greedy businessman who cares of no one but himself. By the end, however, he has learned more than he has in his entire lifetime from the brother he never had. And unlike a lot of the buddy films out there, we get to see the bonding between Charlie and his big brother, Raymond, form on a daily basis, until it is brought to a standstill.Dustin Hoffman gives his best performance in "Rain Man," one of such unmatched strength and brilliance that we often feel that we are really watching an autistic man on screen. Raymond Babbitt is one of the most memorable characters you will ever encounter as a viewer, and though Dustin Hoffman isn't necessarily a favorite actor of mine, I place his performance in "Rain Man" as one of the most convincing and touching performances of all time.Trying to put the reason that "Rain Man" is so great into words is simply impossible. It's got everything. And as humorous as Raymond Babbitt becomes, he never seems unreal or obnoxious. As I watch him every time I watch the movie, I completely forget Dustin Hoffman is playing him until I mentally remark on how well he is doing so. This is movie magic, folks.Hollywood has a fascination with characters like Forrest Gump and Raymond Babbitt, but -- even more so than Gump -- Raymond is never annoying. (That's not saying that Gump is, but...Raymond is even more touching and realistic.) Raymond is a fair bit more impaired than Forrest, and we feel for him even more (though which is the better film I could never say).By all means, see this movie. Drop whatever you're doing and rent it, buy it, watch it over and over. It's amazing. I don't care if I sound like a mainstream critic trying to get my quotes on the new Special Edition box of the DVD (yes, please!), I love this movie and I can't say enough good things about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this is Tom and Dustin's best performances by far. They are such a wonderful duo together. I love seeing how Tom reacts to Dustin's character. Two brothers, one being successful and the other mentally challenged, are finally reunited. They both learn how to live with each other and eventually learn to love each other. As for a best picture, I wasn't too sure. But the actors will impress you. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has wonderful characters and some great laughs. But also some very touching moments. You really have to like this movie. It's too memorable to miss.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is something of a great cinematic achievement that Rain Man became the great film it clearly is because the story surrounding it is interestingly Hollywood in itself.Four directors, six screenwriters, two cinematographers, eight producers, writers strikes, crew change, and a studio fighting for its life.All of the above are common knowledge but it doesn't hurt to remember these facts when viewing the award wining triumph of a movie that stands the test of time today. The film is so simple in structure it really needed something special to pull it out of the prospective banality of being "just another road movie about finding oneself", Rain Man achieves something special by tackling its subjects with very sensitive hands and splicing a believable human concept into the story via the incredible shows from its two leading men.Dustin Hoffman gives a magical moving performance as the Autistic Savant Raymond, the ultimate complement I can pay the performance is that it really is believable, both moving and clever rolled into one artistic result. Tom Cruise is equally as great in a role that called for drastic layer changes, a role that demanded much conviction from the actor taking it on, and Cruise gives the role much depth as he goes from shallow bastard to a very emotive and feeling human being, it's a great show that stands up to reevaluation these days. A performance that seems to have sadly been forgotten in light of Hoffman's film stealing show. With a film such as this you pray that the ending can do it justice, and I'm glad to say that there is no pandering here, it's an ending that says so much because it doesn't cop out, I thank god for those rewrites because the endings to the original scripts would of had me booting the TV set out of the window.Essential cinema. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the 80's, Dustin Hoffman &amp; Tom Cruise are a perfect duo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain Man is a moving story about two brothers, one a selfish yuppie named Charlie Babbitt who cares only about the importance of money and the other named Raymond who is a autistic and doesn't know anything about the importance of money. Charlie realizes that his father left three million dollars to Raymond and little to him, as he also realizes Raymomd is his brother! Charlie kidnaps Raymond from his residential home and begins a long journey and discovery that will forever change both their lives. Rain Man is a completely moving, emotional, funny, and unforgettable movie. Dustin Hoffman is one of my favorite actors and plays his most memorable role as well as Tom Cruise, who gives a great performance that helped a lot in launching most of his career. The direction by Barry Levinson is stunning and of course, his best yet. Overall, the film is a timeless classic that moves me in every way. This is definitely one of the best films of the 80's and one of my all time favorites. Yea, definitely, definitely, recommend it! Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. Rain Man incorporates moving drama, timeless scenery and unbelievable performances from Dustin Hoffman and even Tom Cruise who up to this point in film history was known for typical chick flicks or films in which his potential was not shown, even the color of money couldn't make him look like any kind of decent actor. Yet in Rain Man he isn't bad, but I suppose it is very clear and easy to say that Dustin acts him off the screen. The screen is a simple tale of brotherly love. Dustin plays Raymond "The Rain Man" Babbitt, the long lost, supposedly autistic brother of Charlie Babbitt (Cruise). As Charlie finds out he has a brother never revealed to him by his father he feels let down and betrayed, and even more so that now his father is dead and leaving his estate, to the value of $3.000.000 to his brother, and not to himself. So Charlie in his situation decides to take Raymond away from the medical institution he was left in, and goes on a huge road trip, not willing to give his brother up, unless the institutes settles his share of his father's assets. But as this slow but intriguing film goes on, the bonds get stronger, and you can see the devotion settling in around them as they establish some common ground. And so when the end of the film comes and the brothers are ripped apart, even though really you know they should be allowed to unite it is extremely saddening. The end scene is particularly good, and very emotional, and the fact Barry Levinson has made characters the audience can genuinely care for, it means that the overall effect on the viewers is elevated to a whole new and amazing degree. It is brilliant. Don't deny this film it's worth because of technicalities and the fact it doesn't relay the correct message, and praise the quality of its creation. Which is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best and most touching film productions to ever grace the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows the way forward for issue driven movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Cruise stars as a used car salesman, who is angry when his father's inheritance is left to his older autistic brother (Dustin Hoffman), whose existence had not been revealed to him.The film is built around its two assured central performances. Hoffman gives an excellent portrayal of a man with autism, totally unable to comprehend the real world around him. Cruise is no less impressive. While he is essentially playing to type, his character's attitude changes so gradually throughout the film that you barely notice, and without Cruise's subtle performance this transformation would be much less credible.This is a highly commendable film, which, despite tackling a tricky subject, refuses to succumb to sentimentality. In giving autism such publicity, the film has hopefully helped to lessen the stigma brought on by ignorance of this condition.Rain Man's great success is that it shows the way forward for issue driven movies in Hollywood. Its success at the box office demonstrates that taking a risk can pay off in spades, provided that the film is good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant when you think about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thinking of the way different movies seem to be good. Some have lots of action, others a bunch of special-effects. But then it strikes you, that what represents real depth, real quality is when a movie can be good without those features. When it's the dialogue, the story and the acting that strikes you. This film has really only two characters, all others play only minor roles (Cruise's girlfriend has some importance though). Two characters basically, and one dialogue - that's all you need when you've got a script as good as this, and two such great actors. Only that is brilliant. But this film also has such fine, very true episodes, small stories in the larger film. One example is when Ray watches court TV with the working class woman and her many children out in the countryside...it's such a fine picture, just outstanding. ALL IN ALL A GREAT FILM!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RAIN MAN (1988) **** Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Valeria Golina, Bonnie Hunt. My all time favorite contemporary film.Brilliant Oscar-winning Best Picture film about quick-tempered exotic car salesman Charlie Babbitt (superlatively played by Cruise) who finds himself bilked out of his estranged father's inheritance and discovering an older brother, Raymond, (Hoffman flawlessly brilliant, Best Actor), an institutionalized autistic savant, and 'kidnaps' him in their dad's Buick Roadmaster for a cross-country odyssey of self-reflection and genuine sibling bonding. Poignant, funny, and moving character study with expert direction by Barry Levinson (Best Director and appears as a mental health envoy). Ethereally Oscar nominated haunting score by Hans Zimmer. Best scene: Cruise learning why Hoffman was "sent away." Life-affirming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good drama that gives an idea of what living with an autistic person must be like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not very difficult to see why this movie won four Oscars and was nominated for four more. The academy loves movies about people with difficult lives or with a handicap. Sometimes it almost feels like they are desperate to show that they too have a heart and so a director who hasn't won anything so far just has to make a movie with such a subject and he can be sure that he will hit the jackpot. Does that also mean that those movies are always excellent? No, although I wish they were. But it has to be said, not all of those movies are bad either, take for instance this "Rain Man". That's certainly a movie that deserves a closer watch.When the selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt hears that his father has left behind a fortune after his death, but that he won't get it, he is furious. He has never had a good relationship with his father, who threw him out as a teenager, but he sure hoped for more than a now antique convertible. And to make things worse for Charlie, he hears that all the money goes to Raymond, an autistic man who he has never seen before in his life, but who appears to be his brother. And if that shock isn't yet big enough, the man also appears to be able to calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy, but doesn't even understand what money can be used for. Enraged by all this 'injustice', Charlie kidnaps Raymond from his residential home, but then finds out how difficult it is to live with a man who only can live with his fixed routines...This wouldn't have been a typical eighties movie if there hadn't been a selfish yuppie in it of course, but I must say that it didn't bother me this time. The main reason for that is because it accentuates the contrast between the two men even more. Charlie has nothing else but money on his mind, while Raymond doesn't even know what money is. That's without any doubt a very smart idea which makes this movie work. And that's not the only good thing about this movie. The acting for instance is also very good. Especially Dustin Hoffman is excellent, but that has of course much to do with the role that he is playing. Still, his performance is very believable and remarkable. And even though I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I must say that he was really very good in this movie. The role he was playing seemed to be written for him.All in all this is a very good movie that sure deserves to be seen. The acting and the story are far above average and give a good idea of what it must be like to live with an autistic person. I'm convinced that this movie certainly doesn't deserve a rating lower than 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it took me 21 years to watch this movie.Literally, the first time when I saw this movie was when it was released and I was back then a kid of 9 years who barely could understand the delicacy of human characters portrayed in the movie.And finally when I watched the movie again, I was 30 and boy oh boy,I was blown over.What a performance by Dustin Hoffman!!!Is it his best so far?Well, may not be, coz he is such a fine actor and he has so many good movies in his kitty.But truly it was one of his most memorable ones.And Tom Cruise, oh man, this bloke can act.I have always been so much skeptic about his acting skills.But I am happy that I have been proved wrong.He can act, thats for sure and this movie is a documentary proof of it.The best thing about this movie is of course the chemistry between them, a spoilt brat and an autistic person.The director handles such an issue with such panache that you are compelled to emote with the protagonists.Valeria Golino did an excellent job in her small role.She really sparkled in the elevator scene.The rest of the cast did a fine job, too.Overall, it is a memorable movie backed by power house performances.Don't ever take the risk of missing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlie's Quest to Become Whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Sorry, I do not think Ray is the center of the movie. It is about Charlie Babbit; it is how his relationship with Ray purges him of all his hatred and anger towards his father. Ray is the front of the picture as baseball was in Levinson's THE NATURAL. Like THE NATURAL, this is great moral depth to the movie. We meet Charlie as a ruthless, cruel, heartless, greedy monster at the beginning lying and cheating pushing his girl and friend with a whip and a chair. This is the Charlie who hates his father; his quest for money to compensate for the father's love he was denied when he ran away. In a catatonic trance, his girlfriend tries to break him out of. She is so great; I always adored Valeria Golino; what a wonderful actress that can convey such empathy and caring for others. The whole movie is a liner path of Charlie as during his quest for revenge and wealth something fascinating happens; he connects with his brother, has empathy for his father who cast Ray out to protect him. It happens at a little motel Cruise conveys the astonishment and disabusing at learning that the heartless creep he despised loved him beyond measure. Cruise has this epiphany where he mutters, agitated,"that is why they sent you away."This is the core of the film. Charlie, very slowly, in caring for Ray changes existentially and morally irreparably; by the end, he will never be the evil Charile we met at the beginning; he has been helped more than Ray. He is whole now; he can love. The scene with Levinson, in a cameo as the psychiatrist, is one of Tom Cruise's best scenes in any movie. Watch how understated the emotion is for Ray. How we are not milked like cows in E.T. or STARMAN. I love how the anger is now in protection of Ray before it served only Charlie Babbit. It is the manifestation of true love, not the pagan bringing the light cowardly forgery, all real love is sacrifice. It is giving of yourself to help others and it always comes with a price. When Hoffman leans his head, touching foreheads with Charlie; the first physical contact not only allowed by Ray but initiated; this is the movie, my friends, Charlie became whole. It shakes Charlie, he turns his back, Ray mutters."my main man, Charlie, my main man."The film was never intended to be about Ray; this film is about Charlie Babbit. It is about his transforming through the performance of good, initially for evil reasons, and how it transforms him into a whole, loving man. The thematic structure is very similar to THE NATURAL. The same struggle of good and evil; the eventual transformation of the person, by his doing of good, into a completely different person. It is a masterpiece; Levinson made so many of these. He is one of the treasures of the American Cinema. Yes, the Light transforms all who enter into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's a rarity: a film that gets a mental disability RIGHT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of the few people who can personally relate to Raymond Babbit's condition. I was diagnosed with autism a long time ago. Because of this, I have tougher standards when it comes to movies that deal with mental or physical disabilities. Too often, I see films patronize these people as saints, even when they do almost nothing for themselves throughout the film. In my view, when it comes to dealing with "disadvantaged" people, I feel these figures should honestly overcome the odds despite or even because of their disabilities, or be recognized for whom they are (in a supporting light) for both their good and not so good traits ("Rain Man" takes the latter approach). I have no qualms when I say that I was not inspired by the "based on true events" stories of "The Elephant Man," "Radio," and "The Blind Side," because I felt these movies patronized disadvantaged people whom I felt had little agency for themselves.But, "Rain Man," on the other hand, gets it right. Almost EXACTLY right. And it gets a rare 10/10 from me too.Let's start with the treatment of the Raymond Babbit character. He has mid-functioning autism, and he will be like that for the rest of his life. Though he's quick with math and card counting, he will never understand the concept of money or be able to function on his own. And the film wisely does not set him up as a figure to be hailed. Admired? Perhaps. All the same though, while Raymond does grow a little in that he allows a little more flexibility into his daily schedule and begins to share a bond with brother Charlie, he's still a mostly static character has some very positive (math and memorization) and very frustrating (takes things too literally, obsessive fears of the unknown world) characteristics.The real hero of the film, is his brother Charlie. And Charlie undergoes a REAL transformation. You actually watch him grow and change as he forces himself to take care of his brother. By the time he was trying to make a case to become his brother's guardian, I honestly believed his words and felt he had undergone a dramatic, yet subtle, change. The film handles his arc very delicately here; lots of small moments lead to the progression of his character.As almost everyone has stated before, the acting is superb in this picture. Dustin Hoffman is perfect as Raymond, absolutely perfect. His facial ticks, his refusal to look into eyes, his meltdown when he hears the smoke detector, it's all there. He truly sets a golden standard when it comes to playing autistic characters, or any character with a mental disability, for that matter. And Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as the yuppie brother Charlie. Admittedly, this does play right into his 1980's persona. But the way he transforms from being so immature and ignorant to becoming a caring person is so honest, so well done. I know it's easy to bash Tom Cruise these days, but when I watch this movie, I can't help but hold very high admiration for him."Rain Man" has held up well since it's 1988 release (my year of birth, in fact). Even today, though we know far more about autism, "Rain Man" still remains a smart insight into the condition. "Rain Man" gets both its story, and the issue of autism, RIGHT. And that is why it will continue to be appreciated by generations of film viewers for years to come.(Oh, and did I mention that Hans Zimmer's film score, his first to be nominated for an Oscar, is awesome as well?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie without knowing whatever the story is about except that Dustin Hoffman is in it and so expect this film to be of some standard after seeing many other Dustin's films: Marathon Man, The Graduate, Papillon. It's also because the DVD was on sale at S$9.95 so I just bought it out of curiosity after seeing other people buying it.Dustin does not disappoint; his acting is amazing. He plays the autistic older brother very well, funny and charming. But the story is only average.You can only put so much humor between 2 people as they start a journey of self-discovery. I watched it only once and that is enough. I'd have to put this film aside for a while before I can watch it again and find it interesting.The conversation between the brothers get boring after a while. The film is too long- over 2 hours. I'm tired of Tom Cruise's grumbling after a while and Dustin, playing autistic, can only say those few lines and interesting as they are, it's once too many times.I can't believe it's rated so high at 8.0/10. I'd rate it only 3/5. Good rental, but not worth keeping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but the key is in the detail!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good film that really helped the audience to understand autism and how much of an impact it can have in peoples lives, what I liked about it is it didn't dwell on this and instead had a great storyline that involved autism, rather than completely revolving around it like some kind of unique selling point.Hoffman's acting was superb and it was really hard to imagine him as anything else but autistic, he really got into the character and there were no obvious moments when he clearly was not in his autistic character, which really helped the flow of the film. On the other hand Cruise is an actor who I have always disliked, and this film was no different, he played his same old cool guy character, always wearing ruddy sunglasses, so frustrating. However even for him his realisation at the end of the film was sufficient enough to carry the end of the film even though in my own eyes the film ended fairly poorly.The ending just showed that life would carry on just as it had done before they had even met, and the most frustrating thing is that Cruise's money problems were never properly figured out, which was the whole reason he did this in the first place, yes he gambled but this never really explained the main storyline ending. As well as Cruise's reaction to his girlfriend having kissed his brother which was also unexpanded. Other moments such as Hoffman just leaning on his brother lightly obviously showed that Cruise had made a connection, but still why could he not have done that earlier, for someone with autism that situation would have been no different to any other, as well as Hoffman telling jokes, so the story became more fantasy based than based on any kind of real fact.It was this kind of flawed storyline which showed a lack of research while writing the film, which really showed especially towards the end of the film which prevented it from being a truly great movie. In spite of this it is still a very good movie that shows the expansion of Cruise's character although against his character type, it is still good to watch and enjoy, but lacks the realism of a film great.Good but the key is in the detail and this film just didn't deliver in terms of realism, especially on such a sensitive and misunderstood subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Rain Man in 1989, I thought I was witnessing something very tragic and terrible. Overwhelmed with pity for Hoffman's character, I never gave the film's contents a second thought. Then, in 2004, I finally learned why I had been subjected to so much abuse during my childhood and adolescence by teachers and healthcare professionals that I can not sleep a wink at night. Yes, like hundreds of thousands of angry adults, I was diagnosed with a higher-functioning form of autism. And then my pity for Hoffman's character, or any semblance of respect for the man who wrote him, was replaced by something much, much worse. There is fear, there is anger, and then there is outright hatred. Among autistic individuals who grew up in the 1980s, Ronald Bass is easily one of the most hated men who has ever lived, and his attempt to backpedal to take into account the fact that autism is a spectrum rather than some crippling disease that simply must be cured has only made it worse for him.Aside from being very badly written (real people with high-functioning autism do not scream, cry, and hit themselves just because a variation occurs in their plans), it is also plain ignorant. This is not only apparent in the words of the performers, it is also apparent in the words of its supporters. Dustin Hoffman once said that playing this role was very easy because his character was essentially in a cocoon, while one commenter here tells us that character is "totally unable to comprehend the real world around him". Both show such a ridiculous ignorance of autism that it would be funny if this matter were not so damned serious. Even today, as people try to tell us to our faces that we are not autistic because we do not scream and cry when someone breaks wind in our direction, we struggle to get our voices heard among so-called charities that are ostensibly set up for our benefit, yet do not allow our input. Supporters might call Rain Man the way forward for "issue films". I call it dehumanisation.It also strikes me as flatly ironic that Tom Cruise, a man so ignorant that he makes creationists seem reasonable, does not like to emphasise his involvement in this film when autism has exploded into a burning issue on the world stage. That should honestly tell everyone who has not yet learned what real people with autism think of the matter all they need to know. The reason why Cruise does not point to Rain Man and claim this is evidence that he knows something about the suffering of the neurodivergent that he also helps contribute to is because a smart agent researched the issue properly and informed him that real organisations representing the autistic such as Aspies For Freedom would have his guts for garters. It also says a lot about a film, and none of it good, when he happens to be the most convincing performer involved. None of the other actors save Hoffman seem remotely convinced about the dialogue they are delivering, and in fact some of them look very concerned that they are coming across as ignorant. Rightly so.It is not often when a singular problem so utterly destroys a film, but the bad writing in Rain Man just utterly takes the cake. In Philadelphia, a real blueprint for so-called issue films, one key piece of dialogue from Tom Hanks describes the stigma and isolation of being infected with an illness that is almost universally fatal. Philadelphia gets it right because it goes to great pains to emphasise that the illness itself is bad enough, but it is the attitude of the beholder that makes it as unbearable to live with as it is. And while Rain Man attempts to do the same, it fumbles the ball by not just displaying ignorance on the part of everyone around Hoffman, but by practically announcing that its makers were just as ignorant, if not more so. Now, with reliable testimonies to the effect that such directors as Tim Burton or Steven Spielberg are on the autistic spectrum, the silence about the erroneous nature of films like Rain Man is literally killing us.You see, in the hysteria that films like Rain Man help to whip up, quacks are convincing parents to use unsound and unsafe medical therapies on their autistic children, with total disregard for the fact that such therapies can and already have resulted in fatalities. Autism cure charities attempt to block the autistic out of discussions of their own affairs, and attempt to negate our objections through exclusion. So when I tell you that Rain Man is not the Schindler's List or Philadelphia equivalent its defenders proclaim, but more akin to Triumph Des Willens, I want you to understand my full meaning here. Over a decade ago, I went to a museum in which products from eras gone by were exhibited. One exhibit, essentially a hall of shame, showed us ugly artifacts such as Darkie toothpaste or other such racially stereotypical adverts that would only be acceptable in a society where a social minority is legally subjected to second-class citizenry. And if we lived in a society that cared as much about the autistic as Ronald Bass would like us to believe he does, Rain Man would be part of a similar exhibit.Rain Man is a two out of ten film. I wish it were possible to give negative scores, but c'est la vie. That people mistake it for a good film about autism is a mark of shame upon the entire human race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To paraphrase Raymond, Rain Man is mediocre. Definitely mediocre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be just a lot of hot air, but I think the movie and Hoffman's award-winning performance are over-rated. I'll admit that, typically, I'm too cynical to buy a feel-good movie, and ultimately that's what Rain Man wants to be. I'm especially suspicious of movies that use mentally slow characters and their supposed child-like innocence to convey difficult themes like what's right and wrong in the world (see Forrest Gump and Sling Blade). To me, these characters are too often the result of lazy screenwriters. The characters have moments of genius that never ring true, moments that appear far beyond their mental capabilities. These moments are always used to covey some deep truth about us or society. Then, during the rest of the movie, they can barely get dressed or tie their own shoes. I don't buy it.It doesn't help that screenwriter Ron Bass draws his characters so poorly. While Tom Cruise does an adequate job of revealing Charlie as a crying-on-the-inside jerk, Bass never really develops the character. Charlie is shown to be a selfish jerk at the beginning of the film and stays that way throughout. Sure, he lightens up a little at the end, and why not? He just paid off a debt incurred through shady business dealings and won $100,000 at blackjack. Not a bad day. I'd feel a lot better, too.As for Hoffman, well, to paraphrase Pauline Kael, a collection of ticks and weird behavior do not make a great performance. As excellent screenwriter William Goldman says in Premiere magazine, there is nothing special about Hoffman's acting, which he describes as being in the "drunks and retards" category. "Actors kill for those parts," he says. "They love to slur and stagger and drool." These Scent of a Rain Man roles, as another writer in Premiere coins them, pass for great acting. In fact, eight of the last 10 Best Actor awards belong in this category. (Including two for Tom Hanks, who, ironically, actually deserved the Oscar for his work in Big the year Hoffman won for Rain Man.)Rain Man boils down to a fish-out-of-water buddy road movie. Cliches are abundant and the formula is familiar. Of course, this shouldn't be surprising given Bass' lukewarm track record. His filmography proves he has all his cliches covered: drunks (When a Man Loves a Woman), retards (Gardens of Stone), psychos (Sleeping With the Enemy) and the always crowd pleasing triumph over adversity (Dangerous Ground, which was originally titled the laughably putrid My Posse Don't Do Homework). Don't even get me started on My Best Friend's Wedding or the super sappy How Stella Got Her Groove Back and What Dreams May Come. That none of these films, on the whole, have received even better than average reviews is telling. Perhaps if Rain Man hadn't been helped by high-priced actors and director Barry Levinson, it, too, would have been seen for what it is: Mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain man is one of the best movies of the 1980s', and it has without doubt, one of the best performances ever seen on film. Dustin Hoffman was amazing as Raymond Babbitt, an autistic man, whose younger brother, Charlie, played quite well by Tom Cruise, abducts him from the institution he is in order to get his share of inheritance money. The character of Charlie is very selfish and greedy, but as the film goes on, he changes for the better. He takes Raymond clear across the country by car because Raymond won't fly. Watching this film again made me realize that it is really one of the greatest films I've seen. It's a bittersweet story of brotherly love, dramatic at times, but has a great deal of comedy blended in. This is a film to be cherished for generations. I highly recommend Rain Man. The performances by both Dustin Hoffman, who won the Oscar for best actor (very well deserved!), and Tom Cruise are outstanding. I believe this to be one of the first films that Cruise had a real substantial character with depth to him. It's no surprise that Rain Man won Academy Awards for it is a very touching story. Great from beginning to end, brilliantly written, Rain Man will always remain one of the best movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood always believed that if a movie dealt with a serious theme in an entertaining manner it was somehow worthy of consideration which is why so many second-rate films like "Rain Man" ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. As 'Best Pictures' go "Rain Man" wasn't quite the worst of them but you can't help feeling it trivializes its subject which is played almost entirely for comedy or sentimental value. If it's enjoyable, and in its way it is, it is due entirely to the two principal performances of Dustin Hoffman, (an Oscar for best actor), and Tom Cruise, (no nomination, but thoroughly deserving of one).They play estranged brothers reunited after the death of their father. Hoffman is an autistic-savant, (definitely qualifying as a handicap; definitely several rungs up the Oscar ladder), whose facility with numbers proves a definite plus when it comes to playing the tables in Las Vegas. (The journey from first meeting to final parting also qualifies this as a road-movie). Cruise is the initially venal younger brother who wants to use Hoffman's 'talents' for his own ends but, this being a Hollywood movie of the inspirational variety, it isn't too long before bonding takes place and at the time Cruise's persona was such that playing a bad guy wasn't really on the cards.If anyone ever doubted in the early days that Cruise could act all they had to do was to look to this and "The Colour of Money" where he gave his Oscar-winning co-stars as good as he got. The film's director was Barry Levenson, formerly as script-writer who graduated to making his own films with the marvelous "Diner" and whose best films tended towards autobiographical pieces set in his native Baltimore. "Rain Man" represented his attempt at tackling a 'big' subject. It had all the ingredients for popular success and it gave him the Oscar but it's still a bland, formulaic film typical of what the big studios were churning out at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely movie for so many reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have just watched this again after many years. A really good movie.By now Rain Man is a time capsule for the acquisitive thrusting 1980's - and it is great to watch simply to see how films were made back then, what they looked like and how they told their stories. This film reminded me of the movie Wall Street - with Gordon Gekko as the greedy badie. Cruise is on that spectrum, greedy, mean and selfish. Gekko has no redemption, but Rain Man is, slowly but surely Cruise's redemption. It's fine to see it unfolding.In a believable way, Cruise (Charlie Babbitt) slowly comes to terms with the facts that a) he has an older brother, Hoffman (Raymond Babbitt) that he never knew he had (thus compounding his contempt for his now deceased father), and b) his Autistic brother has really profound needs, but exceptional gifts. Cruise is the dynamic part of the pairing and gives an excellent performance going through shock, denial but eventually acceptance of the new realities. In return, Raymond slowly undergoes subtle changes in response to his brother Charlie and the experience of the road trip - in small ways he does learn to relate to Charlie and he acquires skills that he would not have acquired had he stayed forever in the Home. It's delightful to see the brothers slowly come to accept each other in their own ways.By today's standards Rain Man is a slow movie lacking in polish glitz and refinement. It's dated in the way it looks and the way it tells it's story - but I like it for that. Rain Man is also a forgotten movie, for some reason. This is a great shame as it is a really good film, with Cruise showing strongly. It is also a complete tour de force by Hoffman - who gives arguably his finest ever performance rightfully collecting the Best Actor Oscar.So - watch Rain Man - a lovely movie for so many reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story departs from a supposedly common premise about a sleazy scheme of a brother, into one of brothers, distanced by time and disability, bonding together on a road trip. The developed story and screenplay is really very nice. They show at first how Charlie is perceivable as a bit inhumane to Raymond. But later as the movie progresses, it shows how Charlie slowly grows affection to his distanced brother. From acting point of view, it's one of the definition work that puts Tom Cruise acting abilities on the map for recognition. on the other side, Dustin Hoffman is also worthy of praise to have been able to portray, quite realistically, an autistic person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman, off the record, was the best actor in this film. Tom Cruise, of course, is an amazing actor, but Hoffman took all the spotlight.This is about how Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) found out after his father died, that he had a brother, Raymond (Hoffman), in which his father left a fortune to and only gave an upset Charlie not what he "deserved". Charlie then finds out that Raymond has autism and they end up traveling cross country.... Would continue but it would be a spoiler.&nbsp;Any who, this movie was great. I've never seen better acting then what Hoffman did in this film. He was outstanding playing an autistic 'Rain Man'. His movements all the way down to the things that he would say were outstanding. This is an amazing film. I recommend it to everyone.&nbsp;</fullReview>

That's what movie is about. You watch it all 2 hours long just like you are about to cry and the most important thing here is quality of Dustin Hoffman. Seriously, I've never seen that kind of acting before. He is a real legend.Scenario was the best but finale was little sad.

		<fullReview>The rain man is a story that emphasizes the brotherhood between the two man. The older brother has autism which irritates the younger brother, but they are becoming more and more friendly as they travel along the road. (The younger brother could earn a lot of money owing to his older brother, who is really good at memorizing numbers. The younger brother could earn money from the casino, and it helped him to pay off the debt of his company.) I thought it was so moving that I wanted to watch it over and over again. Also, it was realistic because it can happen in the real world. I think almost all sisters and brothers have something in common. They don't know the importance of their brother or sister, but they learn it as the times passes or as they communicate each other more and more. So, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel touched and the greatness of the brotherhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry Levinson's Rain Man was a seemingly funny heartbreaking and powerful drama about a selfish yuppie named Charlie Babbit (played by Tom Cruise) a young man who doesn't even know he has a brother until him and his girlfriend go visit an institution and then he finds out that he does have a brother named Raymond (played by Dustin Hoffman) just a few days after their father passed away. This was a god road trip picture which tries to teach us only one life lesson and that no matter who you are we are all created the same and that we should go by the golden rule of respect for one another even though there are some people that are different than others and we should respect that. Director Barry Levinson has crafted a heartwarming drama that took home 4 Oscars at the 61st academy awards. Not only this was a pretty sad and powerful film it also had it's comedic moments just like Nobody's Fool, and The Descendants.</fullReview>

Although it is rightfully recognized for its superb acting, terrific dialogue, and perfect chemistry of dramatic and comedic moments; many people forget that it is the ultimate story of brotherhood. Aside from Golino being a little annoying at times, the movie is near flawless; it even dates really well, especially for being filmed in the 1980s. An unexpected success, with many involved in the project doubting its potential. Likely one of the last times Tom Cruise will ever get a second-billing.***? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rainman is a true original from 89, you'd like even if you're not into dramas. Cruise really comes across well as a selfish yuppie who runs a car business, who's father's just passed away leaving poor old Charlie, nil. The two really never got on, and left on pretty nasty terms, which is the impression we get, if Cruise's almost blank reaction, is anything to go by. Surprise, surprise, Charlie discovers a brother he never knew, who's autistic, played with flawless precision by Oscar win, Hoffman, which still looking back on it, today, just recently, is still an amazing piece of acting work. With the money going to Raymond, Charlie must find a way to retrieve his deserved share, taking older brother for a ride, going cross country. It becomes fun seeing Hoffman's temper tantrums irk Cruise, who's not equipped to handle this situation, yet over the course of a week, they really get to be good mates, so when parting time comes, it's actually sad, not that they're really parting. This is the greatness of the film, it's journey where Cruise must finally accept his brother for what he is, an autistic genius, especially with numbers, and childlike. And Hoffman has likes too, like Apple juice and K mart clothes. They're even have to crash a family's house, as Raymond starts up again, as he never misses an episode of Final Jeopardy. Valerie Golino adds sexy appeal as Cruise's girlfriend, where Raymond stumbles into the bedroom during an intimate moment. Hoffmasn's so creative with his character, mannerisms speech. Like autistic people, they are still alive inside, the bath scene, with Raymond screaming madly, was an unsettling moment. Barry Levinson makes a cameo as a doctor staff, near wrapping up time, in a film you can't really stop to finish watching the next day.</fullReview>

Compared to Wall brook, Raymond probably had a lot of fun for that 1 week, but it would be a huge commitment for Charlie to look after him ongoing - at a great cost to his personal liberty.

Then, enters his brother(Dustin Hoffman) who is the sole owner of his father's proprietary. So, Charlie Babbit abducts him and tries to gain his favor.

It begins with 'selfish yuppie' in Charlie attempting to get more financially from his father's will through his unknown brother for his own purposes. However just spending a single week together, the two find brotherly love. This film leaves the audience to ponder how despite appearances, we are all very similar.

He also discovered his father left a very large sum of money in a trust for a beneficiary he does not know. Upon further discovery, he learns the beneficiary is actually his older brother Raymond. Raymond diagnosed as an autistic savant, has a hard time learning and communicating. Charlie cannot believe that his father would leave so much money to a person who has no concept of money. Charlie kidnaps Raymond from the institution in an effort to get half of the inheritance. After Charlie learns that Raymond will not get on a plan to LA, he drives across country. During their journey, together Raymond's eccentrics drive Charlie crazy. Raymond will not go out in the rain; he will not travel on busy highways, forcing Charlie to take an alternate route on less traveled roads delaying the return back to LA even more. On their way to LA Charlie stops in this little town, this is where he finds out that Raymond is very intelligent when it comes to numbers. It is at the next stop at a hotel when Charlie starts to remember that what he thought was a childhood imaginary friend actually turns out to be Raymond. He also discovers that Raymond was put in the institution because Raymond accidentally hurt Charlie when he was young. Over all Charlie, starts to see Raymond in a different way, at first Charlie is harsh and comes across very mean. As he gets to know Raymond he starts to accommodate Raymond's needs, he even tries to get close. This is the point where the overall theme fits in, that just because a person is autistic or has a handy cap, does not mean they cannot have feelings. This is very clear in the scene where Raymond, being asked if he wants to stay with Charlie or return to the institution, he say yes to both. In this scene, you can see Raymond has feelings for Charlie because he is allowing Charlie to touch him. Raymond actually leans his head on Charlie's, showing a connection. Over all this, remind me of the movie called I am Sam. I am Sam is a story about a mentally challenged man fights to keep his daughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman at their finest. If one thing is for sure, is that it's not easy to create a good movie with basically 2 actors throughout the whole movie without a touch of brilliance from both actors.Tom plays a hardy, egoistic man (Charlie) who lost his estranged father, and found out that he doesn't get his fair share of his wealth.Dustin plays an autistic savant (Raymond) who can be extremely annoying at times due to his constant whining if he can't follow his routine every single day.It's just beautiful to see how these two start to get to know each other, tolerate each other's annoying habits.If you are someone who likes meaningful movies, this movies is surely a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man is a film for everyone to relate, laugh and cry in this exciting story of friendship and overcoming. We see this fantastic character who is Raymond Babbit (Dustin Hoffman), who suffers from schizophrenia, but apparently he is very intelligent. He Guard of what sees everything, names, numbers, addresses, a genius, and we see his brother, Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise), trying to help him and know that your new best brother in which he did not know the existence. And throughout the film we see the relationship of both characters grow, a relationship of love, friendship. The performances of the film has no details, Dustin Hoffman is superb in all limits, and Tom Cruise gives us one of his best performances. A film of overcoming and adventure that makes us laugh and cry from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important lesson of empathy, humility and generosity ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie fan remembers the iconic line from "Cool Hand Luke": "what we've got here is failure to communicate". I believe a similar diagnosis can be made about the two lead characters of "Rain Man", Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) because he's autistic, and his brother Charlie, 25 years younger, because he's a young yuppie blinded by his own ego. Both live in their world, both are their own referential; naturally, they're put in a situation where they have to interact. "Rain Man" features one of the most intriguing premises of the 80's, and although the film never strikes as a 'masterpiece', not even in style, it does deliver the emotional pay-off we all expect without recycling old archetypes or falling into sentimental trap.Should I describe Raymond Babbit's condition? Those who know already have in mind his mimics, head-banging, 'uh-oh', his addictions to such TV programs as "Judge Wapner" and "The Wheel of Fortune" and his perfect recitation of Abbots and Costello's 'Who's on first' routine when he's uncomfortable. And to those who haven't, it's enough saying that Dustin Hoffman surpasses himself, if it ever was possible after performances of the caliber of "Tootsie" or "Midnight Cowboy". He's unbelievably convincing, capable to transcend the limits of acting. To win an Oscar for a rather one-note character is an exploit even more impressive because Hoffman manages to pull some human complexity in Raymond, making him absolutely endearing and adorable yet frustrating and scary. Raymond is a character we want to love without turning it into pity.On the other hand, his brother Charlie is the total counterpart, young, handsome, he's a self-made man who exploited a passion for cars to sell imported vehicles. Even his girlfriend, played by the beautiful Valeria Golino is Italian, like a foreign beautiful possession, a trophy that elevates him above the others. Charlie Babbit is a character who flirts with the archetype of the young and arrogant go-getter, a role tailor-made for an actor like Tom Cruise, especially in the 80's. The talent of Cruise consists on making his character unlovable enough to laugh at his misfortunes with Raymond, but human enough to feel sad for him when he learns about his father's death, and much more, when he learns that he didn't get one cent from him, while he was full of debts. Charlie is a character we want to hate but end up giving him the benefit of the doubt.And Charlie is so blinded by his financial problems that he's incapable to care for Raymond and take his medical condition into consideration; all he sees in him is the guy who inherited three millions from his father. At this point, I suspect the screenwriter immediately thought 'hey, in fact, Raymond is medically autistic, while Charlie is symbolically autistic; let's see if the viewers will figure that'. I don't think it takes a degree in psychoanalysis to jump to that conclusion. Anyone would see the kidnapping of Raymond coming. Naturally, the girlfriend leave them to let the adventure begin between the two brothers and both would learn how to communicate ? not. This is where the odd-couple/road movie formula stops. The strength of "Rain Man" is to never make Raymond change, no miracle cure, no sudden change of behavior, if there is one who's up to change, it's Charlie. And he must change, otherwise, the whole premise of the film is pointless.The quality of Barry Levinson's film is to make a predictable turn of events work remaining believable, it also grabs our interest without an abundance of spectacular scenes, or overused emotion. It's always interesting to see a character with leadership quality, handsome and somewhat charismatic, pushed to follow an autistic man and having to deal with out-of-control situations. Charlie wants to take Raymond in L.A, but they can't because Raymond is afraid of planes, and when Raymond starts screaming in panic, Charlie understands that the road trip will follow Raymond's parameters of life. In a way, Raymond Babbit is a leading role because he leads the story. And by following Raymond, Charlie will get to know more about his brother's sensitivity and become more empathic, a word he knew nothing about. The narrative progresses and provides the film's greatest twist, when Charlie realizes he can use Raymond's savant skills.Till now, the film is mostly remembered for the 'Las Vegas' sequence and the iconic moment when the two brothers stand on a descending escalator wearing the same suit, and the last step between Charlie and Raymond's reconciliation, a clever partnership for a rewarding pay-off. It's obvious that Charlie was mostly motivated by greed, but it's impossible not to see genuine attachment growing between Cruise and Hoffman. Both had failure to communicate their feelings, but it's by inviting his brother to communicate his inner thoughts, his fears and desires that Charlie learned the process of listening, of using another referential than his, of being capable of giving and understanding. The film follows the traditional coming-of-realization structure, and on that level, Tom Cruise never makes his changing obvious and spectacular. Indeed, both actors are so good, almost equally, because it was to Cruise to portray anger and frustration without making it forced or over the top.Without Hoffman and Cruise, I can't imagine the film having the same impact. Yes, the screenplay is well-written, and Hans Zimmer's score has a haunting effect, but it's definitely an actors' film. It ended up winning the Best Picture Oscar in 1988, which is quite surprising considering how simple and non-Best Picture material it feels, but it did created a genuine interest for autistic condition, and featured many memorable scenes, and I guess sometimes, that's enough to touch the hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing much new in the movies about photographic memories. We've seen them in "It's Always Fair Weather" and "Operation Madball," among others. It all depends on the use to which they're put, and "Rain Man" puts a photographic memory to pretty good use.Tom Cruise is a selfish expensive Los Angeles car dealer who is in a financial hole. He doesn't blink when his estranged millionaire father dies back in Cincinnati. He blinks when he discovers that he's inherited nothing but an old specimen of a Buick convertible and some rose bushes, the remainder of the fortune being put in a trust for the autistic brother, Dustin Hoffman, that Cruise never knew he'd had.Hoffman is sequestered in a local institution where he's safe. Cruise, determined to somehow get his hands on all that moolah, kidnaps Hoffman and drives him across the country in that Buick, accompanied by Cruise's girl friend, Valeria Golino.It becomes a mismatched buddy comedy. Hoffman is a pain in the neck, always talking to himself, demanding his obsessions be met regarding food, clothing, and scheduling. Hoffman can't stand to be touched and is unable to look anyone directly in the eye. If Cruise were capable of feeling shame, he'd be ashamed to take Hoffman out in public, but in fact Cruise is so shallow that all he feels is irritation and anger. Golino is so disgusted by Cruise's self absorption that she leaves him flat somewhere along the secondary roads, leaving us with two very self-aborbed men.Things pick up when Cruise realizes that Hoffman is not a garden variety autistic but a savant. He has an extraordinary memory for details. He memorizes half a phone book in a few hours. He can remember anything, as few people can and few autistics. Eidetic imagery, the fancy name for photographic memory, is real enough. You can show somebody a comb for a few seconds and he can tell you how many teeth there are. But it's most common in children and fades with age. At any rate, Cruise forgets all about memorizing phone books and teaches Hoffman how to count cards at a Las Vegas casino. They make more than eighty large before being thrown out of town -- enough to save Cruise's big car business.A movie like this, with two people who are alien to one another but are thrown together by circumstances, has to be handled delicately because everyone already knows that, by the end, the two of them will have bonded emotionally. In a movie like "Groundhog Day," Bill Murray's conversion to humanity is done very well indeed. Here, the transition is a bit contrived. What apparently landed Hoffman in the institution was that he was handling Cruise as a baby and accidentally dropped him in a tub of hot water. This is supposed to be a Big Reveal and our eyes are supposed to tear up. And at the final conference, which will determine Hoffman's fate, the two brothers are left alone for a few minutes and Hoffman leans his head against Cruise's and -- sob. The scene is meaningful in the worst sense. Fortunately, it doesn't end with Hoffman's being "cured" and dancing in the streets. Instead he's packed off back to the farm where Cruise promises to visit him. That's a mature sort of ending.Hoffman evidently put a lot of effort into learning how to act like an autistic and it pays off. Cruise is lightweight, adequate, and handsome. The Italian inflections that inform Golino's speech are exquisite. It's like listening to an Italian movie in which the phonemes almost accidentally form English words.I hope the movie doesn't leave anyone with the impression that autistics are all savants because it's far from the truth. Nobody knows what causes it but it's present at birth. An autistic baby is quiet and doesn't care if you pick him up and hug him or not. They're fascinated by glittering objects. (Hoffman says of a Vegas hooker, "She sparkles.") They tend to repeat rhythmic movements such as banging their heads lightly against the wall. And autism is at one end of a continuum, while at the other end is childhood schizophrenia. It's a curious disorder. Experienced observers comment that when you look at the eyes of an autistic child, though they don't respond to anything you do, you just KNOW there's intelligence there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Performances Were Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to be skeptical into thinking it can't be possible that two immensely talented performers are at their very best and every scene that they're in just makes you green with envy. "Rain Man" has that kind of manipulative tactic and it succeeds in doing that. I saw this movie numerous times and more than that in near future (because this movie is addictive) and through every viewing I learn a new thing and more fondness is only an eyelash away. The chemistry between the two leading stars (Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman) is phenomenal it'll make your heart melt like butter. Like the Rob Reiner movie "Stand by Me", this is another road movie that leads to the path of self-discovery. In this case it comes from a arrogant Los Angeles car dealer Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) hears the news that his distant father has sadly passed on. Charlie thought that he was going to inherit a huge lump sum of cash only to be surprised that his late father left him absolutely nothing. instead he gave all his inheritance to a brother Charlie never thought he new named Raymond (Hoffman). The only problem is, Raymond is severely autistic and can't really look after himself let alone manage money. Angered by the whole situation, Charlie removes Raymond from the ward he's living and takes his savant brother and drive all the way west to Las Vegas because Charlie has a clever plan. You see, Raymond may be autistic, but that doesn't mean he was brain-dead either. He had a knack of solving the most complex mathematical problems and can easily count cards quite well in casino card games like poker and blackjack. And Charlie took this to his advantage. The transformation of Charlie's character is so stunning, you might be able to sympathize the character with ease. The relationship he has with Raymond was well beyond believable from irritated and frustrated by Raymond's desperate needs like only flying to Qantas airplanes to his fixation watching Judge Wapner on "People's Court" to trying to getting a better understanding of what it's like to be autistic and to further find weaknesses within himself discovering that we as a society has at least one weakness. And Charlie eventually has an epiphany that he himself is even more fragile than his brother Raymond and that he is willing to become a better human. One of the things I found admirable was how humble Hoffman was in his role. From a documentary on the making of "Rain Man", Hoffman actually had a lot of doubts that he wanted to be taken from the cast be replaced by Richard Dreyfuss. He really thought his role was horrid and unbearable. His perfectionist ways shows he wanted to play it both sensitive and carefully. But director Barry Levinson dismissed his request and from there it was all gravy to me. Hoffman and Cruise were creatively masterful in their respected roles as this movie deserves it's respects and recognition and it offers a kind of message we can all learn that in the end we're all small and our smallness is what helps bring the world around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting Performance By Dustin Hoffman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain Man tells a story of a self-centered Los Angeles-based automobile dealer named Charles Sanford Babbit,simply known as Charlie,who is at conflicted with his own life. As a young teenager,he used his father's Buick convertible without permission and as a result, he went to jail for two days.One day,Charlie learns that his estranged father died and left him from his last will and testament a huge bed of roses and the convertible. While the remainder will of $3 Million goes into a trust fund to be going to someone. He was extremely angry by this and decides to look into this matter further.Apparently,the recipient happens to be Raymond, his brother. He has no knowledge of him since his older brother happens to be an autistic that resides at the Walbrook Institute. Charlie takes Raymond and decides to take him on a lust for life trip to the west coast as a threat to get his share of the inheritance. But during this road trip to Los Angeles,Charlie learns about Raymond's autism, which he initially believes is curable ? resulting in his frequent frustration with his brother's antics. He also learns about how his brother came to be separated from his family, as a result of an accident when he was a baby. Raymond also sings "I Saw Her Standing There" by The Beatles like he did when Charlie was young, prompting him to realize that his older brother is the protective figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named "Rain Man." Charlie proves to be sometimes shallow and exploitative, as when he learns that Raymond has an excellent memory and takes him to Las Vegas to win money at blackjack by counting cards. However, towards the end of their trip Charlie finds himself becoming protective of Raymond, and grows to truly love him. Eventually,he has gained a new brother and mellowed his materialistic attitude as he develops a new relationship with his brother.It is a classic movie due to Dustin Hoffman's performance alone as the autistic Raymond Babbit. I have never seen someone who portrayed a character with all honesty and accuracy. Also commendable is the chemistry between Hoffman and Tom Cruise as Charlie Babbit.Watch this movie for this reason alone.Also,it deals with the theme of a relationship between brothers and of people suffering from autism.This seemingly ordinary film as most part of it is a conversation in road trip between Charlie and Raymond presents more than what is actually does for it is truly a heartwarming film.A 10/10 rating is only justifiable. Highly recommended.Definitely,one of the best movies during the 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rain Man" is a classic road movie drama about two brothers, one who's a selfish prat and one who has autism and of course by the end of the film Dustin's simple nature shapes Tom as a person who learns to love and not ruled by money.Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise certainly looked like brothers with there massive conks (that's noses) and small eyes and both put on great performances. Even Tom Cruise, who I don't particularly like very much even though he follows my sister on twitter, was actually quite good! Dustin obviously out-shined him though with his tremendous performances as an autistic man in his own little world. Dustin makes the character even more likable and by the end of the film you begin to love him as much as Tom. He's brilliantly observed and quite remarkable.The script is full of wit and fantastic characterisation. Tar-tum would be proud of the great character observations in the glorious screenplay. I also liked how the film didn't have a typical Hollywood slushy ending, but actually ended humanly and realistically with a hint of tear being placed in the audiences eye. It's fantastic."Rain Man" is quite simply an ray of sunshine, a truly heart-warming and moving experience that everyone should experience. It's funny, touching and most importantly carries a message that has a heart. It really is a wonderful film and if you haven't seen it, you must!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some claim this to be an overrated buddy buddy road movie, but there is much more to it than that. One thing is Dustin Hoffman's performance as Ray, the autistic savant. his performance is so realistic, so convincing, and so human that once i saw Dustin Hoffman speak normally in another movie, it was so weird. His performance has to be one of the best film performances of all time. He deservedly won the 1988 best actor Oscar. Another key thing to this film is Tom cruise. although his performance isn't as eye popping as Hoffman's, this role gave Tom cruise a chance to extend his dramatic side, and he does it very well. he is very convincing in his role, using humanistic qualities to really show his character's snobby demeanor. His performance was not the stereotypical snob. Barry Levinson also uses comfortable directing styles that sometimes puts you in the mind of Raymond, and it has a dreamlike quality to it. To give a solid summary, rain man is an excellent movie with a simple plot. Sometimes less is more. And if anyone is in the mood for a good movie, look no further. The acting, direction , and screenplay is superior. The screenplay is flawless. I will say no more on that. So now I must leave off with my favorite quote from Rain man: "Shorts on the highway."</fullReview>

And enjoyed watching his performance in a lot of his movies. Anyways they are a very good combo and fit there role flawlessly. What I really didn't expect is how touching and memorable this movie is after it was finished. The two brothers premise has been done before, but this movie has a unique and moving direction which overall makes it most definitely worth seeing, it's simply a wonderful film.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a New York based car dealer, self centered, utterly selfish and wants to win his life no matter what. Left home at an early stage after severe arguments and regrettable memories with his millionaire father he returns home after his father's death expecting a huge chunk out of his fortune. But to him amusement is father just left him an old car along with some other stuff, while the majority of the property and money is left to Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) who is Charlie's brother that he never knew that existed until now. Furious and disappointed, Charlie wanting to grab what's inherited to him learns that Raymond is autistic and spent almost his entire life in a mental institute. Overwhelmed by all the things which is recently happening in his life and about to lose his car business due to debt, Charlie hits the road with Raymond. Dealing with Raymond's challenging behavior; Charlie gets anxious day by day on how he can reach his goals. But unknowingly while spending time with Raymond, he finds a long lost connection of brotherhood and actually starts to feel for Raymond. 'Rain Man' is a classic, not just in 80s but in all time movies. In an age where movies were not totally based on how pretty they looked or how well animated with special effects, you will feel what a movie really needs to be while watching it.Charlie and Raymond both are challenging characters to pull off. Specially Raymond who is mentally challenged and unpredictable, Hoffman portray really well proving that he is one of those actors who knows what character representation is all about. Equally wonderful performance by Tom, who is selfish and greedy you might hate him right from the inception. (My regret is that Tom is not getting any more worthy characters such as this nowadays which he can place his real talents than jumping from one building on to another like a stuntman) Wonderfully written script with warmness of hearts embedded, 'Rain Man' brings in anger, disappointment, love, hope and ambition in to one whole 133 minutes. With wonderful performances of Tom and Hoffman throughout and cleverly build set of characters this is one heartwarming piece of drama that you can lay hands on. read my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com</fullReview>

This film is generally well made, although it goes on a bit too long and loses focus at times. Sure, Hoffman's performance is too mannered (and tailor-made for an Oscar) but he is funny and fun to watch as the idiot savant who is obsessed with television. Cruise gives one of his better performances, although his transformation from a self-centered jerk to a caring brother is not really believable.

		<fullReview>A brilliant story ( Written by Barry Morrow), and well directed by Barry Levinson. The movie is about about an autistic man and his a little selfish brother, or one can say the other way around too.Charlie ( Tom Cruise) , after his father's death, unexpectedly discovers that all the money and estate of his father is inherited by his autistic Brother Raymond ( Dustin Hoffman), whose existence is a surprise to Charlie . The story then moves to Charlie taking his brother away and wanting to do a deal to have half of the 3 million dollars which his brother inherited. In due course he developed a connection with his brother and the movie revolves around their relation.A stand-out performance by Dustin Hoffman, for which he won the academy award. Poor Tom Cruise, his performance got overshadowed by brilliant Hoffman. But he was really good too. A heart touching movie which you don't usually see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of self-interest and brotherly love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Tom Cruise became a big name star he has always wanted to prove to the public that he is a serious actor and wanted to win an Oscar. His starring role in Rain Man was his first attempt at getting the Academy's attention but ended up getting upstaged by Dustin Hoffman.Charlie Babbit (Cruise) is a young, ambitious and selfish car dealer, importing Lamborghinis but is in the middle of a business problem when trying to sell them. He has an Italian girlfriend, Susanna (Valeria Golino) and his only real concerns are himself and money. When Charlie's estranged father dies and leaves him only a 1948 Buick Roadmaster and his prize rose bushes. His $3 Million goes to a unnamed beneficiary. When Charlie finds the route of the money he discovers that he has autistic older brother, Ray (Hoffman). Charlie takes Ray away from his home in Cincinnati and takes him on an cross-country journey as a bargaining tool to gain the money. On the way Charlie gets frustrated with Ray's needs and routine, not understanding his condition: but also slowly builds a relationship with this relative he did not know he had.For this role Mr. Cruise was in full scumbag mode and he has proved he can do repulsive roles really well. His character Charlie is truly a dislikeable character who only cares about himself; but the story of Charlie follows basic screen writing rules of what he wants and needs. What Charlie wants is money but what he really needs is a family and get to know his brother. Cruise was obviously trying to flex his acting muscles for this role. Hoffman made sure that he gave Ray a lot of traits like talking to himself and lives on a routine of certain food and television problems. He does seem like a man who lives in own world and can not interact with people. He does give a good performance and it was obvious Oscar bait. The two men work best during more tender moments where Charlie gets to find out more about Ray and their past and Charlie does develop a more caring bond with his brother.To me Barry Levinson is a hit and miss director: he has made some really good films like Sleepers and Wag the Dog, but he has made turkeys like Sphere to balance things out. With Rain Man he does a standard but he does have a few moments of flair: a moment I particularly liked was when the camera follows Charlie and Susanna when they are having an argument. But for most of the time all Levinson needs to do point the camera in the right place and let the actors just interact with each other and make sure there are some nice wide shots and make sure there is a decent editing job. But I did feel awkward at times involving how Ray interacted with people, particularly when Charlie and Ray are outside a farm house and Ray was about to have a fit. It was at times uncomfortable when the film was not tender.7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man is heartfelt movie about a selfish man named Charlie Babbitt played by Tom Cruise and the journey that he finds himself on when his wealthy father passes away and Charlie discovers that he has an autistic brother name Raymond who is played by Dustin Hoffman. The movie focuses on the emotional journey that Charlie and Raymond experience together over a one week period. The adventure begins when Charlie and his girlfriend Susanna played by Valeria Golino are on their way to a weekend getaway and Charlie receives a phone call that his father has passed away. Charlie returns to Ohio only to discover that his father has placed his 3 million dollar inheritance in a trust and left Charlie with only a car. The journey continues when Charlie takes Raymond from the facility where he has been living since he was a small child and they drive cross country from Ohio to Los Angeles. Charlie learns many things about himself on this adventure that takes many twists and turns. Charlie discovers what it is like to have family and how important his brother is to him. At the end of the film, Charlie turns down a large sum of money to try to get custody of his brother. The film ends with the two brothers parting ways as Raymond returns to the facility with his doctor.The theme of this film is that family is very important. Charlie spent most of his adult live alone and only focused on himself and his needs and when his father passed away he was focused on how it was going to benefit him. He learned through the course of this film that family is much more important than money and that Raymond needed his brother and he needed Raymond as they are the only family that each other has. Charlie learned that he was a selfish man and that he had to take other people's needs into consideration instead of focusing so much on his own needs.This film has a very serious aspect to it while certain aspects of the film make you smile or even laugh. The theme in this film is very similar to the theme in the movie Big Daddy starring Adam Sandler as guy who does not need his family because they tell him that he is wasting his life. In this movie Sandler realizes how important family is when he takes care of his friend's child. This theme in this film is also about the importance of family and taking care of your family. Rain Man is a much more serious film but the themes of the two films are very similar.The film uses many different ways to demonstrate the seriousness of this film and how it has impacted Charlie. There was a common motif used throughout the film that focused on money. Charlie was always happy when he had money or thought that he had money. This was represented numerous times throughout the movie. For example, Charlie was very anxious to go meet with the lawyer about his father's will until he realized that his father did not leave his estate to him. The film demonstrated several times that Charlie was very focused and driven by money.The lighting used in this film was also very important because it demonstrated the different moods and atmospheres throughout the film. The lighting was used to show happy times and depressing times throughout the film. The lighting was dull and somewhat dark when Charlie and Susanna first visited the facility where Raymond was living. This provided a sense of sorrow for the people living in this facility because it seemed sort of dark and dreary. The lighting for the outside scenes were really bright and cheerful as if the film was trying to make a subtle point about live at the facility. The theme really makes this film great because it allows the viewer to reflect on his or her own relationships. Films that cause people to think about their own situations and reflect are very important because they cause the viewer to think about the film in a very serious manner which may impact their future relationships. The theme of this film will make a lasting impression on most people who watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving brotherly story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman play two brothers on a road trip, one of them is autistic, and one of them is ignorant and selfish, and cares of not much else but to get what he believes he deserves. Course it's obvious which actor played the autistic one, Dustin Hoffman of course, Tom Cruise couldn't pull off something like that, and even if he could, it wouldn't be any near as good as Hoffman's portrayal. "Rain Man" is a touching tale of brotherly bond and self discovery that had a very deep impact on me personally, because like Charlie Baggitt (Tom Cruise) I also have a brother who is autistic, so I understand the sheer frustration and anger that he experiences in this movie. What was really moving about this movie was the amazing transformation that Cruise's character took on while on this road trip. What started out as an act of kidnapping, provoked by desperation and anger for his father, became a life changing emotional journey. Past memories are redefined and new feelings of compassion and love are introduced and it's an incredibly heart provoking experience. Some of the most powerful moments you have ever seen take place between two people are featured in this movie (The last scene: where the two brothers are finally separated after a very long week of spending time together, when Raymond gets on the train to go back to Wolbrook and Charlie watches him leave, it's a very saddening time and I almost broke out in tears, almost.) Barry Levinson has succeeded in creating characters that you can really care about, as well as creating his best movie ever. It's an unforgettably heart-warming story of brotherly bond, powered by an Oscar winning performance by Dustin Hoffman, and the part that set Tom Cruise up for life. Miss it, and miss out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Driving with Rainman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Babbitt is not a good man.He's a LA cardealer and a selfish yuppie who's main interest is money.Even his gorgeous girlfriend, Susanna, gets overlooked.Then his father, whom he haven't seen in years dies.All he gets is a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible and several prize rosebushes while an undisclosed trustee gets $3 million.Charlie wants to find out who gets all that money and finds out he has a brother in a mental institution.Raymond Babbitt is an autistic savant who follows his everyday routines step by step.But Charlie takes him away from his routines, because he wants the money.They can't fly to LA because Raymond freaks out of the idea of flying.So they drive instead.During the journey Charlie becomes a bigger and better man.Rainman (1988) is directed by Barry Levinson, after Martin Brest, Steven Spielberg and Sydney Pollack couldn't do it.The men behind the brilliant screenplay are Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass.Tom Cruise as Charlie and Dustin Hoffman as Raymond are definitely the right men to play the parts.Valeria Golino is perfect in her role as Suasanna.Jerry Molen is terrific as Dr. Bruner.Michael D. Roberts is very good as Vern.Director Levinson plays his part as Doctor very well.Bonnie Hunt is great as Sally Dibbs.Dustin's son Jake Hoffman is seen as Boy at pancake counter.Hans Zimmer's music is fantastic.There's a big amount of comedy in Raymond character.The whole "I'm an excellent driver" thing is funny.He keeps repeating the "Who's on first" routine made famous by Abbott and Costello.A number of scenes make this film a classic.When Raymond counts those 246 toothpicks from the floor is a classic.The casino scene is pretty awesome.Since Raymond has a great number memory, they go counting cards.And they win a lot of money.And when they go to the house of big family, because Raymond has to catch People's Court or he will go nuts.Or Charlie teaching Raymond how to dance because he thinks he has a date.But eventually he ends up kissing Susanna in the elevator while the tunes of Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers movie are playing.It's a beautiful moment when Raymond sings The Baetles song "I Saw Her Standing There" like he did when Charlie was little.And then he shouts "Hot water burn baby" and we realise that is why Raymond was sent away.Comedy and drama certainly walk hand in hand in this gem.Rainman is a classic that will never age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Montgomery"Rain Man" ReviewPeople with Autism are amazingly intelligent. They all can carry on conversations, memorize phone books, follow schedules, recite statistics, calculate square roots, and count the number of toothpicks spilled on the floor in just a few seconds. But they can't clean that abstractly. They can't tell you the price of a lawnmower to the price of a pack of gum. Also, they get rather furious when someone interrupts them in a conversation.My favorite part of the movie is when Raymond yells out, "Kmart SUCKS!" I thought that was the funniest thing I have ever seen.Dustin Hoffman (Raymond Babbitt) is a man with Autism. He was living in a mental hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father died and Raymond inherited three million dollars and his brother's were in awe wondering why it went to him. His brother, Tom Cruise (Charlie), never found out about Raymond until that day. He was very furious that his father left him with everything besides an old Buick. Then Charlie travels to Ohio to find out where his fathers estate went. Then when he finds Raymond he abducts him to bring him back to L.A. until he gets his part in the money.My point of view I think this is a very good movie. It has all the good parts to a movie that I would like. Its funny and it talks about a topic that nobody really sees a interest and has no idea of people with Autism Rain Man works so well because of its simplicity. It doesn't try to perform miracles or discover cures; instead, it merely observes a man's acceptance and self-discovery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruise EQUAL to Hoffman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall back in 1989 right after BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY came out and it was obvious that Tom Cruise was going to get his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor for that film, Gene Siskel after reviewing it said that it wasn't BORN that proved that Tom Cruise could act, but RAIN MAN, which came out the previous year 1988. It was at this point in my (early) film-viewing life that I learned that some of the true best performances are not when actors play showy roles designed to win Oscars, but when they play "regular Joes".In RAIN MAN, Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a rather mean-spirited, selfish yuppie whose car business is failing and he needs a lot of money to save it. Charlie's father has just died and Charlie thinks he's about to inherit a fortune, but instead all he leaves him his classic Buick convertible and the rest of the money is put in a trust to go to Charlie's heretofore unknown autistic savant half-brother Raymond, played by Best Actor Dustin Hoffman.As far as I'm concerned, Hoffman is one of the top 5 film actors of all time, and as impressed as I was with how convincing he was in this role, I was EQUALLY impressed with how perfect Cruise's performance was! This film does not work if Charlie's reactions to Raymond come across as somewhat false, sentimental, predictable, or schmaltzy and Cruise avoids all these traits and delivers a real performance. One particular scene that I found to be incredibly real ironically had nothing to do with Raymond and was before his character was introduced. When Charlie finds out his father left him essentially nothing, he spoke in a fast-talking, ranting manner summing up his disgust and disdain for what his father had done to him; it underscores the essence Charlie. Cruise had obviously played jerky, rather unlikable characters before, but in RAIN MAN, he is working with a much better script and this just feels like the first REAL performance of his career. Now, that said, one really has to be blown away by how great Hoffman is playing Raymond. There is not one false note in his performance and so his Best Actor Oscar is thoroughly deserved. Can't really argue with it. But retrospect is a son of a gun and I'll be darned if Cruise did not at the very least deserve a Best Actor NOMINATION! That would have been fitting as well. I know who the other 4 nominees are and have seen those films and performances and NONE of them are as good as Cruise was in this! RAIN MAN, the Best Picture of 1988, was directed by Best Director Barry Levinson. What's amazing about the film is that it is essentially a two-character play but always remains watchable due to these 2 enduring performances. We get to see a genuine relationship (as good as it can) develop between these 2 characters and it never really gets boring or devolves into schmaltz or sentimentality. Just genuine character interaction and development. Great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest sense of humor makes "Rain Man" a surprise classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rain Man" might be most remembered for Dustin Hoffman's brave and remarkable performance as autistic savant Raymond Babbitt, but the film's greatest strength lies elsewhere: its sense of humor. At first, you're inclined not to laugh at Raymond's oddities and especially not at the way his brother Charlie (Tom Cruise) treats him, but as the film progresses, you become less worried about being respectful and suddenly "Rain Man" is really just a film about two brothers on the road together, sometimes sharing funny moments, sometimes sharing tough ones -- but who discover something about themselves through their newfound relationship."Diner " director Barry Levinson, who has always carried his sense of humor about him in all his projects, is responsible for much of this tone to what is a challenging story. Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow do write in some humor, but when summarized, this film does not have a pleasant story line. It's about a young man who's angry that his father left him nothing upon his death, finds out it all went to an autistic brother he never knew he had and in his rage, as sort of a ransom, kidnaps his brother and heads for L.A. Cruise plays an unlikable yuppie with no patience or sympathy for his brother's condition. He's entirely selfish and blinded by deep-seated father issues having grown up without a mother and leaving his father after a dispute at age 16. It's a good role for Cruise, having played rebellious younger characters in "Top Gun" and "Risky Business" at this point in his career, it was a good fit that smoothly transitioned him into a more dramatic role, establishing him as more than just the latest fashion. Charlie's change is the most significant in the film, and though it's hard to believe he's not being selfish about Ray from beginning to end, it's the transformation in his sense of humor that really sells us. At first he's funny because of how he overreacts to his frustrations in taking care of Ray, but once he understands him, it becomes sweet and genial.Raymond is Hoffman at his finest, maybe the height of his career after "Kramer vs. Kramer" and "Tootsie." Playing the mentally challenged is done so little because it's such a difficult thing and a touchy subject that Hoffman had to have handled with incredible sensitivity as he was developing the character. The real genius in his acting is in his eyes. You can always tell he's counting or paying attention to details and he's mesmerized by the world around him. That sort of guides how he interacts with the characters. Levinson picks up on this and subsequently gets a lot of scenic footage, namely Las Vegas where Raymond is fascinated by everything that sparkles.The troublesome part of the story is that it glamorizes Ray's savant abilities and at one point takes advantage of them with little remorse. At the same time, it's clear that despite the opportunities for "Rain Man" to just lay on the sap, Levinson wants it to feel real. Even Hans Zimmer (in his first score) was forced to keep the score electronic '80s style, which while awful is a distinct choice in tone. In real life, Charlie probably wouldn't treat his brother all that much better, he would just appreciate him differently. This is not about changing one's life forever, its about the experience and rewards of brotherhood. All the way to the ending, there's not but a brief moment that would make you want to cry, just be happy that the characters both got something positive out of the experience.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man and the Main Man...Brotherhood as the way it should be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Couple of things I want to mention before I reason out why this is a great film. First, the soundtrack of this film is amazing and very well suited to the film, its rare to hear the background music and feel the emotions that the director is trying hard to convey but this film perfectly executes that part.{It didn't win Oscar for the best original score, that to me indicates the winner must have a hell of a score to beat this} Second, I liked the poster of the film. It clearly shows the distinguishable personalities both the character have. Nice Work!I consider this a great film because of the following reasons: 1. Dustin Hoffman played an autistic savant and I've seen comments from people saying the performance isn't Oscar worthy because he played a one-dimensional character BUT thats the point my friends, he played the character with such prolonged intensity and dedication that it was truly an Oscar worthy performance. 2. Please don't bash Tom Cruise for no reason. He did a good job and complimented Dustin's character well. Couldn't ask more from him {I'm not a Tom Cruise fan but he did his job here}. I liked Charlie's compatibility with Raymond. 3. The movie was nicely done, Kudos to the director and all the staff involved. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was also quite witty and funny.The only fault if I can say so was that I wanted to see the brothers' relationship get more evolved than the end showed, a little more!This movie deserves to be in the Top 250...There are many unworthy candidates there who aren't as good as this movie in my opinion.I give this a 8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman And Cruise Make The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performances from the two leads in this movie are truly top-notch. I've always considered Tom Cruise to be a bit over-rated as an actor but as Charlie Babbitt he really was very good. Charlie is an angry man, whose business is in trouble and who discovers, when his father dies, that he's been denied the $3 million inheritance he thought should have been his. Even more surprising to him, he discovers that he has an autistic brother he had never been told about. Thinking that Raymond was the key to the inheritance, he essentially kidnaps him from an institution and then tries to ransom him, for lack of a better word, asking for $1.5 million to send him back. A funny thing happened, though. Charlie and Raymond began to develop a relationship with each other. The key to this movie, as good as Cruise was, was Dustin Hoffman's unbelievably believable portrayal of the autistic Raymond. He nailed everything perfectly, from Raymond's obsessiveness, to his emotional outbursts to his childlike innocence. Everything in Hoffman's performance was perfect.The superb performances were essential to making this work, because I must say that I didn't find the story to be overly compelling. Parts of it were interesting, while parts of it were also rather silly and unnecessary - the dance and kiss scene between Raymond and Susanna in the elevator jumps to mind as one example. It was hard to nail exactly where Charlie's feelings for Raymond began to change, although the final handful of scenes display the growing bond between the two perfectly. If you like really good performances, this has them in abundance, along with a story that, while not riveting, is good enough. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man , i believe, can be regarded as one of the best films about the issue of Autism.Dustin Hoffman gives a breath-taking performance in my opinion and by far the best depiction of someone with a mental disorder that i have seen in a movie, comparable to a Beautiful Mind. Tom Cruise also gives a noteworthy performance playing the selfish, self-centered brother who transforms to a loving friend who doesn't just want money, but to rebuild his relationship with his family. The film has some great comedic relief and overall great story.This film overall had great potential, and i think could have delivered a little more. But, it's still a great movie that will impress anyone with a beating heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man surely is one of those rare movies, that have humor, solid directory, excellent acting, in-depth character development, and touching emotional moments. Could we ask for a better performance from Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman? I don't think so. Dustin Hoffman was nothing more then fabulous in his role, and the reason why he won Best Actor In A Leading Roll for his performance in Rain Man. It also claimed Best Picture for 1988, as critics named it "The Best Movie Of The Year", and they were spot-on. A movie with a solid duration, didn't tend to drag or skip parts to decrease or increase the movies limit and we witnessed some powerful and moving performances from both Hoffman and Tom Cruise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, thought-provoking and refreshingly positive - a film to be cherished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has become exceedingly difficult of late to mentally recreate in the public consciousness the essence of what made Rain Man such a rare success of a film. Having been reduced to a series of truncated sound bites and references in recent popular culture, with throwaway gags in The Simpsons and Tropic Thunder downgrading it as "that film about the mentally challenged man", public recognition of Rain Man has tragically often been reduced to associating it as being just another film exploiting the handicapped for the sake of Hollywood entertainment or melodrama. The fact that this is a misperception is a crucial link to what made Rain Man such an uncommon success in the first place - the fact that it never took upon such a reductionist approach, but instead was content to remain an honest, unpretentious film about people, is what makes the final product such a resonant accomplishment. Director Barry Levinson (whose career had never generated anything so noteworthy before nor has it since) delivers one of the defining films of the decade, a picture which manages to be touching, intelligent and just funny enough to counterbalance the emotional poignancy and maintain a human spin on the story. The film's screenplay by Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass is wise enough to avoid the temptation to milk the character of autistic savant Raymond Babbitt for excessive pathos or dour moralizing, or, even more unsettling, pass judgement on him through either alienating him as an outsider to society or playing him up as a tragic hero. Instead, Raymond is simply presented as a human being, with the script allowing the character and his actions to speak for themselves, making the film more accessible and truthful to audiences by drawing attention to the condition of autism with a noticeable absence of contrived Hollywood sentiment allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks and warm to the film independent of artistic manipulation. While the prospect of a road movie may have initially led to uneasy associations with Hollywood clich, for once the context accomplishes its purpose with magnificent aplomb, allowing the viewer to bond with Raymond and his uneasy brother Charlie while sharing their journey to a surprisingly genuine extent. Rain Man is made all the more appealing through Levinson's confident refusal to bank on convention or strive for operatic Hollywood ambitions - instead, its intimate, simplistic scope make the important message all the more poignant, and the ensuing film all the more of a success.Nonetheless, the film can hardly disputed to be a flawless triumph, coming across as slightly too long, with 15-20 minutes which could have been easily trimmed. Similarly, for however honest and heartfelt the film's sentimental undertones may be, the emotional trappings do escalate to the point of excess at times. However, such concerns of Levinson's film crescendoing into a Hollywood sap-fest are quickly dispelled by a surprisingly tasteful and quietly poignant ending, and Hans Zimmer (making his Hollywood debut)'s bouncy, Caribbean style musical score puts a delightful spin on the film miles beyond anything a melancholy orchestral effort could have generated, adding a simultaneously light-hearted yet thoughtful tinge to the film. However, for all of the external plaudits, the film's main strength lies in its two primary performances, and on this front Rain Man proves an exceptional triumph. Dustin Hoffman is nothing less than flat out mesmerizing as the aforementioned autistic savant Raymond Babbitt. His extensive research into autism clearly showing through his impeccably crafted characterization, Hoffman fearlessly shoulders the emotional center of the story with a character unable to fathom emotions - the fact that Raymond remains endearing, lovable and incessantly credible throughout is a testament to Hoffman easily deserving every last bit of recognition for such a superb feat. Nonetheless, despite Hoffman's performance attracting the bulk of the attention, Tom Cruise equally proves his merit, displaying a previously unseen acting prowess and dedication which launched a transformation from flavour of the month teen star to a genuinely talented leading man. Cruise manages to morph his arrogant, self-serving yuppie Charlie Babbitt from a despicably manipulative character who effectively kidnaps his autistic brother in an attempt to weasel inheritance money from him to a surprisingly sympathetic man exercising his inner turmoil in a refreshingly fluid and convincing fashion, and Cruise channels his edgy energy into the character in an unexpectedly effective fashion. Valeria Golino is also a charming presence as Cruise's more kind-hearted girlfriend, adding much needed warmth and compassion to a story which in many ways is about two emotionally closed brothers learning to feel. All parties concerned deserve every ounce of credit for transforming a potentially cumbersome Hollywood sob story into a miraculously balanced, informative and entertaining film, (mostly) resisting contrived melodrama in favour of a more thought-provoking, positive narrative approach and making Rain Man a film to be cherished. -9/10</fullReview>

But it's still worth viewing. The beginning was kinda dull and I thought that I ain't gonna like this movie, so I was kinda surprised when after 15 or so minutes, I couldn't take my eyes of screen. Dustin Hoffman was brilliant, though his character was autistic, he still was likable and even funny (and it's ain't easy to make likable character who's always kinda self-contained). Tom Cruise's character was kinda negative but still, was pretty likable when he didn't shout on Raymond, I think he did a great job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Everything in this movie is fudged ever so humanistically, in a perfunctory, low-pressure way. The picture has its effectiveness: people are crying at it. Of course they're crying at it - it's a piece of wet kitsch!" ? Pauline Kael "A man had better starve at once than lose his innocence in the process of getting his bread." ? Henry Thoreau Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a self obsessed car salesman who discovers that his long-estranged father has left his multi-million dollar estate to his autistic brother Raymond. In an attempt to claim half of the inheritance, Charlie kidnaps his brother (Dustin Hoffman) and takes him on a cross-country journey."Rain Man" is structured like your typical road movie. Our hero travels from one point to the next, and by the end of the journey, has come to a moment of personal realisation. Cruise starts off as a cocky car salesman, but by the end of the film has renounced his love for money and learnt instead to appreciate his autistic brother.Like all road movies, the film is episodic, filled with musical montages and punctuated by shots of roads, sunsets and horizons. But despite these clichs, the film works tremendously well. Cruise is great at playing a cocky jerk and Hoffman's autistic routine is affecting.Audiences think they're responding with sympathy to Hoffman's disabilities, but really he represents a big child. He represents that period of innocence between disillusionment and nothingness. We want to hug Hoffman, protect him and shower him with sympathy. And so does Cruise, who uses Hoffman to reconnect to a past life he has long since abandoned.What makes the film so powerful is the profound sense of lost innocence. Through Raymond, Charlie remembers simpler times, when the world wasn't all about fancy cars and slick suits. Midway into the film we learn that when Raymond was a child he accidentally dropped Charlie into a bath of hot water. It is this failure at an adult responsibility that leads to Raymond being exiled from the family. As punishment, his parents send the young autistic boy to a mental health clinic.In an attempt to reconnect to his brother, Charlie repeatedly attempts to hug Raymond. Unfortunately Ray reacts violently to physical contact. The payoff of this character trait occurs at the end of the film, when the two brothers touch foreheads. It's a little gesture (improvised by Hoffman), but moving all the same.As the film progresses, it becomes clear that Charlie's relationship with his brother mirrors the relationship he has with his patient girlfriend, Susanne. When Charlie continues to fail to really communicate with Ray, he yells: "You can't tell me you're not in there somewhere!" This echoes Susanna's earlier remark to Charlie. Charlie tries to reach out to Ray and gets nothing in return. Susanna tries to reach out to Charlie, and likewise gets nothing in return. The irony is that, because of his autistic brother (a man who can't connect to other human beings) Charlie learns to open up and connect with others.So what we essentially have here is a more low key version of Oliver Stone's "Wall Street". Our yuppie hero learns the value of family, humanity, patience and compassion. Films like this were common in the late 80s, as artists rallied against the "perception" of rising greed and materialism. Essentially, the young parents of the 60s were rallying against their now twenty-something kids. Kids who took modern conveniences, job opportunities and education for granted.7.9/10 ? The film reeks of 80's kitsch. You either accept the corniness and let the emotions move you, or denounce it outright. Having just watched a string of Hal Ashby films, I appreciated the message. There's nothing wrong with a little humanism.Director Barry Levinson has always been a weak visualist, relying instead on the strength of his actors, but he still creates a couple memorable images here and there. What really keeps the movie moving along is a memorable score by Hans Zimmer. It's another one of those great 80s synth tunes (think Beverly Hills Cop and The Terminator).The film was marginally influential, in that it inspired a spate of "retard" or "disability" movies. Because of Hoffman's work here, Al Pacino, Robert Deniro, Sean Penn and Edward Norton would, in an attempt to win accolades, take on similar "challenging" roles. But the truth is, it's not that hard to act like a retard. Tom Cruise does it all the time.Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third or fourth time I watched Rain Main, I began to have doubts about the events that transpired in Las Vegas. When the casino management sequestered Charlie Babbit in a private room, informed him that they had videotaped him as he played Black Jack, accused him of counting cards, and ordered him to get out of the hotel and not return, they made no mention of the man with the deadpan demeanor sitting next to him at the table."Just keep your mouth shut, take your winnings, leave the casino, and don't come back," they could have told Charlie Babbit, "and take your strange little partner with you." Seems that someone would have questioned Charlie about the man with whom he often spoke -- the dealer must have noticed that Charlie sometimes openly consulted Raymond before placing his bet--rather than treat Charlie as if he were traveling alone.If, as Raymond's Doctor Bruner said early in the film, an autistic person doesn't tolerate changes in his daily routine because he desperately needs order and predictability in his life to feel safe, wouldn't the constant flashing of lights, movement of people, and noise from slot machines and roulette wheels cause him to panic? The casino scene begs that question.In any case, my favorite part of the story takes place before the cross country road trip begins, when Charlie drives to Wallbrook, first discovers he has an older brother, and learns about his uniqueness. The dialog between Wallbrook employee, Vern, and Charlie, as well as Raymond's reaction to having unexpected visitors in his room sound very natural. The quality of the story does not really suffer,though, once Charlie and Raymond embark on the journey that takes them from Ohio to California. Dustin Hoffman does such a convincing job as an emotionally and socially limited yet intellectually gifted man, obsessed with numbers, patterns, and lists, and compelled to memorize them, that less plausible moments become believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since its release almost twenty years ago, Rain Man has become a perennial favorite of many movie lovers. And who can blame them? The story is very simple, yet one we all can relate to. It tells the journey of two brothers who never knew each other until their father died and are now taking a cross-country trip that turns out to change them. The older brother, Raymond, is autistic, and due to his unusual and repetitive behaviors, he seriously annoys his younger brother, Charlie. These two could not have lived more different lives. Raymond has been kept in a mental institution with a rigorous schedule to help his autism, while Charlie has been living the good life selling high-priced cars in Los Angeles. Charlie is selfish and only in anything for his own benefit. But, once he meets Raymond, the circumstances change how he reacts and he is forced to really listen and pay attention to somebody he never knew existed.This is a film that grows on you as you think more about it. This movie is so well done, you don't really have to think about anything except the story and what will happen to these two next. The acting is terrific with Dustin Hoffman nailing the part as an autistic, yet somewhat brilliant man who has been sheltered his whole life. Tom Cruise is spectacular, better than Hoffman in some scenes. He is so good at balancing the selfish, yuppie self in the first part, then becoming a caring human being in the last act. All along the way, there are many scenes to make you laugh at Raymond's behavior, as well as cringe at the dangers of autism, a disease not well known at the time of this movie. Overall, this is a wonderful, sweet, charming, and funny movie that drives home the point that sometimes its better to know someone for a few days than your whole life, because it might change you for the rest of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but not as good as its Oscars would imply.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie (Tom Cruise) has just learned that his estranged father has died. But the biggest surprise comes soon after when he learns that his father's fortune is NOT coming to him and Charlie is NOT the only child in the family. It turns out that he has a much older brother, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and the money has been placed in a trust to care for him because he is mentally disabled and dealing with the effects of autism. In a jerky move, Charlie kidnaps his brother and decides he'll care for him until the trustee will agree to give him some of the $3,000,000 fortune. Much of the film is a road trip where the two go cross-country--making money at Vegas and having a laugh or two. However, the ending where Charlie supposedly grew and changed (just a bit) did seem a bit difficult to believe."Rain Man" won four Oscars--including one for Best Picture. This would seem to imply that it is an amazingly good film. However, I would argue that the film is actually a very good one but it also appeared during a year in which the competition just wasn't very good. The list of other nominees would include "The Accidental Tourist", "Dangerous Liasons", "Working Girl" and "Mississippi Burning"--all films that just don't seem particularly Oscar-worthy. The film is interesting and also is a funny look into the awful fashions of the late 1980s. Just don't expect a film that is anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a brilliant movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a lot about how good this film was, and when I saw it myself I can completely see why. Rain Man is beautifully crafted; funny, moving and startling, sometimes all at once. The cinematography and scenery is beautiful, and the music is effective. The story never loses steam or feels boring, and the script is excellent while Brian Levinson directs absolutely beautifully. The performances from the two leads are brilliant. As fantastic as Dustin Hoffmann is, and he is, his character is one of cinema's greatest triumphs and Hoffmann adeptly is hilarious, unsentimental and completely and utterly believable, that is not to say Tom Cruise should be dismissed, because Cruise is every bit as good as a character whose emotional journey ranges from confused and impatient to understanding and protective. Overall, brilliant film elevated by the two leads and the direction primarily. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 1988!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain man is director Barry Levinson's crowning masterpiece. Featuring an all-star ensemble of Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Bonnie Hunt and Valerie Golino, it won Oscars for best director, actor and screenwriter in 1988. I must have watched this film at least a dozen times and I never tire upon viewing it in succession. It is the story of an egotistical salesman Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) who, upon learning of his father's death, is perplexed to discover that he has an institutionalized autistic savant as the brother he never knew he had. Charlie ends up going on a road trip of sorts with his brother Raymond (Hoffman) where after being annoyed with Ray's disability, discovers a love for Ray that he never knew he had. We watch as the movie takes us through plenty of luscious scenery and locale while we feel lost in the budding relationship that eventually unfolds between Charlie and Raymond Babbitt. Only a director like Levinson could pull something like this off. Everything is so carefully executed, to the masterful location planning and creative camera angles to some strikingly innovative juxtaposition. At one point near the middle of the film, we watch a shot showing us nighttime and then, without ever cutting away, show us daylight unfold in one composite shot. Furthermore, we have more Levinson trickery in the placement of promotion. At one point we see Charlie sitting in the hotel as a multitude of jump cuts show us the passage of time and we hear numerous commercials playing in the background. Whether this was intentional or not, it works well in the context of the scene. In a way, it's almost as if Levinson has broken the auteur barrier. His directorial work on Rain man is nothing short of stunning. Levinson is truly in his prime here. He even seems to bring out the best in Hoffman as we watch his character Ray constantly notice things that the average non-autistic person would take for granted (ie. the structure of a bridge for instance). I really don't have to say much about the acting. Hoffman's performance as a mentally handicapped Ray is legendary. Truly one of the most realistic performances ever brought to the screen. But it's Cruise as Charlie Babbitt that really shines. It was this film that finally showed naysayers that Cruise could actually act. I actually prefer his performance to Hoffmans! I would go as far as saying that this beats out 'Jerry Maguire' as Cruise's finest acting to date. Watch out Edward Norton! The musical compositions layered throughout Rain man remain some of my favourite of all time. Hans Zimmer has never been better; the Rain man theme song stays in your head long after you hit the stop button. He would even go on to use the same musical structure in his next movie, 'Days of Thunder', also with Mr. Cruise. Basically the entire score is an ethereal, uplifting experience in itself. Stu Linder provides excellent editing to compliment John Seale's dazzling camera work. It's a shame that Linder died only a few months ago while completing Levinson's,'Man of the Year'. I really can't say enough about this film. It's one of those movies where the viewer notices something new upon each viewing. I only just recently noticed that the photo montage on the closing credits screen are actual the pictures that Ray took while on his journey. Also look for a cameo by Levinson as the psychiatrist near the end of the picture. Truly a work of art, Rain man will shine well into the 21rst century as a fine example of classic cinema. By the way?who was on first base?10 OUT OF 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe this film is approaching 20 years since its release. I always enjoy seeing it again - for the story, characters and performances, of course; but also, having been born and grown up in Cincinnati, I recognize all of the areas and locations where the initial portions of the story are filmed - from Cruise's arrival following his father's death, until the finally get on the road towards California, in the vintage Buick.Virtually all movies require some creative license in their stories, but there are two here which alway give me a bit of pause. The major one is that - even though his father is clearly characterized as a distant individual, and one who had to institutionalize Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) following his wife's death - it is illogical that Charlie (Tom Cruise) would never previously been aware he had a brother.Charlie, a toddler at this time, might very well have forgotten Raymond, and the father may have wished to spare his younger son from anguish. But the time line of the story would have required that during Charlie's 14 years or so remaining at home, from 2 until he was 16 or 17, he gained no awareness of his brother at all. 14+ years of the father's visits to the institution, telephone calls, notes and letters, etc., and Charlie never had a clue? Seems unlikely - but, at the same time, wouldn't have this story if he'd known.The other (minor) point which I find illogical is their shopping for clothes and shoes (and barbering) when they get to Vegas. Charlie has maxed-out his cards, and hocks his valuable watch for a stake to take advantage of Raymond's prodigious skills at the blackjack table.I've been to Caesar's, and these shops in their arcade. There is no way Charlie could have gotten out of their shops with those suits, clothing accessories and shoes, plus the hair cuts, for less than nearly half of the proceeds from his watch. Even somebody with the tastes Charlie had obviously acquired in the film, he's have taken a more economical route to clothing and grooming them.Of course, these are minor in view of the overall presentation, and its heartfelt story of the characters coming together, and especially Charlie's finally growing-up and acquiring a fresh, valuable perspective in his life - and adding to that of his brother, in spite of the barriers and hidden recesses in Raymonds personality.A real classic, which should remain so for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that shows you the real meanings of life in a context of modern stressing business life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie that shows you how it is to live with an autistic person. It shows how Charlie gets to love this very mentally ill brother that lives very simply and is a difficult person. It shoes what really is important in life, having a family and someone to love in contrast to stressing businesses and a superficial life. Charlie lives that very superficial life, has a car business, is stressed and has a lot of work and problems. He gets to know is unknown autistic brother and at the beginning kidnaps him to get the 3million his brother got from their dead father. But during their long trip to L.A, Charlie gets to know his brother even if it isn't easy to live with such an ill person. Charlie finally feels very related to Raymond and doesn't want to give him away, but would it be good for Charlie to continue living with his brother in L.A? In addition to an incredibly good plot, Dustin Hoffman is presenting a outstanding acting performance as Raymond.</fullReview>

Charlie takes his brother, who is called Raymond until he gets his share of the will but something happens that he wasn't expecting. Good film,of course its a definitely good film as Raymond Babbit would say.This film has a dramatic but sweet tone to it and landed Dustin Hoffman an Oscar for his role of the autistic Raymond Babbit.

		<fullReview>This was a touching story of how two brothers came together after a tragedy in the family. Tom Cruise's character at first turns out to be a money-grubbing bastard but then slowly has a sweet change of heart. But forget all of that for a second because there is one thing that stands out here in my mind. I am talking about the acting by Dustin Hoffman.I have seen hundreds of movies, some classics and some flops but through all of these movies with their countless actors and actresses, nothing or no one has ever compared to Hoffman in Rain Man. I will say that in my opinion, he put on the single most outstanding performance in Hollywood history. He captures the audience's imagination, heart and makes you question how he did it. I have seen this movie about 5 or 6 times (obviously i own it on DVD) and every time i cannot believe what i see. He IS that good. If by some chance you have not seen this movie, I urge you to give it a shot. You will be blown away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolute masterpiece, that deserved it's best picture win in my opinion, with a brilliant story, Hoffman and Cruise are incredible!. All the characters are wonderful, and the story is extremely moving, plays Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise are simply incredible in this!. Dustin Hoffman absolutely amazed me here by playing Autisitc, just the way he walked, talked and acted, it was just uncanny, especially his freak out scenes, and Cruise is just as good, playing the incredibly selfish brother, as he and Hoffman, had fabulous chemistry together, plus the ending was a little surprising for me, but nonetheless I liked it. Hoffman deserved his Oscar, and Cruise deserved one too in my opinion or at least a nomination, plus one of my favorite scenes is most definitely when they go to the Casino, to count cards. It's extremely well made and written, and it also has some wonderful tear jerker moments as well, plus I loved the scene where Cruise teaches Hoffman to dance, as that was a great scene.I will admit to not seeing much of Dustin Hoffman, however his incredible performance here, definitely has made me a fan, and I would rank this in Cruise's top 5 for best performances, plus you will hate him in the 1st half, as he is such a prick, but really love him after a while, once he starts caring for Hoffman. Everything about this film is just perfect, and It was really unpredictable too, plus I loved the score&amp;music as well. This deserves it's place on the top 250, as a matter of fact it should be even higher in my opinion, and it's also hilarious at times too, plus It also seemed that Hoffman and Cruise had so much passion for there roles. All the characters are extremely likable, and what also amazed me is how Hoffman and Cruise made there seemingly incredibly tough parts, look so easy!. This is an absolute masterpiece, that deserves it's best picture win in my opinion, with a brilliant story, Hoffman and Cruise are incredible, and if you haven't seen it, please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is outstanding!. Barry Levinson does an outstanding job! here with brilliant camera work, great angles and just keeping everything perfect and at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is no doubt Oscar worthy!. Dustin Hoffman is simply incredible here, he really convinced me he was autistic, he was funny, lovable, had brilliant chemistry with Cruise, and just the way he walked, talked it really did amaze me, as I really enjoyed watching him work, you will love his character and be amazed by it trust me! (Hoffman Rules!!!!). Tom Cruise is amazing as always, and is incredible here, he plays such an incredible selfish prick at the start, but he turns wonderful in the 2nd half, as he was just as good as Hoffman in my opinion, he had the difficult task of switching character wise, he at least deserved an Nomination, but I loved seeing him and Hoffman work together! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Valeria Golino is good as the girlfriend, she was cute and charming I really liked her. Rest of the cast are fine.

		<fullReview>Many people told me that Rain Man was a very good movie and that I should see it. I took their word for it, and after viewing it I've found that Rain Man was an average movie. The Good: Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman were brilliant in this movie. They fit their characters very well and both put forth a superb effort. I also thought it was neat seeing their relationship grow throughout the movie. The Bad: I found this movie to be quite boring many times throughout the movie. It got repetitive, and it really did not send a very strong message, in my opinion. The movie began as a story of jealousy, and ended without much emotion. After a very long and exaggerated middle, I was hoping and expecting the movie to end very dramatically. Instead, it ended abruptly and I did not feel much sympathy for any of the characters in the movie. I thought the movie was a good idea, but could have been written and directed a little bit better. Nonetheless, it was a nice movie, but I don't know if I'd recommend it to very many people. Overall: 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman certainly gave a good performance. But I recall one Oscar host who said something like "your chances of winning an Oscar are high if you portray someone with a mental or physical illness" - reference to Rain Man, Philidelphia, Silence of the lambs, Shine..and the list goes on.The interesting thing is that playing these sorts of characters may not be as difficult as many people think. That's why I have respect for actors such as Jodie Foster and Hillary Swank - they play relatively normal people, but with conviction and realism; and that makes it difficult to take your eyes of them. But I would have thought that playing a Raymond or a Forest Gump type character would be relatively elementary for these actors.Take away Hoffman, and the often underrated Cruise, and you have a fairly mediocre, long winded and somewhat boring story. To some degree, this is because the film is a bit too pre-occupied with showcasing some of the inadvertent talents of a autistic savvant. But then again, somehow I feel that would have been fine, had the screen-writers ditched the backdrop of a film (Cruise in financial trouble and needs the inheritance money). Worse still, the backdrop made the final 30 minutes extremely predictable (money isn't everything... blood is thicker than water... blah blah blah).Certainly watchable, but tends to drag on a bit and as mentioned previously too much a predictable background plot that required unnecessary servicing throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road movie with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman as brothers, the later autistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1988 and directed by Barry Levinson, "Rain Man" is a drama starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman as brothers who meet for the first time, the latter being autistic. As they travel across the country from Cincinnati to Los Angeles they have many misadventures wherein the spoiled rich Charlie (Cruise) gets to know Raymond (Hoffman) and ultimately has an epiphany. Valeria Golino is on hand as Charlie's babe."Rain Man" is a road movie and it's solidly entertaining, albeit overrated in some circles. The score by Hans Zimmer is fitting, but decidedly 80s. The tie-in to Charlie's imaginary friend from his childhood is effective. Both Cruise and Hoffman deliver quality performances wherein you forget you're watching a movie and buy into the characters &amp; their story, which is a sign of a good drama, although Raymond can be irritating or frustrating to watch at times.The film runs 133 minutes and was shot in Cincinnati &amp;East Walnut Hills, Ohio; Kentucky; Indiana; Oklahoma; Las Vegas; and Los Angeles, California.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If "Silver Linings Playbook" wasn't terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About time I can tear into this one. Do you know what the worst movie I've ever seen is? "Silver Linings Playbook". Why? Because I've never seen characters that detestable get treated like royalty for 2 hours. I could literally write a thesis on how terrible that movie is. Terrible characters, terrible writing, terrible ending, terrible everything! The only reason I bring that up is because this movie reminded me a lot of "Silver Linings Playbook", only this movie was actually good. So the rest of this won't really be a review, just me destroying "Silver Linings Playbook" for the last time.So how are these two movies similar? The main thing is that they both involve people taking advantage of other people's mental illnesses. In "Silver Linings Playbook" it's OCD, in "Rain Man", it's autism. The characters that abuse these illnesses are unlikable, self-centered, and just miserable.So how are they different? In "Rain Man" the abusive character actually changes. "Silver Linings Playbook" would not be nearly as terrible if the abusive character got what was coming to them, or changed, but instead, she's rewarded for being a lying, manipulating, self-centered, egotistical, waste of life. Over the course of "Rain Man", there's this bond that slowly grows between Cruise and Hoffman. What starts off as as miserable character, eventually turns into a character you connect with, and sympathize with, and almost root for.This movie is fantastic not only for Hoffman's performance, but also because it finally gave me a great alternative to "Silver Linings Playbook". Finally, I have a movie that actually knows how to develop characters in this environment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie probably 7 or 8 times in the past three years, wrote a paper about it for my college film class last semester, and basically regard it as my favorite movie of all time. Where to begin with the praise for this movie? Let's start with the acting. Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor, and has been for a while. I'd watch him in any role. I was amazed at the way he was able to pull off this role. I've never seen a more deserved Oscar win. The vacant stare, the monotone voice, the screaming, it was unbelievable. Each time I watch it I am floored by his talent. Tom Cruise is also good, the villain of the story who undergoes such a subtle change that it's almost not visible until nearly the end. He is, however, perfectly suited for the flashy, egotistical character of Charlie, and I think he did a great job. The directing was unobtrusive and beautiful, for the most part just letting the action unfold, which is exactly the way it should have been done. It's a feel-good movie that does that and more, and I think nothing I've seen in the movies is as touching as the scene in the motel where Charlie discovers who "Rain Man" really is. I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. Absolutely wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man' is the kind of film where we know we are watching a formula movie, but we are so enraptured by the story and the premise and captivated by the brilliant performances by Cruise and Hoffman that we can't help but let ourselves go and fully enjoy what this unique film has to offer. It wouldn't of been so successful if Hoffman and Cruise hadn't delivered such brilliant performances, their scenes together are masterful and we really believe that they could be brothers, this also helps at boosting the emotional impact near the end of the film.Hoffman deserved that Oscar 100%. One of the best acting performances I have ever been privileged to have seen. His performance really shines when it shows the constantly evolving chemistry with him and Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise makes use of his time in this film masterfully and shows why he is one the best Actors of all time. I felt Valeria Golino performance to be lacking when she's upset or disappointed she does not seem as good or effective as possible, she is kind of lacking in energy some of the time here. But anyway...This movie was very emotional at some times, and had it's funny moments as well. I believe that "Rain Man" is truly a work of art, and a film that everyone can watch, understand, and enjoy.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films of Both Cruise and Hoffman's Careers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very well-done movie. It was very well-written and compelling. It was nice to see a non-action Tom Cruise movie.Tom Cruise is great as Charlie, a selfish young wheeler-dealer. However, the main attraction of this movie is Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance as Raymond, an autistic savant. My mom has dealt with a lot of autistic children, and she says that this was a very accurate portrayal. It gave me a taste of just what it could be like to have an autistic in your family.The relationship between the two brothers is very well played-out. Charlie at first can't stand Ray, but he later learns how to deal with his extreme autism and even later forms something of a bond with him.There are many powerful scenes, such as the "hot water burn baby" scene. There are also plenty of funny moments to come around, with my favorite being Ray bugging Charlie about underwear ("UNDERWEAR IS UNDERWEAR!" yells Cruise).A great movie and for sure one of the best films and performances of both men's careers. This is especially recommended for people who are familiar with autistics.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on a premise so absurd that it undermines all the sentimental good feeling we are supposed to experience while watching it. Charlie Babbitt, who is on the verge of bankruptcy, finds out that his father, from whom he has been estranged for many years, has died. He goes back home in the expectation of inheriting his father's estate, inasmuch as he is the only living relative, at least so he thinks. But he finds out that aside from an old car and some roses, the entire estate, worth $3,000,000, has been put in trust for someone else. That someone else turns out to be an autistic older brother he never knew he had (he never finds out why no one told him about this older brother, Raymond, and neither do we).Charlie decides he is entitled to half the estate. So far, so good. Up to this point, the movie is more or less within the realm of what might actually happen in the real world. In said real world, Charlie would have hired a lawyer to contest the will, and then he could have gone about his business while waiting for results. I once had a cousin who left all her money to her lover. I figured that was the end of it, cut and dried. But a lawyer thought otherwise. I signed an agreement with him, and two years later he sent me a check for $22,000. Now, if a mere cousin can break a will, I figure one of the sons of the deceased has a really good chance of doing so.Instead of just hiring a lawyer, however, Charlie kidnaps Raymond from the institution where he has spent most of his life. Then, he calls the head of the institution and demands $1,500,000 in ransom to get Raymond back. That would be all right if we were supposed to think Charlie is a criminal, but we are not. We are supposed to ignore the fact that in the real world, Charlie would end up in prison. Instead, we are supposed to believe that he is going to show up in court with Raymond by his side, saying, "I have him now, so give me the money!" as if that is going to strengthen his case.In true Hollywood fashion, we get the best of both possible worlds. Charlie comes to care for Raymond, forgoes his claim on the estate, sends Raymond back to the institution where he belongs, and promises to visit him regularly. But, thanks to some card counting on the part of Raymond earlier in the movie, he and Charlie won $85,000 playing blackjack, just enough money to keep Charlie from being forced into bankruptcy. But it is a little hard to enjoy this happy ending after spending half the movie suffering through that ridiculous kidnapping plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but can be very hurtful for people with this disability to look at this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really really hated Tom Cruises character Charlie because he just instantly verbally abuses poor Raymound every time he would say something and he doesn't know the fact he has a disability. Yes you can laugh at the stupidest words he says from his mouth but for god sakes, he doesn't even know how to cope with someone who has autism. I felt like giving him a shake and tell him to man up because having a disability isn't a curse or a sin! I also thought he was super selfish, he just isn't on this earth! I really felt sorry for poor Raymound, he is so innocent and kind. You would feel upset when he screams and thumps his head out of fear.I think if they ever remade this film again, it should be less rough and concentrate more on the coping mechanisms for someone with autism!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man rounds up how much a Drama film could be so special. The film's acting, Message, wit, drama and it's story is all Perfect, here's why this film is great.The story follows Charlie Babbitt, a selfish yuppie who after finding out his father misfortune of Death, he must take care of his autistic savant Brother Raymond Babbitt since he has fear of planes, they go on a road trip to Las Vegas where Raymond learns about gambling, learn to Dance and kiss, but also that Charlie finds out that Raymond is a number genius and somehow have a Close Connection to each other as the film goes on.The film's screenplay is top-notch having both a comedic and sad appeal to the film's premise. The performances particularly Dustin Hoffman is one of the most intriguing performances in a Movie yet. Everything from timing to script is all done perfectly, Tom Cruise is good as well but somehow less promising With annoying tone and poor decision Choice for script for the character.The Music by Hans Zimmer is alright, sometimes it sounds great, and sometimes it sounds god awful. I don't think Hans Zimmer should do the Music for this Movie, but im the only one. The direction is stunning, the film having a autistic Brother is a genius idea, this Movie does this idea perfectly.The card-playing scene in Caesar's Palace is fascinating and the one of the most entertaining scenes in the Movie along With the scene where Raymond is out on the road stopping at a red light on the road.The film's most emotional scene is when Raymond talks about the Rain Man that Charlie kept thinking about as a kid. It's all done in a dramatic matter, which makes the film much better.The film has it's problems like the Music and it's somehow disappointing ending, but other than that, this film rocks.Rain Man is a must watch for all People looking for a comedic drama Movie that is pretty darn great. Performances, script, humour, drama, screenplay and Message is outstanding despite Music being OK and having a abrupt ending. Don't miss out this Movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent cinematic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hans Zimmer made the music of Rain Man. It is not exactly haunting, it sure chills. I also find the music to be very modern. The music mixes with the movie as does a screwdriver drink. Rain Man is actually a two actor film. Of course, a small but important part of Tom Cruise's girlfriend is played by the ever pretty Valerio Golino. Let us not talk about Dustin Hoffman or Tom Cruise. Hoffman got an academy for this. Both the actors can achieve the depth that was required of them 10 out of 10 times, we all know that. Instead, let us talk about Barry Levinson. My point is "If you have a good story to tell, people will listen". The movie starts with a great scene, follows that great scene with another one and does so until the last scene. Nothing is out of place here. I have seen this movie like 10 times and still find it entirely watchable again. The cross country drive made the whole movie an excellent watch. Rain Man is a great cinematic experience.What it does best is that it touches the core of human sensitivity while on the road. It is Barry Levinson who made this simple story an Academy winning effort instead of just another road movie. Barry Levinson pulled out a miracle out of mere nothing and used the two actors with such class, it will stand the test of time for generations to come.The outbursts by the autistic character played by Hoffman were so nicely done, kudos to him. Those outbursts were so nicely handled by the brother, played by Cruise, you have to see it to believe it !! Watch this if you have not already..... My vote, 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IN BASEBALL, THE term for a batter's getting a single, a double a triple and a home run in the same game (although not necessarily in that order) is known as "Hitting for the Cycle." It's a feat that is seldom seen and one that is comparable to a pitcher's throwing a shout-out, a no-hitter or a player's hitting a grand slam home run.SO TOO IT is that today's honoree, RAIN MAN, is as all encompassing and cherished a rarity; albeit in a far different field. This picture does "touch all the bases" in providing its audience with great and fairly equal portions of drama, comedy, tears and laughs. In each of these categories, the film invites the audience members to share in the emotions dominant at the time. This is particularly important in the category of comedy; for in such a complex and sensitive story, it would be a true tragedy if the production team had opted for having us laugh at the story rather than with the it.SO AS A RESULT of the gentle meshing of those previously mentioned elements, we have the added drama of a guy under the gun of a desperate business situation. Added to all, there is this his (the Tom Cruse character) sudden discovery o his older brother, Raymond.ALL OF THESE parts are masterfully assembled and carefully blended into a masterpiece of a film for all. And as architect we have Director, Barry Levinson. Amomng the entries on his resume, we have THE NATURAL (Tri-Star, 1983) and NBC's HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET TV Series.AS FOR OUR ratings, we have: Mine ****, Schultz *****1/2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man has become somewhat of a trivial joke these days, but it's a film you must watch. Unexpectedly, it's one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. The pairing of the sleazy car- salesmen and his incredibly profound autistic brother provides an interesting, almost hilarious companionship. Charlie's waining patience with Raymond is very funny, considering how little people actually understand the eccentricities of autism. But the more we find out about Raymond, the more we feel for him, and the more we want Charlie to fall for him. Without a doubt, this is Dustin Hoffman's best performance. This is is a feat of brilliant method acting, that only comes once in a lifetime for an actor of such electrifying theatrics. It looks like it was a risk to his mental stability, but who wouldn't accept the role of Raymond, and completely disappear in this character? I think Raymond is one of film's most groundbreaking characters, and he brought to the forefront, a syndrome that even to this day, few people understand, or even care to understand. This is a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Babbit is a hustler. He's been on his own long enough to know how to work people and situations. He finds that the father who threw him out as a teenager has died, and left him an antique convertible and something more important, a previously unknown brother, Raymond. Raymond is autistic, but is able to calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy. Their father has left his fortune to Raymond who doesn't even understand the concept of money. Charlie is enraged by what has happened and by his father keeping Raymond's existence from him for his entire life. He kidnaps Raymond from his residential home, and the two begin a long road trip that will lead them to an understanding of each other.....After the behemoth that was Top Gun, Cruise could have easily gone to do the huge blockbusters that he is known for today. But instead, he decided to dial it down for a few movies, thus giving us some of his greatest performances.And this has to be up there with his greatest performances of all time, because the moment we meet Charlie, we instantly have a huge dislike to his character, thanks to his abhorrent, selfish behaviour, and yuppy tendencies.It's clear that he has a chip on his shoulder from what his father did to him all those years ago, and in turns has made him a selfish individual. But as the film progresses, and learning from Raymond that material things do not make the man, Charlie begins to appreciate his brother, rather than the legacy that he has bequeathed.Hoffman as expected, is the heart of the narrative, and his depiction of autism is one of the most gentle, respectful, and genuine performances I've ever seen of a condition I've ever seen on screen, and he truly deserved every accolade he received for this film.The film is very funny in places, and heartbreaking in others, and the cinematography, especially during the road scenes, and the beautiful dance sequence, is jaw dropping.A beautiful film about leaving your pseudo life behind you and forgiving your past, and finding your future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great performances from Hoffman and Cruise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise) is a self-obsessed hustler selling high-end automobiles. His girlfriend Susanna (Valeria Golino) tries and fails to connect with him. His father dies and leaves him the 1948 Buick Roadmaster convertible. He drove it once without permission at 16 and got thrown in jail for 2 days. The estate in excess of $3 million is left to Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman) who is an autistic brother unknown to Charlie. Charlie kidnaps Raymond while trying to get his half share of the money.There are two terrific performances. Hoffman's careful dissection of an autistic character is one of the first such performances that I saw. It's the work of a master. Less acknowledged is the callous despicable Charlie character. Tom Cruise is unrelenting. He's the one who has to react to everything that Hoffman throws at him. His character has the growth and the changes. Their interactions are a fascinating watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its so rare that great dramas are as entertaining and fun as Rain Man, so the decision to check this off my to-see list was one I am very happy with making. As Barry Levinson said in his Oscar acceptance speech, this film really was about two actors. Tom Cruise shows how easy he can head up a film, and conveys Charlie's spoilt brat side and loving brother side with equal grace. His frustration is our frustration. But this show is all about Dustin Hoffman, and what a performance he gives. The voice, the body language, the mannerisms, the flawless delivery - Hoffman's performance is one of the finest ever to win Best Actor. The film's screenplay is wonderful, the dialogue it gives to Hoffman is itself worth an Oscar. Levinson's efforts in bringing all of these wonderful elements together is evident and praiseworthy. The score is a critical part of the film and does a great job keeping a film about autism light.The meaning of the title "Rain Man" is probably my favourite besides "The Silence of the Lambs" and is definitely the strongest scene in the film. Wonderfully handled by all, Rain Man is a real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances were quite extraordinary. Not only Hoffman but Tom Cruise was truly in the character too and they were the perfect combination for this movie. However, the scenario and the reflection of autism to the visual media was a little superficial and that's expected because it's based on a true character which is an exception, yet for a person who doesn't know that an individual with autism is presented in a much different way than in reality, it creates a different image for those who don't know. Apart from that, considering the movie as a whole it is a true Oscar material. It has every element that Oscars pay attention to, a moral, a brotherhood which is found, understanding the true meaning of values such as money... It is well accomplished movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you try to write about a movie like Rain Man, the review becomes more of an essay than an actual "review". Mostly because Rain Man is about the human mind and what it needs and what it wants; subject that's usually tackled through books rather than film. However, the movie answers these questions perfectly. And it's hard to write about anything that's truly perfect. But, here's what Rain Man as a movie is about. The film follows a workaholic brother by the name of Charlie Bay and his interactions with his savant brother Raymond. Telling you why Charlie has to interact with his brother is said in the synopsis above. But telling you in detail nears spoiler territory and that brings me to the first reason why this film is brilliant.The film highlights the details of everybody in the film. The film thrives of the small parts or scenes that would otherwise be secondary in other films. In other words, the film is built around how much you do and don't know about a character. That includes personality, how they talk, where they live, everything. It's both a blind viewer's utopia and dystopia rolled into one because if one thing is spoiled, there's always something right behind it to make up for it.Second, the film knows how much needs to be said in a shot or scene. It's like the Citizen Kane of weird, realistic, drama. It knows how much you need to know about a character. It knows how much landscape it should show you. It knows how much weird is enough. It knows what kind of lives these people live and how much you want to know about their lives. The pacing alone can fill three essays.Third, it's about characters. Not how the actors portray the characters, but about characters. Every actor and I mean EVERY actor, from Hoffman to the waitress in that one scene, they all become these characters. And that's what an actor should do in a movie. The actor should improve an already fantastic script. The actors play the characters so well that you can no longer see where the direction, acting, or writing ends or begins; it all just becomes one.Rain Man is beautifully simplistic and yet one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen. It deserves a spot on the greatest movies ever made no matter how small.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise)'s father left a fortune to his savant brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and a pittance to Charlie; they travel cross-country.This is a film that is not only brilliant for its script, not only prescient for its addressing autism before people knew what it was, but just a perfect example of casting. Hoffman is a strong actor and really shows it here. Cruise, not quite as strong, fits in perfectly as the pompous, well-coiffed 1980s capitalist.If you want to talk about modern classics, you want to talk about "Rain Man". Few films hold up as well as this one does. But then, there is just something about the 1980s that seems utterly timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain ManRain Man is a 1988 blockbuster, Oscar-winning film directed Barry Levinson, starring Tom Cruise as Charlie Babbitt, Dustin Hoffman as his autistic idiot savant brother(Raymond Babbitt), Charlie Babbitt is a brash, self-absorbed individual trying to play in the professional world. His father who he has been estranged from passes away and leaves his multi-million dollar estate to Raymond, a brother he never new about. Charlie is left with next to nothing from the estate. Valerie Golina plays Charlie's girlfriend (Susannah) and is with him when the estate is announced. Most of the film is an eventful cross-country trip which developed because Raymond refused to board a plane because of all of the crash history in his memory bank. The trip is slow and eventful because Charlie has to deal with Raymond's insistence on keeping all of his compulsive routines. Their relationship develops as they travel together bringing out the themes of the movie that 'every human is valuable' and family loyalty is key. They take a detour to Las Vegas because Charlie realizes that Raymond's math skills could help him win the money he needs for his shattered business dealings. Family loyalty is key, but Charlie also believes in family helps family so wasn't above trying to make Raymond's strengths work for him. Rain Man has some similarities to A Beautiful Mind (2001. This film is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr., who is a schizophrenic mathematician who made many contributions to his field particularly to game theory, while at the same time struggling with paranoid delusions. Russell Crowe portrays Nash with a very human approach as Raymond was portrayed in Rain Man. In both films, the disabled character's personality shines through. Sound editing stood out in Rain Man particularly due to Raymond's reaction to sounds such as ambulance sirens screeching, water filling the bathtub and clocks ticking because of his autistic characteristics. These scenes used sound with great impact magnifying it so that viewers could understand what it was like to be Raymond. This contributed to the theme's development by allowing the viewer to identify with Charlie's attempt to cope with his brother's disability. Scene editing was also key in that the editors changed up the pace of the action and the number of cuts depending on the nature of the scenes. When Raymond and Charlie were having a bonding moment, the action slowed via the editing techniques used, thus contributing to the development of their relationship and the development of the theme.Dialogue, sound editing, and brilliant scene assembly contributed to this Oscar-winning film by allowing the audience to fully relate to these characters as their relationship grew and Charlie realized that Raymond was much more important than many of his original aspirations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's been a misguided belief in movie fans that to win an Oscar, your chances will increase if you're playing somebody with a mental or physical handicap. That certainly is true as evidenced by the number of people who have won for playing disabled characters, but there certainly have been a ton of actors who didn't get a nomination for playing such roles. In the case of Dustin Hoffman as the unknown older brother to Tom Cruise, it is obvious as to why he won, and that is the fact that his second Oscar win came for one of the single best film performances ever put onto film.Tom Cruise's Charlie Babbitt is a total selfish S.O.B. who is surprised by finding out that his late father left his estate to an unknown person and only left him an expensive antique sport scar which had been the cause of their rift years before. Investigating the beneficiary, Cruise ventures to a hospital for the handicapped where he encounters Raymond (Hoffman), an autistic man who recognizes the car which forces the hospital's administrator to reveal that indeed, Raymond is the older brother Cruise never knew he had, only having encountered him in what he felt was a childhood dream as "rain man".While Charlie remains a very selfish character, his motivations change as he gets to know his brother, going from wanting to get control of the estate (to save his failing sport scar business) to getting custody of Raymond. But no matter his intentions of wanting to get to know his brother, the question arises as to if a mentally handicapped man like Hoffman's Raymond can make it in society even surrounded by the best that money has to offer. Fortunately, the selfish Charlie has a very wise girlfriend (Valeria Golino) who pushes him to try to get to know his brother in the first place, and this opens up the possibility that there is a chance that Charlie will learn that the world doesn't just focus on him and his needs and that there is certainly something more important in life than just making a name for yourself in business to prove to a dead man (the unseen father whom he resents even after death) that you can make it without him.While Cruise gives an honorable performance, his character is certainly too smarmy to really totally like. It's Hoffman who wins praise here hands down, giving a detailed nuance to everything that Raymond does. When actors do win Oscars for playing characters like this or with other handicapped (such as Cliff Robertson for "Charly" and Daniel Day Lewis for "My Left Foot"), it is because there is more than just an element of reality to their characterizations. They win Oscars for these performances because they show the average movie goer what these characters are really like. It asks the question, "What really is the definition of being handicapped?" and explodes open our view of the world past what we simply only see on the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Dustin Hoffman role and performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Cruise is 20-something Charlie Babbitt, living in Los Angeles and trying to make big money on a shifty luxury car business. He is stretched thin and needs to make a deal come together quickly, but then gets jolting news. His dad back at their home in Cincinnati has just died, Charlie needs to go back for the funeral and hopefully to collect his inheritance. But his mom had died when he was very young, he and his dad never got along well, and in fact Charlie left and never looked back, and failed to stay in touch. In short he was a self-centered jackass in all aspects of his life and relationships. It turns out Charlie was left very little, and most of the $3 Million inheritance went to a trust, and as he dragged it out of the administrator, Charlie found that he had an older brother he never knew about, Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt, living all his adult life in an institution. Later in the story Charlie remembers what he had thought was an imaginary friend named Rain Man but it in fact was his brother Raymond.Charlie wants and needs his half of the inheritance. He is determined to take Raymond back to Los Angeles to live with him, takes him away from the institution without permission. What starts out as "the road trip from hell" because of Raymond's quirks eventually turns into a 6-day bonding experience. Raymond is an autistic savant and a turn card-counting at a Vegas casino proves entertaining. So the story is really about the two brothers bonding on a level that they can, and Charlie learning some lessons about life. A very good movie, a classic of sorts.SPOILERS: In the end, even though Charlie and Raymond make it back to the apartment in Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Raymond can't be successfully removed from the environment of the institution. When the mediator asks him if he wants to stay with his brother in L.A. he answers "Yes." Then when asked if he wants to go back to Cincinnati he also answers "Yes." His function is not high enough to allow him to make decisions. As Charlie sees Raymond off on the train back to Cincinnati it is sad but Charlie has found his family and presumably has learned to be a better person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent movie, this movie just shows that super complex plot or many intense action scenes are not needed for a movie to be great. ''Rain Man'' is a very mellow, calm and moving movie about Charlie Babbitt and his new found brother Raymond, who is autistic, but has a gift - he can memorize anything.Dustin Hoffman, playing Raymond, displayed insane acting skill in this movie. That is easily one of the best acting performances i have ever seen in any movie, it felt like he went so deep into the character, there was not a single flaw in his acting throughout the whole movie. Definitely playing a very interesting and complex character, to say at least, he is one of the few actors who is capable of pulling acts like this off, just an incredible performance. Tom Cruise was really good too, have never been a fan of Cruise, but his performance was just outstanding, he had a role, which was not as complex as that of Hoffman's, but still an awesome performance.The story had the reality aspect to it, nothing too crazy, since we know this movie is based on true events. It was just great to see how a completely normal guy tries to understand a mentally unstable person, who just doesn't go by the rules of society.Definitely, a great watch, a movie that can easily be watched many times, not only once, easily one of the best characters and performances ever! A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is something of a great cinematic achievement that Rain Man became the great film it clearly is because the story surrounding it is interestingly Hollywood in itself.Four directors, six screenwriters, two cinematographers, eight producers, writers strikes, crew change, and a studio fighting for its life.All of the above are common knowledge but it doesn't hurt to remember these facts when viewing the award wining triumph of a movie that stands the test of time today. The film is so simple in structure it really needed something special to pull it out of the prospective banality of being "just another road movie about finding oneself", Rain Man achieves something special by tackling its subjects with very sensitive hands and splicing a believable human concept into the story via the incredible shows from its two leading men.Dustin Hoffman gives a magical moving performance as the Autistic Savant Raymond, the ultimate complement I can pay the performance is that it really is believable, both moving and clever rolled into one artistic result. Tom Cruise is equally as great in a role that called for drastic layer changes, a role that demanded much conviction from the actor taking it on, and Cruise gives the role much depth as he goes from shallow bastard to a very emotive and feeling human being, it's a great show that stands up to reevaluation these days. A performance that seems to have sadly been forgotten in light of Hoffman's film stealing show. With a film such as this you pray that the ending can do it justice, and I'm glad to say that there is no pandering here, it's an ending that says so much because it doesn't cop out, I thank god for those rewrites because the endings to the original scripts would of had me booting the TV set out of the window.Essential cinema. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just One of The Best Movies of the 80s, One of the Best Movies In Any Decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This feel-good comedic drama was one of the first to deal with a mental disability. Autism is more common today than it was in the 80s, so Rain Man is perhaps more relevant now than then. It follows selfish yuppie, Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) who is angry that he did not get over $1 million of inheritance from his father whom he never had a good relationship with. When he finds out all the money went to his older brother, Raymond, (Hoffman) with high-functioning autism he never knew he had, Charlie kidnaps him to get his cut. Raymond's social ignorance, lack of communication and odd rituals bug the living hell out of Charlie, until Charlie sees the good in Raymond and gets out of his self-centred world. Dustin Hoffman gives his most recognizable and best performance as the Rain Man. The movie may be a drama, but Hoffman provides all the comic-relief this movie needs with his rituals, ignorance and intelligence. The movie is a triumph based on Hoffman's performance alone. His Oscar win for this was one of the easiest wins in the Academy's history. Tom Cruise also gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the one that drives the movie. He is the protagonist and the one that changes the most throughout the film, starting as a mean car salesman to a humble, loving one. I mentioned that it was funny seeing Hoffman bug Cruise, but it is just as funny seeing Cruise throw his hissy fits because his is so annoyed by his brother. The brother-to-brother relationship is strong and original. The information that is delivered about autism is done in a strong and simple way. This is a must see movie that just makes you want to hug yourself because of how nice it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man is sad and funny in equal measure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt's father left a fortune to his savant brother Raymond and a pittance to Charlie; they travel cross- country. Charles Sanford "Charlie" Babbit' played by Tom Cruise, is a self-centred Los Angeles-based automobile dealer/hustler/bookie who is at war with his own life. Charlie, as a young teenager, used his father's 1948 Buick convertible without permission and as a result, he went to jail for two days on account that his father reported it stolen. It is then that Charlie learns that his estranged father died and left him from his last will and testament a huge bed of roses and the car while the remainder will of $3 Million goes into a trust fund to be distributed to someone. Charlie seemed pretty angry by this and decides to look into this matter. It seems as if that "someone" is Raymond, played by Dustin Hoffman, is Charlie's unknown brother, an autistic savant who lives in a world of his own, resides at the Walbrook Institute. Charlie then kidnaps Raymond and decides to take him on a lust for life trip to the west coast as a threat to get the $3 Million inheritance. Raymond's acts and nagging, including repeated talks of "Abbott &amp; Costello" Rain Man is just a terrific film that lingers with you after viewing it for the first time, I especially loved how Charlie rejected his brother, Raymond, but then he really began to care for him, that really for me is what makes Rain Man such a heart-warming and heart wrenching film. Another example of how deeply sad it can be is where Raymond when he was young was a comforting figure to Charlie as Charlie use to call him "Rain Man". As the two brothers spend more and more time together the form a strong bond together that is just so heart-warming. Rain Man is truly a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie played a role to spread recognition about the autism in the world. This story is touched my heart. Anyway, it is simply good performance of Dustin Hoffman. I am surprised by the ability of the performance. He handled a difficult duty wonderfully was a show stopper. Furthermore, the performance of Tom cruise becoming the gentle expression is wonderful as I repeat time. After all I thought that a script, the cast, music, places were splendid. I think that a splendid movie was possible because all is splendid. I savored the lingering sensation of being moved. This movie was touched my heart, so I want to watch again several years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really heartwarming story.This movie draws it well that the change of a selfish man Charlie. It makes me surprised how strong the relationship between brothers. If they are apart from each other for a long time, they can establish an emotional bond with them. First, Charlie is very selfish man who left home long time ago. When his father is dead, he searches Raymond for money and he notices Raymond is his brother. Raymond is autism man in a facility.During the journey with Raymond, he tries to understand his brother's feeling.Raymond also opens his mind to Charlie.This movie tells us that the strong tie of a family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man missed a good chance to be a major universal phenomenon in cinema !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the theme of two unknown people knowing each other during the course of a journey is not at all new, neither for world cinema nor for sagacious viewers, American director Barry Levenson's 'Rain Man' remains very much "an American film" in essence. The Americanization of a universal story is its biggest drawback. The film is replete with plethora of easily recognizable symbols of American culture namely casinos in Las Vegas, American style desperation to watch successful TV shows and consume food items which are considered an essential part of American cuisine. Despite these shortcomings, Rain Man manages to retain its label of 'an entertainer' for viewers of all ages and tastes as it makes effective use of two big Hollywood actors Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise to portray how strange circumstances drive an ambitious man to have a change of heart. As a feel good film, Rain Man is a successful film about the emotional bonding of two people who do not have much in common. Actor Dustin Hoffman is so convincing in his role that he has no trouble in making us all believe that intelligent are the ones who appear sheer nerds to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible performance from Hoffman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rain Man' is Hollywood at its best. It tells the story of an arrogant , ego-centric man Charlie ( Tom Cruise ) who's life is turned upside down when he meets his autistic brother Raymond ( Dustin Hoffman ). Charlie's initial selfish intentions gradually disappear as he learns what a fantastic mind his brother has. Watching the effect of Raymond upon Charlie throughout the course of the film is wonderful.The script deserves praise for it's intricate character development but ultimately it is Hoffman who brings the film to life, in one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. He actually becomes his character , Raymond , and his attention to detail is astonishing. Tom Cruise also gives a superb performance , this was one of his earlier films that helped him burst onto the scene. Hans Zimmer's music score is also fantastic and the editing/ cinematography in this film is sublime - the countryside back-drop in particular is magnificent.This is a truly brilliant film. One of the few best picture winners that actually deserved the award. This is a tale about real bonding and the importance of family. I would fully recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bond of brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain Man is the story about the bond of brothers. Charlie, who works as an automobile dealer in Los Angeles, realizes that his father died and left only his old car and roses in his garden to him. Charlie becomes angry because his brother receives multimillion-dollar estate from his father. In order to get the legacy, Charlie tries to find his brother Raymond. When Charlie finds his brother, he realizes that his brother is an autistic savant and is in a medical facility. At the beginning, Charlie is not nice to his brother and selfish. However, gradually Charlie realizes that he is caring about Raymond. The film has great characters and their acting is brilliant. I am sure that you really like this film and it touches you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Very sparkly, very twinkly" performance by Hoffman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Babbitt played by Tom Cruise was a selfish young professional who was informed that his father was dead and left a fortune worth 3 million dollars to a trust fund which would be given to someone. This turned out to be astonished for Charlie to learn that he has an estranged brother who he encountered at the Walbrook psychiatric Institute. Seeking for the share of the money, Charlie kept the custody of his brother and went for a car trip due to Raymond's phobia of flying. Dustin Hoffman delivered an outstanding performance, as an autistic savant, Raymond Babbitt, who has issues communicating in the conventional way due to his mental neurological condition. We learnt that Raymond doesn't have anyone intimate to him other than Vern, who was just the guard of the mental institution. Like other patients in the psychiatric institution, Raymond was safeguarded and constrained to the daily routine, even the weekly diet was implanted into his brain.Raymond is an astounding character written and played at the film, it captures the quintessence of a mental patient who has emotional feelings and other things care about in spite of the obscurity of communicating these emotions. He is capable of being affectionate and bond with people once he is opened up to others. The portrayal of the character was impeccable, the way Raymond avoided eye contact during conversations and had to keep a television within his perimeter was eloquently executed.The character has his own peccadilloes yet the society has labeled him as an outsider. Yet, Raymond has shown his idiosyncrasy during the course of the movie and his aptitude of memorizing things among others, it's shown that he is more capable than the society told him. As the two brothers travel across the country, they learnt and accepted each other as they had developed an unusual relationship at the end of the movie. As the two acquainted, they made a connection between them and even joked as one of my favorite line of the film 'Kmart sucks,' when Doctor Bruner asked if Raymond would like to put some of his Kmart clothes on. Overall, the movie was moved and provides series of powerful performances from both of the protagonist which was more than satisfying to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raymond is the Rain Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow i saw this movie for the first time yesterday night and if I'm being honest i really thought i was going to dislike it simply because I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise. I remember thinking of him as arrogant also cocky seems like he acts like he is Johnny Depp when he is not however Dustin Hoffman just watch his other movies like The Graduate , Tootsie , Kramer vs Kramer and more he is truthfully one of the best actors of all time like Depp. You can tell by how he played Raymond so intelligent yet so Autistic. His voice, The way he stares into the world, sporadically accurate, yet stuck in repetition , his movements through out the movie. He worked hard on it probably one of the hardest roles in a movie to play. This is my Fourth review on IMDb and its so tough how to describe this movie. Its really emotional I did not cry however there were a lot of moments were you felt what they were going through. Charlie changes through the movie he is first selfish and slowly transforms into an understanding and loving of Raymond. The moment that was my favorite and got to me the most was when Charlie figured out Raymond was the protective figure from his childhood who helped him when he was scared who he thought was an imaginary friend named "Rain Man", which was a mispronunciation of Raymond. Raymond was not just autistic he helped his brother Charlie out along time ago to me Raymond or his alter ego "Rain Man" was the Hero and Charlie as his brother could only do what his heart said to do - Look after your brother and protect him like he did for me along time ago - That being said a wonderful movie it has a few funny bits on there journey. I also saw Awakenings with Robert De Niro and Robin Williams and its very similar but different . I recommend this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rain Man" is an excellent movie. It certainly deserved it's award for Best Picture in 1988 or 1989. For those who love to travel on highways you'll enjoy this. It's a very touching movie. Dustin Hoffman stars as an autistic savant. Tom Cruise stars as his brother. Tom Cruise's character is a self-absorbed yuppie. Dustin Hoffman's is more carefree. It's a movie that'll make you cry. There's a lot of drama and action in this film. It's also a lot of fun. See it for yourself. In one scene there's a hilarious and entertaining moment where they discuss planes and Tom's character gets worked up over it. It's sad the way he abuses Charlie in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for Tom Cruise and I like it. Charlie Babbitt is Raymond's brother but he don't know that. He hadn't known it before his father is that. Raymond who is an autistic man is Rain Man. Rain man is Charlie's friend in his own imagination when he was a child. Charlie and Charlie's girlfriend(Sussanna) like Raymond. Raymond is very regular man and he says every time "I am a very good driver!". He is very interesting for me. Because if he doesn't do his plan, he will be shock. I am very upset when the film was finished. Because Raymond went to Walbrook with Dr. Bruner. I think, Raymond should stayed with Charlie. Raymond learned something from his brother for me. If Raymond stayed with Charlie, this film would be better for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing Rain Man reminds me of The Graduate, another of Dustin Hoffman's most popular films. Some films tell big stories about the nature of humanity, or our social dynamics, where other films tell a nice contained story. Both of these films are in the latter, and thus the degree of how much one will like the film comes down to a viewers' taste. I really liked both of these films, but consider the Graduate to be far superior- but that's just me. I'm sure there are many people who are the exact opposite. Anyway, Rain Man is an exceptionally charming film with broad appeal due to its positive messages about family and lifestyle.The topic of autism is handled incredibly well. The process of Charlie meeting his brother and being impossibly fed up with his shortcomings is sadly believable for his character, as is his gradual acceptance and caring, though not without his outbursts. A week such as this wouldn't completely reinvigorate a person, but it certainly changes his perspective from his enclosed world of money.The two leads are brilliant: Raymond's mannerisms are so believable, and his presence is soft but powerful. His foil is his brother Charlie, greedy and inconsiderate. He's a p****. But time brings these unknown brothers together believably, with no one single moment of 'the big change', hallmark of bad 'transformation' films. Raymond is the catalyst for Charlie's change in the scientific definition: he himself does not change. The film may make it seem like Raymond too has evolved, but he hasn't. His routine has. A year after the film finishes he would be right back at the start, albeit with a caring brother.Rain Man is a great story from an efficient script with enjoyable dialogue and a smooth pace. The technical side of the film is conventional: costumes, music and set design is very 80's. Some films have greater potential than others, and Rain Man achieves all it can. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you have autism? Does someone you know have autism? Are you interested in thought provoking movies that you'll want to own and watch every year? Well, this is the right movie for you. I would not recommend it to kids because of all the language in it. But I do think that it is worth everyone's time. It deserved every award that it won from best original screenplay to best picture. If anyone you know is interested in a good movie watch this. The movie is so good that I get sad at the end. I don't think that the ending is sad, but I'm disappointed that the movie is over. But that's all the more reason to watch it again. This is truly a cinematic masterpiece that everyone should watch at some point in their lives. It's serious, yet you'll probably laugh at certain points too. If you know anyone that is unusual, be sure to watch this movie and pretend that they are Raymond Babbit. You might learn something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this film many times and it gets better by each viewing.The film centres around Charlie Babbit, a selfish and arrogant thirty-something car dealer who is suffering from massive debt due to over-due loans. His rich estranged father has died and Babbit jr finds out that $3m of his estate has been passed over him into a "trust". Charlie's inheritance includes the car which ended his relationship with his father and rose bushes.Charlie, along with his harassed girlfriend Susanna go to investigate and find the "trustee" is a doctor in charge of a care home called the Walbrook Institute and the man who has inherited the $3m is the big brother that Charlie never knew he had. Raymond is an autistic savant with care needs but also a splendid memory for facts and figures.Charlie, angered by this revelation, "kidnaps" Raymond from his home (although he is a voluntary patient) and demands negotiations around the will with Dr Bruner, the man in charge of Raymond's care.What follows is a road movie of sorts which delves into the depths of character study of the two brothers in both humorous and serious tone which by the conclusion gives the viewer food for thought.Rain Man has been criticised by his stereotyping of people with autism but having autism myself I can't see anything in the film to provoke this except maybe for its minor generalisation (Raymond's memory, strict life routines, difficulty in human interaction). That alone is no more offensive than films showing a pair of twins talking at the same time which appears regularly in a lot of films.Rain Man is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raining With Excellence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain Man has got to be one of my favourite movies ever. The whole basis of the story was unique and well acted. Both Hoffman and Cruise played their respective roles terrifically and added depth to an already moving storyline. Not many movies have ever engaged me this much with a relationship between two characters. Although the movie doesn't have special effects like almost all movies now a days, it still grabbed my attention and made me feel deeply attached to Ray. The development of the story and the life of both Ray and Charlie was moving and touching. I honestly think this movie is underrated and deserves to be closer to that number one ranked spot in the top 250 movies. Movies I've previously seen are garbage compared to Rain Man! This movie proves a classic and will surely show up on my TV screen soon again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise and Valeria Golino star in Barry Levinson's 1988 drama. Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) is a car dealer who learns that his father has just passed away. He's left with his estate and car, but learns that someone has inherited 3 million dollars. Soon, he meets autistic savant, Ray (Hoffman) and discovers he's not only the beneficiary, but his older brother he never knew until now. Charlie decides to take Ray cross country with him until he gets half of the money. Charlie eventually realizes that family is more important and bonds with Ray. Golino plays Charlie's girlfriend, Susanna and Levinson also makes a cameo as a psychiatrist. Dustin and Tom are great together and this is definitely one of their best films. Hans Zimmer's score is also great as usual and I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Performance from Cruise and Hoffman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The power of this movie remains decades after it was released. One of the best movies I have ever seen.Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbock, a very self-centered man. He learns that his long estranged father has died, and is upset when the will is read. The money winds up going to Raymond Babbock (Dustin Hoffman), his much older brother who he never knew existed up to this point. Raymond is in an institution because he is a man with savant syndrome, a disorder on the autism spectrum. Charlie is upset because all the money went to Raymond, who does not know anything about money, or understand money's purpose or value.Charlie takes Raymond with him to try to bargain in order to get what he thinks is his rightful share of his dead father's money. He tries to take him on an airplane to L.A. but Raymond is terrified of airplanes, leaving them to get there by car - a three day journey.It is on this road trip that Charlie gets to know his brother very well. In this movie you see Charlie gradually transform from an impatient, selfish man, who treats Raymond like an object, rather than a person, to someone who grows to understand, and love Raymond. Anyone who thinks Tom Cruise can't act, needs to buy or rent this DVD and watch it over and over again. Watch for the gradual change in Charlie's heart.I give this movie a ten.</fullReview>

Rain Man is my second favourite film after The Shawshank Redemption, but it's a pretty close call. An amazing screenplay and excellent directing, this film is thresh hold to many great things. And Tom Cruise's performance in Rain Man is underrated and was also deserving of an Oscar nomination. Before the film's release, it was expected the film would be awful, with Hoffman and Cruise calling the film "Two Schmuck's in a Car" during filming. But a surprise came with the film being an Oscar winner and truly special. Rain Man is "Definetly" a very good film.</fullReview>

The transformation in tom cruise behavior in no way looked like it was forced and it was nice to see how with time and situations things change so much. The film got boring when they tried to make the journey too long. But that was just for a few minutes and later everything seemed to fit in so nicely that you can hardly say after watching completely that it was not worth watching.A must watch for people with a taste of performances and storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie in 2012, and it is still definitely great.Rain Man is a road movie of brothers. I think it is quite special among movies about family. And I suppose this is because I could feel that the brothers actually accept each other as their part of life by sensing very small things. There was no rapid change, but it was true that some connections were between them. Of course it is very hard for them to totally open their minds due to the 20 years and illness, but the road trip could narrow the gap a little bit between Raymond and Charlie.I like the ending. There is no huge change in there lives, but the brothers actually go through some tiny changes. Way more realistic. Also it was very sad to see that Charlie could not help but let Raymond go back. I could see something unspeakable in his eyes when Charlie said good bye to his brother. Tom Cruise is a excellent actor. And of course, no doubt, Dustin Hoffman is amazingly talented. His performance was astonishing in this movie. And I got to respect him more after knowing that he is the one who changed the ending of the film. I will never forget his role as Raymond.... legendary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a very successful young entrepreneur. But when his father dies, and the will is read, Charlie finds out that he has an autistic brother, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), to whom his father has bequeathed his million-dollar estate. Looking for revenge, Charlie kidnaps Raymond and takes him on a cross-country road trip to Los Angeles.The only good thing about this movie is Dustin Hoffman's acting. Hoffman, as he does in most of his movies, makes the character believable. If I had not known that Hoffman was acting, I would have thought that he really was autistic. He was very much deserving of the Best Actor Oscar. With this performance, Hoffman cemented himself as one of the greatest actors of our time. Cruise's performance, on the other hand, made me want to turn off the TV. Cruise seems to play the same spoiled-brat, punk character in all his earlier movies. Throughout the movie, his character continuously berates Raymond for his behavior. Raymond does not understand when Charlie scolds him. Charlie is loud, foul-mouthed, and downright annoying. I know that Charlie is supposed to be the antagonist, but this portrayal took it too far.The move making quality of the film was good, but not above average. The soundtrack and score offered a variety of selections. This movie could have been a feel-good film. Instead, I found myself annoyed at the foul language and ignorance of Cruise's character in the film.</fullReview>

"Rain Man" tells the story of the bonding between two brothers: Tom Cruise as "Charlie", the greedy car salesman with a recently deceased father, and Dustin Hoffman as "Raymond", the long-forgotten autistic savant brother. Throughout the movie, we go on a road trip with the two brothers, and follow the mayhem that involves Raymond's disability. Some moments made you laugh, some moments made you cry, and some moments can show the true bonding between two long-forgotten brothers. Director Barry Levinson arranges a movie that contains two great actors, an inspiring script, an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, a perfect soundtrack, neat cinematography, and all of the sweet drama. Tom Cruise portrays an excellent role in this movie, but it's Dustin Hoffman that deserved his Best Actor Oscar win for his role as the autistic savant brother Raymond, who sometimes brought hilarious and dramatic moments. "Rain Man" is a movie that can beat the odds on screen, and warm the hearts of an audience. This movie is like no other movie I have seen, and it's one of my personal favorite movies to this day. "Rain Man", in my review, "a wonderful portrait of brotherhood".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an almost novel twist to the usual Hollywood tear-jerking formula a self-centered young LA entrepreneur learns the hard way how to be his brother's keeper, after inheriting (reluctantly) an older, autistic savant sibling when their father dies. Together they make an unlikely but fascinating pair of social misfits: one is mentally and emotionally disabled (despite his mathematical memory); the other is mentally and emotionally immature, and both are difficult to warm up to at first, making their gradual connection over a long, cross-country road trip all the more rewarding. Dustin Hoffman tackles the more difficult (and more showy) role, but because the character is limited by his disability the film is slanted toward the more photogenic Tom Cruise. Director Barry Levinson laminates the already calculated scenario under a thick commercial glaze, to the point where even the snapshots shown over the closing credits (supposedly taken by the autistic Hoffman from a fast-moving car) look perfectly composed and artfully arranged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most heart-warming films of all time, coupled with superb acting and well-paced direction, it stands as one of Cruise's best performance (apart from probably only Valkyrie or The Firm). The clichd road trip to finding inner understanding and over time understanding one another is explored with new dynamics and a more meaningful perspective. It lets us experience the trials and tribulations of the mentally ill, and it's incredibly light heartedness in dealing with autistic issues at times highlights the dark and twisted cruelty of society. It does, also, provide for pleasurable and comedic viewing.The film is a combination of heart-warming comedy and stellar emotionally-provoking drama. The team up of Cruise and Hoffman is a gem. Hoffman as Raymond Babbit is sensational and undoubtedly is the star of this film. His excellent acting convinces us, and then convicts us for our own mistreatings in society. Overall, a classic that should never be overlooked. Good acting, good direction, and most importantly, good humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man ranks among the most popular films of the late 1980s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On his father's death, a young wheeler-dealer (Tom Cruise), heavily in debt, discovers to his chagrin that all the money is left to an autistic elder brother (Dustin Hoffman), unknown to him. The film won a People's Choice Award as the "Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture."Rain Man is a road film with a difference, featuring one of the most showy, and admittedly memorable leading performances in recent years. Hoffman is remarkably meticulous in his portrayal of the immutable, repetitive idiot savant. Yet the film stands and falls on Cruise: it later became a clich that he chose characters who progressed from arrogant egotism to selflessness, yet that is precisely what is required here. Working from a script that pushes all the right buttons, Barry Levinson directs with snap, energy and a good deal of wit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man is a great film, I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When I was a young kid and I got scared the Rain Man would come and sing to me," Charlie Babbit (Cruise) said of a nostalgic memory from his childhood. This, is a quote that should stick with you throughout the movie because the whole plot is somewhat centered on it. During the reading of his father's will only two things really stuck with him, the Buick convertible that tore through the strands of their relationship and the three million dollars in a trust fund he has no access to. On the hunt to try and get the three million dollars he soon discovers that it went to his new found younger autistic brother (Hoffman) and even though he's a highly functioning mathematical genius who can count just about if not anything instantaneously, doesn't understand the concept of money. Raymond recites Albert and Costello's "Who's on First" (to keep him calm when things are out of place and he feels unsafe) and is a skit that he believes is a trivia question but Charlie later reveals to him is a joke. Now because he is mad at his deceased father, Charlie decides to kidnap his brother upon the day of meeting him because, he wanted his half of the three million. The people on the voting committee of the Oscars seemed to have agreed with me when I say that Hoffman did an exceptional job of portraying Raymond (the autistic younger brother). Yes, the cast was a major strength along with Barry Marrow and Ronald Bass' job on the story and screen play. My only problem and their only weakness was in the scene when Charlie was trying to force Raymond on the plane Raymond's fit seemed to be cued from somebody offset. Throughout the movie some of the things Charlie does and goes through to make sure that Raymond is still living by his daily routine is one of the moments that make you want to laugh and feel bad or cry at the same time. One of these moments is when Raymond recites "Who's on First" while walking along the highway with Charlie trailing slowly behind him in the old Buick because after driving past an accident Raymond feels that the highway is unsafe. Overall I love this movie and recommend that everybody should watch it at least once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the non-expressions of Raymond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of this film is that there is no price one can put on brotherly love. Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a young and unscrupulous car dealer, who is hustling exotic sports cars to wealthy businessmen. While living in Los Angeles, Charlie receives word that his father has died, and he must travel to Cincinnati, Ohio to settle the estate. Upon his arrival in Cincinnati, he discovers that his inheritance is some prize flower bushes and a 1949 Buick Roadmaster. Charlie also discovers that three million dollars has mysteriously been left to an unknown trustee and beneficiary. He finds out that the trustee is an East Coast mental institution and the beneficiary is an autistic brother, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), whom he did not know existed. Charlie heads east to get his share of the three million dollars and to gather up his brother.In order to get his half of the inheritance, Charlie decides he must win his brother's trust, so he is taking him home to California with him. He soon learns that autistic people have many eccentricities when Raymond refuses to fly and insists on driving the trip. Raymond's insistence that his underwear come from Kmart frustrates Charlie as well. Raymond is not just eccentric but has some surprising talents as well. Charlie soon learns that Raymond has an remarkable memory and exploits this ability in Las Vegas by counting cards at the blackjack tables. On this journey, the brothers endure the humorous moments and also the tender moments of two persons bonding. Near the end of the film, Charlie learns the meaning of brotherly love and unselfishly leaves the three million dollars in the trust to care for Raymond.The trip is a motif of this film because many times, throughout the movie, the viewer is led back to it. The expressions of Charlie, or the non-expressions of Raymond, are emphasized by close-ups and then a fade away. The self-centered Charlie Babbitt, who started this escapade with a selfish motive, is completely a changed man at the end. He learns that caring for his brother is the more important than any amount of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman is excellent in this movie. Good humor and good drama too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film probably ranks as my favorite movie that Tom Cruise is in, but I give most of the credit to Dustin Hoffman for making this movie so entertaining. The film follows this dude whose business is in bit of a financial mess. He is estranged from his father and now his father has passed away having left all his fortune to someone other than his son. Well the son ends up finding out that he has a brother and takes this brother on a cross country trip, at first to try to get some of the money. His new brother is autistic so there is a lot of outbursts from the younger sibling as he just does not know how to cope with the older brother's mental condition. However, over time he begins to get closer to this new brother and he actually wishes to take care of his older sibling, not for the money, but because he begins to actually care for him. The movie is really good and I love the interplay between Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman is excellent at playing a person with autism, you can understand why Tom Cruise's character gets so annoyed as he is not used to dealing with this condition. I also enjoy road trip movies like this one too. Nothing like hitting the open road with characters that are rather different and such. The humor is great as I loved the underwear part and I loved how Tom Cruise's character fixed the problem of there not being the right amount of fish sticks. Simply a really enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie a few times over the years and thought it about time to comment on it. It's over 20 years old now and you can see some of the late 80s stamped on it. Doesn't detract from it though. Dustin Hoffman really nails this part and well-deserves the Oscar. Additionally it excelled in it's human story of a left out bitter brother who begins to learn a thing or two besides the importance of money. The road trip culminating with the Vegas scenes showed an interesting growth and acceptance. Probably one of the best scenes in the movie was the Pink Cadillac pancake scene where Raymond identifies the maple syrup joke, and Chailie Babbitt (Cruise's character) picking up the impact of it later in his defense. He's grown by the end of the movie and we can easily identify it as he starts to un-latch from money and pick s up nuances of his past that is associated with his older impaired brother. It's the simple and endearing quality in the movie that makes it a strong picture and recommended deservedly winning best picture and director director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man took me a while to get into, but once I did, I was totally absorbed in the film.The story is about somewhat of a snob of a man, Charlie Babbit. He finds out that his father, who he hadn't written, called, or talked to since he was a teenager, had passed away. Without even shedding a tear he goes to his fathers funeral. He later finds out that his father, a millionaire, only left him the car that ruined their relationship in the first place. The 3 million dollars that he did leave was left to Raymond Babbit... his brother. Charlie never knew he had a brother. Raymond is autistic, but very highly functioning. He can do math problems and count at unimaginable rates.Dustin Hoffman as Raymond, is unbelievable. I didn't realize just how good his performance was, until I began arguing with myself whether Raymond was a real person, or just a character in a film. You won't believe Hoffman is just acting.The story is very moving, and yes, I did shed a tear or two. And I'm sure you will too.Rain Man is an incredible piece of film.7.8/10</fullReview>

He has learnt brilliantly about autism.Great touching story, brilliant script and filming.The story shows about what it's like being and living with someone who's autistic. I thought the ending was very sad and disappointing because Ray should have gone with Charlie.This I really recommend you should watch.

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Arrogant, self centred Los Angeles car salesman Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) learns that his father, with whom he parted on bad terms, has died. Even more shockingly, he learns he has left him not a penny in his will but instead to a much older brother he never knew he had. And even more shockingly, his long lost brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) is an autistic savant who has lived in care all his adult life. Determined to get his greedy mits on his father's cash, Charlie travels to the care home and kidnaps Raymond, unaware of how Raymond's eccentric rituals, from only buying his underwear from K Mart in Cincinnatti, to insisting on watching People's Court at a certain time, to only flying on QUANTAS air flights because 'they're the only one that's never crashed', will drive him to the brink of insanity. But being in charge of something so vulnerable eventually melts even rude Charlie's heart, and as they begin the cross country drive back to LA, including a stop over in Las Vegas where Charlie uses Ray's memory to work wonders at the Roulette table, they form a bond that changes both their lives forever.With the film adaptation of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time now apparently abandoned?!?, it falls on the most memorable film to deal with autism for me to make an announcement. I myself have a mild form of autism, in the shape of Asperger's Syndrome, that I have known about from the age of twelve. In the plot summary section, it states this is what Raymond has in the film, but as others have commented and I concur, he is severely autistic, not an 'aspie.' I cannot professionally diagnose anyone, but I think I've come to know enough to be able to say what is what in this sense. Just clearing that up, then.Aside from a stirring, well developed story, what's got to carry the film is the performances from the two leading men. They are, of course, both brilliant. Hoffman deserves praise for his leading role, but even taking into account the incorrect description of his character on the PS, his role does seem a little corny now. Despite using his method acting technique, hanging around with autistic people and studying their mannerisms and behaviours and as well as the film makers having the consultation of six behavioural psychologists on the condition, as others have stated, with what's now known about autism since the film came out twenty years ago, his behaviour is a little too simplistic and straight forward. Suffering mildly from the condition myself, I'd have to go with this. The real surprise performance is from Cruise, though. In earlier films like this, before his name became synonymous with being a 'big movie star', I guess he showed he could handle serious roles that required more depth and heart. Praise too for Valeria Golino as his girlfriend, who tries to get him to see how he uses people and tries to get the best side out of him.This was an inspired and original film when it first came out and has remained so till today. Barry Levinson has crafted a moving and gentle piece that moves at the right pace and surprises the viewer in different and exciting ways. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, you have to see this movie to judge for yourself. Raymond, one of the main characters is autistic-savant. It's a movie about love between two brothers, one is much younger and very successful in life (Charlie Babbitt, played by Tom Cruise) and the other is the autistic older brother (Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin Hoffman, he got an acadamy award for this one), who is institutionalized. This movie makes me think every time I see it, it's one of those movies that you can watch more than once, rent it and experience the world you may not know exists. Get the Special Edition DVD, if you're wanting to buy this film. The DVD only has three commentaries, one deleted scene and a featurette. Also a few trailers and photo gallery, but MGM could have done much better. For a special edition re-release it still kind of sucks. Nevertheless, you're supposed to enjoy the film. This is a masterpiece of a film, and it should NOT be missed. Rent it, buy it, experience it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry Levinson mostly resists the urge to give in to the rampant sentimentality that this story begs for, but the end result is still rather treacly and weepy.Tom Cruise plays a selfish hot head who ends up having to care for his autistic brother (Dustin Hoffman). It's a road trip movie, the kind where you just know Cruise is going to discover all sorts of goodness about himself before it's all over; meanwhile, Hoffman acts up a storm, delivering the kind of performance that wins awards left and right (which is what happened). I don't mind this movie, but something about it just feels soft and gauzy, like all of Levinson's films. It's got no TEETH.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film with a bad reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I enjoyed the film a lot. But many people especially in the autistic community believe that the movie promotes stereotypes about the autistic spectrum. And for people who do not do any research and assume too many things, yes this is indeed the case. "Rain Man" is very accurate in depicting the specific autistic savants Raymond Babbitt is based after, but this does not mean that he encompasses the traits and behaviors of all autistic people. Savant syndrome is a very rare condition (especially prodigious savants, which is what Raymond Babbitt would be classified as if he were real), so that is something to keep in mind. I thought Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of an autistic savant was simply brilliant. But make sure before watching it that you understand that it is JUST A MOVIE and not a documentary on all autistic people! The film is truly remarkable though no matter what people will tell you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very distinct and never attempted story line. In most part of the movie Dustin Hoffman lived as an autistic character, but some places he overacted. Everything was fine in the movie, but the only concern is, would Tom Cruise show the same affection, to his brother, if he was not good at numbers,instead behaved more like a regular autistic patient?Tom started liking Dustin, only after he came to know that Dustin had some extraordinary number skills, which helped him in clearing his debts. This clearly sheds the light on Tom's selfishness. Any how almost all the people in the world, try to make fortune out of others, so his demeanor doesn't surprise me.But the story, character selection and the screenplay makes it a definitely a worth watching movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not many films can portray the sentimentality and genius on display in this picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a brilliant and powerful film for certain reasons does not just have you watch it and leave you after viewing; forever rendered as a film you may recall if certain triggers occur. No, not this film; this one, like so few others, stays with you at least a few days after the viewing for all the right reasons. I would say this is similar in a broad sense that it is large and epic in its power and punch; similar to Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Forrest Gump as well as rather a few others from what I've seen in the sense it his you where you don't expect it and stays with you for a while afterwards.Rain Man, I suppose, is essentially a buddy movie that takes place on the road. Planes, Trains and Automobiles as well as the Lethal Weapon films and Midnight Run were enjoying success round about the time but where this is in no way a cop thriller or an out and out comedy, it is arguably the best of the bunch in its chosen genre; the road movie. What I like most about Rain Man is that it is sad without being too tragic; it is driven emotionally without the need for nasty deaths that may await its characters around the corner, nor does it rely on tragedies such as loosing loved ones or befalling a certain terrible event. Rain Man is pure emotion put across through brilliant acting as well as the certain situations that Charlie (Cruise) must adapt to in order to solve the problem that his brother Raymond (Hoffman) has got himself into.Rain Man is extremely simple in its set up yet deadly clinical in its execution. The upbeat 80s song playing over a really cool looking car seemingly gliding through the air as it's unloaded off a boat sets the scene perfectly for its character introduction of Charlie. We see the space he inhabits: it is a large and open warehouse which has some things inside of it but rather empty on the whole. Two colleagues; one of which is Susana (Golino) who is the girlfriend, rapidly try to keep in check with people on the phone as brand new sports cars idly wait by the side. This sums Cruise's character up perfectly: a big and active but perhaps empty in places life that is chaotic; yet he still has friends to back him up when he needs it ? the cars signify the 'coolness' Charlie possesses where as the empty space that is the rest of the warehouse perhaps signifies his lack of a real family. Raymond on the other hand inhabits a smaller and more concentrated space at the hospital; an almost childlike room that screams of innocence.But to call Raymond a child is incorrect. There is a seemingly pointless scene in the middle of the film where Raymond gets distressed over the fact he may miss a TV programme so they have to stop at a random house to find a TV. The kids in the house want to watch cartoons but Raymond isn't excited by the prospect at all; he watches his programme and the rest of the children seem bored by it suggesting Raymond has at some level, an area that isn't of an infantile nature. This in itself creates a new argument. It is apparent Raymond is autistic but through deeper knowledge, he suffers from a severe form of Asperger's Syndrome which means any break from formation or routine results in high anxiety. This is where the film challenges you to laugh. Do we find Raymond and his misadventures funny? The scene where they have to stop to watch a television doesn't advance the plot at all; it merely highlights the problem he has but is it played for laughs? Another example is the scene in which Raymond quotes the waitresses address and phone number because he can remember what he reads (last night he read the phone book: A-G). Rather than laugh out loud at this, we may chuckle if we're familiar with Asperger's Syndrome but would others laugh at the absurdity of being able to recall her exact information? Similar scenes are when Raymond counts the toothpicks; repeats the radio jingle and is interested in the sexual noises coming from Charlie's hotel room. Again, is it funny that this happens or is it just a scene highlighting the symptoms of the illness. Director and Screenwriter alike are putting across humour and information that we may laugh at, cry at or learn from: genius.But rather than be a documentary of any sort, the films would have its characters go through a journey. What's tragic is that we don't know whether or not Raymond realises he has done so. Charlie, I feel, changes from his old yuppie self and develops a nicer side. He learns what it means to have a family. He says so himself that his mother died when he was two; a father he hated and ran away from at 16 and a brother he only discovered the other day. As well as this, he realises that love interests aren't something to be toyed with since Susana leaves him when she sniffs evidence of Charlie using Raymond to get his inheritance. Charlie learns what it means to behave correctly when it comes to love and family ties and both characters share epiphanies at various points. To have the two heroes start the 'road movie' as one type of individual and have them finish it someone completely internally different is a difficult yet powerful thing to achieve but Rain Man absolutely nails it dead centre. With few real bad things to say about the film, it is no wonder I loved it so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie only "The New Yorker" could dislike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall shortly after I first saw this movie(late December,1988),coming across the review of this show in a copy of THe New Yorker MAgazine,where the reviewer dismissed this film as being "a fawning piece of kitsch". I was,naturally,rather displeased with this dismissal of the movie because,even though I understood that the New Yorker has(or had)a well-traveled rep of being a "Snob" magazine,it still seemed to give such a dismissive and short-sighted summary of a well-nuanced,humored and well-acted story.Charlie Babbit(Tom Cruise,modified from being the usual Tom) is a short-tempered car dealer whose life is built around "making the sale",and is less than thrilled to find out that,upon the death of his distant father,he's inherited a long-lost older brother. It doesn't improve things that said brother Raymond(Dustin Hoffman,in a performance as iconic as it is memorable)is an Autistic Savant,at least not at first. But as the two make a journey across country which is at least partly inspired by Charlie's discovery that Raymond's talent at counting impossibly high numbers and inscrutable attention to details and facts could be used to make him a fortune in LAs Vegas,they bond in an all to human,awkward,gentle and funny way.Director Barry Levinson was on his A-game through much of the 80s/early 90s("Tin Men","Good Morning,Vietnam","Avalon"),and his almost mater-of-fact following of this relationship is a thing of cinematic beauty. While I cannot quite call this movie perfect,I dare anyone who isn't the most cross-eyed or jaundiced about movies to see this movie as anything less than a unique story of human bonding through pathos and frailties. A keeper of a film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Rain Man' is a truly enjoyable film, both heartwarming and inspirational. Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise combine flawlessly to give two of the finest performances of the 1980s, and director Barry Levinson ? following the success of 'Good Morning, Vietnam' ? took home his only Oscar to date. 'Rain Man' was monumentally successful at the 1989 Academy Awards, nominated in eight categories and taking home statues for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Hoffman), Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Unbelievably, Tom Cruise ? despite giving one of his career-best efforts ? did not receive an acting nomination.Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a selfish young Los Angeles car dealer who is in a spot of financial trouble. After learning of the death of his estranged father, Charlie attends his funeral in Cincinnati, and is shocked to discover that his father's $3 million inheritance has been left to somebody else. Thus, Charlie comes to learn of Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman), his autistic savant older brother, of whom he had known nothing. Whilst Charlie has a photographic memory and is a prodigy with numbers, his autism means that he cannot look after himself, and, furthermore, he has no understanding of the concept of money. Eager to rob Raymond of his inheritance for his own selfish reasons, Charlie basically kidnaps him, despite the objections of his girlfriend, Susanna (Valeria Golino).'Rain Man' is one of cinema's most touching "road trip" movies. As Charlie and Raymond make their way to Los Angeles' in Charlie's newly-acquired 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible (Raymond had refused to fly with any airline other than QANTAS, having committed to memory every plane crash in history), they have their own share of frustrations, with Charlie soon developing a great level of respect for Raymond's abilities. There is also a very memorable stop-off in Las Vegas, where ? in the movie's most exhilarating scene ? Raymond wins his brother more than $80,000 by counting cards in a six-deck shoe. There are also some sentimental moments, particularly when Charlie, wanting to prepare Raymond for a "date" he thinks he is having, teaches him how to dance.Screenwriters Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow drew their inspiration for the character of Raymond from real-life savant Kim Peek, who suffered from agenesis of the corpus callosum and was not actually autistic. Hoffman plays his character to perfection, complete with the hurried speech and the quirky tilt of the head. Other Raymond Babbitt oddities, which we all come to love, include taking photographs of random objects, watching "The People's Court" at four o'clock every day and reciting Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First?" routine whenever he is nervous. Cruise, who is often over-looked, also gives a stellar performance, with Charlie tracing a full character arc, his selfish disregard for Raymond's wellbeing gradually giving way to love and understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this is one of the best Tom Cruise movies I've seen to date! And for that matter, Dustin Hoffman also! The combination of the two was great and you almost felt that these guys were really brothers. What was really cool about the movie was the fact that while watching it, you find yourself laughing half the time and then feeling sad the other half! I think Tom Cruise did a much better job with movies back in his early days because he was new and so tried harder to do more dramatic roles, i.e. Born on the 4th of July. Lately, the action film phase is just for the money I think and nothing else. I mean did anyone even watch MI:3?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was the first time that I heard of autism. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as autistic Raymond Babbitt who was kept away from his younger brother, Charlie, played brilliantly by Tom Cruise. The film is about the brothers who travel to Los Angeles from Ohio and how they bond over the journey despite Raymond's complete need for structure including a schedule including People's Court, The Price is Right, and his genius for numbers which gives his younger brother a better idea. I don't know much about autism so I'm not going to criticize Hoffman's portrayal which has been joked around a bit much like the repetition of his speech. The film won Best Picture at the Academy Awards along with director Barry Levinson and Dustin Hoffman for his second Best Actor Oscar. I still think the film's superior but I'm not crazy about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the Best Film of 1988</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RAIN MAN is the riveting and emotionally-charged drama about family and brotherhood that evoked laughs, tears, and Oscars. This was the story of Charlie Babbit(Tom Cruise), a self-absorbed and cocky man with his own private auto business whose business is in financial difficulties. Charlies experiences mixed emotions when he learns his wealthy father has just passed away and travels across country for his funeral and the reading of the will, but is disgusted when he learns that his father's 3 million dollar estate has been put in a trust. Investigating the trust, Charlie is shocked to learn about a brother named Raymond (Dustin Hoffman)who he never even knew existed, who is autistic and institutionalized. Thinking it's his only way to get his share of the money, Charlie sneaks Raymond out of the institution launching an emotional and intense journey where Charlie gets to know and eventually bond with his brother. Barry Levinson's masterful and meticulous direction won him the Oscar for Best Director. Dustin Hoffman won his 2nd Best Actor performance for his haunting performance as the autistic Raymond...Hoffman is nothing short of amazing here as he completely loses himself in this role. Tom Cruise gives one of his most razor sharp performances as the self-absorbed Charlie...Cruise was supposed to be submitted for a supporting Oscar but felt his role was a leading role and refused to be submitted in the supporting category. I think if he had been nominated in the supporting category he would have won...it was his finest work to date (his only performance better than this one was in MAGNOLIA). Watching the slow development of the relationship between these two brothers is an emotional and rewarding experience and trust me, tears will be shed along the way. The richly deserved Oscar-winning Best Picture of 1988../an instant classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Self-centered yuppie Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) goes to his rich father's funeral. He hasn't seen or spoken to him in many years. He finds out he isn't getting a cent from his dad--it's all going into a trust to his other son--Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman). Raymond is also an autistic savant and in an institution. Charlie "kidnaps" him to get his share of the money. But it turns into a journey of self-discovery.The story is pretty simple--it's been done hundreds of times before. I knew exactly where this was going and how it was going to end...BUT that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's well-directed by Barry Levinson with a well-written (if predictable) script. Also Tom Cruise was actually very good--I usually hate the guy but I admit he did good in his role. But Hoffman is the whole movie. From what I heard he played the role exactly as it should be done (he spent months with autistic patients and families of them). He stutters and sprouts facts off non-stop. Hoffman is clearly enjoying himself. Valeria Golino is around as Cruise's girlfriend. She's given little to do unfortunately. Also this movie does not need to go on past two hours.Still this is a GOOD little film. I can understand the Academy Awards for director and star (Hoffman)...but it did not deserve best screenplay or picture. Still a lot of people love this. It's good but not great. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RAIN MAN ****1/2 The Academy Award winner for 1988's Best Picture is a characterized story of a man who goes on an enlightening journey in realizing the finer things in life, like brotherly virtue. Tom Cruise handles himself admirably as a self-centered car salesman who, upon being told of his father's death, discovers that he has an autistic brother (played to perfection by Oscar-winner Dustin Hoffman), who is receiving Dad's inheritance. Cruise takes Hoffman out of the institution and travels back home, hoping to get his "fair share" of the inheritance. Director Barry Levinson keeps a firm hold on the material as we see the brothers' relationship fortify through a variety of situations and Cruise turning from his self-absorbed ways and becoming soft-spoken and considerate. This film is poignantly dramatic, original, and convicting - the achievements that mark great cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brotherly love at its best; Levinson's final grace note, Cruise and Hoffman are the dynamic duo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Valeria Golino,Jack Murdock, Ralph Seymour. Directed by Barry Levinson. Levinson was one of my favorite directors until he decided for reason un-known to me to do "Envy", thus ruining his career. Aside from 1996's "Sleepers" which wasn't half bad his directing talents have slowly decreased substantially each year. Coming home for his father's funeral Charlie Babbit (Cruise) enraged to see that a large sum of money was not left for him but to the brother he never knew he had. Autistic but gentle Raymond (Hoffman) was left with the money and Charlie takes him on an adventure to try and get the money. This is Levinson's final grace to cinema, I sincerely hope he comes back to make better films aside from "Envy". "Rain man" is smart, gentle, and one of the best films ever made; my final rating 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable portrait of an autistic brother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful touching film and one that gives the average viewer with little first hand experience a touch of insight into autism.The plot revolves around the two Babbitt brothers, Raymond and Charlie. After the death of their father, the handsome, materialistic, self absorbed Charlie (Tom Cruise) learns that he has a long lost older brother named Raymond, who's autistic and also the sole beneficiary of his father's fortune. Charlie kidnaps his brother from the mental institution where he is resident, and the pair set out on a cross country journey. Charlie starts out trying to manipulate some of the inheritance out of his brother. Raymond is an idiot savant with an incredible ability to do mathematical problems in his head. So Charlie decides to take advantage of his brother's remarkable talent by taking him to Los Vegas so he can count cards. Gradually, he starts getting rather attached to his endearing (but sometimes quite difficult to deal with) savant brother. As time passes, an unusual relationship and close bond develops between the successful and mentally handicapped brothers, as Charlie realizes that he is indeed "his brother's keeper". One brother (Charlie) changes during the film, while the other (Raymond) remains pretty constant. Tom Cruise is memorable as the brother learning to love and care for his brother, coping with the challenges of autism. Dustin Hoffman is of course absolutely brilliant as Raymond, the role for which he won a much deserved Oscar. He is an extremely endearing character, with a particular fondness for Judge Wapner of The People's Court, which he watches every afternoon religiously, without fail. Wait until you see Raymond taking dancing lessons. By the movie's end, every viewer has learned to love Raymond; he's everyone's brother.Very touching ending which I won't give away. An incredible film, an education in autism, and a legendary savant (who seems real, not fictional) living on in our hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin Hoffman's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman, you are a genius. I am in a position to give the ultimate compliment to him, as my brother is autistic, and the amount of autistic men or women, boys or girls i see is substantial enough to say that when i can't tell the difference between him and them, it means something. Every time i watch him in a different film i always think of him as 'Raymond', even in political drama's such as 'all the presidents men'. I hear that he studied an autistic person for about a year before and during the filming of rain man, and i feel it really paid off. Hoffman's performance alone is worth buying the DVD of this movie. other than that, the on screen chemistry and (plutonic) love he shares with Tom Cruise (his brother) is magnificent, and it's a tremendous story of a love between two brothers that is formed against all odds. Probably the most satisfying thing about this film is that it doesn't lose it's integrity at the end, like other feel good movies, where endings are just thrown in to make everybody happy. This is a real ending, with a real solution to the conflict, and it is congruent with the flow of the entire movie.Must see flick, 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rain Man" Autism Speaks Out ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman, in a truly brilliant performance, as an autistic person, shut out of family life by his father. We must remember that Hoffman was classified as high functional. It would have been nearly impossible to make this film if that type of function were not there.It is only with the death of his father that the normal son, Tom Cruise, learns of the brother he never knew.Hoffman is totally believable as the victim of autism. We see and feel his very struggle.Cruise seems to be another hot-shot performance who is deeply affected and toned down when he meets his brother. The hot-shot tones down as he learns more about life itself when he begins to interact with his handicapped brother. Cruise also gave a phenomenal performance and should have also been Oscar nominated. Didn't anyone see any resemblance in the fine performance that Hoffman gave with his 1967 break-through performance in "The Graduate?" In both films Hoffman displayed a rare vulnerability. In both films he struggled to come out of a life of being withdrawn.We view the autistic as not the hopeless or seemingly retarded, which society has viewed them.A film of the heart, richly brought out by the superior acting of Oscar winner Hoffman. A remarkable journey of a young man who wants to cope in a world that has shut him out.</fullReview>

However Tom Criuse seems to play the same person in every movie, just different names. However in this movie he changed my mind and yes people he actually can act.

		<shortDescription>Men don't cry watching films.. or do they?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember loving this movie when it was released. It was funny, well paced and touching. The gentle emotional bond of Charlie to Raymond is a fusion of tension and comedy. I've never been a Tom Cruise fan, and past this film, I'm still not one. Nevertheless, his talent is truly on show here. His role as Charlie is a difficult one; he has to lead a film along side an actor who is playing a very complex and captivating character. On top of that, he has to flesh out a man who could on the surface, be played very two dimensionally. Cruise succeeds in making Charlie's growth through the film as fascinating as watching Raymond.I think what motivated this comment was how evocative this film is. I started to watch this film again (borrowed from the family) as background noise as I finished some artwork. Within thirty minutes, I was away from the drawing board and spellbound. I don't usually laugh out loud, and I certainly rarely feel like crying because of a film, but the chemistry is so poignant and yet so fluid, you can't help swing back and forth through the emotional spectrum.I doubt I've added anything new to all the other comments here. I'm glad to have watched this film. I'm glad it was made, it's been a great experience for me and a great spotlight for autism awareness.Go see it. Have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Yuppie And The Savant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The name of Babbitt has an old but not terribly honored name in American literature. George Babbitt was the creation of Sinclair Lewis as the the self seeking, hard striving archetypal middle class American whose interest is making money above all. If George Babbitt had a grandson he'd be Charlie Babbitt late of Cincinnati, Ohio.As played by Tom Cruise he's a worthy successor to his grandpa. George Babbitt if he were around today would be proud of Charlie. He's a child of the Eighties, looking for paper profits in fast deals. But he's got a cash flow problem. He's on the hook for a pair of expensive Italian Lamberghini sports cars and his customers want either the cars, their money back, or his head.In the midst of these problems comes word that is father who he'd been estranged from for years has died. Back from Los Angeles to Cincinnati goes Tom in the hopes a timely legacy will save his butt. What a shock to find that his father's millions went in trust to an unnamed benefactor and all he got was a used car and rose bushes. But that's not all.The unnamed beneficiary for whom the money is held in trust is Tom's older brother, older by about 15 years who's been institutionalized. He's an autistic, idiot savant, played by Dustin Hoffman. What to do, but break him out of that institution and gain custody of him and his millions.Rain Man's success hinges on the performance of Dustin Hoffman as Raymond (Rain Man) Babbitt and it's the best piece of work Dustin Hoffman ever did on screen. We're told that for someone in his condition, he's pretty far advanced. He can count 246 matches falling out of a matchbox that contains 250 and 4 were left inside. He's memorized Abbott&amp;Costello's Who's On First without any idea of what it means. He sees and memorizes, but can't reason or articulate.But Dustin Hoffman did more with those monotone answers and his own facial expressions in interpreting the role than I think most actors would be capable of. It's a world so different for Hoffman than it is for Cruise and for any of us reading my review. Raymond Babbitt would memorize the words I write and not be capable of knowing their meaning.The film is about the growing relationship of the two brothers, one of whom the other didn't know existed. Hoffman does know about Cruise and there was a reason he was kept apart from him, not a good one to keep him unaware of his existence, but a reason. It's something I won't tell you'll have to see the film to find out.Tom Cruise also does a wonderful job in exploring all the dimensions of Charlie Babbitt. Normally I find it a weakness in a film that secondary characters aren't developed. But in the case of Rain Man it really is all about these two brothers. Rain Man got four Oscars, four big ones, Best Picture, Best Actor for Dustin Hoffman, Best Director for Barry Levinson, and Best Original Screenplay and Story for Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass. All richly deserved.Best scenes in the film when Cruise decides to make use of Hoffman's talents by stopping off in Las Vegas. That has to be seen.You will be moved mightily with one viewing of Rain Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, moving and surprisingly unsentimental little film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favourites this movie, Rain Man is moving, funny, sad, uplifting and ultimately a little dowh beat, but contains two terrific central performances from two Hollywood legends and terrific direction from one of mainstream Hollywood's finest filmmakers, who makes all the right choices, which of course means not making the obvious ones. What surprises one straight away about Rain Man is how funny the film can be, without any of the bad taste theatrics of, say, a Farrelly brothers movie, who have frequently used various forms of mental illness or autism as the butt of many of their jokes in their movies. Here we have a film about autism that is very funny, but knows that it is dealing with a serious condition, thus making the jokes not so much about the condition, but about one man having to deal with it, in this case Charlie Babbit, played superbly by Tom Cruise in what is arguably one of his best performances, up there with Jerry Maguire and Magnolia. This isn't a film that pokes fun at Raymond's condition and thus makes him into a superb character, one that we care about, even though in many ways he is incapable of showing emotion back to the person who comes to care for him the most, even though we desperately want him to.Enough cannot be said of Dustin Hoffman. One of Hollywood's finest, here he is at his utmost best, sparring off Cruise superbly in some of the finest scenes in a mainstream film from 80's Hollywood (the K-Mart sequence is a particular highlight), he is engaging, even though he is always reserved and never makes eye contact with anyone, he is also funny, yet sad, but never over-eggs one or the other aspect in his performance.What surprises one about Rain Man is how restrained it is for a Hollywood film. The biggest aspect of the film to symbolize this is its music score from Hans Zimmer, composing his first American film. Instead of relying on strings and pianos like many other composers would do, Zimmer relies more on percussion and an almost African-Carribbean style main theme that sums up the film perfectly. The music never overshadows the film, it is more restrained and cleverer than that and almost sums up what you can say about the film. Nothing ever goes over the top or into theatrics, everything is kept as realistic as possible, from the performances, to the way it is filmed by Levinson, right through to the writing and the film's ending which doesn't go for the conventional manner of trying to have the audience reaching for the tissues, but neither does it go for some emotional catharsis that you would expect either. Of course there is one little moment ("You're my main man"), but it works anyway and strangely keeps in line with what the film is doing.Clever, brave and superbly done, Rain Man is one film that I demand that everyone should see.</fullReview>

Tom Cruise plays his usual handsome yuppie role with a new meaning and focus that are lacking in some of his other films. The story of their meeting and discovery of each other is fantastic and fascinating. The farm children who watch "People's Court" with Hoffman are well-cast and bring youthful interest and meaning to the plot. This movie is truly beautiful, but also sad and has a powerful message behind it. The mentally handicapped are not to be hidden or stuck in a room, they're to be treated as human beings and can learn for themselves. It is a film that I highly recommend for all people who aren't yet acquainted with retarded or handicapped people, and also for those who have been.

		<shortDescription>Flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the rare films in cinema history which can boast having absolutely no flaws. Even films like The Godfather, Gone With the Wind and Citizen Kane had flaws if you look closely. Rain Man's simple narrative structure and story may create doubt and manipulate you but after multiple viewings it will become part of you. Part of your personality.Dustin Hoffman delivers an extraordinary Academy Award-winning performance as Raymond Babbit, an idiot savant who has just inherited his father's money, to the dismay of brother Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise in a very underrated performance). Charlie, frustrated at this, decides to take advantage of his brother's handicap and take him on a road trip to manipulate him into getting some of money. On that long journey, Charlie becomes increasingly fond of his new-found brother, especially after learning that Raymond used to take care of him when they were kids.The story sounds very derivative, I know, but what makes it so unique is the realistic turns the movie takes. First of all Charlie's major character change takes place over a long period of time deliberately so you won't take notice until at the very end. The idiot savant character of Raymond is portrayed in the movie very well and honestly. Idiot savants are incapable of emotional thoughts and the film stays true to that theory by having very little character change for Raymond throughout the movie.Director Barry Levinson (who has a crucial cameo in the movie) did such a fantastic job in this film. There were so many directing changes in the production of this film it is very surprising Levinson pulled it off. His direction is a very subtle, subliminal direction which from a distance looks very ordinary and traditional but when thought over becomes an intellectually stimulating style (similar to Sidney Lumet and Francis Ford Coppola in their prime). The way he slowly changes Charlie's character while making us more sympathetic with Raymond is simply masterful. He puts us in the journey into Charlie's point of view. We first see Raymond as a pathetic, poor individual but at the end of the film we look at him as our brother. Most people would say this film has no theme or message, but they just haven't looked deeply enough. The theme is that the more we learn about someone we begin to gain respect for him and eventually love him. The unchanging character of Raymond embodies this message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman brilliant, but film VERY overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman is especially good, but overall the movie is just a muddle. Tom Cruise is particularly obnoxious and dense as the younger brother. Long after the audience has caught on to the special talents of Raymond (Hoffman), Charlie (Cruise) is only starting to get the picture. But just in case anyone in the audience still doesn't get it, Charlie declares the obvious about 3/4 of the through the movie, (paraphrasing) "Hey, he's really good at remembering stuff and doing math in his head."Throw in imported sports cars (Charlie's business), a French girlfriend, a cross-country road trip in a vintage Buick Roadmaster, a stop in Las Vegas, and a brief low-key custody battle, and overall you end up with a confused montage of "high concept" ideas.Hoffman is the only reason to see this otherwise lame film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very linear and you could see where it was going right from the start. The characters are very stereo-typed and not deep at all, and maybe it might be that this movie came out only a few years after my birth, but this was flat-out boring. Nothing really grasps your attention, you know that Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) is "magical" and that Charlie (Tom Cruise) underappreciates that. Charlie's impatient butthole personality gets really old and annoying right from the beginning, and it continues on for hours. This whole movie felt like a waste of my time, the only thing worth watching was Dustin Hoffman's acting. But honestly, retard movies just really bug me (The Other Sister was, to me, unbearably annoying). If you wanted to see it because you heard it's a classic (like me) don't waste your time. Trust me. This movie is as dry as they come, you can't juice anything out of this fruit. I give it a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching a movie from the 80s again now after 25 years is a weird experience. But the content is still up to date and the fact that this movie is from another period of time only reflects in terms of music and style. The general topic, the main characters (Tom Cruise is still someone) and even aspects of communication and media as well as mobility are still up to dare and interesting. This road movie brings two brothers together despite the odds and makes a cool and calculating man turn into a sensible human being ready to fight for his family. The acting is done in a convincing way, especially by Oscar winning Dustin Hoffman. With Tom Cruise you never know if he only acts being the superficial hot tempered guy always looking for his own advantage or this is just himself. The atmosphere created is at times paralyzing and embarrassing but also funny in a relieving, natural way considering the problem dealt with. It is certainly authentic and helps for a better understanding of both autistic people and the people dealing with them day by day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was exceptional in its development of the two main characters Charlie and Raymond. The interactions between the brothers on the road was humorous and revealing. Charlie starts out as a protagonist that is not very liked. He comes off as very selfish and arrogant at the beginning, but as the film progresses his heart seems to soften as he finds out more about his brother, his father,and himself. Dustin Hoffman was fantastic as Raymond. He was very believable in his portrayal of an autistic savant. One aspect that made the movie enjoyable was the demonstrations of Raymond's genius throughout the movie.However the end of the movie bothers me quite a bit. There are so many questions that remain unanswered. This could be argued that you can make your own assumptions about the future, but I would have liked some clarity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man is Dustin Hoffman humping one note on a piano for two hours and eleven minute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain Man is clearly a product of the late '80s, as evidenced by the uncommonly distracting score by Hans Zimmer and the sun-bleached look of the movie. Though the themes and performances remain intact some 15 years later, there's no denying the fact that director Barry Levinson was perhaps a little too influenced by what was hot at the time. But unlike some other movies from that decade that don't quite hold up (ie To Live and Die in L.A.), Rain Man remains a compelling film - anchored by two fabulous lead performances.Less plot-driven than one might expect, Rain Man is mostly a series of vignettes as Charlie and Raymond hit the road (Raymond refuses to fly, since every major airline has had at least one crash - except Qantas, which only flies out of Australia). This leads to sequences that most audiences will be familiar with, even if they've not seen the movie (ie the moment in which Raymond instantly recalls the number of a waitress after reading half the phone book the night before). But really, Charlie and Raymond's misadventures are secondary; it's the development of Charlie as a character that really keeps us involved.Though it initially seems as though Charlie's going to the sort of cocky and self-assured type that Cruise excels at, there's more going on here than just the standard grin-and-smirk performance that dominated much of Cruise's early work. Charlie's clichd journey from selfish cad to considerate gentleman is made all-the-more convincing thanks to Cruise's surprisingly effective work. And then, of course, there's Hoffman. The veteran actor never breaks concentration for a second, and turns Raymond into a figure that's absolutely convincing. It's the ticks and mannerisms that Kael objected to that allow Raymond to become a fully fleshed-out character; though we're not given a lot of back story on him, it's simple enough to glean info about his past through various little things he does throughout the movie.Though the film perhaps wasn't entirely deserving of the Best Picture Oscar, there's no denying that Rain Man is a superbly acted drama. Cruise and Hoffman create characters that are so intriguing that the predictability of the story and late '80s directorial flourishes are easily overlooked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Autism runs in many families and is a delicate and misunderstood subject and yet Tom Cruise plays the insensitive A-hole brother like he didn't need acting lessons. While educated through entertainment, we ween't being insulted but engaged only because Dustin Hoffman's portrayal was so believable and comedic at the same time. I left it here as recommended against my better judgment as the exposure outweighs any plausible insult. Raymond blurts out, "Three minutes to Wapner", and we all laugh, but how different is that habit from folks out there who behave in the same way and are not mentally handicapped? (Don't make me late for my hockey game!) The foul language used throughout by the older brother almost simplifies the frustration that caretakers of autistic family members must experience. I'd have preferred more of a selfish less epiphany by the movies' end. Another knock is the music soundtrack hardly matches the movie experience, yet it remains a must see as Dustin Hoffman deserves all of the accolades for making Autism an attainable story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the end it's all about Hoffman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that this movie has earned such a stature over the years. I believe that the main-if not only- reason behind this is Hoffman's amazing work in playing the autistic brother of Tom Cruise, who was just over the top and not believable in the majority of the scenes. My biggest objection is the script. All in all we are said that Raymond is a non functioning autistic and that his brother doesn't even care about except the money that he inherited. And to follow that opening it shows us that his brother saw him differently when Raymond earned him all that money in Vegas. That's where the movie goes bad. When I saw the scene where Raymond drives the car out of the casino and the way that the shots were edited I could not help but wonder what would happen between the two brothers if Raymond was not good with numbers. In fact that is his only way of reaching his younger brother. Not that he cares about it, because I believe that Hoffman really meant to do a performance based on self seclusion. But nevertheless it tries to sell us capitalism and the theory that is all about the money in a very vulgar way.Not to mention all the American pop culture that is shown to us through out the film in a way that is very similar to propaganda. Because if you see the things that Raymond wants to see on TV, or eat in the film is like seeing any typical American guy, and again I get the feeling that this passes off as a good way of life. That is concerning the script because Hoffman goes in there and takes his role away from all that. He just makes all this way of life a routine that he is not capable to break. And that turns all the other exibitions of the American dream around. We know that he also made a lot of changes in some ideas of the script, he even changed the condition that Raymond had including his way of dealing with the world which was meant to be cheerful. He took what was gonna be a huge pile of junk and made a movie that is worth watching but definitely not a masterpiece, or even close to one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While Dustin Hoffman's performance is admirable, it's not enough to save "Rain Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings towards Barry Levinson's 1988 Oscar-winning drama "Rain Man". On one hand, since I am autistic, I did respect Dustin Hoffman's performance as the main character. His work gave me a better appreciation of how far I've come with my autism and how much I've been able to succeed at in life. On the other hand, there are certain things about "Rain Man" that I found tedious and not very pleasant to sit through. "Rain Man" is a typical road trip movie which follows a young, selfish car salesman (Tom Cruise) from Los Angeles who learns that his father just passed away and goes to Cincinnati to inherit his fortune. When there, he finds out that all he inherited was his Buick convertible and that $3 million is going to his autistic brother (Dustin Hoffman) who he didn't know he had. So he takes him on a road trip back to Los Angeles in hopes of making an arrangement with his attorneys to inherit some of his money. Along the way, he learns that his brother, despite his social difficulties, has a great memory and some extraordinary math skills. Like I stated before, Dustin Hoffman did a good job at portraying an autistic person who doesn't warm up to any last minute changes and must have strict routines. However, the character Tom Cruise played was so cold-hearted and mean-spirited that it become difficult to feel any sympathy towards him. Furthermore, it also became difficult to buy that he experienced any sort of change at the end of the film. Maybe it was intentional, maybe it wasn't. Either way, they succeeded all too well at making him completely unsympathetic. The main narrative isn't only predictable, but it's also for the most part a mean-spirited one. The reason for that again is because of the Tom Cruise character. This guy has some nerve to interfere with a dead man's will just to please only himself with little to no regard for his brother. If that weren't enough, he takes advantage of his brother's math intelligence by using him as a tool for winning thousands of dollars at the casinos. No kidding! Because the salesman's brother is autistic, he has some unusual behavior issues such as repeating what he said over and over again which can get old for the viewer pretty fast. Between the salesman being so unpleasant to everyone around him and his brother's repetitious tendencies, "Rain Man" became simply unbearable to sit through. It didn't help that the film ran out of gas after the two main characters hit the casinos. I respect the attempt at telling a story involving autistic people since everyone who has this symptom deserves to be heard from a mass audience. Unfortunately, this wasn't the right story to tell especially considering how it was mainly another average road trip movie. Somewhere, there's a good movie to be made out there about people with autism. "Rain Man" just wasn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 21 years, "Rain Man" floats into mediocrity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This discussion needs to begin with the idea that whatever critique comes of this film; it is not in direct correlation to those that suffer from autism. The words written herein are only used to discuss the film "Rain Man", not to have a lengthy discussion on my thoughts with this serious condition. With that said, I recently had the opportunity to sit down and watch "Rain Man" commercial-free, and unedited by TV ? viewing it the way audiences may have seen it in theaters ? and I wondered ? is "Rain Man" that wonderful of a film, or we just all taken-aback by the intense performance by Dustin Hoffman? This is a tough question as I was somewhat bored with the story that Morrow and Base put together, yet each scene that Hoffman was in I was glued to the screen watching his idiosyncrasies, his apt ability to make this character out of merely studied influences. Hoffman deserved the Oscar for this film, but again, looking back ? was it deserving of everything else that it won? "Rain Man" recycles this age old story that Hollywood is familiar with, a dying family member leaves a will to another, unknown, family member that eventually becomes the savior of the film. The groundlings to this story are not anything new to direct-to-video markets, but with Hoffman and Cruise headlining, there is more of a mass appeal. What pulls this film up is, as already stated, Hoffman ? continuing to prove his worth ? but yet slips downward yet again with Cruise. He seems to be a bit of a loose cannon in this role. For the first moment that we see him, he is this fast-talking, smooth sailing entrepreneur that seems to be going through this financial crisis. Randomly he is able to leave, drive from California to Florida and finally making a pit stop in Ohio for his father's funeral. Upon arriving he becomes bitter and more sinister as he learns that he is not inheriting his father's wealth, but instead has a brother that will have it all. As we discover whom this is ? our film changes from this family plight to this road movie ? going all over our great nation to demonstrate brotherly love. Yet ? from the moment this voyage begins, we see less and less of the Cruise's initial character and we are welcomed into the third stage of Cruise, caring man who is just trying to survive.Where "Rain Man" gets itself into trouble is that Hoffman is so good, we are unable to fully develop Cruise's character. We are glued to Hoffman on the screen, and thus Cruise can get away with anything (slipping in and out of character within scenes) because are eyes are focused on one man, and one man only. Cruise does give a performance in this film, but it seems stale and disjointed. His emotion never seems to come out, especially with the very dark ending ? leaving us with no hope for the future? The bleakest of endings, I was left wondering how much this would have worked if we were to focus on Cruise's character throughout, only giving us glimpses of Hoffman throughout the film. I would have liked to see his inner turmoil, his struggle without the glossiness that was handed to us. As a man with no money, he was easily able to maneuver anything that his brother wanted? The suits for Vegas were not free. Yet, we seem to let this slide off our backs when we talk about this film because we are all in awe of Hoffman, which we have every right to be. Personally, Hoffman deserves all the kudos for his role, but watch Cruise carefully; I believe he gives one of the worst performances of his career.Then there is Barry Levinson. There is so much that I like about him as a director and there are moments in this film that he pulls your heartstrings hard ? and with the greatest of ease. He never gave us a false impression of autism ? there are these moments where we believe Hoffman will say something that doesn't fit, there are plenty of music-leading moments, but instead he pulls the rug and gives us honesty and truth. I appreciated that and adored Levinson's choice of cinematography, but the ending needed work. Once we were out of the car, we were rushed to a conclusion. The less-tender moments at the end didn't congeal well, leaving us with false hope and darkness. This isn't a happy film, and I just don't think Levinson had a way to wrap it up. The train scene was disappointing and disastrous to say the least.Overall, I think I am going to answer my own question. "Rain Man" doesn't seem to last the test of time. Hoffman's performance kept the over two hours worth the viewing, but I don't think I could watch this again. "Rain Man" is a mediocre film fueled by one great performance. There isn't any meat to the overall story, and at times it just seem to flop around on the floor waiting for something to put it back into the vastness of cinema. "Rain Man" did sweep the Oscars that year, giving everyone that feeling of joy ? but nearly 21 years later, it just doesn't remain a memorable film.Grade: *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rain Man" proved to be a fairly enjoyable and touching film. It shows how a selfish man (Tom Cruise) changes after meeting and spending several days with his autistic brother (Dustin Hoffman, in an Oscar-winning role) whom he never knew existed. The film could be described as a comedy-drama, though it is far more on the drama side. There are plenty of little funny moments (particularly from Tom Cruise's somewhat funny lines and "hurry up" type of attitude) that keep the film entertaining. The plot is a little too predictable and some parts of the film (Dustin Hoffman freaking out uncontrollably) are somewhat difficult to watch. The Best Picture of 1988? Not for me ("Die Hard" is my favorite). While the film is not a personal favorite of mine, it does have its moments. It also has one of the best original film scores I have ever heard, with a sort of haunting feel to it. Worthwhile, but far from perfect.*** out of ****</fullReview>

Rain Man is about two brothers, and their new, forming relationship, learning to live with and love each other, and making that understanding that only brothers have.Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt is without doubt one of the finest performances I have ever seen from Hollywood in the last two decades. The standard I think he set with Rain Man is one that is difficult to beat - he was extremely impressive as an autistic man. The way he walked, talked, even his eye movement and facial expressions, were all perfect. I was bowled over by his talent, and found him to be extremely believable as Raymond. Now, I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but I have to admit he was very, very good in his role of the thoughtless, cynical, and arrogant Charlie Babbitt. This was probably the best he's ever done in his acting career. In addition to two wonderful performances, Cruise and Hoffman's connection on screen was fantastic, resulting in truly emotional, moving, and many times humorous, occasions. They had me floored.I found Rain Man to have amazing cinematography. The entire casino sequence, I thought, was filmed beautifully. And a commendable mention must go to the elevator scene, with Raymond and Susanna. I found that scene to be truly heartbreaking, but at the same time sweet. The ending is one of those moments that cannot be explained; a unique closure that is truly soul-stirring and touching. Overrall, this is a poignant, powerful view of the human spirit.Rain Man is a rare gem, and one which cannot be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking in the Rain Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting movie. Self centered, high energy Charlie (Tom Cruise) takes his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), whom he has'nt been around for over 2 decades, and who has been locked up in a mental hospital. . . from the east coast to LA in his car. They must go by automobile because Raymond's autism affects him so that he cannot fly without overwhelming extreme terror. Raymond must be molly coddled and indulged to keep his disorder from destroying him along the way. A road adventure ensues. Charlie's motivation for the trip is money. He wants to get a piece of an inheritance from his father that is earmarked for Raymond whom he has'nt even seen since they were kids.OK. I liked the concept of it. Brotherly bonding and an interesting adventure. It is warm hearted, and therefor easy to like. But the implausibility of some of the scenes just blows me away. Are movie-goers actually willing to buy that a person can just automatically get rich gambling in a casino because a certain math skill (by Raymond, who is a savant) can give you, at best, a 1-2% edge? And there were other implausibilities as well. The age difference for one. Hoffman is clearly much much older than Cruise. And the manic need by Raymond (Dustin Hoffman's character) to watch certain television shows causes Charlie, in one scene, to pull up to a farm house so that Raymond can watch television. I never could convince myself that anybody would go for that, despite Charlie's affability. Otherwise, Barry Levinson does a good job directing this picture. The cinematography is quite excellent, and the sound and camera work is superb throughout the picture. Tom Cruise is OUTSTANDING in this picture. In my book it is his best performance in any movie I have seen him in. He plays snot-nose to perfection; slowly dissolved into brotherly and loving. His performance is the highlight of the film. Dustin Hoffman is less convincing to me as the autistic savant, though, to his credit he was fairly consistent throughout the picture, except when they got to Vegas he seemed to stretch out a bit and lost some credibility (for me). Overall, I liked the movie for it's warmth, despite the plausibility strains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best Picture for 1988, "Rainman" tells the story of a young man who abducts a brother he never knew he had because his father never left him what he considered to be his share of a three million dollar inheritance. Thus begins a touching cross country journey of discovery as the two brothers learn about each other.Director Barry Levinson ( who was awarded the Best Director Oscar) involves us deeply in the tale, and thanks to him we really become a part of the Babbitt's adventure, always helped by Hoffman's warm portrayal of Ray's peculiar, ritualistic and fascinating world, and Tom Cruise equally effective display as the greedy and selfish Charlie."Rainman" really saw Mr. Cruise come of age in a strong performance as the self-serving business man who goes through a personal metamorphosis when he spends a week with his newly found, mentally 'high-functioning' older brother. Dustin Hoffman displays his consummate professionalism and easily steals the show in a beautifully weighted performance as autistic savant Raymond Babbitt. This wonderful turn from one of Hollywood's greatest talents earned him a second Best Actor Oscar in what was a most convincing outing. Most admirable in support are Valeria Golino as Charlie's long suffering girlfriend Suzannah who is desperately trying to become a part of his world and not just an accessory, and Jerry Molen, as the trustee of Ray's new estate and the doctor who has only his patient's welfare in mind.John Seale's camera presents us with some memorable images of America's mid west, editor Stu Linder keeps proceedings always moving toward a passionate climax and Hans Zimmer provides a truly moving and striking score.Levinson pulls everything together superbly in a movie about personal values and priorities, human sacrifice and the discovery of feelings. In the beginning Ray, with his inability to understand or display emotion, is as much capable of showing them as the shallow Charlie. Yet ironically it is the "Rainman" who helps his little brother get in touch with his inner self, and ultimately unearth the ability to care and love.Our director lends the drama, from the pen of Barry Morrow, superb surety and genuine, heartfelt poignancy, never letting it become over burdened with emotional baggage. A sense of humour pervades, mostly through Ray's idiosyncrasies, that is both wonderfully funny and surprisingly moving.Friday, May 19, 1995 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i first saw this movie in high school,and recall feeling indifferent towards it.flash forward several years,and what a difference.this time around,i really liked it.for one,i paid more attention to it.i also liked it because Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of an autistic person was bang on. the reason i say this is because i work with an autistic individual.Hoffman must have done a lot of research for the role.either that,or he's a complete and utter genius.Tom Cruise is also good as the man who find out he has an autistic brother.Cruise's character(Charlie Babbit)goes from being an ego-centric materialistic and shallow human being,to someone who actually has compassion and doesn't just think of himself.Cruise makes the transformation very credible.i bought every minute of it.the story is fairly original,as far as i know,even today.there are also bits of lite humour sprinkled throughout,which don't detract from the quality of the film at all.for me,rain man is an 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man is a really good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that i think that this film was a crap......i think, well Tom Cruise isn't a good actor and i wasn't a fan of Dustin Hoffman but i consider Hoffman as an important actor. The director, well i never watch any other film of him. That's why i never wanted to see or to buy the DVD for my collection of this film. Finally one day i was on a DVD store and i saw a double pack DVD: yes two films for the prize of one. The films was Blue Velvet and Rain Man. I think that Blue Velvet is the best of David Lynch and i love it....but i don't have the DVD so i buy it. Finally i saw Rain Man just because i have it now but well i just LOVE IT.Dustin Hoffman do his best performance ever in a very charismatic role. He plays the Rain Man or Raymond, who is very intelligent person but has this problem of the autism. And Tom Crusie prove that he can be a good actor too (not as good as Hoffman) and plays Chalie Babbit, the younger brother of Raymond.The story is simple: Charlie never know about his brother until his father die and all the inheritance goes to Raymond, so he thinks that he can took away the money from his brother.Well i have to say that i was very wrong about thinking that Rain Man wasn't a good movie and the only negative aspect of the film is the MUSIC. Yes the music is just crap but well I still put 10/10Recomendations: another similar films of Rain Man and also films that i love are: Paris, Texas, Sideways, About Schmidt, Broken Flowers and Buffalo 66 Please watch this films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Tom Cruise's and Dustin Hoffman's best films to date and also became an instant favorite of mine. What doesn't make me happy is that it isn't going down as one of the classic movies of all time and I feel it should be getting more recognition for what a great film it was. If you like 'The Natural', you'll love this movie, seeing as they were/are both directed by Barry Levinson also did a great job directing this masterpiece and I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to see more of his works.'The Natural' is also one of my favorite films of all time, but Rain Man is good, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman is an extraordinary actor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This outstanding film was highlighted by Dustin Hoffman's superb performance. I taught high school for 22 years with 10 of them teaching mentally retarded students, many of whom were autistic.Having worked with these disabled people I can say that categorically without exception Hoffman's performance is the best I have ever seen regarding a portrayal of a mentally retarded person. His lack of emotion and repetitiveness in his mannerisms, speech and emotions were highly accurate. (A few reviewers criticized him for lacking emotion, but this is exactly how mentally retarded autistic individuals behave.) Incidentally, 75% of people with autism are also mentally retarded.Hoffman's Raymond was not high functioning as the film doctor said. (Another astute reviewer mentioned this also.) He was mentally retarded with a small portion of his brain having savant ability for mathematics.Hoffman's character had substandard intellectual and cognitive skills (couldn't perform simple math questions) and poor adaptive behavior (his interaction with the prostitute and his inability to discuss subjects intelligently or even simplistically). These are the 2 criteria for mental retardation along with the disability occurring before the age of 3.My only complaint with this otherwise outstanding film was the scene where Hoffman and Cruise stopped at the rural house so that Hoffman's character could watch a TV show. The scene should have been cut as it was not realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peek District</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Levinson's (1998) film of Barry Morrow's story loosely based on the life of Kim Peek explores the uneasy, deepening relationship between fictitious savant Raymond Babbit (Dustin Hoffman) and his long lost brother Charlie (Tom Cruise).No surprise that Ron Bass, who shares the screen writing credit, has in preparation a film of 'The Butterfly and the Diving Bell'.The death of the Babbit boys' father triggers a chain of events and a journey on which we accompany the vulnerable orphan Raymond, and his rather shallow and pretentious brother.It's rather interesting to compare the story of Raymond in the film and the real life-story of Kim Peek.In life, rather than in art, Kim Peek is as becoming as Dustin Hoffman manages to make Raymond Babbit. But he is cared for, not in an institution - as Raymond is - but by his own father... who, in everyday life, is far from wealthy.Pardoxically, in the documentary, we see Kim being put through his paces by neurologists and psychologists who are heavy on tests and measurements but light on understanding. Quite the opposite of the institutional carers shown in the film, who are not slow to miss the facets of Raymond's experience which are non-standard. They are very much the worthy and responsible custodians of Raymond's fragile existence.The film helps us to begin to confront the uncomfortable and inevitable situation of the Raymond Babbits of this world. The father of the real Raymond Babbit (Kim Peek) will very probably die before he does. Like Raymond, Kim Peek can easily memorise air safety statistics. But, aged 40 something, he is still having trouble getting food into his mouth without leaving a lot of it smeared all over his face.The uncomfortable exasperation which Charlie Babbit shows us in the early stages of the film is the likely inheritance of any actual Raymond when their parents become infirm and die. There are hardly any fathers wealthy enough to fund meaningful care for individuals in Raymond's situation.They rely on an unexpected miracle, which happens in the film. They rely on something happening to somebody else that will engender in them a lasting commitment quite inappropriate to anybody who is not their natural parent.There is no neurology or psychology text book yet published that could make this process as obvious and straightforwardly accessible as this film does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's raining men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I started watching this movie, I thought it was some low-budget work that Tom Cruise has been in, and that was the reason why I thought I wouldn't be the only one not enjoying it. I hope you people don't get mad at me for such ignorance. I don't know much of what was going on in 1988-- in fact, I wasn't even born--, so that's why I didn't know this movie's recognition. Tom Cruise's character (Charlie) is an arrogant, ambitious and selfish boy who finds out he has a savant brother who inherit all their father's money. From that point on, Charlie tries everything to get the custody of his brother, in order to be able to manage his fortune. Not only that, but Charlie is extremely rude with his poor brother, and I felt like punching Charlie in almost every scene. There is nothing wrong with acting from anyone from the cast; Hoffman, Cruise and Golino are decent in what they're doing. The big problem is the weak directing. Barry Levinson builds only normal scenes that never engage the movie as a whole, so I never got to see a dramatic moment in the whole picture. Also, the kissing scene between Raymond and Susana didn't feel right by any standards for me. Maybe the only really interesting scene happened when Charlie and Raymond had a conversation with the doctors, in the last 10 minutes, but it feels too hard to track the slow-paced story that filmmakers have given. "Rain Man" proves to be very passable, in my point of view. I hope fans don't get me wrong.</fullReview>

Raymond who is a slow man just like Forrest Gump meets his brother Charlie who uses Raymond for half of the money their father left all for Raymond when he died. Charlie learns as soon as his girlfriend leaves him that what he is doing to Raymond isn't right at all. In the end Raymond is out of the home he was in and he lives with Charlie where Charlie teaches him life outside of the home he was in. Ray is smart and can do math really easily. Charlie is most unbelieved when he sees what Raymond can do in his head. Rain Man and Forrest Gump are almost the same movie in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road movie extraordinair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had of course seen this years ago when it was released and later on video, but I never could really put my finger on what made this movie so good all those years ago. Yesterday I had the chance to view this excellent depiction again on TV after about 10 years, and now that I have grown into appreciating movies and being able to properly judge a movie I was astonished.First up there is the acting. Dustin Hoffman delivers his most touching and brilliant role as the savant brother Raymond, who was committed to an institution because he is autistic and needs guidance. Then there is Tom Cruise, who plays his first really character driven part after doing some light-weight movies, and I must say this is one of his best performances to date (among 4th of July and Magnolia). This role launched him into the big leagues, but regrettably he is cursed with his good looks (as is Brad Pitt). His role of Charlie Babbitt, the selfish entrepreneur in trouble, is a textbook example of a character that changed through the course of a movie, excellent. The other cast members are equally convincing and deliver great jobs.Second: directing. Barry Levinson has made a brilliant picture out of the Ronald Bass script, and should consider this his best directing move. The timing is top-notch in this flick and you really start to feel for Charlie in the end when he realizes that he loves his brother but isn't capable of taking care of him by himself.But for some people it might lack something. The action is packed in the characters and not in their actions. If you don't have an eye for detail this might come off as dull. But not for me, this picture has made it after all into my personal top 100 of favorite movies.I recommend this picture from now on to anyone who has a heart and who has the capability to listen to this heart.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, with a couple of inaccuracies regarding autism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like "Rain Man" and think that it portrays many aspects of autism quite well.However, while savant abilities occur almost exclusively in people with autism, savant abilities are still quite rare, even among autistics. The movie is an introduction to autism for most people seeing it, who may then incorrectly assume that savant skills are seen in all autistic individuals. Of course, I realize that most movies are not intended to educate, although it is helpful when they do educate people about little-known conditions.Also, as a "high-functioning" autistic adult, I take exception to the statement in the movie that Raymond is "very high functioning" [said by the doctor to whom Charlie took Raymond during their cross-country drive]. The portrayal of Raymond was barely in the "high-functioning" range. Again, my concern is based on what the general public may assume after seeing the movie (that is, that since Raymond is supposed to be "very high-functioning," anybody who is able to function in society at a higher level could not be autistic, which, of course, is not true). I have personally run into that attitude from others.One other thing: I believe that it would have been a much better movie without the sexual scenes; they were really unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic, but simultaneously hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rain Man" is a reasonable movie. It might be classified as a drama, but let's face it: it is both drama and comedy because it has lots of hilarious moments.This movie serves as a lesson of life as well. I consider it a lesson of life as much as "Pay It Forward", "Regarding Henry", "Dead Poets Society" and "Scent of a Woman" - each one at its own way, of course.It shows us what it's like to be an autistic but it also shows us that people can change for better and stop worrying only about themselves to worry about the others.That's what happens with Charlie Babbitt: a selfish, greedy, spoiled and explosive yuppie. When he finds out that he has a brother (named Raymond) he only cares about the money and his relationship with Raymond is very temperamental. Raymond starts by taking the quick-tempered Charlie to the limits of his patience, but later ends up taking Charlie out of his selfish world.But is Charlie a hateable character? Absolutely not! His short temper actually makes him very funny. Whenever he explodes because of Raymond is hilarious. Charlie uses often insulting vocabulary, but in a funny way."Rain Man" seems a simple movie at times, but it has beautiful moments too, especially with the always glorious help of naturally gorgeous sceneries.Dustin Hoffman is great in this role, but in my opinion this is not his finest performance: here he is very limited and repetitive both in speeches and emotions. However, Tom Cruise has his greatest performance ever in this movie - he's amazing in this role!The soundtrack is typical from the 80's, which means that it is very good. Most of the themes are instrumental and great, but the opening song is awesome: "Iko Iko", sung by The Belle Stars.By the way, "Rain Man" has also some beautiful and fabulous machines: various unities of the Lamborghini Countach, a Ferrari 400i and a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.Until the first hour and a few more minutes, this movie is excellent or very close to that. However, the second half isn't as good. Far from being terrible, it becomes a little boring. Part of the reason is because I like better the explosive Charlie than the "good Charlie". I have other reasons, but sometimes I'm not very good at explaining things, so I will leave that behind.</fullReview>

As does the shinning glitter of middle America and well chosen soundtrack.The movie is just a pleasant drift-down-the-river with a few small laughs and twists along the route.

		<shortDescription>Rain Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Barry Levinson (Good Morning, Vietnam), this is an excellent road movie and drama film. Basically selfish hustler Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) has found out his father, who threw him out as a teenager, has died. He has only left him an antique convertible, and everything else is going to the older brother he never knew he had. His brother, Raymond (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Dustin Hoffman) is an autistic man (with Asperger's Disorder/Sydrome), and he has no knowledge with the concept of money. Charlie is very displeased with no fortune, and a brother his father never told him of, so he decides to "kidnap" Raymond. But Raymond is too scared to fly, apart from Qantas, so they start a long road trip. Along the way Charlie does have his rages at Raymond, but at one point he discovers that he is a friend he thought was imaginary in childhood, the Rain Man, and that he can calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy, he starts to have real affection for his brother. The best scenes are the gambling (poker) spree, and those where Raymond and Charlie get on well, the ending of course when Raymond goes back with the carers or whatever is quite emotional. I can have some understanding of the character of Raymond (not in exactly the same way), because I myself have Asperger's Syndrome. Cruise is terrific as the suffering and later loving brother, Hoffman is not only admirable, but he is sympathetic when he is terrified and slapping himself, but also sometimes funny (I admit that) with his talking to himself and genius, it is just a great film. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Hans Zimmer, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Tom Cruise was number 32, and Dustin Hoffman number 24 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Cruise was also number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Hoffman was number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 63 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruise's Abrasive Character Ruins This For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, here's a film I liked a lot on the first viewing, but less and less on subsequent ones and finally calling it quits after the third look. By then, Tom Cruise's character "Charlie Babbitt" was too much to take. It wasn't entertainment to listen and see his profane, arrogant, mean-spirited character. Yeah, he comes around to some decency in the end but it's too little-too late for me.Dustin Hoffman, of course, gained a lot of recognition for his idiot-savant role of Cruise's brother "Raymond Babbitt." It's tough to root against a mentally- disabled person, even if he's math wizard.As interesting a story as this is, and as is Hoffman's acting and character, Cruise ruins this film for me. For others who wouldn't be offended, I highly recommend the movie as it's an involving story and Hoffman's performance alone is worth the rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing, Beautiful and Real work by Dustin Hoffman.Now this movie to me is just great. Starting with the song 'IKO IKO' the movie travels its path on an amazing and fresh story for its era/time. Dustin Hoffman played one great role and gave performance of his life. Tom Cruz was good too. Then why do i rate this movie 6/10 ?Although it is an amazing story as i mentioned it has one feature lacking. It starts with hatred and lust mixed with cruelty but suddenly turns into affection. Now this is still good but the changeover is not out of some appropriate reasons but, as i saw it, the most pitch-y point of the changeover (of this emotion and attitude) is the brilliance of one brother that helped other to win a huge amount at the casino. Now one brother is autistic but rich and other is lusty and in debt. It also tried to show the change in his attitude towards money and his autistic rich brother by checking out the memories of parents and the past events between brothers that connected them to rain man and main man but still casino winning by the brother actually made highest impact in movie and same was just visible. Now this is the situation where the movie fails to satisfy the logic that was this love for poor autistic but brother or was it the satisfaction that I won because of him and I have someone who can in time of need help me make a lot of money? honestly speaking the situation or doubt is not that much, its still the development of real love but the execution was too weak in this respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that while I wasn't wild about this film and didn't like the music at all, it had an excellent cast. Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a rich daddy's boy whose nose is out of joint because he only inherited a weird-looking late 1940s Buick and a rosebush. The lion's share of Babbitt's father's estate was bequeathed to his brother, Raymond, whom Cruise nicknamed "Rain Man" as a young child. At the film's opening, Cruise has virtually no memory of this long-lost older brother. After the will is read and the legal formalities are completed, Cruise drives the weird-looking car up to the residence where Rain Man,played by Dustin Hoffman has lived for many years. The brothers meet by chance when Rain Man comes out of the residence, sees the car and makes long, detailed comments about it. The brothers meet and Cruise and Rain Man, with the residence's hard-wrought blessing embark on a road trip. They converse, in a fashion. Rain Man was an autistic savant. He picked up a box of toothpicks and was able to tell how many were in the box; he had a "feel" for numbers and proved to be an asset at the gaming tables in Las Vegas; he memorized the telephone book; he recited facts by rote; he was a slave to routine and had "melt downs" when he missed a favorite show or shopped in a store other than the K-Mart he had become familiar with. Stories like "Rain Man" that portray people with autism as autistic savants are a tiresome dime a dozen. That description and accompanying behaviors doesn't even apply to most autisics! Get an umbrella to ward off the tired clichs about autism that come raining down from this movie. This movie has reinforced a stereotype of autism. Although this was not a terrible movie and was entertaining, I think it has done more harm than good in creating a better understanding of people who have autism and what it entails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man Raymond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raymond Babbitt(Dustin Hoffman) is what is called an "autistic savant". His brain does not function in the typical fashion. I must admit he is a superb mathemetician. He has difficulty communicating and learning. He is set in his own ways of acting,thinking,eating,sleeping,walking,talking,using the bathroom,you name it. Any sudden unprepared break from his daily routine and weekly rituals terrify Raymond. Raymond has a younger brother Charlie(Tom Cruise) who is a typical healthy human being. The Babbitt brothers' father passed away and when Charlie learns about the death,that's when he learned that he had an older brother. The Babbitts' mother died when Charlie was a toddler and Raymond was in his 20's. Charlie is bequeathed a vintage 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible. That's what brought his relationship with his father to an end. Charlie tells his girlfriend Susanna(Valeria Golino) that when he was in high school,he took a car for a victory spin against his dad's authority. He brought home a report card with almost all A's. The father reported the car stolen,spitefully to teach his son a lesson. Charlie felt he deserved it although the car was his dad's pride and joy. Charlie and a few friends of his were arrested and all but Charlie were shortly bailed out of jail. So Charlie ended up leaving home and he never saw his dad again. Charlie also got prize-winning rosebushes. Raymond,who doesn't understand the concept of money,was left $3 million. Charlie does all he can to gain custody of his brother and get his rightful share of the monetary bequest($1.5 million). According to Dr. Bruner who's in charge of Wallbrook,Raymond's institution,says Raymond gets the best care there. Charlie felt Raymond would live his life civilly outside Wallbrook. When Charlie was a child,he was trying to pronounce his brother's name and it came out "rain man". During Raymond's temporary departure from Wallbrook,Charlie takes him to Las Vegas. They play blackjack and win a lot of money. They even receive a penthouse suite,complimentarily as a result of their winnings. At a diner one morning,after eating a pancake breakfast,Raymond immediately knew that 246 of 250 toothpicks fell out of a box onto the floor. "There's four left in the box.",the waitress says. Raymond even briefly drove the '49 Buick in one or two scenes. In one of the final scenes,a private hearing takes place regarding Raymond. Raymond can't decide whether to stay with Charlie or go back to Wallbrook. Director Barry Levinson plays Dr. Mardsen,who's in charge of Raymond's psychic evaluation program. Raymond kept saying,"Go back to Wallbrook with Charlie Babbitt". So Dr. Bruner took Raymond back to Wallbrook. This film was theatrically released on December 16,1988. It won three Oscars. Levinson took home a Best Director Oscar,Hoffman took home a Best Actor Oscar,and best screenplay.</fullReview>

His was supporting his two small children,since his wife and child hood sweet heart passed away. And from my understanding God Blessed Mr. Ugal with the opportunity to work for Mr. Dustin and to make a new life for himself and his children. If this is true what a great thing in Gods eyes that Mr. Dustin, did for this family and for this man.. Wish that everyone would take this chance and make something better for someone else. I know that God has blessed the both of them over and overThanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road Trip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an actor's movie, first and foremost. There's very little in the sense of eye-candy and on screen acrobatics, but there sure is quite a lot of emotion and humanity. This is thanks to a great screenplay that allows for an astonishing character evolution for Tom Cruise as well as a clearly defined and stable yet at times erratic character for an accomplished Dustin Hoffman. The plot is intelligently conceived in that it begins with a huge moral roadblock for Cruise's character Charlie Babbitt. We are introduced to a rich and kind of arrogant profit-seeking guy who wants in on his father's inheritance. This inheritance, however, happens to be in the hands of his long-lost autistic-savant brother, Ray, who doesn't "understand the concept of money" (a comical contrast with Charlie's nature). All this because Charlie didn't get along with his father; he's been arrogant and selfish all of his life, we learn. So this is Mr. Babbitt's final punishment: Charlie merely gets an old car and some rosebushes and must live with the fact that there's a 3 million dollar cheque out there with his name on it that he'll never see. And so ensues a life altering, yet all the while entertaining road trip.At first, Charlie believes that Ray is an idiot, actually telling him on a few occasions. Then he thinks he's faking it ("I know you're somewhere in there, Ray). In other words, he doesn't know how to deal with his brother's condition. Actually though, he doesn't really care to. He has no time for a "retard". Later, however, Charlie finds out his brother's "good with numbers". In fact, with just one glance at, for example, toothpicks scattered on the ground, he can tell you exactly how many there are. This gives Charlie an idea: It's time to hit Vegas.This stint at exploiting Ray ends soon however. Ray starts to grow on Charlie. As the movie progresses, there are less outbursts of anger and more understanding on Charlie's side. As soon as he begins to really listen to his brother, he learns things about his past that he never knew. That is, as soon as he ceases to see Raymond as a bank number, he learns a great deal. Hoffman gives one of the best performances in American cinema. Performances like Sean Penn in "I am Sam", which consists of mental retardation, are given a little too much credit. Playing an autistic-savant, with all the right nuances and contradictions like Hoffman is something I will continue to marvel at. He's in the dark when it comes to his emotions. He simply cannot express them. As Charlie falls more and more in love with his brother, we are led to believe that the feeling is reciprocal, but it really isn't. Raymond Babbbitt is a person riddled with impossible self inflicted rituals that he must abide by. At the end of the film, Raymond is asked if he would like to stay with his brother, and he says yes. Then he is asked if he would like to go back to his ward, and he says yes. Ultimately, he is not at all in contact with his emotions and has no idea that his brother loves him. It's a sad fact, but a good idea to let him go.In the end, we have what is called a comedy-drama. "Rainman" is funny indeed: card counting in Vegas and "K-mart sucks!", etc. It is also a drama as we witness the positive evolution of a greedy man and the sad unchanging nature of his autistic brother. The actors make this movie possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Levinson is one of the great screen directors of our time. He's most notable for being able to evoke subtly comedic discussions amongst his leading characters, save the rare occasion when his strained efforts backfire ("Toys" comes to mind). "Rain Man" (1988) is his crowning effort, his best achievement I can think of off-hand.Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise in "Rain Man," but the individual who really lights up the screen and makes us believe is Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt, his autistic brother. Actors Aside, People consider Raymond a wandering innocent who has no idea what he's doing, but as his friendship with his brother proceeds so does the fact that Raymond, though obviously unable to comprehend all his surroundings, recognizes his brother and the bond between them.That's not to say Cruise acts bad in this film. I don't like Tom Cruise, specifically because I think he is more than similar to his ignorant character in this film. But because of his personality, Cruise is able to convincingly portray the type of person vital to "Rain Man" -- he's the parallel of the audience. We go into the movie with apprehension and perhaps a little self-assurance, and we come out wholly different and strangely changed. Our perspective is no longer what it was before.Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a wealthy car dealer living the high life in California. He's just gotten in a shipment of Ferraris and he's going to make a killing on an upcoming deal for all of them, when his entire background comes back to haunt him in a single unfortunate moment during his newly acquired and quite happy life. What can I say, crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Rain Man's problem? - His brother. Revisted movie - Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a man who has some kind of mysterious mental disorder which enables him to perform the most complicated mathematical calculations but cannot tell you the answer to one-plus-one. The movie suggests that he is autistic, but is he? He communicates quite satisfactorily when he wants to, and when he's upset he starts rocking back and forth and throws tamper tantrums. Well, so what? When he's left alone, he's all right. It's only when other people, such as his conniving and pushy brother, insist that he talks that he gets nervous. But the movie also shows that when someone speaks to him nicely, he responds accordingly. One strong scene is the scene where a young pretty woman, Iris, who is a prostitute but clearly not a sinister or threatening person, starts talking to Raymond, and Raymond, who is supposed to be autistic, responds. He likes Iris and more importantly has a conversation with her in which he reveals a droll sense of humor. The scene gets ruined when the brother shows up and drives away Iris, which destroys the ambiance developing between Raymond and Iris, who found Raymond intriguing, and wipes out what potentially could have been an upbeat and amusing part of the story. What if Iris had picked up Raymond? What if Iris, like the prostitutes in "Leaving Las Vegas" or "Pretty Woman," had bonded with Raymond and started taking care of him? Maybe Raymond would have gained some confidence in himself, felt a lot better about life, really learned how to dance, shaken off the effects of autism, and got it together to tell his pushy brother to get lost. Then the movie would have really become interesting.I rate this movie an "seven" exclusively because of Dustin Hoffman's dominating performance as the indomitable Raymond. Otherwise, this movie is a "four."On 5/12/07 I watched Rain Man again and wish to make a few more comments. This movie is about two brothers who attempt to bond with each other after suddenly discovering each other's existence. Both brothers struggle with emotions that overwhelm them but ultimately they succeed in establishing a bond. This time I was much more impressed with Tom Cruise's performance. At first angry and selfish, his character gos through a complicated change and emerges a much better and more responsible person. As for Dustin Hoffman, his performance is a classic and is the hub around which the movie revolves. Mr. Hoffman's character is trapped in a psychological prison that distorts his behavior and makes him emotionally unreachable. But with enough attention, encouragement and support provided by his brother, he begins to improve and by the end of movie there is hope for him. I now rate this movie a 10.</fullReview>

A simple touch could feel (to a person with autism) like fire, or it could feel like an electrical shock or any other unpleasant thing you could think of. It varies in each person with Autism and to what severity they have the disorder.On the highway, when he refuses to stay in the car?

		<fullReview>Well, I liked this movie for the single fact that I have met such 'autistic savants' who are really both talented and retarded at the same time and the movie lets us know more about them. The guy I met had memorized pages from various books and made wonderful portrait. Now, Hoffman was good no doubt but his character's condition was much better off. There are autistics who cant even recognize relations, can't wear their shirts right and yet can memorize the capitals of all the countries. About Cruise, movies like this one and 'Magnolia' reveal his depth beyond his looks. And the actress Valeria was really cute and I was forced to search for her wallpapers. Overall a great movie with great performances. If you haven't watched it yet, you must!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man is a movie that touches the hearts of many of it's viewers. It's splendid, a film of epic emotions. Dustin Hoffman plays an autistic savant, from beginning to end he portrays the character with such passion it's like he actually is retarded. I've seen Rain Man fourteen times. The first time too young to appreciate, the second old enough to love it. Like Goodfellas round of every scene is violence, Rain Man's ground is the emotion. The score plays a big part of the guide running the emotions through the film. A film about a mentally retarded savant being kidnapped by his cold brother(a perfectly game Tom Cruise) may not seem interesting but Rain Man's director, Barry Levinson adds a warm touch to Rain Man's atmosphere. I recommend it to people over the age of eight.It hit me like a bombshell</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the amazing eighties classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rainman is the quintessential eighties film. First Tom Cruise, second loads of bad language, third hot eighties chick, fourth a renowned and respected actor and fifth...a crazy road trip. It's fun, but never much of a comedy, it's actually more sad and dramatic and pulls the heart strings in such a big way. The biggest way and reason that happens I think is Dustin Hoffman's performance.Rainman is the story of a self centered, quick talking car dealer who's father dies. He hasn't spoken to his father in years and goes to the funeral mostly to find out what is becoming of his father's fortune. Instead Charlie is left his father's car, nothing else. The rest of his father's estate is mysteriously left to some unknown recipient. Charlie is furious, especially considering his business is on the brink of closure and he needs money. Through some investigating he discovers that his father's money has been left in the car of a doctor at an institution. He then discovers that in that institution is an older brother he never knew he had...Raymond. Charlie is determined to get that money and takes Raymond into his custody without asking and wants to take him back to L.A. in hopes that he can get permanent custody and therefore the inheritance. Raymond refuses to fly so Charlie and Raymond are forced to take a road trip across the country. As they go Charlie gets to know his brother and by the end of the trip the only thing that matters is his brother's well being.Tom Cruise does a decent job as Charlie Babbitt. It's not an unfamiliar role to him but he still plays it well. The supporting cast is just equally okay, nothing mind blowing but they aren't given a lot of lines or place in the film. Instead this film is entirely about what the title suggests Rainman (a name Charlie came up with as a child because he couldn't say Raymond.) Dustin Hoffman is brilliant in one of his greatest roles. He creates such an emotional character that we all fall in love with Raymond, we all want him protected. He's brilliant and has this talent with numbers and yet is so emotionally withdrawn he can't show any real emotion which is heart breaking for both the audience and Cruises' character. Despite the film being an intense drama, there are some genuinely funny moments that are classic. Teaching Raymond to dance, and just even the dialog between the two brothers. This is just one of those movies that everyone has to see at least once. It's touching and Dustin Hoffman is truly amazing. The only downfall to the film is the ending which although made sense it just didn't seem to wrap things up as well as I would have liked. Anyone who loves movies has to see Rainman. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First you laugh and then you'll cry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew very little about autism before seeing this film on its release. It is not a preachy type of film, nor does it always go for the easy laugh. Everything is very subtle about it. It's well made, well acted, and powerful throughout.(Potential Spoilers may follow within text)Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is an instantly dislikable exotic car business owner who is in financial trouble when he learns his millionaire father has passed away in Cincinnati. Thinking he will be gaining a great fortune and save his business, he instead learns he has essentially been disowned. (with the exception of a classic car and some prized rose-bushes from the garden.) Soon after this, he discovers a brother he never knew he had is the heir to the actual money. One catch, Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman) is autistic and has no concept of what he has inherited. Although he can't tell you the value of a candy bar, Raymond can calculate impossible sums in his head in seconds!! He also is entrenched with little rituals that begin to grate on the self-absorbed Charlie as he kidnaps Raymond and starts to take him back to LA. Over this long journey, we watch as Charlie discovers that it's not money he really cares about after all. In between there are some great scenes as the two travel cross-country. To the uninformed, you might go into this film saying to yourself, "oh no, another movie about the wacky brother." That would be an injustice both to the movie and to a very serious subject. While initially, this film starts off in high comic gear, be prepared for some later moments that will cause the tears to flow. I'm not the hugest Tom Cruise fan in this world, but he does a GREAT job in Rain Man, mainly because the character he plays calls for a guy who is loud and flashy in a rather overconfident way. Dustin Hoffman obviously did his usual homework and manages to really suck you into believing that he IS who he portrays. There are some slapstick scenes, but mostly this is a film about learning priorities. I'm stingy on giving 10's out to ANY film, but this one is worth it."Definitely 10 out of 10......Definitely 10 out of 10!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hoffman's Best Roles Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the movie opens, Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a 26 year old egotistical, mercenary, matierialistic, spoiled, rich kid trying to hide his past as a Los Angeles businessman. While driving to Palm Springs, Charlie learns that his father Sanford died at his home in Cincinnati. Since his mother had died when Charlie was three, Charlie expected to receive a lavish home and millions of dollars as the sole survivor. Rather, he learned that his father left him his prize rosebushes. What happened to the money? It was lent to his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman). A brother he never knew he had. Charlie then kidnapped Raymond from his institutionalized existence and take him back to Los Angeles in an attempt to use him for his money. Along the way, Hoffman performs an excellent portrayal of an autistics savant - an innocent foil to Cruise's ruthless yuppie character. The plot is both heartwarming and tearjerking, but is not without its humourous moments. As the Academy Award winner for Best Picture in 1988, "Rain Man" could easily win an award for outstanding movie of the eighties. Yeah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie being so direct and straight to the point. Since autism is a very serious illness, it was often called 'too bad', or 'I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it'. Thanks to Dustin Hoffman's excellent, almost perfect role, the seriousness of the disease was brought out in the open and since a lot of research is performed under pressure of media and society, the movie has a goal...And hit it! Next to the social importance, it's allso a great movie, funny but very sad, so no one exept the ones who are very familiar with the syndrome knows what to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin Hoffman's gone autistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie last night and it is just a wonderful film. Dustin Hoffman was wonderful at portraying the autistic Raymond Babbit. In fact, Hoffman spent time with an autistic child and his/her mother to get an idea of what an autistic person acts like. The reason why I found this movie so interesting is because I know someone who is autistic. He went to school with me practically my whole life and thinks I'm his best friend. He would hang onto me all the time back in elementary and middle school and even through high school (although not as much) and say stupid things like "The train went walrus!" (which Raymond never said in the film). He certainly threw a lot of tantrums like Raymond did, but only in elementary school. (here we got Raymond as an adult and he still throws tantrums). Like Charlie Babbit(his brother), I got fed up with him. Unlike Charlie, however, I never learned to like him and definitely never will. Like Raymond, the guy who kept hanging around me, was quite smart. He did not adapt well socially though(although he's quite popular with the other students). He [the autistic kid who hung around me] made a gift for me as a sophomore in high school that had pink, green, and blue pine trees, hearts, and teddy bears that he cut out of tissue paper and glued on another piece of paper. I wonder if Raymond ever did that to anyone. Autistic people are not bad people. They're God's children too and we shouldn't make fun of them. The reason why I don't like the guy who hung around me was not because he was autistic, but because I had a bad history with him. Now that I'm done with high school, I won't have to worry about him for he'll be far away in another college. Anyway, this is a great movie that everyone should watch.</fullReview>

Hoffman does a wonderful job showing the emotional detachment that lies at the heart of the movie. Cruise portrays an emotional detachment of another kind as the egocentric Charlie.

		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was very young, to this day I still really admire this film. Rain Man is about two brothers (Raymond &amp; Charlie), who finally meet eachother in adulthood, the death of their father is what brings the two brothers together. Their father Sanford Babbitt, left three million dollars in a trust fund for Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) before he died, and has excluded out his other son, Charlie (Tom Cruise) from inheriting the money. This really irks Charlie and compels him to find his long lost brother. He does find his brother, but what he finds is not a normal brother, more like a brother who suffers from Autism. From that point he kidnaps his brother from a mental institution, hoping to find a way to get the three million dollars. The two brothers eventually learn alot about eachother, and what really matters more then money, family. Tom Cruise's character begins to understand Raymonds condition, and he begins to realize how special his brother really is. Dustin Hoffman's role is more than just amazing, it's true to life. We begin to feel like we know how Raymond is, we begin to enter his world and see the world as only Raymond can. This film won the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor &amp; Director, and it really deserved all of the awards. Especially Dustin Hoffman, who's role I think is among one of the finest in film history. This film is really as good as it can get on the big screen!</fullReview>

His gradual understanding of his brother's disability (and extra abilities) lead to the grasping of a strong relationship with his brother.I feel that the trip across the country was the start in the relationship (because of the scene at the airport) and also the real start of the film.This is a film that everyone can watch because everyone can understand and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter what people say about "Rain man", they can not deny the fact that Hoffman controls the movie from start to finish. Sure, Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance and Barry Levinson masterfully directed this masterpiece, but it is still Dustin Hoffman who, in one of his best performances of all-time, brings the movie to stardom.Charlie Babbit (Cruise), a self-centered car dealer, leaves on vacation with his girlfriend (Valeria Golino). However, he learns that his father has passed away and decides to show up at his funeral for only one reason, to get the money his father left. Unfortunately for Charlie, he can't get the money for it has been given to a mental institution Charlie is unaware of. Charlie therefore decides to take matters in his own hands and goes to the institution to find out what their connection with his father was. It is only then that he learns that he has a big brother by the name of Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) who is autistic and lives in this institution.Charlie tries to convince the manager of the institution to let him have the money for his brother can do nothing with it but he refuses to. So Charlie takes Ray out of the institution without the permission of the manager and this is how Charlie gets to know his big brother Raymond.Very emotional at some times, "Rain man" has its funny moments as well and Hoffman demonstrates incredibly well how an autistic person reacts towards certain things as well as changes in his routine life. "Rain man" is a work of art and is not to be missed.</fullReview>

Charlie takes custody of brother Ray. When it's discovered Ray has amazing mathematical ability, including the ability to count cards, they take a road trip to Las Vegas.Scene after scene the brothers are compared. In a manner reminiscent of the movie 'The Effect of Gama Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds' which compared the lives of two sisters in a dysfunctional home, Rain Man seems to simply be a comparison of the lives of the two brothers. Charlie is harried constantly; struggling on cell phones, car phones and home phones in efforts to make his next pay check and meet their daily needs. Ray takes pleasure simply watching 'Wheel of Fortune'. Ray seems happier than brother Charlie.Tom Cruise could have won an academy award for his performance here also. Does Ray actually save brother Charlie? Do the two brothers need each other? Is Ray better off with his wheeling dealing brother or back in the supervised ward?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain Man tells the story of a selfish yuppie who learns that he has an older, autistic brother that his recently deceased father has left everything to. In an attempt to gain the wealth for himself, he kidnaps his brother and goes on a road trip with him. Along the way, they grow close, and the yuppie finally begins to see his brother as family rather than another way to get rich. However, when he learns that his autistic brother is a mathematical genius with the best memory he's ever seen, he decides to make a stop in Vegas. Rain Man is a classic feel good movie that people of all ages should enjoy.The best part about Rain Man is that it manages to be absolutely hilarious in some scenes while being tear jerking dramatic in the next. Movies that can mix genres like that and still flow together as one are automatically good in my eyes. Some movies try to do both but just end up looking sloppy. Not Rain Man. The story is a very cool inspirational story. It's one of those movies that brings a smile to your face because of how cool it is. The dialogue is genius. For a movie that consists primarily of two guys, one of which is autistic, the dialogue is still smart, funny, and witty.The acting is terrific. Dustin Hoffman pulls off one of his best performances, and he rightfully won an Oscar for it. Tom Cruise does an amazing job also, and his role in this film really makes you wonder what's happened to him lately.Overall, this is an amazing film, and I recommend it to everyone.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man is a great film that works on so many levels. As a detailed character study, a comedy, a drama, it manages to blend so many fields of cinema, and it manages to pull all of them off. A short opening plot summary goes that Charlie Babbit is a guy who has a small car sales business that is going down fast. At the end of a stressful day of work, he gets a phone call telling him his father has died. Once he gets down to the matter of the will, most of his father's fortune has been left to a beneficiary - a man called Raymond. What follows is easily one of the best cinematic experiences anyone could wish for, a real gem of a character driven road movie, with perhaps the best dialogue ever in a film. The acting in particular is very good. Dustin Hoffman, obviously is amazing, but Tom Cruise also puts in a great turn that should not go unmentioned. My only initial qualm with the film was it's score. A weird pan pipe based piece of work. But as the film progressed, I supposed it made it more original than set it apart from any similar movies that would surely opt for some kind of Thomas Newman rip-off. To sum up, maybe a 9 out of 10 is perhaps too high, but I got myself into a pattern with my reviews where I rated certain films too high and... anyway... It is a great film and will surely be liked by anyone who has respect for great cinema, a good story and I'm sure most people in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is way better than where it falls on the top 250 list maybe some people weren't watching it or just voted on it without seeing the movie this film didn't win the 1989 best picture for nothing it is one of Princess Diana's favorite films thought during the filming by both Tom and Dustin to be a bad film ending up with Hoffman grabbing his second best actor award. just for kicks and giggles try grabbing a pack of card and pull off counting them and then think about doing that 6 times you will find you probably cant even count a quarter of the cards in the deck this is a great movie not my personal favorite but way better than where it seems to have fell on this list watch this movie you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't watched it yet, i suggest you watch it because this film is the most touching and Hilariously funny film ever to come in theatres.The story starts with Charlie Babbit a slick car salesman who will do anything to make that extra bit of $$$$. Then once Charlie finds out his Dad has just died -who he has fallen out with and as a result he left home in his late teens- he obviously wants to know what he gets in inheritance. Then when he finds out that somebody other than him has inherited his Father's $3million Estate, he goes on search for that person... only to find that it is his brother Raymond -who he has never met before, but only knew him as the infamous RAINMAN!-. an Autistic Savant patient, who's about to turn his world upside down.I won't reveal anymore but take my advice, WATCH IT! and always remember that he's a very excellent driver!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man: A truly amazing movie, with truly amazing actors, and (yet again) a truly amazing score.The focus of the movie is on an autistic man and his brother after their father has died and left his money to the autistic one.Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise completely steal the show with amazing acting. Although critic after critic has bellyached on how great Hoffman's performance was, personally, I preferred Cruise's performance as the jealous brother just as much as Hoffman's. Cruise was able to make it flow naturally, just like Hoffman. However, since many people consider mentally retarded people harder to portray, I can understand people's preference to Hoffman's. He was able to make it seem as though although he was there in the places physically, he wasn't actually THERE mentally.Hans Zimmer's score really hits the beats of the film perfectly and underscores the emotion in the plot and the acting, rather then trying to create it where it doesn't exist.A very great movie overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Contains spoilers) It was hard to tell who was more retarded in this movie--the character played to Dustin Hoffman or the one played by Tom Cruise. Hoffman did his job as an actor, believably playing the non-verbal features of this difficult disorder especially well. But the Tom Cruise "pretty boy" character, with his constant pasted-on smile and incongruous, arrogant, volatile temperament, made me cringe. That's because I've worked for people just like that and I know how impossible (and impossibly stupid) they are. His inability to pick up on the fact that his brother had savant qualities, for example the ability to instantly count and remember numbers, was just too glaring. How dumb can the guy be? Events like this just dragged the movie on like an episode of Crocodile Dundee XII. Of course they're on their way to Las Vegas as Hoffman's card-counting (oops, savant) abilities become clearer (at least to everyone except Cruise) and, let's see, could this be leading to an "aha!" experience that Hoffman could be put to use in a Casino to rescue his idiot brother from the debt of his hairbrained car-importing scheme? If these were live actors people would be throwing garbage at Cruise on stage -- if they even remained in the theatre. Or better yet, throw garbage at the writer and director. A suitable movie for Cruise, but he's a B-grade actor who can only do B-grade movies. Hoffman, well, he's versatile and tries new roles; you win some, you lose some. The movie was very low-brow, stupid, and simplistic, with over-done plot set-ups where you could see everything coming. Cruise's character was offensive but the movie didn't redeem that situation by having him be the 'bad guy' who gets it in the end because of his stupidity and arrogance. It's as if the movie was aimed at people who are themselves mentally retarded. Maybe under totally different direction and a re-worked plot it could have been a better story, but it you're looking for an uplifting or even a sad human interest movie, this one definitely rains on the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't count how many times I've watched this movie. I love it. I love every minute of it. I forget that I'm watching famous actors. I am seeing two brothers. I am seeing a transformation - small in the end, for Raymond, but huge for his little brother.I have no criticism at all about the movie Rain Man. It is perfectly entertaining. I puts me through all kinds of thoughts and emotions; it takes me on a journey; it makes me laugh and cry and want to kiss and dance, and try one more time to connect with extended family members who are so different from me, it feels impossible. This movie affirms that someday we'll understand each other a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain Man Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of an awkward autistic brother in Barry Levinson's Rain Man gives a great example of the difficulties experienced by people who are autistic and those surrounding them, and the fascinating abilities of this minority of people. The film explores the difficult things experienced by people involved with autism, and how autistic people interact with others. It also explores autism itself, and how different autistic savants have different abilities and disabilities. At the centre of the story, however, is not Hoffman's character, Raymond, but Tom Cruise's character, his brother Charlie.Charlie Babbit is a young man at the top of his game. He works for Ferrari, has a beautiful girlfriend and is extremely successful, that is, until Raymond comes into his life. When Charlie's father dies he leaves Charlie his car and his award winning rose bushes. The three million dollar house, however, goes to a brother who Charlie knows nothing of, apart from the fact that he is in a mental institution. When Charlie visits the institution he argues with the warden about Raymond's fortune, and questions Raymond's ability to take on this great asset. When the warden refuses to recommend any change, Charlie kidnaps his brother, and takes him under his care.This damages Charlie's relationship with his girlfriend, Susanna, and his job. He soon begins to blame his misfortunes on Raymond, which is not always incorrect. When Raymond refuses to go out in the rain, Charlie is left stranded, unable to reach a destination, required for his job. "I hope you appreciate this because my business is going down the f***ing toilet." Raymond has a rare form of autism, which makes him able to perform massive and complicated mathematical problems in his head. He also has a fantastic memory. However, this condition also has its negative affects. He has trouble relating with people. When kissed by a prostitute in Las Vegas, he says that the kiss felt "wet". He has difficulty making decisions and does everything he is told. When crossing a road, the light flashes 'Don't Walk'. Raymond immediately stops walking in the middle of the road. He is asked whether he wants to go back to Walbrook (his mental institution) or go with Charlie, and responds "Go back to Walbrook, stay with Charlie Babbitt." As well as these, Raymond has countless fears, becomes highly distressed in basic conflict situations and when he cannot watch his television programs at the right time.Perhaps the basic negative aspect of Raymond's disorder is his 'twisted vista' on life. He can do great mathematical equations, but struggles when asked basic life problems, involving things such as money. Everything he seems to do is vague and he does not respond to body language, only words. It is later revealed that Raymond cared for Charlie when he was very young, but once accidentally burnt Charlie in the bath and was sent away. It was during this time Charlie called him 'Rain Man' and this is where the film gets its name. This care is inverted when the pair meets up later in life, and Charlie finds it difficult to take this care on.However, what separated the pair is also what brings them back together. Charlie takes Raymond to Las Vegas and uses his extraordinary mathematics skills to 'count cards' in a game of Blackjack. They win masses of money, and, although Charlie is 'using' Raymond, this trip brings them closer together. Charlie becomes a great carer, and begins to show great affection to his older brother. "What you have to understand is, four days ago he was only my brother in name. And this morning we had pancakes." Charlie begins to see that it is better for Raymond to send him to the institution. So, Charlie gives Raymond perhaps the first major choice he has had in decades. He sends Raymond back to Walbrook for two weeks, and tells him he can come back if he wants to. We have seen though, that this may be the end of Raymond's trip, as he is so indecisive that this may be the last time he is outside the institution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rainman is a story of one "s*** of a human being gradually transforming into a real person. Charlie Babbit is a selfish yuppie who discovers he has an autistic brother, Raymond. Events take place which change his perception of the world for the better. Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman have never done anything of this calibre, before or since. Rainman is one of the most hilarious, touching and unbelievably amazing films of all time. The subtle intricacies which all add up to create a mesmerising masterpiece that will be thought over for many years to come are startling. This is Levinson at his best.

Despite Pre Rain Man people doing mostly normal lives and figuring out a never in print before thought process all of our efforts are purposely hidden by the Post Rain Man Empire that includes Nascar and Postage Stamps. We unintentionally deflate their bubble of autism being this helpless condition.After Rain Man Autism became a Buzzword and Psychology practices were over come with experts on the subject and the old Autism that was figured out can't overcome the power and the might of the Autism Empire that resulted from Rain Man's good intention. Our version Of Autism Explains everything from Einstein to dyslexia and even the real Rain Man. Modern Autism jumps threw hoops to keep our anthropology hidden. In reality we might have figured out the building blocks of the human mind.Our Hero is Alan Turing Autisitc father of the computer 1912-1954,Rich Shull Author Autism Pre Rain Man Autism, Inventor Of the Turing Motor a 70 % efficient Green car motor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now here is some good Tom Cruise, but before we go into that, I must, of course, mention the incomparable Dustin Hoffman's winning performance as autistic Raymond Babbitt. In the Acadamy Awards' choice for Best Picture, Charlie, a selfish waste of life, learns through the death of his father that he has a mentally handicapped brother named Ray who is inheriting the majority of the deceased's goods. After Charlie finds the savant brother, what eventually ensues is a road trip involving the two (since Ray will only fly Quantis, an airline that's never crashed but only makes trips to Australia). Along the trip, Ray eventually reveals his remarkable mathematic knowledge, an attribute Charlie believes will be helpful in Vegas. My favorite scene is Ray's first kiss from a woman in a lone hotel elevator - he charmingly describes the experience as "wet" (Comedy kudos to the "fart in the phone booth" scene as well). The film is very well done and well written, but it is very eighties-riffic at times. Most of the rating I give Rain Man is due to Hoffman, who did his homework on his character's condition (It truly shows.), and partly because of Cruise's convincing portrayal of despicably ignorant Charlie. Though the plot is so-so, this film's a classic.</fullReview>

When their father dies, Charlie is angry when he discoverers that all he has been left is a 49 Buick Convertible. He then finds out that his long lost brother has inherited their father's estate, worth $3 million.

		<shortDescription>like or dislike, but never judge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i admit that the first time when i saw Rain Man i felt poignant and pathetic for the Hoffman's character--a rare physical disability, no loving, no tearing, no any emotional affairs ever involving with his routine life. Especially when his mental retardation confronted with Cruise's extremely cocky character--a far more common emotional one,Charlie. But after several reviews and my following growth on age and experience, i acknowledge that everyone in his own way is equal happy or painful to you, equally before the God. you can only like or dislike them, but can never judge them and then show your cheap sympathy or worship or something like that. one should admire on how human nature is, and how the deficiencies of one can be the abilities of the others. Rain Man is so fascinating because it didn't show us a weaker or a stronger man by its own judgment, and refused to supply those questions with sentimental but unrealistic answers, unlike a movie in which there is a miracle cure. at the end of the movie, we didn't see a smart Raymond, or see a spiritually changed charlie, the movie just show us a matter-of-fact(this is largely due to Dustin Hoffman's convincingly render), and we just get in touched with our own heart, not be reluctantly driven by director. Rain Man in this way is a masterpiece which has gained many affections.but in other way, i would like to say any movie resort to physical disability is easy to win heart, but just temporarily, not permanently. it is can only be my B-grade list no matter how touched it is. i appreciate those present us daily trivia of common and still can be thought-evoking and can really stay in my heart. it may be not popular with most audience, but it can truly be a soul mate to some person forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ambassador movie for caregivers and for family love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning; may give away the whole story to the movieAnyone that has been unfortunate to have an ill member of the family or a loved one with some medical setback would totally relate to this movie. It allows those that have never been affected in such a way, access to really know what it is like to be either a caregiver, a loved one or even as a very close friend of someone with special needs. I do not recall seeing any other movie with a similar theme with the exception of those with similar emotions in `She lives' starring Dezi Arnez. and `Death not be proud'.Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman both collaborate in a unique and brilliant performance,the roles of two siblings where the youngest (Charlie Babbit, performed by Tom Cruise) discovers after the death of his only surviving parent, his father, the existence of his Autistic older brother (Raymond Babbit, performed by Dustin Hoffman) that has been institutionalised most of his life. Initially, Charlie is shattered beyond disbelief that his Autistic brother inherits a very large amount from his father's death, as money is meant to have no meaning to an Autistic person. Charlie's initial motive in meeting his Autistic brother is only of monetary interest, but on getting to later know his older brother better, develops an incredible fraternal bond, where money is no longer the reason for his interest towards his brother. Charlie manages to spend time getting to know his older brother and they travel together across the country when his autistic brother refuses to board a plane to fly as he is in fear of crashing down. He only wants to travel on a Quantas plane as it has never had a history of crashing, which is impractical for them to go to Australia just to board a plane to travel on their side of the country.Charlie plays the role of a caregiver superbly. He brilliantly highlights the immeasurable pains and frustrations that are associated with caregiving in a way that would make most caregivers feel recognized. He displays the enormous patience with near breaking point behaviour to assist in the best way he can as most caregivers do, as it is sudden and without any formal training. It shows the love, commitment and devotion of what it is like to care for someone for 24 hours, even if for only a day. Dustin Hoffman also compliments the role of an Autistic person brilliantly and I just cannot see how it could have been better.Charlie's biggest surprise is when he discovers his brother's unique Autism skills of high level number crunching and the ability of memorizing a whole phone directory with the names and phone numbers, after reading the name tag of a waitress in a cafe'. He is later further dazzled with the card counting skills which they then go to Casinos and win big from his brother's autistic skills, but nobody notices why. They are thrown out of the casino being falsely accused of having inside information instead. A beautiful scene of financial sacrifice that is often also associated with caregivers, is when he takes off his Gold Rolex watch to the pawnbroker when he is short on cash flow prior to going into the Casino.The last scene is when Charlie is fighting with the authorities over custody of his Autistic brother and the role of 'blood being thicker then water' is displayed beyond words. After having finished arguing with them, he is alone with his autistic brother and kisses him on the forehead, displaying an emotional and memorable scene which ties families in a unique and special way. His initial monetary interests are transformed into the love and compassion that go beyond his original expectations. This movie is a great ambassador to caregivers and for family love. I highly recommend it as you will not be disappointed</fullReview>

In "Rain Man" he again shows how good he is when playing an Autistic who travels with his brother (Cruise). As the scenes appear, we see his performance and admire him even more.

		<shortDescription>Charlie and Raymond had a right to have a relationship with each other!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my very favorite movies, not only because it was so well done, but because for over 25 years I have worked with and cared about people with disabilities, including autism; and like Charlie am a sibling of a person with a developmental disability. Other family members and friends of people with disabilities love this movie too, because we knew it the first movie about disabled people that was so true!It was NOT about a Helen Keller type (once unlocked, brilliant and OK)or about cute, sweet kids with Down's Syndrome (they are cute, but most disabled people are adults, and aren't always cute, sweet or easy). Charlie came to love Raymond, learned to communicate with him through humor, and seemed to become a better person because of Raymond; but Charlie was also stressed and baffled by Raymond much of the time. At times he reached out to Raymond with affection, but was rejected. This is the dynamic we live with daily.Someone who simply feels pity, who cannot accept the disabled person for who he/she is, who has no sense of humor, or thinks he is a Miracle Worker who will 'cure' disabled people, will get nowhere, and will not add to the disabled person's life. Charlie and Raymond were the only family that each other had. They had not only a moral but a legal right to continue their relationship and to live close to each other, if not together. Even in the 1980's, as Raymond's closest relative, all Charlie had to do was petition the court to become Raymond's "conservator", which likely would have been granted. He was wrong to take Raymond, but the institution in Ohio had no legal hold on Raymond, regardless of the father's will. Charlie's kidnapping would have been outweighed by the fact that a)he was family (like parental rights), it is always better to keep families intact unless serious abuse exists and b) Raymond had the right to live in the "least restrictive setting" which in no way is a large institution such as the one where he had been living, across the country from his only family.If Charlie could not handle alone having Ramond live with him, then Charlie had the right to choose, with Raymond, and the advice of social service agencies, an appropriate small group home for Raymond close by where the two could maintain the brotherly relationship they had resumed. Perhaps in the 30's or 50's, the state, assuming that it and psychiatric experts knew what was best, had the right to tear family members apart and institutionalize people, but this has not been so for a very long time, and the ending was the only thing about the film that rang untrue. Finally got this off my chest since 1988!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie I saw today on AMC TV and I sat through it twice; that's how involved I got in it even though I'd seen it in 1988. Dustin Hoffman plays an autistic brother to Tom Cruise, and complications arise not only because of Tom's selfish desire to cash in on a trust fund their father left to his brother; but the trying times of listening to the trite words of Hoffman. On their trip around the country and playing in Vegas at cards (Hoffman has an uncanny brain for winning at cards), they become closer friends whereas they had not really known eachother. The story is supposedly a true one of how Tom comes to grips with the problems and let's Hoffman (Rain Man) go back to where he had lived before. This is a tearjerker and does have it's unusual funny moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand the screenplay to this movie was originally written with Randy and Dennis Quaid in mind. I would have liked to see the results. I don't know if it was the different acting styles or what, but I was never convinced that the Cruise and Hoffman were brothers. It might be presumptuous to put someone else in an Oscar-winning role, but I'm sure Randy (who I assume would have played Raymond) would be up to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most memorable ever. Tom Cruise is perfect playing the asshole yuppie taking advantage of his brother, Dustin Hoffman, Ray, who is autistic. This movie is both funny and heartbreaking at the same time. It's also amazing...the viewer learns so much about autism; like how autistic people are geniuses in many ways. It's truly a great movie...marking the days before Cruise starting doing crap like "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Mission Impossible" which I fell asleep in front of within the first 15 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where was Cruise's nomination?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not taking anything away from Dustin Hoffman, who delivered a remarkable performance in a remarkable film. However, at the risk of sounding discriminatory, I wholeheartedly believe that it is generally easier to play the role of a mentally challenged individual than it is to sell the performance of a "normal" person, with "typical", but more importantly, believable actions and emotions. (Try it yourself if you don't believe me.) However, Tom Cruise makes a difficult role look easy. His unnaturally natural performance, coupled with the fact that he starred opposite a living legend whose delivery was equally captivating, was probably the reason he was overlooked as a nominee for best supporting actor. (Here's where I'll go out on a limb and dare say Alec Baldwin is often a victim of this very phenomenon.) In a nutshell, Cruise's genuine behavior compliments Hoffman's character like a hand in glove.The film itself is magnificent in all regards, and is a must see for those of us who see Cruise for what he truly is: underrated, yet one of the finest film talents of this era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman's Performance steals the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this on DVD having seen it in the theatre in 1988 when it was released. It was not as riveting to me on a second viewing, however. Tom Cruise's performance, particularly, seems to fall far short of what I remember. I found his mannerisms sometimes quite irritating and his transformation into a rounded human being a little too sudden. There is much to this movie - the brothers reflect two sides of the same coin. Both autistic in their own way. Raymond, the part played by Hoffman, genuinely so and Charlie, the part played by Tom, an emotionally crippled luxury car salesman, unable to feel or see anything outside the next deal. Some of the scenes are memorable, Charlie teaching his brother to dance, Charlie accommodating his brother's rituals in their everyday life together on the road, Charlie's girlfriend kissing Raymond. Hoffman deserved his Oscar, not once does his performance fall below excellent. 8 out of 10. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastically realised and superbly acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman certainly deserved his oscar for his sympathetic portrayal of an autistic genius, it's such a different part to anything he has ever done before. Tom Cruise isn't so bad either! My only criticism is the girlfriend, I don't see what she adds to the overall impression to be honest, though I know that most films have a love interest. The director knew exactly what he wanted out of the script and the actors, and he obviously had not only the final impression on his mind, but also the audience. Alot of directors lose sight of that. But the praise has to go to Dustin. He is superb. His character makes the film, and his relationship with his brother. (Cruise) He pulls at the heartstrings, as well as drawing you in with his intriguing but highly believable personality. He is almost like an adult kid. I can see no flaw in Hoffman's performance. See this film for Dustin Hoffman's awe-inspiring acting if you can't see any other reason to do so. But what else can you ask for in a film, unless you're shallow-minded enough to want special-effects and heart-stopping action. The special effects are the way 'Rainman' has your constant attention, and the action is subtle and just as captivating. A film for anyone, even those with a heart of stone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was ever a joint Best-Actor Oscar then Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman would be likely candidates for their superb performances in Barry Levinson's superb drama. Cruise is on fire as the young egotistical car salesman whose $3 million inheritance falls to the autistic brother (Hoffmann) he never he had. The rest of the film develops into a first-rate road movie as Cruise attempts to claim what should be is but ends up becoming a better man in the process. Everything for a genuine masterpiece is there and is used to the full, the acting being the icing on top of the cake. Whilst there certainly is moving, subtle drama, there's plenty of laughs in seeing the highly-strung Cruise's greedy ambitions falling through before finally finding his heart. All in all, an absorbing, moving and undoubtedly wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably my family's #1 favorite film of all time, simply because it very realistically depicts high-functioning autism at its best and most frustrating. My son is very much like the main character, and he enjoys the movie, too. When we were viewing it for the first time in the theatre, we couldn't help but laugh out loud at the more familiar parts of it - much to the dismay of the "normal" people around us. I'm very glad "Rain Man" was made and was seen by so many people. It helped the general public understand high-functioning autism better. It's amazing to me that the same actor, Dustin Hoffman, could be so very convincing as both an autistic man and, in "Tootsie", as a woman. What a skillful actor that man is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances, but could have been edited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rain Man' is a story of characters on a quest to find identity and to come together in brotherly love. Cruise's character is afraid of commitment and bitter with his life and his father; he meets his autistic brother in a mental hospital in Ohio after being told that his father left nearly everything to him in his will. Cruise's character has every intention of taking all of this from his autistic brother, played by Hoffman. Hoffman's character ends up being kidnapped by Cruise, and the two embark on a journey from Ohio to California. Along the way, Cruise's character learns patience and other virtues while using Hoffman, then realises his potential. Both characters do learn something about themselves.The magic of this film takes place in the first hour to an hour and a half, and then it gets pretty dull and some of the sub-story seems as though it could have been edited out. This would have probably made a better and more coherent film. (For example, although the romance did portray a sense of what Cruise's character was like, the continued romantic sub-plot did little for the film.) This is not an excellent film, but it does have some good elements, including performance and story - although some of this could have been edited out to make a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Look at Cruise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The chemistry between Dustin Hoffmann and Tom Cruise go far in making "Rain Man" a winner. Both beautifully complement one another, and their mutual respect as actors enhances their fascinating two-character interaction.Focusing on Cruise a bit, his career work as leading man has always proved serviceable, and he's certainly played a wide variety of roles effectively. Thus, it was particularly interesting to see his interview on the tv series, "Inside Actors Studio." The actor really put some staunch Method proponents "in their place" by asserting that he doesn't tend to draw painful memories from the past, and rather uses his fertile imagination in engaging himself forever in the present, in the moment. What was amusing to me was that, although the moderator gently tried to curtail him from going too far along these anti-Method lines, Cruise persisted in detailing his own imaginative approach to roles, which includes writing out extensive histories of the character, that everything comes from the standpoint of character, and that he as actor seeks to imaginatively "become" that person.It was a refreshing moment on this skewed series. For like many "movements," Method proponents can ultimately get too "big for their britches." In trying to push their particular agenda and ideology (which admittedly has achieved extraordinary success) they might just discover they've become ingrown and fundamentalistic. In truth, there are a variety of ways to achieve success in the dubious and fickle field of acting (which remains a spurious profession) which pre-Strasberg history has proved. Thus, Mr. Cruise's comments effectively put into perspective what may be on the verge of becoming more artistic cultism than one of many technical approaches to the thespianism. Hats off to Mr. Cruise. May he continue to engage us with interesting performances, like that in "Rain Man. "</fullReview>

Hoffman himself is extreme and so concerned with presenting himself that he loses depth. Nonetheless, he tries harder than Tom.Overall, more idyllic than 'Vietnam', more mature than 'The Natural'.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Meet Charlie Babbitt, a yuppie car salesman in Los Angeles. His mother died when he was very young and he had an estranged father in Ohio who had just died, so Charlie and his girlfriend, Susanna, went to the funeral. At the reading of the will, Charlie's inheritance was his father's vintage 1949 Buick Roadmaster and his prize rose bushes, while his estate and $3,000,000 was placed in a trust. Charlie was furious. His father has stuck it to him all his life. Never treated him fairly. Charlie was determined to get to the bottom of this and find out who got the dough instead of him. His search takes him to Walbrook institute for the insane. Charlie learns that day he had a brother: Raymond, an autistic savant. Not quite crazy and not quite retarded. Raymond knew the Buick right off. Raymond was also the heir of the $3,000,000. Charlie was determined to get that money so he takes Raymond out of the institute and he, Raymond and Susanna spend the night in a hotel. Susanna leaves because she thinks Charlie is being unfair. At a breakfast cafe, Raymond get's upset because there's no maple syrup on the table before the pancakes are served and when he spills a box of toothpicks, he takes one look at them and counts them exactly. At the airport, Raymond was afraid to fly because of current airline accidents so they get in the car and drive to Los Angeles! They stop at a motel for the night and can't go out the next day because it's raining. Charlie was starting to lose it. He lost it even further the next day when Raymond refused to wear a pair of Charlie's underwear because he get's his boxers at K-Mart in Cincinnatti. There was more trouble to come: Raymond always watches The People's Court at 3 and they needed to find a TV quick! They watch it at a farmlady's house; that night at the motel, Raymond tells Charlie about childhood and why Raymond was sent to Walbrook: he accidentally burned him with hot water because when Charlie switched on the bathtub, Raymond freaked out. Before long, they enter Las Vegas. Charlie discovers Raymond's knack for counting cards so they go to a casino and win lot's of dough. Susanna comes back and dances wit Raymond in the elevator. They finally arrive in Los Angeles. Charlie tries to get custody of Raymond and he loses, so Raymond travels back to Walbrook but Charlie would be coming to see him soon. Great movie! Fabulous acting by Dustin Hoffman. This film got him an Academy Award! Tom Cruise was good too. I like the part where Charlie and Raymond are in the phone booth and Raymond farts. I also like the argument Ray and Charlie have about boxer shorts and when Raymond repeats "97-X. The future of rock'n roll!". This is a great film! I recommend it! Definitely recommend it!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I don't know whether I would have given "Rain Man" Best Picture for 1988. It was a good movie, but I don't think the best one from that year (I would give that distinction to "A World Apart"). The plot of course has yuppie Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) meeting his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and taking him on a trip across the country. Over the course of the movie, we see how Raymond's autism affects him and his surroundings, but also makes him able to do really hard math problems (granted, the numbers mean nothing to him).All in all, this is a pretty well done movie. Maybe not a masterpiece or anything, but worth seeing nonetheless as a look into a certain part of society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most inexplicably praised among a spate of late 80s/early 90s films and tv programs dealing with the plight of mentally retarded persons (others being "Kids Like These" and "Life Goes On"). Even worse is the film's driving force: Hollywood's assumption that society is as clueless and removed from reality as they are, so a movie must explain that having down syndrome or autism can be "difficult". Rain Man consists primarily of Dustin Hoffman whining and repeating irritating phrases, which nowadays qualifies one for automatic Oscar consideration. The trend only worsened in the late 90s, with Forrest Gump and Sling Blade. For those materialistic viewers not really moved by "'Tard Dramas", there are some Lamborghinis flying through the air, a grossly misplaced IKO IKO musical piece, and a scene in Las Vegas where Hoffman's character does what not even the most gifted autistic savant in real life can do. Ah the joys of fiction.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I thought this movie would be too hard for me to understand, but it really was not, I understood the whole plot, and the whole problem with Raymond. The reason might be because I myself posses a few of his bizarre features. The acting was incredible. Dustin Hoffman does a great performance as an autistic guy, with his way of talking and his facial expressions. Tom Cruise did a very brilliant job as well, and I think his part was also very important, because he is the guy who changes from rude and self-centered jerk to a guy who cares about the safety of his brother. This movie touched me in many ways, and it was brilliantly done. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when it came in the theatres and I loved it. It had been 14 years since I had seen it, and I had some birthday money, so I bought the DVD. I loved it as much as I did the first time. It was definitely worthy of its Best Picture Oscar.Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbock, a very self-centered man. He learns that his long estranged father has died, and is upset when the will is read. The money winds up going to Raymond Babbock (Dustin Hoffman), his much older brother who he never knew existed up to this point. Raymond is in an institution because he is a man with savant syndrome, a disorder on the autism spectrum. Charlie is upset because all the money went to Raymond, who does not know anything about money, or understand money's purpose or value.Charlie takes Raymond with him to try to bargain in order to get what he thinks is his rightful share of his dead father's money. He tries to take him on an airplane to L.A. but Raymond is terrified of airplanes, leaving them to get there by car - a three day journey.It is on this road trip that Charlie gets to know his brother very well. In this movie you see Charlie gradually transform from an impatient, selfish man, who treats Raymond like an object, rather than a person, to someone who grows to understand, and love Raymond. Anyone who thinks Tom Cruise can't act, needs to buy or rent this DVD and watch it over and over again. Watch for the gradual change in Charlie's heart.I gave this movie a ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No offense, but anyone who can possibly find anything bad to say about "Rain Man" either doesn't understand the movie, doesn't appreciate excellent acting or directing or screenplay writing, or simply needs to get a life. By the way, I am under 14, and I loved the story of Raymond and Charlie Babbitt.Like practically everyone else said, Dustin Hoffman soars. So does Tom Cruise--this was actually the first Cruise film I ever saw and didn't even like him at first because his character was so selfish and dependent. Now back to Hoffman. There wasn't a single moment where I didn't believe that he was autistic. I was on Raymond's side most of the time, but sometimes he got REALLY frustrating.One of the funniest things in this movie was that Raymond and Charlie were one of the most mismatched duos in screenwriting history. If everything wasn't exactly the way Charlie wanted it, he'd throw a fit. (Actually, that's one thing he and Raymond had in common!) He was the exact opposite of understanding. When Raymond started to gripe that something wasn't working out, IT DROVE CHARLIE NUTS! One of the ways they show this is when Charlie yells "SON OF A B***H!" out in the middle of nowhere.I also like the part when Susanna tells Raymond that just because the hooker didn't want to meet him didn't mean that there weren't any other women who would like him, and then she kisses him. Most men would go wild if that happened--Susanna was so attractive and smart--but Raymond hardly understood what was going on ("So how was that?" "Wet.").Another thing I appreciated about this film was that it didn't have a Hollywood ending; it was believable. But when it did end, I was sad because I wanted more! I suppose if you're the sensitive type, unlike me (or maybe I'm just too young), you should have a box of Kleenex handy, but at other times, the only crying you'll do is from laughing too much. Overall, "Rain Man" was a very touching and funny film, and I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rain Man was absolutley a tear jerker. And I mean that in a very good way because the film delt with certain issues and there were scenes where a person would just want to drop to the ground crying their eyes out. It was truly a wonderful film to watch.Car financer Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise) has just found out that his father Sanford has just died and has left some things behind. First, he has left Charlie a classic car, but what Charlie is unaware of is that Sanford has just inhereted $1 million to Charlie's autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) who has been held in a mental institution in Cincinatti, Ohio. Charlie travels to Ohio to meet his long lost brother and plans to get the money he feels he deserves. What happens is, Charlie kidnapps Raymond from the institution and they hit the road to Los Angeles. Charlie's plan is to keep Raymond until Charlie gets the $1 million. But along the way, Charlie turns from a greedy, selfish loser, into a caring person because he becomes close to Raymond and really develops a close bond with him. Their trip becomes the time of anyone's life.I must say that Dustin Hoffman delivered a real nice performance as Raymond and for sure deserved the Oscar that he won for the film. Tom Cruise did very well also.Rain Man is a movie for ages 14 and up and will teach you the beauty of having someone to look up to and love.</fullReview>

Tom Cruise is a selfish bachelor, to his poor luck, gets nothing big in the will. On the other hand, Dustin Hoffman, who plays an autistic man, gets all of the big part of the will. Cruise travels cross-country to try to help his brother... and himself.

Cruise finds out that his father has died so he heads to Cinncinnati and finds out that he has been treated out of 3 million dollars out of his father's will. It belongs to his brother played by Hoffman. As a result the two go on a cross country journey from Cinncinnati to Los Angeles and the results are funny, touching, and sad all at once.Hoffman and Cruise do a tremendous job in this movie that won four oscars!

		<shortDescription>All I wanted was a hug, Raymond ! ! !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last evening on the NBC Saturday night movie, a bowdlerized version of this "me-GENERATION" feel-good classic was televized over a three hour time slot. Granted that they wanted to make some ad revenue, the televising of this Barry Levinson "Best Picture" was over-padded with interruptions and gutted as far as its emotional outbursts and episodes of total panic/frustration. I find the line of dialogue used in my title to reflect the love-hate dichotomy at this film's beating heart: the Tom Cruise character pathetically utters it when his autistic/savant brother played by Dustin Hoffman screeches and protests the effort to hug him when the younger feels that they've reached some level of adequate "intimacy" and trust. This film lays a lot of guilt trips on people who just "don't get it:" the fact that incurable mental illness and disability just don't go away and receive "magic cure" love that wipes all the pain away. The Tom Cruise character kidnaps his brother and "pimps" him as a robotic cohort in illegal Vegas activities. In modern 1980's "me-generation" sensibilities that's OK because everybody deserves their "half" of the bargain. If the angry brother just gets a car and rosebushes then he can hold for ransom whoever he needs to in order to get $1.5 million. This entire "me-generation" logic recently brought us BANDITS who were really "nice" guys and CITIZEN Q where the disgruntled Dad (a Denzel Washington character) holds everyone hostage while his son gets a deserved heart transplant. I wonder why gun violence predominates in our politically correct-obsessed culture like 2002 America and people hold each other and the police at bay with means of violence so excessively. NBC, for shame on your utilization of such a powerful movie for the selfish end of commercial "milking." Go back to what you tried last summer with some sort of context-sharing for the major movie televising that you did with FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and CADDY SHACK! Movies are powerful and not just for audience commercial "flypaper."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about Rain Man? One word sums it up: brilliant!The acting is wonderful and the story is well thought out. Yes, Dustin Hoffman displays an excellent performance and thoroughly deserved his oscar for the role but I always feel that Tom Cruise(when is this amazing and versatile actor going to win an oscar???) does not receive enough recognition for his performance as Charlie Babbitt. Tom and Dustin make a great partnership, Dustin would not be as good without Tom and vice versa. I'd love for them to make another movie together some day as they have great chemistry (not sexual of course!!) All in all a touching story of a man who finds the brother he never knew he had (or did he- he knew 'Rain Man when he was young, but I won't spoil it for everyone???) and how he realises there's more to life than money.Excellent performances all round and some classic scenes and lines (The 'Raymond, did you fart?' bit, 'gotta buy underwear from Kaymart;what difference does it make where you buy underwear? UNDERWEAR IS UNDERWEAR scene' and 'Kaymart sucks!!!')You'll laugh and you'll cry but I guarantee you wont be disappointed with this gem of a film.Well worthy of 9 out of 10!!!!!</fullReview>

I am here to tell you that Hoffman's performance was incredibly powerful in its honesty. Most autistics, of course, are not savants, but he nailed that disconnection that imprisons them. I live with it every day, but Hoffman still knocked me out.The film was beautifully done. Not cheap tear-jerking. Just stripped down life (vegas aside). I also connected with the Cruise character's frustration in not being able to reach "the brother in there."Great film. Wish there were more like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film. (Inconsequential Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is more than just a twee, sappy, coping-with-illness melodrama. The scripting and acting make it a pleasure to watch time and time again. The characters are all recognisably human, and act realistically and with plausible motivation. The film refuses to sentimentalise - or make a martyr out of - any of its characters. It just concentrates on telling a story well, rightly assuming that this alone will be enough to provoke audience thought. As a result, it's not an 'issue' movie, it's a movie that anyone can enjoy, which just happens to have autism as one of its topics. Make no mistake, Charlie Babbitt is an emotionless [illegitimate child] at the film's opening, but Cruise's magnetic performance keeps the audience from becoming totally alienated. It may be true that Hoffman's performance can be put purely down to imitation, but boy is he convincing as Raymond Babbitt, Charlie's long-lost autistic older brother. I know, it sounds like the perfect recipe for standard Hollywood mushiness; but Barry Levinson's opus manages to sidestep that possible pitfall by virtue of being an amalgamation of several different film genres over the course of its running time. The film is always interesting to watch because the characters are so well drawn, and if you watch it for the first time, you never know where the narrative is going to take them. There are countless scenes that will probably be really pleasant surprises to new audience members, and that give Hoffman and Cruise a chance to flex their acting muscles. You could watch these guys reading out the phone book and still be entertained; and to prove a point, Hoffman does just that...  You can either watch it from an objective standpoint, or get sucked in to the centre of the lives of the two main leads. If you DO find yourself involved, you will be put through the emotional wringer. There are scenes to make you laugh, cry, angry and reflective; yet this happens organically, and is in no way the result of manipulation. The film is flawlessly cohesive from first scene to last. Near-perfect cinema, and a deserving winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1988; "Rain Man" is a triumph for all concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films of all time, as we watch the relationship between two completely different brothers evolve from a curiosity into a loving friendship.My personal opinion is that no-one has ever acted as well on screen as Dustin Hoffman does in this film. His portrayal of Raymond is ingenious, emotional, humourous,touching and above all believeable. He is mesmerising on screen as Raymond.I also believe this is Tom Cruise's finest performance. I am a big fan of Tom Cruise because he makes films I wish I was in ( Top Gun, Mission Impossible etc), but many people see him more as a "movie star" rather than an actor. However in this film the transformation his character goes through during the course of the film is very well handled and executed. There is definately a "lump in the throat moment at the end" to get even the hardest heart meltingA great film with great performances a must for anyone who has not seen this yet.</fullReview>

His father dies and leaves a will behind, except Charlie didn't get the $3 million in his father's will. It turns out that Charlie has a long lost brother name Raymond (Dustin Hoffman). But Raymond doesn't know how to use the money because he is autistic. So Charlie "kidnaps" Raymond from his institution, but then Charlier learns a whole new meaning about family. This movie was just absolutly great. Dustin Hoffman was great as was Tom Cruise. The movie doesn't get off track at all. It just sticks to the plot.

		<shortDescription>A novel view of autism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Rain Man' is, among other things, a touching look at the stark reality of those with autism, and the relatives who care for them. At the center of this tale of a money-crazed importer and a detached autistic savant on a weeklong trip through America, is the hidden struggle of thousands of families everywhere who, despite barriers in communication, develop meaningful relationships with their mentally challenged kin.The plot and storyline is cohesive and even. Although quite a long movie, the growing relationship between Cruise and Hoffman is developed so intricately and continuously that no scenes seem wasted or awkward. While some movies dealing with long cross-country car trips get bogged down in visual candy (views of the car driving into the sunset while uplifting music fades into the next motel scene), Director Barry Levinson has chiseled away at the classic genre, leaving only the most essential parts of the plot intact and sharp. The surprising intensity of this film comes from the starkness of the situation. Barry Marrow's script is free of unnecessary sub-plots or situations. Excess characters, such as Cruise's girlfriend, are used simply for plot and character development. This film's continuity mainly succeeds because of its simplicity, uncharacteristic of many of Levinson's other projects.The acting is nothing short of brilliant. Dustin Hoffman's Academy Award winning portrayal of a detached autistic man shines in its starkness and unadorned emotional appeal. Cruise's delivery is highly natural and human, thankfully drawing the audience's attention away from his often detrimental good-looks, and toward an identification with Charlie's emotional transformation. Although the script originally called for Ray to be friendly and outgoing, Hoffman pushed to make the character someone less tangible to the average audience; at odds with the sappy and overtly preachy portrayal of Corkey from the television show `30 Something.' Hoffman's performance of a `broken-record' autistic demeanor greatly intensifies the moments when Ray seems to break free of his emotionally catatonic state. In a way, the viewer also witnesses Charlie immerge from a cocoon of emotional frigidity that makes the connection between the brothers based on a striking emotional similarity as well as a unilateral feeling of acceptance. These moments are often marked by nothing more than an immaculately natural smile shared between them.As far as this film's portrayal of people with mental disorders, nothing but praise is prudent. Although Ray's disorder was mild compared to most residents of `homes,' the reality of the situation was not preached, nor was it understated. The audience is not forced to like Ray, but rather encouraged to identify with Charlie. This identification with the non-autistic brother makes audience acceptance of Ray only as fast as Charlie's growing relationship with him. Instead of making Ray infallible, the tensions caused by Charlie's lack of experience with the mentally autistic calls on the viewer to see Ray as Charlie sees him; at first strange, then on the brink of unbearable, and finally as a problematic, but exceptional human being.Marrow's script incorporates thematic elements to further develop the reality of autism. A good example of this is the lack of a tear-jerking end; no meaningful last lines dripping with contrived meaning, no breathtaking shots of the city, and no heartwarming surprises. Charlie doesn't deliver a silly protagonistic speech to defend his custody of Ray, but rather bickers defensively at the thought of losing someone so close to him. Ray doesn't thank Charlie for his hospitality and good-nature, but rather gets on a train with little more than a trivial comment about TV as a last comment to his only brother. This is not to say that car importers and people with autism cannot be warm. It does say that sometimes attachment, love, and acceptance need not be expressed in rational, vocal terms, but rather through a mutual unspoken understanding. Such a friendship, not requiring overt effort or consistent interpersonal communication on both sides, explains why employees and volunteers at centers for the mentally disabled often forge meaningful and caring relationships with residents who can do little more than smile or nod.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film for about the fifth time, I have to say that I'm disappointed that Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman never made another movie. Oh well. This film is a rare gem in the drama genre that seems to be lagging these days. It proves my theory that if you give the audiance a character who has a defiancy, they will immediately believe you eat up everything that you have to offer. But the Rain Man's autisim doesn't steel the show. It's simply the great screenplay set against the backdrop of the consumer-driven world and what it does to relationships, both new and old. The best scene in the film is when Charlie and Ray are in the bathroom at the Motel on their way to L.A. and Charlie is finding himself through his brother who cannot comprehend love. This film is not the best, but is certainly among them, and the best Barry Levinson film next to "Diner" and "The Natural".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was lent to me by a friend, who wanted me to see it as he thought it was very funny. I knew that it would be good as I had read reviews about it which praised the film, and I also knew that Dustin Hoffman is a terrific actor and had won an Academy Award for his performance. However, prior to watching the film I had a minor grudge towards it due to my awareness of films which had been compared with it in the past, namely Forrest Gump and Being There. Peter Sellers is one of my favourite actors and I was annoyed that his extraordinary performance in Being There had not been awarded an Academy Award, while Tom Hanks' and Dustin Hoffman's portrayals of so-called idiot savants had. But when I watched the film, this small complaint gradually became less of an issue, as Hoffman was absolutely terrific, and Tom Cruise proved that he could act well, although there were needlessly high amounts of bad language, which did detract from my enjoyment somewhat.The best part in the film is one that caused that rarest of emotions for me when watching a film - I actually cried at the incredibly moving penultimate scene. That moment at the end of the scene when the brothers are left alone was so powerful that I found myself fighting to hold back tears, and failing. It is one of the most touching cinematic moments I have witnessed, and the build-up to it is superbly done: I was not expecting it to carry such potence. Hoffman fully deserved his Oscar - he pulled off an outstanding performance.</fullReview>

Hoffman's acting is probably the best performance ever by any actor of any kind, right behind Anthony Perkins' fantastically generated Norman Bates. All regards to Mr. Hoffman, as he really made this film much, much more than "worthwhile". Tom Cruise is to be seen in his best performance to date as the greedy, self-centered Charlie Babbit, one in which you can actually see him enjoying playing his character. Barry Levinson's directing in of pure brilliance, and not a finger is out of place. The cinematography is also very well done, and the setting of the film is perfect.This could well be the greatest film drama ever to be seen, and the film deserves every piece of good critic that comes its way.If you ever want to rent a good film for a cold Sunday night, rent Rain Man!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rain Man" is a damn good movie. Dustin Hoffman can not do a better job as Raymond, the idiot savant. Tom Cruise is also very good as Charlie Babbitt. The Plot is awesome, and it teaches us a good lesson. A must for everyone who enjoys the lead characters and for everyone who knows what a good movie is made of .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Hoffman's winning act, film's confidence is in question.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RAIN MAN excels in Dustin Hoffman's winning character of an individual with autism who accepts the chance of living in the outside world. His role as "Raymond" is true for many others who have this type of condition inside. A couple of huge gaps sort of made me wonder about how this one really stood out with faith and redemption knocking on the door. They try desperately hard to show off a chunk of that human feeling, but it hardly exists. The real downside is Tom Cruise for his portrayal of a "hothead", even if everything falls down on him and his life. He doesn't seem to be treating his long lost brother very well, but he is funny at one incident where he shouts over buying undies at a Cleveland K-Mart. That does provide an example of living with simple adjustments for Hoffman, though. I also don't understand how Hoffman would become a human calculator of himself in solving some terribly complex math problems. That, of course, is another example for the film, as people have the ability to be smarter than others, but this sounds like another idea thrown into a Hollywood movie that sounds too impossible in reality, or even to achieve. Unfortunately, RAIN MAN is the least of my Best Picture movies. It serves itself greatly as a rewardingly entertaining purpose, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain Man is nothing spectacular. It is perhaps the most unworthy Best Picture winner since Ordinary People from 1980. The fact is, however, that 1988 did not deliver any good films. It was one of the worst years in cinema. Rain Man won the Best Picture Oscar because it's competition was even worse. Hoffman's performance are among the good points in this tragicomedy. I disliked Cruise (as the film intended) simply because his performance became exhausting and repetitive. 1988 is like 2000; no good films. And just like 1988, 2000 will give the Best Picture Oscar to an unworthy candidate, but only because there are no other good films to give it to.**1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting Showcase for Hoffman and Cruise 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rain Man works primarily because of the strong performances by Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. At the end of the day, the acting is all you really have with Rain Man. The story is very straight forward, which is fine for this type of film. Rain Man hasn't aged particularly well, which makes one wonder if the film truly deserved its Best Picture Oscar. Tom Cruise's stereotypical character has been seen in a thousand different films. The hard-nailed guy who only cares about money finally finds a person that opens his heart, and eventually makes him a better person. Although Rain Man is quite typical in its premise, the acting is outstanding. Dustin Hoffman won an Academy Award for his performance, and while it might seemed forced, it is actually quite accurate for an autistic. A good film, but has lost some of its impact over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Riveting Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rain Man" is a magnificent film with absolutely riveting performances from its two stars Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Hoffman plays Raymond an autistic adult who has been institutionalized since his youth. Cruise plays Charley a small time hustler who upon his father's death, finds out that unknown to him, he has a brother (Hoffman) that he knew nothing about. Hoffman reportedly researched his character by spending time with autistic patients, prior to the filming. The results are amazing. He has all of the mannerisms and habits of an autistic person down pat. You actually believe he is autistic he is so convincing. He richly deserved the Academy Award that he won for his performance. Cruise, because of his pretty boy image, is not given the credit that he is due as an actor. In "Rain Man", his character goes from a self-centered hustler, to one of compassion, love and understanding over the course of the movie. He complements Hoffman's performance perfectly. There is a touching scene in an elevator between Valerie Galino as Cruise' girlfriend and Hoffman where she gives him a kiss and he responds by saying innocently, that it was sloppy. Watch for Director Barry Levenson as a psychiatrist near the end of the film. "Rain Man" deservedly won the 1988 Academy Award for best picture is is a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruise acts, Hoffman mimics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been what you would call a big Cruise fan. He impressed me in Taps when he lived in barracks, showed potential when he lived up a tree in Legend, proved some of it in Top Gun when he lived on top of Kelly McGuiness and was superb in Mission Impossible when he lived on the run. But every now and again he proves he can act. He is at his best depicting self centred and unlovable characters, such as in The Fourth of July and The Firm (who could love a lawyer?), and then being able to get the audience to accept that he may have some redeeming features. But in Rain Man he excels. I know I'm going against the flow here but I thought Hoffman's display of Raymond was nothing more than mimicry, something that all actors should surely be able to do in their sleep. But Cruise showed real skill in eliciting empathy for the truly obnoxious Charlie who shared his brother's inability to relate to people, although in Raymond's case it was due to a medical condition while all Charlie could claim was an emotionally deprived childhood. To suggest that this is a feel good movie ignores the fact that for Raymond nothing has changed. He is unlikely ever to care, or even know, that his brother has taken an interest. Things are better for Charlie but only because he is no longer totally self centred. That said, any script which suggests that even the worst of us can change for the better should make us feel good. Hoffman tried and failed to dominate this film despite the fact that the only function for the character was as the catalyst for Cruise's self discovery. Charlie's transformation showed that we can all live in hope. A mention for Valeria Golino who performed her role to perfection and another for autism, a debilitating affliction for the victims and those who care for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See Rain Man but don't obsess over it. This movie isn't anything that is to be held in high regard. 1988 was a poor year for films so that's the only reason why it won Best Picture. The screenplay is good at first, then gets exhausting. Dustin Hoffman's performance is the same way. Actually, everything in this movie is that way. Hans Zimmer's score was a plus. Not too great but not bad either. Won four Oscars including Best Picture (1988), Best Director and Best Actor (Dustin Hoffman).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well acted. Well written. One of my favorites. A greedy young hustler (Tom Cruise) seeks to reunite with his brother played by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman's character is an idiot savant and has just inherited the bulk of their father's estate. Cruise takes Hoffman out of the asylum and back into the mainstream hoping to talk him out of his share of the inheritance.This drama does have some very, very funny moments provided by Hoffman. All is well that ends well. I have watched this over ten times and have not tired of it yet. Super movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic Best Picture Winner of 1988</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rain Man" is a good film which is carried by the Oscar-winning Dustin Hoffman who plays a middle-aged autistic man who inherits his father's riches, but does not really understand the concept of money. Enter younger brother Tom Cruise who takes Hoffman on a cross-country odyssey to try and get the bulk of his father's inheritance. The Oscar-winning screenplay is above average, but nothing spectacular. Barry Levinson's direction is nothing special either. Tom Cruise shines, but this is Hoffman's show. Overall a good film that happened to be made during a very weak year for movies. A film that is sure to become a curiosity. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of my favorite movies of all time. It features Dustin Hoffman in perhaps his best role ever as Raymond, an autistic savant. His brother Charlie (played well by Tom Cruise), who to this point was totally unaware of Raymond's existence (because the latter has been in an institution) until he learns that his father has left Raymond his inheritance, "kidnaps" Raymond to get his fair share of daddy's money. The result is a touching cross-country drive where both characters teach each other a little about life. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I think the acting was perfect, and the directing was crisp.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100% perfect portrayal of SAVANT SYNDROME, not autism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is superb, and Hoffmans portrayal of a man with Savant Syndrome is spot on. And people should bear in mind that the number of autistic people who also have savant syndrome is around 5%, so special skills such as Raymond's are extremely rare. As someone who has studied Autism and who has corresponded with Dr Darold Treffert MD, the worlds leading savant expert and consultant on the movie Rain Man, I wholly endorse this films portrayal of Savant syndrome itself, an autistic person forced into society against his will, and the way in which some people would seek to abuse the gifts of savants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, not representative of autism however.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good film. It is entertaining, and moving. There are things about the character Raymond that are very 'right on'. The drawback of the movie, is that society now seems to think every autistic person they meet is "like Rain Man". The anxiety, the need for repetitive behavior, yea that is a pretty good portrayal. Just remember though, in the end, it is just a movie and not every autistic person you meet is going to have phenomenal savant skills, or will 'learn' any social skills in a short period of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin Hoffman, one of the greatest actors of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very good!! There are funny parts and dramatic parts. Thething that makes Dustin Hoffman a good actor is that he becomes thecharacter he plays. He disappears into it. Unlike other actors, like TomHanks, whenever he plays a character he is always Tom Hanks. But withDustin Hoffman, he's always the character he plays. Like matching RainMan with Hook is very hard. It's hard to believe that Raymond becomesCaptain Hook. It's too hard to picture.  The thing about this movie is that Raymond is a character witha good memory and once he launches into a topic, like where he buysboxer shorts, his favorite radio station (97X), fear of flying, orsomething else, he never stops which is pretty funny (when Raymond keepsrepeating 97X and he and Tom Cruise argue about K-Mart). The thing isyou always laugh with Raymond and never at him. So Dustin Hoffman andTom Cruise are good together and Valeria Golino is very pretty! See thismovie if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that this film is on the top of list of anything, except maybe top wastes of good film stock. Cruise is his usual Yes I'm so beautiful I don't really have to act, self indulgent jerk. And, Golino, what the hell is she doing in this flick. She was overmatched in Hot Shots Part Deux, and is way out of her dramatic league here. I know, you're going to say but what about Hoffman? Hoffman did disappear into the role(as he usually does) but I found his character to be very shallow and one dimensional,even by austistic standards.I thought the kid in Mercury rising, to be a much more believable autistic(and I have worked with both autistic kids and adults).Also, most institutions that have autistic people, have much better security than the one in this movie.Plus, the Las Vegas scenes were totally unbelievable.If real people had just taken 70 thousand of some casinos money, they wouldn't have just been asked to leave the hotel.They would have been escorted to the bottom of lake Meade, complete with cement sneakers.There are a few somewhat touching scenes between Tom and Dustin, but far too few to waste time on this film.My opinion of this movie was summed up by Hoffman...Kmart sucks...Dustin, so does this movie.</fullReview>
