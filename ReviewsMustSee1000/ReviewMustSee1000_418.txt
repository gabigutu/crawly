		<shortDescription>The Final Chapter Falls Flat (Spoiler-Free Review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If it's Halloween, then it must be Saw" We've heard this tag line repeated over the years, and it's no surprise another Saw film has popped up into cinemas. There is, however, a catch to this installment: it's the final chapter. As a loyal fan of the series, I was excited last year with Saw VI and saw it as the perfect opportunity to end the series. Sure there were a few unanswered questions, but I didn't think it was worth another film to get the answers. Obviously, the producers disagreed with me and not only went for a seventh installment, but also gave into the latest 3D phenomena to cash in some bucks.Financially, the producers put themselves in a nice position. There were tons of movie-goers paying to see Saw 3D. As far as credibility goes, the producers threw it out the window. Saw 3D is, without a doubt, the worst installment in the series. It's bad?really bad?and I can't stress that enough. Not only does the film deliver a ridiculous plot, but it also fails visually, leaving movie goers with empty wallets and a short-coming 3D experience.Saw VII?excuse me, I mean Saw 3D?tells the story of Bobby Dagen, a Jigsaw survivor who makes profit from his grisly experience by writing books and televising interviews on television. He also acts as a counselor to surviving Jigsaw victims, guiding them towards psychological recovery. Life seems good for Bobby, until he is thrust into a horrific game where the goal is to save his wife before the timer hits zero. Meanwhile, Detective Hoffman hunts down Jill Tuck, seeking revenge over the events of the last film.There's a lot going on in Saw 3D, and you honestly never get bored with it. There are eleven traps (the highest in franchise history) and the Hoffman and Jill story line is presented on the side. The problem, however, is that we've seen this all before. We've seen someone go through a series of tests against a timer, we've seen gruesome traps, and we've seen the now predictable twists. Not only is the material in the film recycled, it's poorly made. The plot is ludicrous, the acting is horrible, the traps lack creativity, and the 3D looks cheap and isn't utilized at all (pretty disappointing considering it was shot with 3D cameras).Tobin Bell, whose character died in Saw III, is in the film for an estimated five minutes, possibly even less. Carey Elwes, who played the infamous Dr. Gordon in the original Saw is back this time around, but also has very limited screen time. It's a shame that a majority of the main characters are pushed to the side for Bobby Dagen's game, which in essence, turns out to be a waste of time. The traps are boring, the shock value has completely disappeared, and you ultimately don't feel for any of the characters in the film. All of these cons, along with the cheap 3D, make for a horrible film that shouldn't even bear the Saw title.It's even difficult putting the blame on some of the film makers. Director Kevin Greutert was forced to return since Lionsgate had a clause in his contract for another film. He was set to direct Paranormal Activity 2, but was pulled in to Toronto a week before the filming of Saw 3D. He attempted vigorous re-writing of the script, but it proved to be difficult since a majority of the sets were already built. Greutert tries his best to salvage the film, but it ultimately falls into pieces due to the production and incoherent story line. Producer Mark Burg and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan should be ashamed for giving into 3D and crazy fan theories online.Overall, the only positive thing about Saw 3D is that the franchise is finally over. It's run its course, and while I expected the film to be poor, I didn't expect it to come to this. After following the franchise for six long years, I honestly feel betrayed and cheated after the final twist. The Saw franchise started with an interesting concept and ran with it, but it fell flat on its face at the finish line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anticlimactic and rushed FINAL CHAPTER Made the last 6 MOvieS PointLESS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a huge letdown , publicity made me believe that this will be final piece of the puzzle which will connect all the previous movies, so i was at least expecting something more intelligent and a shocker twist of an ending, what we got instead seemed to be a rushed attempt to close all loopholes from the previous chapters.I followed this SAGA not just because of the gore but also the story which i thought would end in a very epic scale ,this final chapter just offered more gore and took the simplest and easiest way out of the story, It felt like wasting a 7 year long wait for a good ending and instead we get a mediocre and Pointless one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such bad writing, what a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK this movie was extremely disappointing. From the plot, do the characters, to the acting to the three 3D, it was one poorly written premise after the next.The first thing that was stupid...The opening trap...This one left me feeling the writers purposely set out to make it stupid and unbelievable. The scene opens with hundreds of people walking by the window with three people tied up (you only see two of them until the trap begins). The reason jigsaw puts them in the trap was just plain stupid (two guys manipulated by one girl), and must have taken 5 seconds to come up with...Also, does anyone honestly think in such a public place, no one would notice two people tied to construction equipment??? And then, the only attempt from the crowd to save them was one small women trying to bang the glass with a briefcase, obviously the glass wasn't going to break and so that was it, no more attempts...Really?? And not only that, but everyone was watching like it was some movie, taking pictures with their camera phone...I was literally laughing in the theater at how stupid it was...In the end, the only person who died was the girl, who frankly, out of the three, deserved it most, and you didn't care at all...Second thing that was stupid and totally not believable....Bobby's character or the main character...(Bobby was a guy who lied about surviving a jigsaw trap, so he could sell books and lead a publicized support group of real jigsaw survivors) This again made me feel like the writers just gave up and used the first idea that came to mind...Why was it not believable? Because if someone had gone through a jigsaw trap, there would have been a police report a thorough investigation, all sorts of documentation about what happened, where it happened, people involved, hospital reports about his injuries...So how he can write an entire book, get it published, do book signings, go on TV, lead a support group; without having any proof other than fake scars is BEYOND ME...Not only that, but the decision to make Bobby's trap about going through a house and trying to help out his colleagues is completely unoriginal...(SPOILER) After everything unfolded and everyone died, I was left feeling that writers didn't want to make anyone live because then they would have had to think harder about the plot...Besides the characters in the traps are so thin and meaningless to the other characters, you really don't care at all when they die because they contribute nothing to the story line anyway...Third thing that was stupid...Hoffman's character....His motive the entire movie was revenge on Jill tuck for putting him a trap...(Spoiler) His character for the entire movie was nothing more than a thug...He just walked around stabbing people in the neck until he got to Jill...I mean how freaking stupid is that? Again, I was left feeling the writers had no desire to put anymore thought into the movie and said "Screw it, I'm done thinking about this movie...Let's just make him stab people in the neck and be done with it.."Fourth thing that was stupid...Gibson's character...In the past, Hoffman saved this cop's life (told to the audience via flashback) but then brutally killed Gibson's attacker, Gibson reported him for excessive brutality and Hoffman held a grudge ever since...STUPID premise!! (Spoiler) The goose chase Hoffman puts them on was retarded and required no thought...He led them to a room and they all got shot by a sub machine gun.Fifth that was stupid...The ending and Doctor Gordon's character....(Total Spoiler) It was always rumored before Saw 7 came out that Doctor Gordon was still alive helping out jigsaw...So I was really excited to see how it would pan out...Man, what a disappointment...You see him once in the survivor support group for about 30 seconds and then doesn't show up until the last two or three minutes of the movie, where he attacks Hoffman....The writers decided that a thirty second flash back was all that was necessary to explain his involvement with Jigsaw, after that, he puts Hoffman in the room from the first movie (where Dr. Gordon originally hacked off his own leg) and shuts the door...You don't see him die! And the movie ends...(Spoiler) But wait, what happened to Bobby? Nothing, he goes through each trap, trying to save the lives of his colleagues, but fails them all...He finally gets to his wife in the last trap, fails at saving her, she is burned alive and the last time you see him on the screen is crying in front of the furnace that is burning his wife. Out of any character in the movie, I really wanted her to live because she did absolutely nothing wrong...So again, this movie was such a waste of time...The plot on ALL LEVELS felt rushed and meaningless, completely unoriginal and POORLY written....Perhaps I held it to a higher standard because the first one was BRILLIANT!!! and the others good, but it's really nothing more than a mindless slasher movie...In fact, the only thing I can say good about the movie is the traps are pretty cool...There are a lot of them, and they're creative...All that being said, I am glad I saw it... because at least now, I have NO DESIRE TO SEE ANOTHER SAW MOVIE...If they come out with Saw vs Freddy or Jason; I'm leaving the country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Saw Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could give this a rating of 0, I easily would. This was without a doubt the worst Saw film I have ever seen.I've been a fan of the Saw films since the start and while i think they should have ended it at the first, I've still managed to catch each one, each year, to see what kind of new ideas they have brought to the franchise.Unfortunately the ideas brought to this one were terrible.The trap in the opening scene was just ridiculous, a girl should die since she was been two-timing her boyfriend with some other guy. So they have a choice, the guys can kill each other or kill the girl. These are the kind of ideas that just require no thought or imagination whatsoever.Then, we are introduced to Bobby who was a survivor of a trap, yet we soon uncover that he was actually not in one of Jigsaws traps at all. He was merely trying to cash in on fame, by proclaiming he was one. Since the audience is introduced to this before Bobby must endure his test, we really don't feel anything for his character. As I was watching, I thought, I hope he fails and he is killed because it's awful to lie about that, simply to get yourself rich. But alas, he did not die! And at the end of it, I don't think he learned anything from his "game". Come to think of it, we never even see what happens to him. Instead we are brought to this.....Dr Gordon has returned! Wow what a surprise! Ugh, no not really. It was obvious that the producers were going to bring him back when realizing this would be the last Saw film and that they would want to make it as huge as possible. Unfortunately, the moment I saw him, I immediately knew how the movie would end with him being involved. How did I know? Because most fans wanted that. It seems that the writers didn't have any ideas so they thought they would browse the forums, jot down the whole "Gordon being involved theory" and end the film that way. While I have no issue with giving the fans what they want, that only appeals to some movies. It just didn't work for this movie. I don't like watching a movie and knowing how it will end. The whole point of Saw was to catch you by surprise with its ending but i was not surprised in the slightest bit. If anything, it just left it open for a future sequel.The acting in this film was also atrocious. The actor who played Gibson was awful, I laughed as he tried to pass himself off as serious. The other's were pretty much as average as always. Tobin Bell in my opinion is always the best actor in the Saw franchise. Was a shame we only saw him in 2 scenes though.Also as usual with these sequels, each one tries to outdo the last with it's level of blood and gore. This one was no exception. Except, this time, we have the opportunity to witness it in 3D. The 3D was pretty poor to be honest, was way too gimmicky and just involved chunks of bone and flesh fly at you. One thing that really bothered me was just how over-the-top the violence was. Particularly when Bobby is removing his teeth and blood is literally gushing out of his mouth like a waterfall. While most Saw films to this point have been over-the-top, this was just plain stupid.So to conclude, I did not enjoy this film at all and felt very disappointed once the credits rolled. For the final film, I expected it to be a huge surprise that would end the franchise on a high note. But it turned out to just be a lazily made film with a horrid ending. Hopefully this truly is the last Saw film because I will definitely not be going to see another after what they did to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better-expected end to a franchise with its hey-day far behind it; still never hits its best heights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can one attribute to another entry into the "Saw" franchise? Number 7 comes right on the heels of the 3D craze and purports to be its final chapter. So Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is still dead and but his legacy still goes on in flashbacks. And in a protégé, Hoffman (Costas Mandylor). And in his widow, Jill (Betsy Russell). The entire soap opera of Jigsaw's family and professional life carries a narrative that attempts to reconcile the final film with the beginning of the franchise, and it definitely does seem to have recapitulated rather well for both hardcore fans as well as fairweather ones. But it has to be said that the films have been on a downward spiral since its fantastic first installment. It delivers the gore in more elaborate ways than the past few films have -- considering how quickly they were rushed out -- but loses that sense of cleverness and more importantly, that sense of menace that the franchise has always attempted to retain.After the previous six films, the franchise does not so much look through the eye of the victims anymore as it does its villains who have an entire mythology unto themselves. And "Saw 3D" almost solely focuses on Hoffman, who it really has to be said, is a sad substitute for Jigsaw. He carries on his messiah's waning moralistic philosophy by continuing to find victims in need of a baptism by blood but finds himself hindered by Jill who is now cooperating with the police and giving them everything she knows to spite her husband's latest protégé. Add to this one Bobby Dagen (an actually funny Sean Patrick Flanery), who has written a best-selling book and sold DVDs about being a Jigsaw survivor and profiting from Hoffman's hallowed gift of life. Suffice to say, he (and his wife) quickly becomes the main plaything of this film's grand guignol torture play with 60 minutes set on the clock.Now, even with the requisite twists and better-than-expected inventiveness of its traps, "Saw 3D" does not deliver in the least with its titular promise -- it's 3D sets yet another low standard for the technology. If the onus on watching this film is to attempt a different perspective, then it never quite reaches the mark. But who are we really kidding here? It's just one more excuse to milk this cash cow. The franchise has truly run its course. If you watched and enjoyed all seven of its films, at least you can be proud of that. Right? Anyone?- www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there isn't much if anything left to add</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In keeping with the annual Halloween tradition, producers decided to bring audiences this allegedly final installment of the unsettling series, and apparently wanted to go out in style with what has fast become an overused technique in three-dimensional effects. The 'story' centers around a self-help author who purportedly survived the deceased Jigsaw's deadly game, and now tries to preach a message of strength to those around him. His newfound strength is put to the test however when he becomes the target of a new game, one which will also determine the fate of those close to him. Meanwhile, the cold-blooded Detective Hoffman tries to settle a score while evading the dogged pursuit of his fellow officers. After so many films, so many traps, so much relentless violence and gore, it would be pointless to complain about the film's content, but beyond a few startling 3-D moments, and despite a relatively short running time, the whole thing feels like a prolonged, protracted, and downright boring exercise in this tired genre. Tries to wrap things up nice and neatly in the end, yet still can't hide the fact that this series has long run out of steam, or that this project is clearly uninspired. *?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you like these movies? You should be OK with this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think you need to look at the Saw movies like this: they are Friday the 13th movies with more innovation and creativity, not to mention much more sick gore. Obviously, if you didn't like any Friday the 13th, Halloween, or Nightmare on Elm Street movie, you should stop reading now, because your mind has been made up. You will hate this movie.In fact, to be perfectly fair, even people who liked the earlier Saw movies will find plenty to carp about here. Saw 3D purports to be the end of the series (oh sure, but we did have several movies after Friday the 13th VII: The Final Chapter), and if it is, it ends on a fairly conclusive note. Then again, Jigsaw himself died early in the series, and that didn't stop further movies from being made, so take that for what it's worth.I can't review this without some plot points from previous Saw movies, so if you haven't watched any of them and plan to, stop reading. OK, still with me? Let's recap.Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is the bad guy, having served as Jigsaw's accomplice (blackmailed into it, really), and he has a new game afoot. But complicating matters is Jigsaw's widow, Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell), who knows of Hoffman's involvement. Jill brings Internal Affairs detective Gibson (Chad Donella) into the mix, so Hoffman's dual goals of running the new game and getting to Jill Tuck drive the plot.The game involves a man named Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery) who has profited mightily from having "survived" a Jigsaw trap; he's written a best-selling book and runs a support group and makes the talk-show rounds as well. But is Bobby on the up and up? Duh. As with all of Jigsaw's games, Bobby's games involve atoning for his own sins at the cost of some self sacrifice.The traps continue to be inventive, although some ? like the face trap ? make welcome returns. I was reminded briefly of an old episode of the radio serial The Shadow called "The House that Death Built," in which various traps (like a tripwire that triggered a double-barreled shotgun) were strewn about the house to keep people from finding treasure, or something. Bobby must go through several of these, much as victims had in earlier movies. And of course, by doing so he loses his pound or so of flesh, and secrets are revealed. Oh, and Carey Elwes, who played Dr. Gordon in the very first Saw movie, makes a return here ? not giving away anything there, of course. He shows up to mock Bobby for having a support group in the first place (something about profiting off misery).Even though it's pretty important to have watched at least some of the earlier films, Saw 3D does its best to keep you in the loop, reminding us of certain characters and plots of previous films. For example, the support group includes bona fide survivors, such as one who needed to cut off her own arm to save herself.But for me, the best part comes at the very end, when All Is Revealed. As the movie's denouement approaches and the bodies pile up, you begin to wonder if Hoffman will emerge victorious ? or if he's even the only bad guy out there. The ending answers both questions to some degree of satisfaction and helps to fill in missing information from the previous six movies as well. So on the one hand, the movie ends the series in a satisfying manner, and that's good.On the other hand, the door is left ever so slightly open for more and more Saw films. It's not impossible to believe. In fact, it's more plausible than the Friday the 13th "endings," because no matter how many times and in how many ways Jason was killed, he somehow came back to slaughter more virgins in the next movie. At least the Saw movies follow some sort of logic.For me, Saw 3D's 3D effects were well played indeed ? if you don't mind intestines flying at you, you'll appreciate them. Not so much if you don't. The plot is less convoluted and intricate than some of the most recent installments, and the movie doesn't waste time on character development. Heck, you hardly even see the now-long-dead Jigsaw. The movie flat-out worked for me from a visual and visceral standpoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome ending, but an otherwise forgettable and disappointing finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was not a perfect movie by any means, but Saw VI was the first Saw movie that really surprised me. Where the other films quickly became standard exercises in torture and brutality, it was the first film in the series that really made an attempt at building and elaborating the overarching storyline that had been developed over the entire series. Instead of merely hinting at things, we were getting full explanations, things began to make sense, and the movie on the whole was just a very satisfying and very enjoyable film. But much like its predecessors, it ended on a bit of a cliffhanger moment ? leading us directly into Saw VII, or as it is more sadly referred to, Saw 3D.After barely surviving a trap meant to murder him, Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is out for revenge on Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) ex-wife Jill (Betsy Russell). But Hoffman is not just out for her blood ? he has set-up a new game for Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a survivor of a Jigsaw trap and self-help guru.If that does not sound like much, it is because there is not much to Saw 3D. Outside of the long awaited (and unfortunately spoiled) return of Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes), there is nothing really notable about the film. Jigsaw, a character who must hold some sort of record for remaining the lead despite having died four movies ago, merely appears in an extended cameo. Jill was always a supporting player, but her screen time and presence has been drastically reduced even further. Hoffman's revenge ploy may drive the film, but he too barely appears. So much was tied up, answered and completed in Saw VI that this film feels merely like a film going through the motions to what should be the finale of the series.Instead of focusing on any of these characters for longer than a few seconds at the time, the film pays attention mostly to Flanery's character and a new detective, Gibson (Chad Donella). Both are described and developed in the quickest and most superfluous of ways (although there could have been a touch more explanation for the importance of Gibson to the storyline), and then help fill in the gaps on the way to the film's conclusion. Neither character or actor is strong enough to carry the movie, and having them help drag the film's running time out just made the film weaker at every interval. Worse yet, the script and story give no reason for the audience to invest any sort of feeling towards either character. Each Saw film hinged on one or an assortment of characters going through some form of game set up by Jigsaw or Hoffman, but there was a grand purpose in the end for why they go through that struggle. Here, the actions of these two characters seem inconsequential. You may hold out hope that there is some reason for their inclusion and participation in the grand finale, but in the end, there is nothing.The deaths are a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the film seems to have wisely amped up the victims "working together" motif for almost every trap scene in the film. It makes for a couple of interesting moments, but inevitably still ends with the requisite brutally gory deaths. And a few of the traps are interesting as well ? particularly one involving a love triangle, saws, and a public display. And for fans of the series, one notable death involving a rather specific "device" will undoubtedly give cheers, laughter and nausea all at once. But outside of these notable tidbits, the creativity, originality and even the morbid "fun" that come from these traps and deaths seems to have been sucked out of the film. Much like the storyline, it all felt like filler padded out to fill gaps. It was a disappointment to say the least after the go-for-broke style of Saw VI, and only shows that the filmmakers are really starting to show how exhausted their imaginations are in this once gloriously and creative realm. The much hyped 3D does almost nothing for these traps and death scenes either. It is an amusing addition at first, but after getting a character's innards thrown at you for the third time, it starts to get a bit old and silly.But for everything else that is done so wrong, and so haphazard, the filmmakers manage to concoct an incredibly satisfying and wild shock of an ending. On one hand, it is without any doubt, the standout sequence of Saw 3D. Remember the awesome twists this franchise was originally known for? This one takes the cake, and brings the film more in line with the original films than the later ones. The sheer surprise and audacity of it all is just too good, and feels like it belongs in a significantly better film. It practically cheats the audience into sitting through such a horribly disappointing film just so they can get to this one moment of sheer greatness. On the other hand, it stands as an awesome conclusion and finale to the entire franchise. If the ads are correct and this is indeed the final chapter of Saw, then this may just be one of the most enjoyable and entertaining endings ever created. It just may force you to rethink everything that has come before it.I hate to say it, but Saw 3D is the worst and most disappointing film in the franchise. It will leave a rotten taste in your mouth, and just feels rushed, disjointed and convoluted. Saw VI showed a renewed creative vigor that just failed to connect with this film. The ending is the film's only real redeeming moment, and nearly makes up for everything that precedes it. Let's just collectively hope a reboot does not ruin its greatness.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melton and Dunston - you have ruined the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Saw fan. I want to make this statement clear before I make the following rant about Saw 3D.What started off 7 years ago by Whannel and Wan has been ruined by the new writers. The world of Jigsaw has been diluted by the new writers to a very poor slasher film of utter nonsense.If the writer's ideas run thin they just make another victim an accomplice. Shame on you Melton and Dunton - lazy writing. No film after Saw 3 makes sense to the series, although Saw 6 is watch-able as a standalone film.Despite my average feelings for 4 and my detest of 5, there is such a wealth of characters and back story that could have been used to make the final Saw epic. Instead we have been introduced to more new characters and over elaborate traps. (Really who is building these things and how much money and time do they have? More secret hide outs etc). One of the traps is a pop up machine gun! For Christ sake what were the writers thinking! The script is so bad that characters are even dreaming about traps. I am embarrassed for you Melton and Dunston.The original Saw was simplistic in it's brilliance, but had the gore of a horror movie and the tension of a thriller. This is what made it great. Even Saw 2 (which is not my favourite) and Saw 3 (possibly my favourite)continued this tradition with clever but simple traps and involving stories that were character driven.Fans cared about what happened to the victims, we cared for the anti- hero Jigsaw and we sympathised with the accomplice Amanda - whilst being disgusted and questioning our own morals. Unfortunately since Saw 4 we no longer care about any of the new characters or the plot. We just have a body count as the writers think this is what horror film are about. Saw was more than this. And now given the chance to put some closure to the series you misused the chance to correct your earlier work and made it even worse by wasting the screen time of Tobin and Cary.I wish I stopped viewing at Saw 3 as the remainder of the series has cashed in on what would have been an excellent trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D: The Endgame with Mixed Feelings..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the surprise hit "Saw" in 2004, there's been a sequel each year. I'm a huge fan of horror movies, and I absolutely love the "Saw" Franchise. Each sequel was a worthy addition to the original story. I thought Part III and VI were the best sequels. Since the sixth one was amazing, it's hard to beat that one with the final seventh installment. This time, it is in 3D. Just to cash in on the 3D hype, because let's face it; it's pointless and adds nothing to the movie. You won't get bored with the story; the pace is on an all time high with a maximum of traps and gory deaths. There are some thrilling and exciting traps, but some have a very "seen it all before" feeling. Well, it's already part 7 and quite frankly, there's no need for another one after this. The story is not as surprising as the other ones; the ending does not have the ultimate 'wooow' factor and the actions of some characters are not completely rational (I'm not giving away the ending here..) Very limited screen time for Tobin Bell (Jigsaw\John Kramer) and Saw 3D sees the long awaited return of Dr. Lawrence Gordon from the original Saw: could have been better written. In a nutshell: "Saw 7\3D" is an entertaining sequel that unfortunately can't cope with most of the Saw movies. It just isn't as strong when it comes to surprising twists and jaw-dropping moments. The story and the interesting characters gave the "Saw" movies the success and status, not just gory deaths. And that is a little forgotten in this final installment. I love them all, but there's no need for Part VIII.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Kill a Franchise for Good (A Step-By-Step Guide)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For this review I am going to provide a guide as to how you can ensure that a franchise will never continue. But first the plot if you can call it a plot.Detective Hoffman is still alive. Jill's attempt to kill him backfired when he found a way out of his supposedly inescapable trap. Whilst Hoffman is out to kill Jill he has to contend with setting up another set of traps for the lying Bobby Dagen and his friends. If Bobby is to make it to the end and save his wife, he will have to push himself to the limit.Step 1: The plot. Ensure your plot is convoluted and does not make sense in the slightest. If you are worried that it does, then provide meaningless flashbacks. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Why change the format when it worked for Saw IV, V and VI. Just rinse and repeat.Step 2: The main character. Who wants motivation, plausibility and character development? The answer nobody! Ensure your character is as bland as humanely possible. The make him unlikable, arrogant and self-absorbed. If he possesses any humanity wipe it out immediately!Step 3: Jigsaw. The main villain is not Jigsaw anymore. To let your audience know this, have Tobin Bell dress as a gangster for one scene so that he can embarrass himself. Then watch the less interesting Hoffman blunder from scene to scene.Step 4: The script. Make sure your script consists of lines that would make Sylvester Stallone worried. Fill it with profanity and the screams of human beings. When you have ninety pages of Horror clichés, you are almost ready to begin.Step 5: The Acting. Ensure your actors are human and made of meat and bone; if they can scream louder than a toddler hire them forthwith.Step 6: The camera work. The reason these films make so much money is because of their budget. You spent it on the traps, so borrow the cheapest hand held camera you can find and film all scenes in one take.Step 7: The length. Make your film as short as possible, but feel ten times the length. Your audience will wonder how it lasted so long.Step 8: The traps. Have as many traps as you want; the more the better. Who will notice pink blood? A lack of invention and tension? Nitpickers, that's who. If your audience is not sick within the first five minutes then you have failed them as a Director.Step 9: Closure. Do not allow for closure. Provide questions with no answers. This will mean that if a sequel is green light then you can slowly divulge the answers in Saw M.Step 10: The Obligatory Twist Ending. If the climax does not leave you scratching your head then change it again. Have characters you thought dead return, just so that you can destroy the brains of the audience.If you follow all of these steps, you can guarantee the death of a franchise. Or for a few years at least until, it is re-made, re- envisioned, re-booted or all of the above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you've wanted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's what you expect. There is no shock factor. Die hard fans that know every little thing about the movie will see this ending coming. I think they should have taken more time to plan out the games and come up with a larger shock. It seemed forced but maybe my expectations were too high for what the final project should have been in my mind. The 3D factor was fun but it seemed that the movie was revolving around the 3D concept more than the story line. Finally it was way too short, it felt like they were already dragging out what they did have. I believe the writers were just in a hurry to tie up all the loose ends, but then again, many liked the "Final Chapter". I Love "Saw" and I always will but by far, this is the worst one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Horror Film of All-Time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the midst of all the 3D action, Saw producers thought this would be the best opportunity to cash in for the franchise. However, movie goers will all be disappointed (especially if you've seen the trailers) with this "state-of-the-art 3D" film.Saw VII revolves around Bobby Dagan, an apparent Jigsaw survivor. But, after about twenty minutes of pointless story, Bobby is put into a real trap and we as an audience find out he's nothing but a liar.Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) returns and surprise-surprise is also an accomplice to Jigsaw. He's responsible for all the happenings since he survived his trap in the original film. What's wrong with this picture? A doctor, devoted to saving lives, has decided to become a serial killer? So, what Saw does is take a cop and a doctor and turn them both evil. How imaginative! What sucks about this most of all, is this has been discussed for the last six years from the IMDb message boards and the House of Jigsaw forums. What the writers have done was just use these idiotic ideas.Besides the pointless 3D elements, Saw fails on all accounts because it destroys several characters, the overall timeline of Saw, and important plot elements about the Saw universe. It's annoying to have heard people say, "the guy who did surgery on Michael in Saw II was Dr. Gordon," then have to see that the writers put that in the final film.I was an avid fan of Saw up until the announcement of Dr. Gordon returning. It sounded so inane to say that he's been working behind the scenes the whole time. He's a doctor. He was screwed over, had to cut off his foot and lost his entire family in one night. But, he forgives Jigsaw and wants to help him kill other people. Makes sense? How stupid! If he was helping, why didn't he show up in any previous flashbacks? Where was he the last two years (Saw-Saw VII is at least a 2 year time difference)?? I thought Saw VII was a good final chapter up until Hoffman was halted by an unknown person in a pig mask, who was revealed to be Dr. Gordon and then the usual Saw flashback brought all the issues (unanswered) to light. I couldn't be more appalled by this film.Don't forget, this is quite possible the worst acted Saw film of all time. Minimal Tobin Bell screen time, without counting his Jigsaw voice on the tapes, and lesser-known actors trying to be established as prominent actors. Without substance in the story or any of the new characters, this Saw has no real plot line to follow or development to undergo.It will be dubbed "one of the worst horror films of all time" for me. I'm very displeased with the producers, writers, and actors. Basically everyone involved in this franchise is no longer someone I like anymore. This includes the fans who thought up the Gordon theories and actually managed to have the writers/producers think they were good ideas. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finale... finally!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The seventh and last installment lays down all its cards... or at least the rest of its cards. The series certainly went out with a bang to say the least. Fans and/or gorehounds will love it, and there's enough entertainment for some of those who aren't overly familiar with the series or forgot a thing or two in the previous six films. It is possibly the most appealing "Saw" film, knowing that it's ACTUALLY the finale. But where does that leave us with quality? For a ninety minute film with numerous returning characters and just as appealing brand new characters, not to mention the burden of trying to keep originality with a redundant back-story, "Saw 3D" does pretty good given the obstacles it's forced to work with. What most people will probably criticize is the lack of twists and turns that made us love the original so much... but lets be honest, has there even been any jaw dropping twists in the series since "Saw IV" or even as far back as "Saw II"? It's up for debate, but the story in the seventh installment is pretty straight forward and that may let some people down. Given that it's a seventh film in a series with impressive continuity, "Saw 3D" is actually a really great film for what it is.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>enough!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything has been leading to this. Or so you'd think. Let's be frank, if we've learn anything from our series of articles revisiting the Saw series over the last week, it's that the franchise is so wrapped up in retcons, flashbacks and time-bending shenanigans that you couldn't really be surprised if this one had turned out to take place in 2003, before even that very first film back in 2004.At the very least, I assure you that we're not looking at a prequel. This is very much a straight continuation from the end of Saw VI, and some time during the last year, we find Jigsaw's ex, Jill Tuck, has lost a considerable amount of bad ass points from having vengefully trapped Jigsaw's bungling successor, Hoffman, in a reverse bear trap. A year ago for us, moments ago for her, and yet, after witnessing Hoffman's escape, she rushes to the police for protection.Hoffman begins a reign of terror, taking games into broad daylight and into the heart of the already decimated police force, and he promises his old colleague, Detective Gibson, that the traps will continue until Jill is handed over to him. Ancillary to all of this, we meet self help entrepreneur Bobby Dagen, whose bestselling book about surviving one of Jigsaw's traps gets him caught up in another game. The final game, perhaps.A stalwart companion, who endured the Saw marathon along with me, came to see Saw 3D last night. Afterwards, he declared it the worst of the series, hands down. For him, this was the most disappointing and dissatisfying ending imaginable after all of the six films and all of the marketing hype around this being the series' conclusion.There's certainly a group of hardcore fans, who haunt places like the IMDb forums, and who will declare Saw VII to be the very best of the series and a fitting conclusion. However, I personally find it difficult to imagine this being anybody's favorite Saw film.It suffers from the same symptoms of the franchise fatigue that plagued the fourth and fifth installments. The story structure and the progression of the main game are disjointed and disaffecting, and aside from the opening sequence, the much anticipated public trap seen in the trailers, there's the same old lack of imagination.Most criminally, there's barely any John Kramer to be had. The series has only survived to this, its seventh installment, because death was not the end for Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. He's the very best thing about this series, and we had a partial return to form with Saw VI because the focus was back on his machinations from beyond the grave.Here, it's pretty much Hoffman's show, and with how much Costas Mandylor has previously paled in comparison with Bell, that's really bloody boring. More than that, it's a rip-off. Mandylor is reduced to a perpetual grimace as he chases poor Betsy Russell around. She deserved better than this too. Having bided her time as Jill for so many films, she's reduced to the stock scream queen role here, running away and hiding behind cabinets.Hell, most of the performances are wooden. What would a Saw film be without a little dramatic sawdust billowing around our B-movie players? In my revisit to Saw V, I gave Greg Bryk the dubious Honor of being The Worst Actor In Saw, and for his trouble, he makes a small cameo appearance here in a support group for other survivors of Jigsaw. However, he now gets the bronze as two other newcomers make late, but impressively awful turns.Firstly, there's Dean Armstrong as Cale. Not to give away what goes on with his character, but he gets a silver medal for some acting that had people in the screening I attended laughing out loud. The new worst actor In Saw, however, is Chad Donella as Gibson. Golly, he's bad. Not since Tommy Wiseau's cult classic, The Room, have you seen overacting this stilted, or this far removed from human behavior.On the plus side, I really have to praise Cary Elwes. It's been telegraphed by the filmmakers to all and sundry that he's back in this one, finally reprising the role of Dr. Lawrence Gordon to bookend the franchise. He serves almost as the Mount Doom of the series. With him, Saw was made, and only with him can it be unmade. And frankly, he's great in it, despite sounding decidedly closer to his native British accent than the last time he was Dr. Gordon.As to my friend's reaction, I can't really disagree, except to say that's it's nowhere near the worst of the series. I'd say it's the third worst overall, or to mark it positively, the fifth best. It is a disappointment, though, and a step backwards from the improvements we saw in Saw VI. The writers are just up to their old rubbish tricks, and director Kevin Greutert is on record saying he would rather have been directing Paranormal Activity 2 than another Saw sequel.With fledgling horror franchises ready to take its place in the form of Paranormal Activity or even Piranha, it goes without saying that Saw 3D should be the last gasp of a franchise that's been running on fumes for a while now. It suffers from the same problems as the worst of the sequels, but enough has been learn that it's more watchable than those earlier films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie that seems to fall short at times...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 3D is the last(7th) installment of the popular horror series. I'm going to get right into it, and be forewarned, there WILL BE SPOILERS!!!The plot: The plot evolves around a few stories, an Internal Affairs agent named Gibson looking to arrest Mark Hoffman, Jill Tuck looking for protection from Hoffman, an author named Bobby Deagan of a book called "survive" in which he details his survival of a jigsaw trap (SPOILER: he was never put in a trap...until this film, so don't rack your brain trying to figure out if he was in the last 6 films, he wasn't) Now, the plot was pretty decent, it wrapped up the series, plus there are huge twists, only problem, we have theorized on these twists years ago, and in most cases, we were right. One of the big surprises for me was seeing the DEMISE of Jill Tuck, I was legitimately surprised she was killed, but with saw no character is safe, not even the main ones. Everyone knows that Dr. Gordon has returned for this film, I won't say much on him, but I will say his screen time is limited, but the times he's on screen are great. Overall the plot held everything together, there were minor plot holes, but hey, what do you expect after 7 films. Acting: The acting was so-so. Tobin Bell was great as always, Hoffman was at his best and most menacing, Jill played her role nicely, Gibson was kind of lame to me. I don't know the actors name, but he comes off as more of a comedic actor than serious one at times and at times he kind of stood out for the wrong reasons.Overall: I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 for... +Hoffman being more menacing and bad-ass than ever +The return of Dr. Gordon (even if it felt a little "Yeah...we figured that") +The ending, for me anyways, was very well done. If you haven't seen the first one don't go see this one till you have. +Obviously made for the fans, if you haven't seen any of the films, watch them ALL first, the saw series was made to be a huge jigsaw puzzle with each film being a piece to that puzzle. The negatives, or, why I didn't give it a 10...-Gibsons acting and acting of those who were new to the film (excluding Linkin Park front man Chester Bennington, he surprised me. His part was short, but sweet.) fell short for me. Gibson felt more like a prick than a real protagonists.-The trap Hoffman left for Gibson was, without a doubt, the LAMEST trap in saw history, almost chuckled at this trap (I shouldn't chuckle during a horror movie when a trap in a saw movie is sprung)-Movie was shorter than I expected, about an 1hr and 30min. was hoping it be longer since it was wrapping up the series but it is what it is.-The obviously tacked on story of Bobby Deagan, this man fails all of his traps, all of them, his story was strictly for traps and gore alone, came off pretty shallow, but hey it's horror right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since James Wan left the director's chair following Saw III, the whole thing has been falling apart. With Saw 3D it finally hits rock bottom.On screen performance is just lame, including Jigsaw. The story is as shallow as it can probably get and the direction looks like a cheap B Grade flick.Its just not the worst of the SAW Series .. No .. its the worst of its genre. Its an appeal to the people behind the franchise : "please stop!" .. the audience has made their choice. Please don't bother us with any more sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst....Not a Saw Movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where to start. I have been a fan of the saw movies from the start. The first one was mind blowing. It was so entertaining due to the fact that it was a psychological thriller that kept you on your feet. They didn't push it with the gore, and it was a thoughtful, intense, thriller with an interesting idea. When Saw II came I knew it wasn't going to be as good, and it wasn't. It was more focused on blood and gore, and less focused on quality. Saw III was fine. It was pretty bloody, but the great story line leveled that out. The movies obviously deteriorated as the series continued, and the producers cared more about money, than quality. Saw IV, V, and VI did their jobs, but weren't as good as the first few. But Saw 3D. All I can say is wow. The story revolves around a self-help author who is thrust into a deadly game, and Hoffman's deadly chase to get to Jill Tuck. I couldn't feel more let down. First off, way too much was going on in this movie. It was entertaining, but not how a saw movie should entertain you. Second, it didn't feel like a saw movie. I felt like I was watching a crazy goose chase. Third, the acting. It was god awful. It was almost laughable. When Bobby tells one of his victims "Why couldn't you just shut the F*** up?" I just shook my head. Honestly, who would say that after watching someone you knew just get brutally murdered? Also, Gibson says, "crazier than a sack of cats." Who seriously talks like that? I think the writers settle on the first thing that pops into their mind. Another thing that made me mad was Bobby. How could he not save anyone? Please. Yet another thing was the traps. I feel like they ran out of ideas way too fast. They used the same metal spike in too traps! I was really angry to see Joyce die. She didn't do anything wrong at all! The thing that made me the most angry was the unanswered questions. 1) Why would Dr. Gordon help Jigsaw after he kidnapped his wife and child, and made Dr. Gordon cut his own foot off? Dr. Gordon seemed like the kind of guy who wanted Jigsaw dead after the events of the first film. Come on! 2)What happened to Dr. Gordon's family? And how did he escape and return to public without telling the police where he was. What did he tell everyone? 3)How did Bobby fake being in a Jigsaw trap. How could he just make that up? Wouldn't the police investigate the crime and ask Bobby where he was? There's no way he could of pulled that off in real life. Cops would just believe him and not have to see the trap site? Come on! 4)Jigsaw congratulated Dr. Gordon and said "You survived." Yes, Dr. Gordon did survive, but he did not pass his test. He was supposed to kill Adam before 6. Clearly he failed to do so and was too late. 5)Who were the other two pig-masked people with Dr. Gordon. More Jigsaw apprentices? Please! The end of the movie truly had nothing to do with the movie itself. Dr. Gordon really had nothing to do with the movie at all. He was there for less than 5 minutes. Him helping Jigsaw did not have to do with the movie. It didn't feel like Dr. Gordon. It was like he was a different person. Also the flash back scene with Jigsaw seemed silly. Jigsaw with a backwards baseball cap??? In general, you can think that these movies all 'fit' together, but truly everything is a big mess. The filmmakers try to make things fit together but so many things do not make sense. Its obviously clear that they make things up as they go. Too bad they can't at least make up something good. They say this series is over, but who knows. The series is dead, and at this point, no matter how many more movies they make, disappointment is a guarantee. RIP Saw series. You are dead but not buried. Tons of questions will be left unanswered. Its too bad it had to end like this, but that's how it is. If you are a Saw fan, you might as well see it, but be warned; this film is a huge let down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had nothing to offer. Just a bunch of sadistic scenes with the worst story line ever, made for people who just want to see some guts splattered all over the floor that being their highest level of understandable entertainment they could enjoy. The traps were so stupid and so easy to pass by a normal person that you needed an actor who could be very good to play such a stupid character. Each trap can be solved in how much time you need if you just don't listen to the stupid tape and the last scene you can just put your feet around the chain and pull yourself up. This movie is a waste of money, I want my money back! If you were expecting some clever genius killing people for a well established reason in his point of view, it's not here. If you want to see blood and body parts flying around and think it's such a hard thing to be done with today's equipment and only a misunderstood genius could think that blood and dead people is something that has a deeper meaning, go and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasons &amp; Facts why SAW3D is the worst movie in the series! + Explanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK i was really excited to see how the SAW writers will end this successful horror/mystery franchise. since I'm a huge fan of SAW, i followed every interview made with the cast of this movie before going to c the film, from the writers of this franchise(Patrick Melton-Marcus Dunstan)&amp; director Kevin Greutert to the main actors like Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Cary Elwes and Betsy Russell. i can sum up what they were trying to say(or actually some of them said) in every interview in few words: &gt;&gt;(SAW 3D WILL BE THE BEST MOVIE IN THE SERIES)&lt;&lt;!!!!OMGbesides the disappointment,SAW 3D is a proof that u can top the box office and gain more money by lying to people and fans under the name of "ADVERTISEMENT". Anywayz,i do not blame the MAIN actors/actresses for this BAD movie, i blame the DIRECTOR, the WRITERS and the CASTING DEPARTMENT.REASONS Y SAW 3D IS ONE OF THE WORST IN THE SERIES: +quick explanation for previous films:-in saw 1, the main game was the bathroom, the other game or story was Zipp's game with Gordon's family, in the final twist we c that Zipp is not the bad guy, but the man lying in bathroom floor(jigsaw) is the one.(GREAT TWIST)-in saw 2, the main game was in the house, the other game or story was Eric Matthew's game with jigsaw, Eric was looking for his son(Daniel), in the final twist we c that the game that was running in the house was not live, then we discover that Daniel is in a safe place(in the safe) all the time.(GREAT TWIST)-in saw 3, the main game was jigsaw's game with Dr Lynn, the other game or story was Jeff's game(Lynn's husband), in the final twist we c that jigsaw was playing the game with Amanda, not Lynn, Jeff entered the room and killed jigsaw(the only person who knows where his daughter is).(GREAT TWIST)-in saw 4, the main game was Rigg's game, the other game or story was Hoffman, Eric Mathew and ART's game, and Strahm investigating in jigsaw's case, in the final twist we c that the events of saw 4 is actually running at the same time with the events of saw 3, Hoffman is the new accomplice and locking Strahm in the room.(NOT BAD TWIST)-in saw 5, the main game was the fatal five, the other game or story was Strahm with Hoffman, Strahm is the only man knew about Hoffman and was following him, in the final twist Strahm met Hoffman in a crashing room, pushed him in a glass box ,but we discover that this glass box is actually the only way to escape the crashing room, so Strahm dies.(BAD TWIST AND THE FATAL FIVE GAME IS NOT MUCH RELATED TO STRAHM-Hoffman GAME) bad movie for critics and fans, and got the lowest SAW movie rating.-in saw 6, the main game was William's game, the movie let us think that TARA &amp; BRENT are William's family. the other game or story was Hoffman with Erickson, Perez and Jill. in the final twist we c that Tara and Brent aren't William's family, they are wife and son of a guy that died because of William's bad health insurance policies decisions. Jill put Hoffman in a trap but he escaped from it.(GOOD TWIST,GOOD PLOT AND IT WAS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT FROM SAW 5)NOW HERE COMES SAW 3D: -in saw 3d, huge side of the plot was talking about Bobby (he is a new character to the franchise) he has the main game in this movie, but we c bobby with jigsaw in a flashback only in ONE SCENE. WT*!.. in saw 6 William was a new character, he has the main game, huge part of the plot was talking about him and we c him with jigsaw in A lot of flashbacks scenes. but unfortunately that didn't happen for bobby and jigsaw in SAW 3D. on the other side of the film, we have Hoffman(superman) VS EVERYONE!! how could one person do what Hoffman did in saw 3d all by himself!!!-the actor that played Gibson was really bad, we laughed on his acting at some moments. his role was unnecessary. the writers just needed new detective and police officer, so they just brought this guy(Gibson) and gave him few lines and also put him in a pointless flashback with Hoffman.-Dr Gordon returns for saw 3d!! WOW, i cant believe. well, now i hope that he didn't return. bringing him back ruined the series. they showed us how Gordon used the hot pipe to stop the bleeding, then jigsaw came and told him u r my personal favorite and he became jigsaw's accomplice, WOOOWW, HUGE SURPRISE!! we don't want to c how Gordon have stopped the bleeding, WE WANT TO C HOW GORDON LIVED HIS NORMAL LIFE AND HOW HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLICE. the writers couldn't find any way to explain this to the audience, and couldn't find any way to fit this with the plot, so they decided to just show us what happened to him after he crawled in the hallway and then he become the accomplice.-3D is pointless and cheap.-Everything in the movie looked so FAKE and BAD, the dead bodies, the blood and the acting in some moments.-the writers have used fans theories to end this series, Dr Gordon is being an accomplice is one of them, this series depends on twists, so what is the point of using fans theories for the twists???? where is the twist in this film???-they focused on goriness rather than focusing on twists, no twists in this movie.-the movie was rush. 11 traps in one movie with bad plot.-the movie didn't add anything for the series, and it didn't answer all of the questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel slapped in the face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to have seen this movie yesterday, and I went in with high expectations thinking that Kevin Greutert was behind the camera again. But I was sadly disappointed. Saw 3D was a jumbled mess. Only towards the end did it really pay off. And even then, there were STILL things I didn't like. Such as: Dr. Gordon. Why oh why was he in on it the entire time? That is almost bad enough to nearly ruin parts of the first one for me. I mean really? The writers couldn't have come up with an ending that will satisfy all Saw fans, and not just the Gordonites? Seriously! He saws his foot off in desperation to save his family, he cauterizes his wound, he is taken in by John, who heals his wound, then Gordon just decides to side with him? WHAT?! And the worst part is, they don't even shed some light on that. All they do, is show John take him in, heal his wound, then show him doing all of the things a doctor would need to do for the traps, such as the key behind Michael's eye in Saw II, the stitches put on Trevor and Art in Saw IV, and I think that's it. I HATED that. And there was a scene where Dr. Gordon goes up to John and shows Lynn Denlon from Saw III and states that "she'll be perfect." UGH. And if you haven't guessed by now, the package that Jill drops off at the hospital was for Dr. Gordon. Other problems I had with Saw 3D: the acting, the effects, the characters, the unanswered questions, the fact that Cary Elwes and Tobin Bell were BARELY IN THE MOVIE, and the no montage at the end. I could go on, but I seriously would come off as a hater, which I'm not. The ending, on the other hand, was great. It's something that we've ALL expected and wanted for a very long time. It shouldn't disappoint anyone. Predictable or not, we've ALL wanted it to happen. So don't complain that it was predictable. I have an extremely hard time accepting this as a part of the Saw series, just because of the pure fact that no Saw movie is BAD, except for this one. There are also so many more reasons, but I don't want to continue. Saw 3D is easily the worst Saw. Anyone who disagrees with that is either new to the series, or is a Gordonite. I mean, everyone has their own opinion, but I mean come on. I am extremely disappointed. This was just a big slap to the face for all hardcore Saw fans. And I don't blame Kevin Greutert. I blame the writers and the producers for this. Saw 3D was a mess, but I'm sure Saw VII would have been a good movie.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A top notch ending to the franchise (warning contains spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday me and my friends decided to have a Saw marathon, we watched saw 1 up to 6 then went to see the new and apparently last instalment aw 3D at the cinema. I went with incredibly high expectations, and in some ways was not disappointed, however there were a few things i was not overly keen on. (spoilers be warned) The negatives - 1. I expected the final game in the saw franchise to focus on someone rather more related to the saw franchise itself. Bobby's character not being known of or mentioned in any previous films ruined it a bit for me, plus the fact i saw him as a completely unlikable character didn't help. In the previous games there was usually a character that i wanted to prevail and survive (Gorden from Saw, Jeff from Saw 3 for example) but this guy didn't do it for me. 2. I so wanted Hoffman to survive (he is my favourite character) and although he isn't shown pyhsically dying in the film, the end clearly shows he has no way of escape. 3.3D! In many cases 3D films can be incredible, just look at avatar for example, however i feel that this was only 3D for the sake of making it 3d, it added nothing to the story and ultimately would have been just as good in 2D. This may just be me but i also thought that the 3D element of the film made it almost too shiny and polished. Saw in 3D just felt too gimmicky when the main focus should have been the fact that it was the last film in the series! The Positives - 1. The traps were pretty fantastic. They were far more imaginative than i expected. I thought Chester Bennington's car trap scene was brutal whilst being clear it was cleverly thought out. I wont go into every trap in detail as it would take too long but there are certainly some imaginative ones in there. 2. Despite Hoffman's demise at the end, he played the bad ass antagonist perfectly. The fact that he chose the old school reverse bear trap on Jill was perfect and throughout the film he remained ruthless. Even at the end when he was chained up, he went straight for the saw, in my eyes again proving he would do anything to survive. 3. The acting, i've heard from a few people that the acting was below par, i on the other hand did not find this to be the case. I thought every character played their role well. 4. The ending, despite predictable to some, was straight up epic. Lawrence Gorden's story was revealed and him ending it with the famous line "Game over!" gave me chills. Overall - In my opinion not one of the Saw films has surpassed the original, due to its pure originality and legitimately shocking twist. Saw 3D didn't have an incredible story, it had a slightly predictable twist but the bottom line is it wrapped the franchise up, answering (most) questions and was a fun film along the way. If you have seen the others and enjoyed them then you can't afford to miss this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible movie, through and through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to others who have reviewed this movie, I am only a "casual" fan. Nevertheless, I was pretty invested in the serial storyline that had developed. Certainly, the first three were superior, and they clearly did not contemplate the second trilogy that came about. The second trilogy suffered from poor direction (Saw IV) and copious retcons (Saw V). Despite these drawbacks, the second trilogy of Saw IV - VI were quite superior to the end of this series: Saw 3D.The title of this film alone portends a terrible final film, because it is a film more concerned about cashing in on the 3D fad at the expense of the strong storytelling that came before. Gone are the various subplots and supporting characters that would become primary in sequels; gone are the traps that mean something to the characters that endure them; and gone is any class that withstood the stereotypical "sequelitis" for which the horror genre became known.The FBI, prominent since Saw IV, has disappeared, as has Fisk, Hoffman's right-hand man. Likewise, Pamela Jenkins, a character after the truth in Saw V and VI, disappears without a word.And Jill Tuck, who promised to be a worthy adversary to Hoffman in order to do "battle" over Jigsaw's legacy, becomes Saw's equivalent to the horror genre's Final Girl. There was no semblance of battle. Instead, Jill, who was previously represented as a strong character, runs scared to the police, Gibson specifically. Saw 3D attempts to give purpose to Gibson's presence, but entirely fails. Fisk, or an FBI agent, would have been better suited to his position in the film.And then there's Bobby Daegen. Little needs to be said. The character, and the supporting characters that he attempts to save, are entirely pointless. None of them add anything to the series. Worse, they add nothing to the film, except running time and body count.Despite my general desire to purchase the DVD or BD in order to complete the series, I just cannot bring myself to buy it. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an emotionally hollow exercise in splatter that exists purely to titillate people creepily excited by exploding flesh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the final chapter of the Saw series Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) manages to escape the clutches of Jigsaw's wife Jill (Betsy Russell) and turn the tables on her. She runs to the police, including a detective named Gibson (Chad Donella), asking them for immunity and protection. Meanwhile, Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery) is promoting his new book about how he supposedly managed to escape Jigsaw and how it turned his life around. To punish him for this lie, Hoffman captures him and puts him through a series of deadly tests and traps. He sends messages to the police saying that if they hand over Jill the bloodshed will stop. Bobby must free several people he recognises in order to save his partner. The Saw franchise has finally made the leap into 3D technology but it proves to be an irredeemable tumble with this nasty, mean-spirited and clumsy finale. The series has always been notoriously violent and nasty, but at least the very first film contained its aggression in a gritty texture that was true to its modest budget. Saw 3D, which makes very little use of any 3D effects at all, feels like it was made from leftover footage from the previous entry. If you have not seen the sixth instalment, as I haven't, be prepared to be left in the dark as there is no exposition as to who any of the players are here. That said, the plot is minimal and characters are expendable as they are either tasked with explaining plot points or simply screaming. The casting is unbelievable dreary, particular when Jigsaw himself only has a single scene in the whole film and because the other actors have no presence on screen at all. What makes this almost unwatchable though is how morally bankrupt this instalment is. Saw 3D is deservedly rated R as it disturbingly aims many of its absurd traps at women. In the opening scene, entirely superfluous to the plot, two young men are trapped in a glass box with a girl who has cheated on both of them. They can choose to kill each other or to murder her. They choose to cut her in half with a blade saw and that is just the start of the misogyny. Women here are cut up, crushed, beaten to a pulp, torn open with a fishing hook and burnt alive in the film. Is this a new way for director Kevin Greutert to pander towards teenage boys or does he have some deeper issues? The violence here moves from comically fake, you can recognise the fake pink blood and artificial intestines, to just outright offensive as a woman's face explodes in front of the camera. The original had some admittedly transparent moral questions attached to the violence. This is an emotionally hollow exercise in splatter that exists purely to titillate people creepily excited by exploding flesh. As a horror film it makes you not want to be there for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Disappointing As a Blind Date Gone Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a devoted Saw fan since the beginning. I've watched every Saw movie at least 10 times and like so many other fans, I've enjoyed the majority of them. Saw V was as bad as it gets, but Saw VI was excellent; leading to high anticipation of Saw 3D. Overall, it was a disappointment.I must say that in general, 3D movies are very cool. Unfortunately, Saw 3D really didn't take advantage. Seriously, I can't remember any good 3D effects; and believe me, I was waiting for it; I'm still waiting; can't believe I was left hanging like that.From the beginning, the movie was a joke; seriously. You will find the first scene to be laughable. Unlike past movies from the series, which did a good job linking all the trap scenes, the first few traps of Saw 3D had no relation or connection to the storyline / plot. Saw 3D promotes murder and revenge rather than redemption and survival.Overview: The story was boring. The gore was extremely intense, but only marginally innovative or original. Too predictable for my liking as all the supposed twists were easily guessed years ago.------------- Start of Spoiler Section ------------- 1. The first trap scene was humorous, but so unbelievably pointless. Does a girl really have to die because she was unfaithful to 2 guys? 2. Jill Tuck was so cool and collected throughout the first 6 Saw movies. I couldn't believe how she was running scared during Saw 3D. It was just so out of character for her and depreciates everything she stood for in the previous movies. And then she dies; but how does that make for good entertainment when she was the closest thing we had to Jigsaw.3. Speaking of Jigsaw; where was he? We only saw him a couple of times in the movie and that's it. The movie was dominated by some very mediocre actors.4. So many people who reviewed previous Saw movies predicted Dr. Gordon's involvement. It's been all over YouTube and other forums for years. You'd think the writers would be smart enough to adapt. I guess not.5. Why are we left with so many questions? Who were the 2 accomplices helping out Dr. Gordon at the end? Why was Hoffman left alive at the end? Who the hell is Bobby Dagen and what makes him so significant that he must be the focus of the very last Saw? By the way, he was left alive too? 6. But the most disturbing point isn't the fact that Dr. Gordon's involvement was predictable. It's the fact that it was never explained as to why. Why does Dr. Gordon decide to work with Jigsaw? Remember, the motivation for Dr. Gordon to escape (by cutting off his foot) was to get home to his wife and kid. What happened to that? Why is there no explanation as to what happened to his family? Did they ever reunite? I wanted to see a good scene (like the scene where Jigsaw convinced Hoffman to join his team). Did Dr. Gordon fight to ensure his family was well kept? 7. The first 4 movies would lead you to think that the time-line between each was days / weeks rather than months or years. But at the end of Saw 3D, when Jigsaw was announcing Dr. Gordon as his best accomplice, he says that Dr. Gordon has helped him through his best traps for years. Could this type of serial homicide realistically go on for years without the authorities finally putting things together? ------------- End of Spoiler Section------------- Is it worth the money? I'd say yes if you are a true Saw fan. This isn't something you'd want to miss; simply because it could be the very last one and once again; 3D movies are very cool. Just know that you will leave with the same feeling you had after watching Saw V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this a 10/10 mainly for the fact that they really had no idea where to go with the series (in my opinion) and basically said "Forget it, we're making this satirical." I am an avid fan of the Saw franchise because I love the story and all the plot twists in the films. Now granted so many don't like all of them where as I love them all. I am a year late in that I had purchased it and just finally watched it tonight and I had to get up and leave because I couldn't sit through it. When I got back after eating dinner and picked up where I was it hit me that it is a joke and they only made it to basically make fun of it.*Spoilers* The acting is horrible. Until I realized it was all a joke.There is a trap in the beginning of people stuck in a large glass box. 2 guys and a girl. The 2 guys are stuck on either side with saw blades and the girl suspended in midair above a 3rd blade. At 1st I thought it was a company that was trying to promote something by imitating and making fun of jigsaw, how could I not for the fact that they were only in it because the girl was dating both guys and using them. Long story short, it was outside where thousands of people could see them and realize something horrible was happening. That is not how Saw works.Next the girl who would basically talk and had to keep quiet otherwise the spikes would pierce her neck. Now Bobby was constantly telling her to keep quiet while he tried to do stuff and obviously a hook in your throat with a key wouldn't really be that easy to keep quiet about.Jill and Hoffmans acting was atrocious in the sense that its not serious, but which also added to the overall satire of the movie. And when the Internal Affairs guy got shot by a mounted turret in a corner of a room I couldn't help but laugh. Hoffman sneaks into the Internal Affairs through a body bag and proceeds to kill every cop in their by stabbing them in the throat. He then kills the cop overlooking Jill by shooting him in the eye and proceeds to attack Jill. She runs and cowers and I couldn't help but laugh so hard. He finally gets her stuck in a chair and proceeds to put the reverse bear trap on her. Now with this again I am laughing so hard as she fails and dies. Its just a humorous way in ending a series.And Dr. Gordon coming back, and figuring out what part he has played in all the films was just what I expected and still laughed and enjoyed it.*End Spoilers*If you go into this film expecting it to be serious like the other movies (like I did) you will be greatly disappointed. It was only after I watched more of it that I realized it was a satire and that they were just making fun of the series in general. I, personally, was able to get past the "horribleness" of it and actually enjoy it for what it was, a joke.Is it how I really wanted the series to end? No. But I definitely enjoyed it. Obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I am sure others will either agree or disagree with me and have their own opinions of it and I respect that. I just wanted to post about it because this is how I truly feel about it and can say that I definitely enjoyed how it ended the series.Tobin Bell and Cary Elwes are amazing and I definitely enjoy their acting in basically everything they work in.tl;drThis movie is a satire and not serious at all. Enjoy it for what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word sums up this movie - "Sigh..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it's Halloween again, and here comes the supposed final Saw movie. I've reviewed the last 2 movies on here and if you read my review on Saw 6, you'll see I was pleasantly surprised by how much of an improvement it was over Saw 5. So since I had the day off I scuttled off to the local cinema to catch the midday premiere to see if the latest offering to the series was a worthy finale... As my title to the review indicates - I walked out of the cinema with a hefty sigh... I'm not sure what I was expecting but it was something more then what this movie is. It felt like Saw 4 and Saw 5... Just pointless traps with no real connection or linkage to the overall Saw story. If you have the choice between seeing it in 3D or not.. Don't see it in 3D... There's maybe like 3 or 4 scenes in which someone throws an object towards the screen or an explosion goes off... It's unnecessary and it feels very forced. The Traps in this one are downright boring. Maybe it's because it's been done before so many times.. But every trap just felt like a rehash of an old trap. The "main" game sees the main protagonist Bobby goes along a similar trial to that of Jeffs (from Saw 3) in which he has to save people in each trap in time before the trap kills them. The story... I read up on the movie before hand and the writers apparently meshed the stories of Saw 7 and Saw 8 together so this was supposed to be a story filled movie that ties up all the loose questions and ends (it was also supposed to run longer then the average movie - 90 minutes long isn't what I'd call a long movie) from the previous ones. *****this is my major spoiler part, you've been warned*********** - The story in this one is just rubbish.. It just continues on from SAW 6 with Hoffman breaking free.. and he spends the movie trying to get Jill to finish her off. This seems to go against the entire point of "Jigsaws" ideals and is just Hoffman out seeking revenge. The two so called "twists" are pathetic - The first one being Hoffman being one of the bodies that gets taken into the morgue &lt;- When I saw the body being carted in I was thought to myself - Come on.. Surely that's not going to be it... And the second twist... I'm pretty sure every "Saw" fan called about 5 or 6 Saws ago.. If you look at my review for Saw 5 I even called it back then (Dr Gordan being the 3rd and REAL accomplise to Jigsaw)... What really annoys me.. is that they've said this is definitely the last Saw movie and they would tie up every loose end.. BUT.. the ending leaves a few things open - Like who the other two pig heads were that jump Hoffman.. And Hoffman actually still being left alive. ****************** End Spoiler***************************All in all I left this movie feeling deflated. This is probably the 2nd worst Saw Movie in line with number 2 and 5. If this is actually the final curtain for the series.. what a lame note to go out on.. trying to squeeze the 3D train for a couple of bucks. God knows how the writers let this slip so far. I know every Saw fan will see this regardless, because I would'nt have let a review stop me and if they release Saw 8 (which I'm betting is riding on how much $ this one makes) then I'll definitely see it... I just hope they actually make a finale worthy of sending off the Saw franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak consolidation of a doomed franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I imagine after viewing the final instalment, SAW fans everywhere were writhing in disappointment and anger with the poor final showdown. I was no different. In my opinion, the franchise should have finished at SAW III. The empathy I had for Amanda's character meant that when she died, I felt that the franchise was missing a poignant female character. What with being a hugely male dominated franchise, without her, it didn't seem to fit or be as frightening, never mind believable.The last film exposed Detective Mark Hoffman as Jigsaw's second (and believed final) accomplice. Hoffman's eerie performance is adequately maintained, but he offers nothing new to the role and in all honesty; you are bored of him. Unlike Amanda or Jigsaw, he possesses no depth and instead is just perceived by all parties as a mindless killer. Though Amanda emulated a little bit of that, she maintained a disorientated and unhinged presence of which Hoffman is unable to recreate. As with any other SAW film, we have some 'sinners' that are followed. The last instalment follows Bobby Dagen's journey to rebirth and rehabilitation in society as a 'better person'. Using the Jigsaw media meltdown as his foundation, Bobby lies about having survived a Jigsaw trap in order to make money. Before this, he hadn't achieved anything. This is hardly worthy of a Jigsaw trap but Dagen manages to convince the public through a false book and fabricated workshops that he did experience this.He works his way through a series of traps quite aptly set in an abandoned asylum. They predominantly focus upon the 'hear, speak, see' no evil transition, where he is placed in a position of power against those who have adhered to his perverse lie. For example; the first trap he is subjected to with another person, is pulling a fish hook which is attached to the inside of his publicist's stomach. However, she is also hooked up to a decibel monitor, and if she screams to a certain volume, a series of metal tubes will near closer and closer to her neck. If she screams for a predominant length of time, these tubes will enter her neck at a frantic speed, killing her from blood loss and flooding her mouth. The notion is- if she is able to refrain from doing what has poisoned her (speaking) she will be able to survive.Unlike some of the other traps, these are apathetic. Almost impossible. Noticeably less and less like Jigsaw. Granted, we are expecting differences but the traps become increasingly boring.Another thing worth noting about this instalment is that for cinematic release, it was in 3D therefore the blood in a 2D version has a fading red almost pink colour. If you watch the movie in 3D this is less prevalent, but watching the 2D version? You'll find the gore laughable. Similarly, some of the more graphic aspects of gore are poorly done and evidently rushed. Organs and skin look flawed, plastic and fake. It is very difficult to immerse yourself in what SAW represents when it no longer does.We do identify very well with Gibson, the detective that appears within this film. He is a very laid back and occasionally humorous character who perhaps gives Hoffman a run for his money. He's worth paying attention to, one of my favourite detectives to appear thus far and he dies a more dignified planned death, I suppose are the appropriate words for it.I will refrain from giving away the biggest twist but it becomes obvious from 13 minutes into the film what that twist is going to be which is unfortunate. The 'epic music' SAW is famed for, is a let down. There is less and less excitement, tension and suspense and it is very obvious why SAW put off creating the eighth instalment after the most poor of receptions to this.However, there are a few PROs. In typical SAW style there's a lot of narrative to chew your way through and some interesting plot twists and character developments. We begin to appreciate just how skilled Jigsaw is and resent Hoffman's foolishness and misunderstanding of some of Jigsaw's basic concepts of importance.The franchise makes a decent full circle but expect to be dumbfounded by plot holes and a thirst for gore you simply won't be able to access.This is one of the weaker films, perhaps in line with SAW VI but even in VI you had decent effects and aspects to consider through and through. This film is just as it appears, unfortunately.For avid horror fans, I recommend sticking to the first three if you want a decent run through. The cliffhangers were fitting and the ideas were thorough, it just- worked. Some franchises are bled dry and this is unfortunately one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such A Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!I am a huge Saw fan and personally think they should have ended it with the third one but no they had to milk it dry. There is so many things about this film that irritated me.How anyone gave this a ten is beyond me.Everything about Saw 3D is the complete opposite to what Jigsaw stood for. Believe it or not but Saw wasn't just about torturing people, it was to make them appreciate their own life and had a great storyline, instead people are tortured for no reason. Jill, who in previous films came across quite strong, has suddenly turned into a quivering wreck whilst demented Hoffman chases her around the building. The storyline is outrageous and so confusing!! The traps have all been done before and I couldn't of cared less about the whole Bobby story. The only person I felt sorry for was Bobby's poor wife being burnt to a crisp. Jigsaw makes a crap 1 minute cameo, I personally think he should have been in it a whole lot more. I think the worst scene is when Detective Gibson goes into a room and a machine gun kills him! How ridiculous is that? Overall, this film is utter rubbish. I am so gutted that they couldn't have made the last Saw film more entertaining. The acting was terrible, storyline was hectic and the effects were awful. Pink blood! What the heck? Oh yeah and the ending makes no sense at all. If anything the "Final" Saw film has left me with tons more questions. I give it a generous two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second movie that I will be reviewing is indeed one of the movies that I will only recommend watching if you want to finish the SAW Series. SAW 3D is a movie that recently came out?being the end to the 7-Part Saw Series. I personally found this movie to be very distasteful, as if the acting was comedic rather than gory. It was a bit disappointing?I believed that they would've invented something interesting. It was just some idiotic traps, poke your eyes out, knife goes through the neck; etc. I personally believed that in SAW everyone had a chance to live? In the beginning the two farmers and some farmer female were laid on this trap in which one of them HAD TO DIE? This defeats the whole purpose of SAW as it means that someone's blood WILL be SHED. The other part was that mumbo-jumbo pull yourself up with meat hooks trap, which is literally impossible; and excruciatingly painful.. If he didn't pull himself all the way up-- the furnace will cover his female friend and burn her to death. What I don't get is why they were re-using the furnace style trap. It was already done in SAW II. The last thing that I strongly disliked was the part with the rednecks being hooked on some car, and some redneck was glued to the chair and had to pull some lever to survive was really rubbish. The 3D part wasn't even impressive?it looked like it was just some marketing trap to gain more audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw VII- the final cash in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If they had ended it with SAW III they could have walked away proud. But here is SAW VII, unrealistic comedy colour blood in some scenes and in one scene the game cannot be won. I thought the hole point was you could win the game, not be killed no matter what you do i.e the woman having both her eyes and her mouth pierced. This sequel has lost vision from the original films 1-3. The traps would take an entire team of experts in mechanical and electrical engineering in order to produce, jigsaw would need 50 assistants and endless disposable income. I wasn't expecting an Oscar winning masterpiece don't get me wrong, but sometimes you can produce more with brainpower then you can with money and special effects, look at the original SAW, minimal budget, good script, good acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game over (hopefully)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot to this one is well, more or less the same as the others, just a continuation of all the others, dragging on since part 1. This time we get a guy called Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery) who claims to have survived one of Jigsaw's traps and has re-invented himself into a self help guru, where in actual fact he lied about the whole thing and eventually he and everyone else involved in the lie becomes one of the many hapless victims in Jigsaw's traps (surprise surprise).In my opinion though this is definitely the worst out of all 7 Saw movies, a huge letdown to a franchise that started off so well. They have dragged this story on now for way too long and has become tedious and way too over the top and ridiculous now. The first Saw movie was amazing, part 2 was even better and part 3 was also great, but the slippery slope started on with the less than great part 4 and 5, although with part 6 things seemed to be on the up and now it's ended on more of a whimper instead of a bang. Another thing as well they call this Saw 3D, but the 3D aspect was way too underused.Okay there are a few okay aspects of this movie, like the gore factor was there and is as appealing as ever, but the traps lacked imagination, I've seen better in the first 3 parts. Sean Patrick Flannery did okay in his role as the new main character, he was likable and Gina Holden who played his wife was okay as well. And also bringing back Cary Elwes from part 1 seemed to be more of a desperate move to me, but he did okay. Tobin Bell is more of a cameo this time round which was a bitter disappointment, but Costas Mandaylor did okay in making up for his lack of presence. But other than them characters all the other cast was pretty annoying and forgettable as always.All in all a huge letdown compared to all the others and I really hope that this is really the final chapter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Acceptable Ending to a Great Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Saw 7 (i.e. 3D) both in theaters and on DVD as well as the commentary where it is described what the real intention for the finale was. After hearing their intake on the matter, I wish the producers would have permitted the series to finish as planned. It would have brought a more permissible conclusion to this great franchise; however, being as it was it was still acceptable though a bit too easy of a route to take.For the past few years, fans have been reviewing, picking apart, and making theories on how this would all end and upon viewing this final chapter, some were satisfied while others were down right outraged. Though I do not think that those negative towards this film are wrong in their criticisms, I still found it to be a fine finish. However, I had a completely different view on where they could and I thought they would take this story. Being as it was, it felt forced and almost cop-out in the idea, as if they spent the whole time listening to our theories and just decided to end it like that. It felt too easy on their part and almost useless in terms of both Jigsaw and Gordon's story.Also, I didn't really believe Gibson's character as the cop tracking down Hoffman, nor did I really accept Jill's demise. I felt that her character deserved more. On a plus side, I fully accepted Hoffman as the newly mantled Jigsaw in his attempt to start a game in distracting the police. Though I did not care for the Bobby Dagen story in that it felt out of place, this being the final film. I actually was against the idea of introducing really any new characters by this point and was hoping for a series of traps set for Jill in Hoffman's attempt to kill her off and any other loose end characters once and for all, involving Gordon in there somehow.The acting was okay, a little on the downside for a usual saw performance. The traps were enjoyable, however it felt that they got lazy as the film progressed or that they just ran out of steam. Though there were some really good and clever ones overall.All in all, the franchise is finally concluded and though I am okay with the ending, I really felt like they could have dropped the 3D and spent more time writing and bringing it all together in a way that we all would have loved, not just found acceptable. Maybe like all horror franchises, it will start anew eventually and really be planned ahead and brought to its full potential. Until then, we are just left with what could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a disappointing climax to the series. It has reached its peak and then some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw started out on my radar as being the potential for a brilliant horror series and in many ways it reached that pinnacle. Certainly the series was on decline after the first two instalments but it still held its own as being gruesome and twisted and tried to be smarter than its own good in many cases. To truly understand and follow the series you really have to watch all seven instalments back to back and even then its a bit of an intense watch. I will never believe that the series is done because I know horror films better than that but truthfully it should be done. They lost a lot of steam in my opinion when they killed off the killer Jigsaw (who is definitely the glue to this series) a few movies ago. So here we have Saw 7, the first instalment in 3D (which is never necessary but the latest stupid fad), the return of a character that fans have waited for since the end of the first film and it was supposed to clear everything up but it didn't do that at all. As many reviewers have pointed out the film does feel rushed and slapped together. It feels like they really had to stretch to try and put this together to be the end.Costas Mandylor returns as the current Jigsaw killer who seemed like his time was done at the end of Saw 6. He has grown on me as the killer although he never comes close to how great Tobin Bell is. But Mandylor still brings an intensity to his role and is solid in leading the film. Sean Patrick Flannery joins the cast as a former jigsaw survivor leading a support group. Flannery is decent, he certainly has a good on screen charisma but he doesn't quite show the intensity that is required from a leading actor in the Saw series. Tobin Bell returns again in flashbacks as John/the original Jigsaw. Bell is one of the greatest horror characters in history. His Jigsaw ruled this series and his eerie, intense performance kept this series alive and the true test of it going downhill was when they killed off his character leaving only his voice and his flashback appearances in place. He is still excellent in this film and I am a huge fan of Bell in general. Betsy Russell returns as John/Jigsaw's estranged wife. Her death is one of the most brutal scenes in the entire series so her story is wrapped up rather appropriately. When she first made an appearance in the series I was wary about her and the chemistry between her and John but they have definitely come full circle and she's a welcomed addition to the cast. Cary Elwes finally returns as the scarred and broken Dr. Gordon from the original film. I had eagerly anticipated his return and sadly they botched it very badly. His roll in the entire series is forced and silly and he hardly has any screen time. Surely Elwes is not that big of an actor that he couldn't come back for a bigger role. It was unfortunate.As much as I think the 3D was unnecessary Saw 7 has one solid point to it and that is gore gore and more gore, something the series has really pioneered. This instalment has some of the most awful horrific, gut wrenching bloody scenes ever and since that's what Saw is all about kudos to them!! It isn't easy to keep horror kills original after seven instalments but they do manage!! Director Kevin Greutert who helmed the sixth instalment but hasn't had a lot of directorial experience but he has worked on dozens of films during his career. It has to be mentioned that his work has been on a lot of campy cheesy films and I think in some ways that has to carry over into the Saw franchise. He might not be the best choice to finish off the last two instalments with. Love it or hate it but the series set a new standard of slasher flicks. But I recommend having a Saw marathon with all 7 if you want to truly appreciate the entire series. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Felt like I had to wait 7 years for nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I bought this on DVD at Best Buy. I watched all 7 films on DVD because I just can't watch movies like this in theaters. I have very sensitive ears and the theater employees seem to think that you won't get the full effect unless they turn the volume up as loud as it can be, which is STUPID! But anyway, I digress. Unlike a few other reviews I've read, I would not go so far as to say this movie was a complete letdown. I will admit, however, it was disappointing. I know, people, right now, are probably thinking "Why'd you buy it if it was disappointing?" As I said, I didn't see this in theaters and I was thinking "Man, I bet this is gonna have one hell of an ending." I now realize, after watching it 3 times, that I couldn't have been farther off track. This movie ends exactly like the first 'Saw' film, which was good 7 years ago, but I thought this one would, as the writers said, answer every question any fan ever had about the series. It did not. It was like watching a completely different film that doesn't relate in the slightest bit to any of the previous 6 films.To sum up all that I said: I DO NOT think this is the last film in the series. Maybe the last one for a few years, but I certainly do not think this is the "Final Chapter". I said to myself, after watching the film "That is a bunch of BS. I still have a ton of questions." This is one of those movies that you watch when you have nothing else to do. Like, If it's on TV in 4 or 5 years, I'll watch it because, even though I didn't necessarily like it, I'll probably have nothing to do and because it's not so bad that's it's not entertaining.I give it 3 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What and ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start by saying this is definitely one of the best endings to a series that I have seen in a long time.The movie begins with Dr. Gordon crawling his way around and you find out why he is now in the final film. Continuing on to the first trap of the movie (like all others include) featuring a love triangle with saws (which I thought was a great choice because of the... SAWS). Then we head into Bobby Dagen's little interview after catching up with the ending of Saw VI. Then there's a trap, a circle of victims, and Dagen's tests filled in with Det. Gibson, then the conclusion.The movie is only about 90 minutes long, so I pondered how it was going to play out in such a small time. It was very rushed (kind of like most series finales) and the character development was not really there; moreover, Hoffman, Tuck, and Gordon do not have as many scenes as you would think, and Jigsaw himself (the man behind everything) is seen for about 15 seconds. No offense, but when you watch saw, you kind of expect Jigsaw to bust out in every flashback. Billy "the buttfucking puppet" had more appearances than Tobin Bell. That's just... not right.Sean Patrick Flanery (as Dagen) and Chad Donella (as Gibson) lead most of the movie, yet their characters are a bit weak to support the film. There's barely any character development between them or their associates, so it's hard to feel bad for them when they all end up (SPOILER ALERT) buttfucked by Evel Kenievel's flying nipples.I will say that one of the traps made me squirm more than most of their predecessors (still can't top the needle pit). I'll just say it involved a fishing hook. That being said, the other traps weren't as "creative" or "dynamic" as Saw's older ones. It shows that there is a lack of creativity going on behind the scenes (to be expected after 7 years of making these), but it's still disappointing to see in the LAST SAW EVER. Really put a downer on me and not what I expected.Speaking of unexpected, the ending is one of the greatest in movie series history in my book. Quite possibly the most rewarding (for sitting through this) and it makes you feel pretty good. I'll just say it ends on a good note and that you don't only revisit the first Saw, but you revisit it TWICE! And that reverse bear trap that seems to never work? It works.Now to stop dragging on: Okay story, poor character development, creativity-lacking traps, magnificent ending that makes the movie. I give this an 8/10 just for that ending. I can't help it. Should probably be a 6 or 7 (possibly a 5), but I love it too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Saw 3D" - An epic closer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saw 3D" is, in my opinion, the best film in the series since the original. After semi-decent efforts (parts "IV," "V" and "VI," chiefly), the series goes out on a rather horrifying note in this latest blood-/torture-fest. Other than serving up many new traps designed to mutilate people in horrifying and disgusting ways, "Saw 3D" seems most closely tied to events (through the use of flashbacks) in the first "Saw," which came out all the way back in 2004.As we left off in "Saw VI," there is a bloody battle of wills erupting for control of the late serial killer Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) legacy between Jigsaw's latest pupil Agent Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Jigsaw's widow Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell). Thrown into the mix is Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a Jigsaw survivor now a self-help guru for other Jigsaw survivors whose past hides a deadly secret, and he must now save himself and others close to him when he is forced to complete another maze full of deadly tricks &amp; traps. Meanwhile, a determined detective named Gibson (Chad Donnella) tries to locate Agent Hoffman and save Dagen before time runs out.Series newcomer Kevin Greutert has the distinction of allowing "Saw 3D" to go out on a good note, and bring the series to a great closer. This movie is a bloody one, probably the bloodiest in the entire series and you can tell that a significant investment was made by Lionsgate to secure a firm hold on Hollywood's fake-blood supply.This movie also has some of the nastiest traps ever devised by Jigsaw or any of his followers. Two really stand out to me: the first involves a very-public love triangle in which two hapless suitors have to choose between their love of a very promiscuous young woman, or freeing themselves of her unjust influence. The second features Evan (Linkin Park front-man Chester Bennington), a neo-Nazi skinhead whose arms and back have been glued to the driver's seat of his car and he must free himself in order to save his girlfriend and two buddies. Needless to say, both of these traps serve up the gory goodies.The last two "Saw" films, while engaging and frightening, showed signs that the series was running low on ideas and torture devices, yet it also displayed that it could possibly go on for at least two more films or perhaps forever - who knows? - and we'd never be rid of this series. But "Saw 3D" shows that the few ideas that were left were good ones and the series has hopefully, finally, been brought to a great close.8/10P.S.: For the record, I'm not sure I really believe "Saw" is truly over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Saw fan but like many have been saying this felt rushed and needed more. Lets break it down: The Good: Costas Mandylor puts on another excellent performance and pretty much out shines everyone. Also his little killing spree at the end made the movie worth it.I liked the first trap and found the back-and-forth banter to be amusing.The car trap was awesome.Yay Cary Elwes The Bad: Both Jigsaw and Doctor Gordon only get limited screen time, considering how important Gordon is I felt he need much more to do in the film.Extend the ending, it's essentially "lol Gordon is an apprentice" *credits* The Ugly: I'm personally bothered by the fact that most everyone fails at Jigsaw's games, the message behind them has been lost and it has just become a dulled down gore fest.The story with Bobby is pointless and does nothing for the story, the traps are boring and uninspired, and the tooth thing at the end.....come on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Saw 3D supposedly being the last Saw installment my expectations were high, but when I left the theater it left a bad taste in my mouth. I mean the traps were fun, but in this saw movie they decided to push aside the side-story that we've been waiting for. I'm glad to finally see Jill and Hoffman die, but now I feel there needs to be more explanation on the Jon/Gordan side-story. We all knew Gordan was in on it, but who were the other people in the pig masks helping him? I also wish the movie would do something about the liars saying that they've been in these imaginary traps. I would like to see a another Saw as long as its better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of bad... no, wait. REALLY bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never have felt so bitch slapped in my life.I lined up to see this at 6 PM on opening night with my girlfriend, who had never seen a Saw movie before. She loves horror and gore though, so I took her. Aside from a dew jump scenes which made her jump, she hated the film altogether. As for me, the one who has seen every Saw movie?When my dad and I went and saw Saw 3 in the cinema, we loved every single second of it. We had seen every movie until that point, and it was really something to behold. Upon walking out of the cinema, we agreed that 3 was the best, and that the series should should end right there. That apparently was supposed to happen, however Lionsgate had plans to lay back and get rich off the film's success and make about like 500 sequels. So, like any completist, I went and saw every other film. 4 was absolutely horrid, it was essentially just a remake of the third movie, but just with some unlikable puke who is obsessed with saving people. 5... I can barely remember that movie, it was s bad. However, 6 was GREAT!!! it was a needed return to form for the franchise. I loved it, and so with all that said, I had high hopes for Saw 7.Looks like I owe myself a big kick. The big appeal of Saw 3D is, as expected of any movie shot in 3D or with 3D in the title, the 3D. It was shot with James Cameron's 3D equipment. And if you're thinking what I'm thinking, then were on the same page here: 3D and Saw go together like peanut butter and cheese. However, I went and saw it, because I like a good 3D horror movie. It can always be fun.The film opens with the worst title cards for a Saw movie ever. Seriously, I hate it when people try to Look all cool and big right off the bat, and this is one of those moments. Then we get a recycling of clips from the first movie, and then the worst trap beer, the window trap. Where everyone watches. Alright, Jigsaw would never do this, problem one. If Hoffman is so faithful, why would he deliberately go out of his way to disobey the orders Jiggy left him?! And that window trap was bloody stupid anyways. I can't remember much except two guys fighting over one girl and they get her killed. No, seriously, this is stupid. Note to the writers: STOP TRYING TO BE BETTER THAN JAMES WAN AND LEIGH WHANNELL.Then right after that, we get the worlds most pointless trap ever, the car trap. First off, why was it there? Who is Chester Bennington? That trap was pointless and stupid, and is what the nostalgia critic would call, a big lipped alligator moment. As one of the robots on MST3K would sarcastically remark when panning a b movie, "and the reason this part works so well is because we care about the characters!" if a random trap is going to be brought in, it should have a purpose, like the opening trap of Saw 6.The plot then spirals downward into some silly bullshit about a self help guru who apparently lied about being in a Jigsaw trap. The twist was made obvious when the scene where John confronts him during the book signing. I get the message about fabrication, but it was done as bout as subtly as being smacked across the face with a bible. Alright, first off, while I love Sean Patrick Flanery (he is indeed very handsome and a great actor, case in point the Boondock Saints movies), the baby faced dude has no place in a Saw movie. His acting stinks here, it's not like I expected him to care for his character since it was so poorly done anyways.The traps are stupid and have absolutely no logic. Alright, Bobbys first trap, the cage... SERIOUSLY?! Hoffman is apparently brutal and what not, and so he has some lame bullshit about spikes and a cage? What the actual Frak? Or the silence circle. Ooh, spikes in the neck, how disgusting! Or the tooth pulling trap... Or the weight of death, blah blah blah. The one trap that has any suspense whatsoever is the deafening mask. That trap was scary and actually seemed to make sense. It was one of the few scenes in the film that actually made sense.As for Dr. Gordon? Should have stayed presumably dead. Prt of what made the sequels great was the mystery behind his being, and this film ruins it all. So yeah, he cauterizes the wound as he makes his escape and Jigsaw appears and says "oh you're my favourite, so I'm gonna make you my REAL apprentice. Again, defeating the purpose. By god, what were the writers snorting?! Him being an apprentice made as much sense as me having any connection with the royal family.At the end of the day, a total waste of time. Apparently this was to be the last Saw movie ever, And while I hope that's true, the rather loose ended finale of this film makes it seem that that's unlikely.</fullReview>

It's almost as if the story line, the integrity of the character, and the quality of the writing were of no consequence to the producers of this film. They went for gore and shock value, instead. I should know better than to see anything with the term "3-D" in the title, I guess. But I couldn't imagine a bad sequel coming out. Not for this series.I knew it was going to be bad from the start. The real Jigsaw would never have murdered someone publicly, as in the first scene. In his twisted way, he had a sense of morality. He NEVER would have horrified all those innocent bystanders like that. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. It only got worse after that. Save your $. Really....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****SPOILER ALERT ****** This is a prime example of rinse and repeat but with a difference, same crap different people. or in saw 3D same crap same people as the case may be.you can establish no connection with any of the characters really bar 1 which we shall get to in all due time.This movie serves no entertainment points apart from one big gore fest, prev saw movies have had 1 goal and that is to change the survivors prospective on there lives and make them realise how they have took it for granted, or at least that was the original concept anyway.This has however changed and the main goal is to provide a distraction so the Hoffman character can get to jill and take revenge for having the audacity to put him in a trap, a trap i may add he himself has been putting people in and maiming/killing them for his and jigsaws own reasons, there are many many problems with this waste of money production but to name only a few of my main issues.1. First trap: placing a women in a deadly trap for sleeping with 2 guys, then have those 2 guys in the same combining trap decide either save her and kill the other or let her die and they live. ( were going to play a game, you have opened your legs to 2 guys so now they must decide open there chest or open your stomach, what? are they religious now and monogamy is a maim or death sentence?.2. traps are near enough the same to have no original idea and assume were going to be entertained at the premise of more blood and gore will not make us look deeper in this movie, yeah right.3. i get that the guy needs distractions and more than saving 1 person isn't enough but it appeared to have been made to show that regardless what you do you will fail (as they always do, so were's the surprise in that, we no-longer think, come on you can do it, now we just wait to see the kill point as we know 100% that its coming.4: now placing people he knows in traps for being apart of whatever he's done is a given and that painfully as it may be trying to save them will ultimately lead to him failing to save 1 or all, but in all saw movie with plots like this we know all will die or brutally maimed, so why put a perfectly innocent person in the final trap and make sure she dies a horribly slow painfully death.It has always been that if an innocent is involved in the trap regardless of whether they succeed or fail, that person will be found at a later time, for instance in the prev movie the young child is locked in a safe and will suffocate if not found, but it released on a timer.The person that should have not died it was decided to kill her anyways so she can learn a lesson of not being involved with a liar that she was unaware of at the time, is that the reason we should have come up with cos it sucked. for the first tie in saw history it should have ended with those 2 getting away.In short, instead this movie was not about living your live and finding redemption but pure hatred and revenge, with a filling of as much gore and killing as possible with no thought to story this took a no brainer to produce or write and was made just to answer questions but leaving you with more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw has been an awful franchise since Saw 4. The first three ones were amazingly gory and creepy, but 4,5,6 and now 3d are just horrible. The problem is that its like watching "A Nightmare On Elm Street" without Freddy Krueger or watching "Resident Evil" without zombies. The most irritating thing about this film is the Hoffman character. Hes just plain stupid and ridiculous and has always been a Jigsaw wannabe. Having Jigsaw in only a few scenes is very bad and irritating. Another thing bad about this movie is the awful acting, I mean is very unnatural and boring and the dialogue is stupid. The best actor in the whole series is Tobin Bell and is so bad he has so little screen time. The last thing bad is the 3d, that did not help the film in anyway and wasn't eye popping . The only good thing is that this is and hopefully the last Saw. If there is another Saw movie on the way, I'm gonna freak out, seriously, because this movie was awful and it looked so fake. There are way better horror/thriller titles. Aaaa aleluya this is the last Saw movie. My rate is 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw lost its way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could understand the first Saw's raison d'?tre as a tribute to the wonderful Dr Phibes and Vincent Price, even though Saw could have never been compared to its inspiration. Indeed, Dr Phibes was filled with amazing sets and was a quite funny black comedy, whereas Saw's atmosphere could have been inspired by a butchery.I really cannot understand why some film makers seem to believe that some decadent men's room and ugly (and yet ridiculous) masks are enough to provide enough darkness to a "horror" movie (not that Saw is one), as it also apparently happens in "Let the Right One In"'s American version, and could not care less about suspense, plot and acting. This is exactly what Saw 3D is: a group of ugly things bundled together, totally deprived of subtlety, elegance and charm. And yes, of any kind of story too, as if it never mattered anyway.The 3D element is horrible, and just serves to point once again the completely lack of commitment in artistic terms, as if it was needed to reinforce what was already clear and bad enough. So, if the first Saw was intended as a homage to Dr Phybes, Saw 3D is some sort of insult to it.Anyway, what was the point of every Saw after the first one? None. It just got boring and uglier. I wish I could believe this was really the last one, but I don't think so...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand Finale? Far from it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is it; the supposed grand finale for the newest slasher film franchise and hopefully it is. Now I'm not saying this is bad; it's just that ti could've been a lot better.After 6 movies, the first three being great, the next two not worth mentioning and the sixth one redeeming the franchise, the seventh one doesn't do well at all. While SAW 3D manages to entertain as compared to the boredom that was SAW V, SAW 3D fails to maintain the momentum and surprise SAW 6 was able to achieve.The twists were predictable (if you've followed the SAW franchise since the start and then read the forums, you'd understand), the 3D effects aren't worth it, the traps weren't even that great (especially the last one... WTF was that) and the story seemed heavily rushed. Thankfully, the movie wasn't as bad as SAW V, which somehow incorporated the power of friendship and team work in a universe like SAW's but still, I was expecting something great or epic since this would be the end of one of my favorite horror franchises.All in all, if all you want is some popcorn horror fun, go ahead; SAW 3D plays a lot like PIRANHAS 3D in the enjoyment factor. But if you were expecting a grand finale for the once great and awesome SAW franchise, you better think twice; maybe it would be better to wait for the DVD instead. For anyone who's watched this series from part one all the way to this installment, get ready to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gimmicky, tired, and over indulgent on blood and guts, the Saw franchise has ended on a lousy note.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now first off, EVERYONE has to have some sort of guilty pleasure, one of mine just happens to be the Saw franchise. Most would accuse the series of being all gore indulgence, no plot. And the gore is indulgent, but I can't say there's no plot, especially for the first film, which is by far the greatest of the series, as it took a bizarre premise to tense, and nail biting grounds, and each subsequent film has been somewhat entertaining (Some more than others). Now with the release of the seventh film, my verdict is... STOP RIGHT HERE, and I don't mean that nicely, because the film isn't even the least bit enjoyable to watch.Taking place where the last film left off, it shows the ever growing struggle between Detective Mark Hoffman (Played by Costas Mandylor), and Jill Tuck (Played by Betsy Russell), the latter of whom seeks protection from the police, as the two of them are engaged in a battle over the legacy of the late Jigsaw killer, John Kramer (Played by Tobin Bell). Meanwhile, survivors of previous Jigsaw captives are starting to come forth in their experiences, in the wake of the rise of fame of self help guru Bobby Dagen (Played by Sean Patrick Flanery), but Bobby's dark secrets are about to come back to haunt him, as the battle for Jigsaw's legacy comes to a destructive conclusion.To those familiar with the series, this is really nothing new. Take a couple of dartboards, throw a dart at a board of random captives, a board of random traps, bring back previous cast members, heighten the blood and guts, add some more depth and exploration to John Kramer's back story, get lead singer of Linkin Park, Chester Bennington to feature in a cameo at the end of the film's first act, add in gimmicky 3D effects, and Voila! You've got Saw 3D, the weakest and most generic installment of the series.This is not the fault of the actors, who honestly look like they're trying their hardest (Except for 2 or 3), but they can't elevate the film's screenplay, with logic gaps wider than ever, the dialogue too cheesy, and ridiculous narratives thrown in that don't even get much attention anyway, as they're overshadowed by the film's gore, which has become utterly repellent at this point of the franchise. The film just tries too hard to force tension and fear out of the traps that have simply become tired. I also thought the third act dragged along.If this really IS the last installment of the series (I doubt it), then they've ended on a pretty sour note.I give it *1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why they should end the series?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the days when I first saw the original one. it was perfect and really took my breath away. so, when I saw that there's a second one, I really got surprised. but it wasn't like the first one. and as time goes, they went worse. it was absolutely clear that the writers were playing with characters to make more series, so they keep some alive, and kill some. but the last one, AWFUL. no one seem to be necessary anymore, so no one survived. so many characters came and died instantly. time was short, traps were poorly made and had no creativity, and of course NO ONE had even the chance of survival. I was really disappointed by this one.also the ending, it was absolutely predictable that Hoffman is going to die. because the bad people always die. by the hands of the doctor!!! HEH...wish they ended the series in 6th one. if Hoffman was dead by then, it was the perfect ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The game still finished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saw" - one of the most popular horror franchises of our time, and certainly the most successful in terms of total charges for all parts. Fans of detective stories watching these movies for the sake of surprise endings under the traditional melody of Charlie Clauser and lovers myastsa and raschlenenki for its attractive traps and subsequent executions of people caught in these same traps. But as is often the case with horror, they just start churning, moving further and further away from the quality of the first parts.The plot of the seventh refers to the origins of the franchise, and returns to the screen (albeit in the background) of one of the main characters of the first part - Dr. Gordon, who has yet to play a role in the multistage plan now deceased designer. Meanwhile, Detective Mark Hoffman and in combination, the heir to the affairs of the designer, is trying to hide the remaining evidence of his villainous activities in parallel punishing racists, rock beauties and wicked writers. The game begins Unfortunately, the detective aspect of the plot in this part gave a serious failure, and if used in parallel with the meat grinder is absolutely left the victims, at least we could observe how Hoffman uvernetsya of justice and out unscathed, there is the storyline is actively developed only at the beginning and now only at the very end. Throughout the middle, we observe the problems fraudster, pretending to be a victim of saws and is now paying for it twice. Everything is as before and if you watched at least one of the previous parts, from the outset understand what this is all over for him and for his accomplices.One of the main chip franchise had constant flashbacks, opening new and new details of life saw taking place behind the scenes of the previous parts and unites all the pieces into a coherent picture. Screenwriters as they could, inventing new and new causes of appearances of Tobin Bell (the irreplaceable role of the artist designer), but for the finale of the tape had the impression that they have themselves become entangled in its own plot twists and turns. Frankly controversial plot twists in the finale instead of the shocking effect gives you a feeling of bewilderment rather than surprise. Guys already do not know what else to say in so jaded and down the plot and therefore attentive viewer will notice a lot of inconsistencies and logical holes in local history.But of course, for those who crave the bloody spectacle, and to whom all these detective zamorochki little interest, is likely to remain on the tape in delight. New traps companion Hoffman is no less bloody than the previous ones, and some (the scene of punishment of racists) and does affect the originality and implementation. Thanks to the stereoscopic effect, the guts now throw out at you right from the screen, which makes it truly a new experience. So, your inner Jack the Ripper will be pleased.However, from a technical point of view, in contrast to the scene, not to find fault with anything. Injected a powerful soundtrack suspense, coupled with mounting a furious and brilliant visuals simply immerse the viewer in a chair on the voltage, but on some points and does begin to roil the stomach.Another thing is that in this sense there is absolutely no, and if before all this slaughter provoked in order to survive (or at least attempts), and Heroes Reborn, now himself a spectator realizes that the chances of characters simply does not. All of this notorious philosophy and morality of the degeneration was nothing more than a reason for another pack vypotroshennyh bodies, and the characters - the only consumable for the evisceration. And do not be surprised by automatic machine guns (it's on the salary of police) in the cabinet saws and cumbersome, though designed in NASA, megapechka in the final. Ideas are over, the story jaded, nothing amaze.The conclusion from the above, you can make one: the franchise came to a standstill, and the old formula, it is no longer there to pull out. Of course, dedicated fans will deny this and claim to continue the banquet, but even the falling box office suggests that the lack of development of the franchise only leads to its degradation. Let the "Saw 7" still quite a can watch and not without a certain pleasure. But the level that was before, he is unlikely to reach. And further, will only get worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atrocious ending to an atrocious series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every year, I think to myself "This series can't possibly get any worse", and every year, the Saw series, which might be the most overrated movie series in history, manages to outdo itself yet again. Saw 3D, which is such an obvious cash-grab it's almost painful, managed to not only create yet MORE plot holes that are never explained, but also have the laziest, most rushed ending to a movie ever.Where do I even begin? The main character, Bobby Dagen, shows off 1-inch fake scars to a woman who cut her own arm off, and a man (Dr. Gordon) who cut his foot off!! How stupid is this guy? And what happens to him, anyway? His wife gets melted and we never find out what becomes of him. And then there's Dr. Gordon, who every Saw fan has been clamoring for since the original. He gets what--5 minutes of screen time? Brilliant! And of course they go with the most obvious ending they could possibly think of. Then there's Jill, who has been turned into damsel-in-distress for no reason. And I can't forget John Kramer, who gets...one scene. Um...OK.And really, the biggest problem I have with the entire series is--why does Hoffman continue doing these things??? He clearly doesn't agree with Jigsaw's supposed philosophy because he makes traps where people HAVE to die. What is his ultimate goal? He kills off dozens of police officers...why??? And furthermore, when does Hoffman have the time to build all these traps? And even furthermore, this movie literally happens directly after Saw VI. How did this guy, Gibson, (whose actor gives an atrociously bad performance) NOT know Hoffman was the new Jigsaw? He JUST TORCHED A POLICE LAB IN SAW VI AND KILLED THREE COPS. And someone needs to explain to me how Hoffman sews his cheek up when his ENTIRE RIGHT JAW WAS RIPPED OFF.In hindsight, this movie was the perfect way to end the series: it was somehow worse than the last one--just like every other Saw movie since Saw II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review for a movie. I can't get it out of my head until I pen it down here. This movie was a waste of time and money. Actually, the SAW series was already saturated after part III came. Thereafter, it was finding plot loopholes on the previous movies and expanding it with blood &amp; gore as another movie (IV, V, VI...VII). The Marketing group had done a good job in deceiving the general audience with the 3D crap for this movie. I was among one of the victims deceivedby the 3D hype. There are couple of scary scenes where blood &amp; body parts splatter on the screen to Ur 3D glasses, other than that the plot of the movie was so weak and the movie ending again with a new character for continuing Jigsaw's Legacy.The makers of the movie say that this is the last one on the series...I wish that is true and they do not make any more of this CRAP!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D was hands-down, without a doubt, the single worst piece of garbage I have ever sat through in a theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I say that as a fan of the series and general apologist for the last several mediocre films. It's a shame IMDb has to force me to give a 1/10 to this piece of trash movie, because it doesn't even deserve that. I can't believe Cary Elwes agreed to come back to *this*. Oh god, where even to start? The "game" of the movie centers around a man, Bobby Dagen, who claims to be a Jigsaw survivor, but had never actually been in a trap before. The execution of this story was so unfathomably bad. It copied the plot of III, IV, and VI wholesale (central character encountering people tangentially related to him in perilous traps, and he either saves them or not). But gone are the morality lessons, gone is the suspense, gone is any past theme of "appreciating your life." Hoffman just kidnapped these people to watch them get killed because they p*ssed him off. Bobby fails to save his publicist, lawyer, and best friend, who all die horrifying deaths. Then he gets to the end and has to pierce himself in the chest with hooks and climb up a chain to save his wife, connecting two ends of an extension cord. He tearfully confesses that he'd never played a game before, but he sees his redemption in this final trap. She forgives his lies, he pierces himself with the hooks and begins to climb. I'm sitting there watching this thinking the correct ending is for him to save her. No one cares about his meaningless handlers, but he's seen the light, he knows what he needs to do, he can save his wife. But no. The hooks tear through his skin as he gets to the top, he falls down, and she burns to death in some kind of ridiculous oven that builds itself. And this was gratuitous. There were several repeated shots of her, in varying stages of burning-to-death, screaming in agony. This was sick, pornographic, and it was wrong in every sense of the word. In past Saw films, if someone died a gory death, it either didn't linger on screen or was done in kind of a cheesy way (limbs being pulled from what is very obviously a dummy, for instance). This was way too real. And the worst part is, it didn't even make sense in terms of the story. The wife was not complicit in the lie. Her only sin was knowing him. And she gets to burn to death for it. She didn't not appreciate her life or anything, she was just a wholly innocent victim. And the liar was never in any mortal danger. In the storyline, this would be a total perversion of Jigsaw's legacy. And EVEN THAT would have nearly approached a redeeming quality in a film that had none had it been addressed. But it wasn't.The new cop character is somewhat interesting. So let's just kill him in a meaningless scene, how about that? In retrospect, he's not nearly as smart as he seems - is that doll in the background behind Hoffman in the video the only one that ever existed? Shouldn't he know that Hoffman wanted him to find the site of the game, giving such an obvious clue? What's more, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE DIES. Except Bobby, and I guess Dr. Gordon, but that was the most predictable twist ending in the history of twist endings. Cary Elwes is a fine actor, but why in the freaking world did he come back for this? There was no need to resolve Dr. Gordon's story at all, but if they wanted to, having him at the survivor's group was sufficient.The multi-person traps, in general, are a load of crap. They, like I touched on earlier, don't honor Jigsaw's legacy of showing someone the value of life. Many of them guarantee that at least one person will die. In the first three films, it was always possible that no one would have ever gotten killed in one of the traps. Not so anymore.I even have to criticize Tobin Bell. He was only in about 5 or 6 minutes of the movie, but boy did his performance seem phoned-in. So much for only staying in the series as long as the movies are good. And then there's Hoffman basically becoming a zombie as the movie went on, killing anyone and anything within seconds with nothing to stop him, and the not-at-all-innocent Jill becoming a screaming damsel in distress. WTF was that?There are about a thousand more things I could say about why I hated this movie so much, but there's a character limit. I legitimately feel like this may be one of the very worst movies ever made. The 3D was totally pointless, by the way. It added absolutely nothing. One thing that surprised me at the time, but makes total sense now, was that at my showing, in a 120-seat theater, there were about 10 other people there. I feel like I owe James Wan and Leigh Wannell an apology for supporting the franchise for so long that it made it to this steaming pile of POOP as a finale. The first Saw, at least, doesn't deserve to be connected to this. And it wasn't even a "so bad it's good" sort of thing. I left the theater angry and offended. And as I said, I am (was) a big fan of the franchise. But no longer. I want to know how the hell the people who wrote and directed this thing are able to sleep at night. Even if you made it to Saw VI as a hardcore fan of the franchise, steer WELL CLEAR of this one. The series ended at VI (frankly, it ended at III). This movie officially never happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review in a long time because I really felt I had to share my feelings with everyone on IMDb.com..... To start the acting is beyond horrible. I can't get over who did the casting, like did they just go outside the studio and grab any random person because it was terrible. The cop playing Gibson belongs doing movies on the scifi channel and that's giving him credit. His performance and the performance of his partner were so bad I just can't get over it. Like did the director and producer not notice they had hired horrible actors or did they just NOT care. Now to the story... I have been a fan of the SAW series since part one and I have to agree the series has gotten really dumb with all the flashbacks and loose ends. Pretty much anything after part 3 is a huge flashback of events. This story takes us to a guy who lied of surviving a trap and introduces us to a team of survivors which we never met aside form the girl with the cut arm. The story was really weak and one key returning character was highly under used and yet we are left with so many new and unanswered questions. As much as i wouldn't mind a SAW 8 i'm glad it came to an end. (HOPEFULLY) because for some strange reason a can feel a "SAW REBIRTH" in the near future!!! I guess i'll make my own answers for the new questions this movie left. I do have to add some of the traps are insane which leads me to wonder how in the world does Hoffman have time to create these off the wall traps and never be seen. Confusing yes!!! Now the 3D... If you even want to call it that...I'm really getting tired of movie studios throwing in 3D to get us to pay more money for tickets. SAW 3D was worthless, the only 3D I notice was during the opening credits with the splattered blood aside from that its pointless and worthless. My conclusion is to wait for this in your local $1 blockbuster Kliosk or wait for it on NETFLIX because it's not worth a movie ticket, in reality it's not worth the hour and thirty minutes!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw WAS a good series, but three films in and jigsaw is killed, they decided not to stop, fine so they make a film that is happening at the same time, it worked but then fans were cheated with the Hoffman story which placed him all the way through the series, it didn't work it made it feel brainless and boring. The 6th film was better after the 4th and 5th films so I was actually looking forward to seeing this one. The 3D didn't interest me and if I could go back now I wouldn't have wasted my money. The first trap isn't promising, bad acting and a stupid unrealistic trap, in the middle of a town... really? I must admit i was glad to finally have closure on the story of Lawrence, but even his performance quality was nothing compared to the first film. Now to the traps, they are possibly the worst in any film, they arn't really well thought out and don't really have creativity, the traps are the center of Saw so this made the film worse. The ending is where fans of Saw have been cheated again, we all know of the rumours that Lawrence is still alive, that it was him who placed the key behind Michaels eye all the way in the 2nd film, so for them to use this made me want to laugh. Why would Lawrence help Jigsaw after he made him cut off his own foot, its unrealistic and i think they tried to just please fans which failed. I am so glad that this is possibly the end of the Saw series because they should have stopped after the 3rd one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am the type of moviegoer that pays the admission price, and in this case, an extra four bucks because like every other film on the market today, it's in "3D," and simply tries to enjoy the experience. However, this latest film in the franchise is so over the top it's flat-out laughable.I haven't read all of the reviews as of yet, but from the ones I have, most of the die hard fans seem to share the same sentiment. That being, this film is by far the worst in the series. Well, I agree one hundred percent.I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said, except for the fact that even some fans I have talked to who disliked the film, loved the traps. Now I can stretch my disbelief pretty far, after all it's a movie and not reality, but the these traps are so elaborate and far-fetched, it would take an army of engineers to design and pull these things off with proper execution (no pun intended). I'm a pretty handy guy, and it still took me two days to install a ceiling fan in my bleeping kitchen! Again, it's a movie and as an audience we are supposed to take such things with a grain of salt, but in my opinion, the simplicity of the first Saw is what made it so disturbing. Two men chained in a room with some props, a tape recorder and a hacksaw. Period. The utter frustration of watching these two poor saps trying to solve the mystery and get out of the room with their extremities intact was engaging enough without the need for downright ridiculous contraptions like those in Saw 3D.That being said, as bad is the supposedly LAST film in the series is, it will no doubt be better than the "reimagining" some exec will come up with five years from now in an attempt to relaunch the franchise.It's been done to death. Leave well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 3D is the newest and "final" entry into the Saw series. Going into this I was expecting the best of the franchise. Let me start with the good things about Saw 3D. Saw 3D reveals the longly anticipated fate of Dr. Gordon. He is definitely the highlight of the film. The traps in the film are OK, but feel a bit bland and uninspired. It's like wanting a straight shot of scotch, and someone diluting that shot with water. It's just a little blah. The 3D isn't corny, but at times I wasn't even aware I was in a 3D movie. It isn't nearly in your face as the trailer wants you to believe, which isn't really a bad thing. The acting is horrible, but who cares about acting in a movie like this. The plot was just boring. Basically the same as Saw VI, some random guy going through rooms trying to save people. Once again, bland and uninspired. It's disappointing that the series would go out on such an average note. This movie is better than Saw IV or V, but all the others are better. Final rating: a very generous 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The seventh (and purportedly last) Saw movie. It picks exactly where part 6 ended so you may think you have to see all six parts to get it, but I saw it with a friend who missed parts 4-6 and he had no trouble figuring it out. It's more "fun" and "games" with Jigsaw's followers carrying out his sadistic little games. This time around Bobby Dagan (Sean Patrick Flanery) and his family and friends are tortured because Dagan lied about saying he escaped from a trap by Jigsaw--but he never WAS in a trap by Jigsaw. Like the others this is dark, grim, no unnecessary nudity or love story and very little humor. The traps are as sadistic as ever and this movie is VERY difficult to sit through. But it scares you and that's all it's supposed to do.Now--the 3D. It jacked up the already outrageous ticket price to $15.00! And you know what? It SUCKS! It's not even used except a few times and makes every scene look even darker than it should be. A few times I had to take off the glasses cause I didn't know WHAT I was seeing! The 3D is totally unnecessary and just added on to get more money out of movie goers. I don't care what the studio says--this was NOT needed! That aside it was violent, VERY gory and (with the exception of Costas Mandylor) well acted. Flanery was very good and I was surprised to see Cary Elwes appear (and totally contradicting what we heard happened to his character in 1, 2 and 3). Top billed Tobin Bell only appears in a few scenes but you hear his voice a lot during the traps.Grim, gruesome and a fitting end to the series (supposedly this is the last). However there IS a way they could film a sequel. If this one makes enough money I'm sure we'll see it. An 8...but wait for the DVD. As I said the 3D is horrible and not needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although most of the sequels have been subpar, Saw 3D ends the genre-defining series on a high</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying the impact the Saw series has had on not only the horror genre, but movies in general. Starting off as a little low-budget psychological thriller centred around two guys in a basement, this series has smashed box office records and created a new horror villain in Jigsaw. Since 2004 audiences have flocked to watch new victims meet their demise in an inventive and cruel way while relishing the inane plot twists and convoluted story, whilst others have condemned the series as "torture porn" and nothing but sick people coming up with sick traps for sick audiences.This latest entry stays true to its predecessors and delivers over-the-top, ultra-violent death scenes accompanied by a plot full of flash backs, surprise revelations and an overuse of the main theme. To explain the plot of Saw 3D is silly, as the whole point of a Saw film is to go in having no idea about any of the trips or twists and to enjoy them as they come at you from every which way. I will say; however, that the film does end well, and the story is wrapped up fairly nicely with no obvious need for a sequel (as this is hopefully the "final" film).Overall the film is very much the same as Saw VI (2009) which was also directed by Kevin Greutert. Like many of the sequels this has multiple stories going at once, but it doesn't quite gel. It all feels very choppy, and after awhile the sheer amount of changing scenes can get quite annoying as it takes away from the suspense which is often built up quite well. The editing, lighting, camera-work and music is all the same as the other entries, by now it is stock standard Saw settings. Jigsaw's traps are back and they are as nasty as ever, if there is one thing this movie delivers on, is fantastic gore. A word of caution (although you may be expecting this now): the 3D is a total waste of money and there are one or two cool effects utilised in the whole 90 minute movie. Do NOT expect something cool just because it was filmed in 3D, cos it ain't any better than the post-conversion films.On a final note, I have never been a huge fan of the Saw series, but looking back it has been an interesting ride. The first film, although flawed, had a great new concept and a shocking twist. Unfortunately the sequels took away from the first, creating a story based around traps and trying to fit as many twists in as possible. These last two entries by Greutert have been two of the strongest (as well as Saw III), but there are still glaring issues that prevent it from being a great movie. Saw fans will not be disappointed, anyone else should probably stay away unless you like buckets of blood and don't care about understanding the story! 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 3D The Final Chapter is a waste of everyone's time. The filmmakers no longer act like filmmakers. They act like people playing Call of Duty on their Xbox trying to get the biggest kill- streak. All this movie is about is killing as many people as possible in the nastiest, yet most tedious and fake-looking way possible. Does this feel like the end of a franchise? No. It's rushed and doesn't really feel like a resolution. The twist that Lawrence Gordon was actually Jigsaw's apprentice the whole time is not only boring, but was painfully obvious from the start. Also, why would he suddenly join forces with the man who kidnapped his family and put him through the wringer? Like the rest of the movie, it doesn't make sense. The acting hits an all-time low here, with the victims of the opening trap and some guy from Final Destination who plays a bland police officer standing out in particular. There is no lightness, humour, joy, intelligence or insight here. It is just death after death after death. And for what? What do we gain from this movie? What do the characters gain from this? What has Jigsaw been trying to accomplish? What will happen to his work after this movie? So many unanswered questions. So many uncaring critics viewers who never want anything to do with this once-decent franchise ever again. They're still making Saw VIII of course. I sometimes wonder why I like cinema so much. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 3D: The final chapter: the last saw movie, as far as quality goes, truly is complicated. The beginning and a lot of the middle is honestly kinda crap, and the gore is cranked up way to high, I mean yes that was expected going in, but still, it could've been a lot better without some of those unnecessarily gory shots. As far as acting goes, eh, nothing that special here, a couple of performances by the main detectives on the case are super cheesy and laughable, the rest suffice OK I suppose. The journey Bobby must go through to get to the ending is wrought with gore, violent deaths, screaming, and predictable goings on. The deaths are gross, unpleasant, and I'm sorry but I just can't enjoy it, just can't, especially since this is nothing new, same old same old. Now the ending is what was actually interesting, the ending is suspenseful, nostalgic, just a little surprising, and I think they ending this slasher series well. I liked Jill Tucker in this movie, I feel like she did well, and her character had good solid material to work with. Unfortunately I cannot give the film a positive review. With some bad performances by a few select actors, a very poor beginning, and an over the top distasteful amount of 3D gore, I just cannot give it one. I give this final installment in the bloody saw franchise a 4/10. I now will have to see the other previous films LOL, this is the only one I've seen so far. And damnit Jill Tucker shouldn't have died!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that shows a lot of ugly truths others choose to distort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see the obligatory low ratings and I assume people are just butthurt because this movie actually was brave enough to show human nature in it's true form, without the pandering and bull you see in other movies and sitcoms. It had realistic characters - a cheating, selfish, double-dealing slut who was using two guys and wished them to kill each other so she can live - that's the kind of a realistic character you'll never see in another movie, and if you're offended by it - enjoy being a hypocritical, delusional narcissist who demands pandering. It also had many other characters with realistic human traits which really amazed me, because I'm used to seeing obligatory unrealistic and pandering personalities in movies. So that was brave!You have your gore and twisty plot, but what this movie really shines in is sparing no one when it comes to realistic human nature. Things like that I'm sure offend a majority simpletons who are used to being lied to and enjoy reading and seeing fake, distorted stories; but make for a respectable &amp; bold movie.Lying publicists, lying media, lying lawyers, everything in this movie was realistically portraying the ugly flow of the "real world".The ending was bittersweet though, I was hoping for justice for the brilliant anti-hero I sympathized with (yet disappointingly and conveniently clumsy near the end, bad script there).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting, confusing sh*tty movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only is the gore disgusting and completely over the top (and not in a fun way like the Evil Dead series) Its just people being torn apart in the most grotesque disgusting ways simply for the sake of showing it. And when I wasn't disgusted I laughed because it looked so fake several times. And I do not have a problem with violence in movies at all. But there is a line and they just keep crossing it in every sick disgusting Saw sequel they have made.But the worst part is that the gore seems more important than what little actual plot there is in this garbage of a movie. Not that there is much of a plot. And it's so confusing that it makes no sense what so ever.The original Saw movie might have been clever with good acting and a good plot. But typical Hollywood: sequels have to be just about the violence. I can barely remember it after 9 horrible money-grabbing sequels.And good actors have been wasted in the sequels, such as Dina Meyer, Cary Elves, Sean Patrick Flannery and of course Jigsaw himself Tobin Bell.Do not waste a minute of your time on this disgusting display of senseless brutal violence. Not even if you're paid to see it. It's sheer torture to sit through this or any of the 8 other sequels.Personally I'd rather watch paint dry.Only good thing to say is that this really was the final chapter as it has been 6 years since this turd of a movie came out.But Hollywood that has run completely out of ideas and they keep rebooting everything and they will most likely reboot Saw as well at one point. And it will be terrible. Like every other reboot out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problematic but fine conclusion to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to help fellow survivors, a self-help guru telling his story of surviving one of Jigsaw's traps finds himself part of a new game that he must successfully pass while the police continue to get ever closer to solving the killer's true identity.This was yet another enjoyable if somewhat frustrating entry that closes out the franchise. There's some pretty big flaws present here for this one, starting with the fact that the film's intention on keeping the main killer alive and so far ahead of the police here simply to have him be the main object of their investigation to stop him. The amount of effort gone through to show how far ahead he is of them is entirely unrealistic and simply features him as such solely to get the villain of the piece to come out on top being the hero of the film but that is a huge detriment to the film as a whole with this one yet again forced to employ such a not-that-shocking twist ending that plays out for the fifth time in the series' history only each time was a different person in that position. Not even that works either with the simple notion of bringing that particular individual into play to deliver the exact same twist as just about every other effort here is incredibly disappointing and doesn't make for any kind of impassioned viewing as there's the overly-familiar sense of deja-vu creeping in here, all of which comes from the films' desired notion of keeping the villain that major of a threat along the way. Likewise, the fact that there's some rather confusing and overly-complicated traps here that no sane person would ever think up trying to teach some kind of lesson to someone doesn't really strike out that much here. The 3D is so unimportant to the film that there's no need to have filmed them that way to begin with as they don't even register at all, while the constant and irritating yelling during each of the traps makes for a hard time to figure out what's going on,but overall these are the only major distractions throughout here. The main thing here with this one is that for once in the series, it finally gets the moral objective of the traps right for this is certainly as worthy and whole-heartedly appropriate for a game as the franchise has ever delivered and actually has enough sense to tie the traps into a significant meaning behind them. While they may not be the most realistically-contrived setups in terms of logic, there's some rather fun times to be had here with the way they all build together and form a rather impressive game to be dished out, and the graphic gore is again a highlight. As well, the idea of bucking traditions with the opening in public make for a highly-enjoyable sense of uniqueness here that makes for a fun opening encounter here. It helps raise this somewhat, but it's still somewhat flawed.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit of a mess really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Saw series ends with a whimper rather than a bang in this underwhelming final installment which simply fails to take the time to set up its various twists and turns.For instance, we have a man who's lied about surviving a Jigsaw Trap who gets put in a trap for real, fair enough. But what actually happens to him? It doesn't look like he dies. Does he end up discredited? Does he end up a depressed and isolated man? Then we have this Jigsaw survivors group. Great idea, but, what happens to them? What's the end game? And finally we have the returning Dr Gordon (Cary Elwes). What a waste! Yes, I understand that he needs to be a Jigsaw disciple and that this makes sense, but surely they could have set this up better. He is in the opening scene and shows up at the Survivor Group, but what happened to his family? Did they break up? Did he disappear for a few months? Come on guys, if you're going to bring back a character after 5 movies, explain something.The one thing I do like in this movie is Detective Hoffman's ramboesque rampage. He is bug eyes crazy and I love his character. I didn't really care about him in Part 5, but in 6 and 7, I buy him as an interesting and dangerous psycho killer. There's also a nice trap with three corners of a love triangle and circular saw, but when is that happening? Who set this trap: Jigsaw, Hoffman or Amanda, or hell, was it Gordon? In the end this a poor final installment. It rushes through things, doesn't explain enough and looks cheaper than the previous ones. I didn't see it in 3D, but it's obvious which scenes pander to it. Hoffman tries to keep us interested, but his bonkers rampage isn't enough to save this. A poor ending, which causes me to fail the whole series. 3 good films out of 7 with a crap ending does not a worthwhile series make. Could have been better but oh well. It is what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 7: 3D (2010): Dir: Kevin Greutert / Cast: Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Betsy Russell, Sean Patrick Flanery, Cary Elwes: The Saw franchise arrives in 3D with graphic gore effects thrown at the viewers. This time the plot centers around a professed Jigsaw survivor gaining fame from what he has not experienced. He is captured and put through several brutal tests to excel or cost the lives of others. Directed by Kevin Greutert with skillful traps but the story has been the same for the last several sequels. Tobin Bell appears briefly as Jigsaw during a book signing segment, plus another flashback reveals past involvements. Bell is now the face of the franchise just as Robert Englund is the face of the Nightmare on Elm Street films. Costas Mandylor returns as the criminal cop outwitting the police and seeking revenge on Jill, played by Betsy Russell, who is in police custody. Mandylor is indeed a sadistic cop in his attempts to out do even Jigsaw, but Russell's feisty sexy widow proves to be just as dangerous, and between the two it is a close match in terms of who can terminate who. Sean Patrick Flanery plays the latest test victim whose boasts to further his celebrity finally catch up to him and he now must prove himself within the real deal. Cary Elwes makes a much needed appearance from the original film to tie loose ends together. The traps are always well done but only slasher film fans will appreciate their detail and ultimately the graphic aftermath that only strong stomachs can endure to any length. The film is pointlessly violent but should appeal to fans of the series. Score: 4 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All that's new is the trap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we are, the end of the Saw franchise. This final chapter is the most violent and disturbing Saw film. The 3D effects doesn't help at all in this bland entry in the long series. To be honest, the franchise should have ended earlier. It went far too long. It's no doubt that the original was the best. From that point, the films got worse. Sure, there were some good scenes along the way, but nothing can't compare to the first. This final chapter has become a joke because it had so much potential.As we all know, in Hollywood, if something is making money, it's never over. Still, Saw 3D hope to be the final chapter in this seemingly never ending series. It shows traps and a great twist.The story by Bobby Dagen, a self-help famous author who wrote a book about surviving one of Jigsaw's traps. The trap is, Bobby was never a Jigsaw victim, the whole thing is a scam, but it's working quite well. Eventually, Jigsaw's followers kidnap Bobby's publicist, lawyer and best friend. Bobby is then places in a trap where he must save them. If he makes through, he must face the test as he struggles to save the last victim, his wife.While all of this is going on, Mark Hoffman, Jigsaw's protégé, is trying to track down Jill, Jigsaw's ex-wife. As he plans out his revenge for her, the police department is closing in on him. At the end, everything ties together, although easy to spot plot twist.If you've seen any of the previous Saw films, you know what you're in for. There are no changes, no new plot devices, no new character, nothing necessary. The main focus of the film is still on the game and while the game is going on, the police are searching for the person who create this mess. Jigsaw attempts to teach his victims a lesson, a few flashbacks are there to confuse you. Characters couldn't be any dumber and soon, repetition starts. It all feels familiar. All that's new is the traps.What the makers of the film still wondering about, the reason why the original Saw was so successful. It included a very simple premise, no side plots or back stories, a shocking twist, and the main villain never die. The original has that sense of intensity that the sequel lacked. By this point, we already know what's going on. The film makers seem to keep trying to upgrade the traps and blood. The horror in the film is liquid blood while the horror in the original was much intensity, which works better. There is no dread or terror here.When it comes to the traps, they're pretty creative and one of all traps may be the best one of the entire film. If you've been disappointed with the way the series going up till this stage, Saw 3D isn't going to change how you feel. It's more of the same old Saw materials we've seen from previous series. If you're a fan of Saw, you may want to see it. If you interested in blood, you'll be entertained. Oh and remember to leave your brain at the door, logic is thrown out of the window.</fullReview>

Just right for an end of the film series. In addition, the film does not degenerates also because at the end of the film, no one survives except Dr. Gordon, even though it was already clear each came back to the big screen since Saw I. As I said, the game comes together and everyone understands it. So for fans of the series a must. Of course also for everyone else.Signed. jigsaw-71869aka Mr. Mef-27</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 3d is the seventh and the final installment in the saw series a sequel was announced and who knows it might be in works but personally i have to say it should remain the final there is no need for more films as this franchise is officially ended.In the last decade the first film came in 2004 it is so far the best film along with another 2 sequels but the director was changed and the writing was awful so what could fans do about it nothing they tolerated with extreme patience but enough is enough there is too much blood and nonsense for no reason and jigsaw is just hanging around at local public places.The Plot:a man who escaped from jigsaw writes a self help book but that never helps as jigsaw is still the man at large this time the game is big traps are in the open and no one is safe.The cast:well Tobin bell returns once again it was embarrassing to watch him get wasted in this mess Anne Lee Greene gets chopped up by a blade when it runs through her stomach it was sick.The ending just proves how lame this was i wont go into much detail as so many reviewers have pointed out this does not look like a saw film at all and why 3d it is just a waste of money please do not buy this film at all there are some funny moments here but on the whole it just does not work.Overall Saw 3D:2010 is only for hardcore saw fans nothing more and once again if anyone is trying to reboot this franchise it should be boycotted my rating is 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unfitting Finale to a Great Horror Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw VII was definitely a big letdown compared to the previous six entries in the franchise. It had way too many flaws going on in it. For starters, the transitions from one scene to another are horrendous, such as in the scene with the "horsepower trap." The film cuts to this scene with four characters who have never been seen before in the film(s), and aren't integral whatsoever to the story, it's completely superfluous material. Secondly, some of the casting and actors are awful, the character of Gibson (Chad Donella) was basically a satire on bad acting, Bobby (Sean Patrick Flannery) was far too dull and disinterested in his starring role, and the woman in the trap in the opening scene, my God! Just stop! I did enjoy Betsy Russell reprising her role as Jill, Tobin Bell as Jigsaw in flashback scenes, Cary Elwes as Dr. Gordon, and I also thought that Gina Holden as Joyce was very good, even though she didn't play a huge role in the film. The film's execution was also terrible. This is supposedly a mash-up between the story lines for the originally planned seventh and eighth films in the franchise, but the eighth film was canceled after Saw VI didn't meet box office expectations. This film focuses on an author named Bobby, who earned fame and fortune by pretending to have survived a Jigsaw trap, only for he and his cohorts to fail miserably when he actually is put to the test. This isn't a bad storyline by any means, but the execution and the acting of the main character just made everything dull and slumberous. And, if that wasn't bad enough, this is yet another Saw film that has the "anti-hero" of Hoffman as Jigsaw 3.0 as the focal point. Enough is enough! Hoffman is a completely unlikable and corrupt character, and is basically a blatant murder rather than a philosophical villain who wants to teach those who inflict harm onto the world to appreciate the life they've been given. We've had four whole films of Hoffman as the villain, much more than Jigsaw or Amanda, this is inexcusable! The only thing this film excelled in was the traps, all of which are extremely brutal, graphic, and gory. They definitely pushed the limits of what you could get away with showing in an R-rated film, this was practically NC-17 fare. I guess these scenes may be enough to satisfy the gorehounds and horror fans who don't really care about an actual story, quality acting, or good dialogue. Otherwise, Saw VII is not for your viewing nor enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody adious, to a great horror franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last of the series, and hopefully the last, although there was 'spose to be an eight one in the pipeline. This bloodiest Saw ever, that goes off on a real sour note I must add, the last scene incidentally ending up being, the same location, the first scene in the original took place: that sh..hole of a batheroom, or is it just fate. There's a lot of bloody trashy violence, the kind that you can sink your teeth into that de cheapens the quality of the pic, that well earns it's R rating, one of only two, that earned an R. Sometimes we feel the violence just takes over from the story. The saga sees the continuation of corrupt cop (wonderfully played by former Adelaide'in Costas Mandalor who really throws a brilliant component of menace into this role, trying to tie up some loose ends. God, he's really hated, this guy. The real plot here, sees a fake victim of Jigsaw's (Sean Patrick Flannery, another unsuccessful face lift and all, I first was dubious about his identity)unlawfully triumph, by becoming a novel success. He's concocted a cock' and bull story of escaping one of Jigsaw's fictional traps. One of his fans of course, is Jigsaw, himself, (the great guest starring Bell) who of course makes sure no deed is unpunished. As for this pic being in 3D, this one didn't really need to be, only causing a bit of aggravation to the paying moviegoer. It's hard to top the opening trap scene, that pits two friends strapped to a sawing device. Hovering above them, their cheating girlfriend. The question really posed here, "Should you let a girl comes between best friends?" They're also on public display this time, in front of sea of Uni students who can't whip out their mobiles fast enough to film the graphic outcome, intestines flying and all, blood too spraying Jigsaw's little clown on a bike camera device. This is a great, overly violent Saw to end this "enough is enough" franchise, but the overdone violence, in the nasty, and continual trappings, kind of detracts of takes away from the essence of the story, as if the 90 minute time frame is reliant on the gore, though I'm not complaining, I did love this Saw. Cary Elwes makes a guest appearances, limping his way through, his one loss of leg, making him one bitter dude over the years, like John Getz in The Fly 2.</fullReview>

Bobby did it for the money. Jigsaw gave him sixty minutes in his game. Bobby had to see the death of many people in that sixty minutes. He tried to help this people but he couldn't it. Everyone were dead. Finally Bobby tried to help his wife. Jigsaw punished Bobby. The founder of the game was Hoffman. Bobby's wife was dead. He saw everything and he cried.

In some scenes it gets to the point where the bodies are literally wobbling they look that fake.The sub-plot involving the 'survivor' is really well done, its just he is wearing way too much make up and looks like a cut price Edward Norton.Tobin Bell pops up briefly, and Mandylor look as constipated as ever. The acting is horrible in this, and there are some people who are almost corpsing its that bad.Elwes saves the show, and the legacy comes round full circle at the end.Plot holes aside (how on earth did they get that opening set up in the middle of a busy street without anyone noticing?) it's an okay end to an okay series of films.But when you watch the first movie and compare it to this, you realise how absurd that movies have become.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game Over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAW 3D brings a slowly declining franchise to an understandable and compelling close, at a time when even fans of the series were perhaps beginning to tire of Jigsaw's gruesome games. In doing so, the majority of 'gaps' in the storyline were eliminated, and the franchise was granted a degree of closure... which will, of course, be ruined should SAW VIII plans be green-lighted. As ever (and unfortunately it's become all too formulaic), this particular outing presents us with a master-trap, which ultimately has on effect whatsoever on the overall story-arc, and only serves to satisfy some of those less intelligent viewers with underwhelming blood and guts. With that being said, the traps remain effective and imaginative, and cannot entirely be written off as entertainment, depending on your tastes. And the storyline too is of course developed further... following Hoffman's survival of the reverse bear-trap, he goes in search of Jill. But, alas, Hoffman has fast become an unpleasant and detestable lead character... whereas Jigsaw couldn't necessarily be regarded as an out- and-out villain, and therefore presented the viewer with a conundrum, Hoffman is just downright unpleasant. All the same, it's the ending which makes SAW 3D worth watching. It's the perfect end to the franchise, in many ways, and I do hope that further inferior sequels don't occur. If you've enjoyed the series thus far, and aren't bothered by one or two effects which are literally present for the sake of 3D, then this film is recommendable. At the very least, it's better than SAW V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by the ending, but still a major disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a huge fan of the Saw movies ever since the first one came out. The gory traps and twist endings kept me coming back every Halloween to see the next one.However, as much as i hate to say it, the so called 'Final Chapter' was a pretty big disappointment as many things were left out that Saw fans really wanted to see (John Kramer, aka Jigsaw was only in the film for a few minutes). The last few Saw films had dropped in quality but this one was a massive plummet. Some of the traps (like the public trap) didn't even follow the 'Saw way' (bad people being tested, not people who had cheated on others, etc), which made some parts of this movie looking like something from Final Destination. On the other hand, some traps did impress me, in particular the car trap and the blind trap on the planks.The 3D aspect of Saw 3D didn't add too much 'wow' for me, as i don't see the Saw movies being something that needed the 3D effect. There were a few moments that made you jump thanks to the 3D but i don't think it was needed at all.The Saw movies aren't known for their powerhouse performances, but the acting in Saw 3D was terrible, especially the whole Bobby Dagen and his associates story. I don't feel that entire plot was needed in the story. I'm sure that much of the Saw fans would've preferred the chase between Hoffman and Jill, with more Jigsaw screen time.And now we come to the ending. The return of Dr Gordon put a smile on my face even though i had sat through an hour of disappointment. The final "game over" did make up for the negatives slightly by returning the first and best Saw movie, which is something fans had been waiting for for a long time.Even though this was the 'Final Chapter', I am unsatisfied and would love another Saw film to cut off those lose ends and end on an even better note. Recommended for Saw fans only. 6/10 :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw chased itself around 6 movies prior to this supposed final chapter. In doing so they created a lot of problems and lines of questioning that really needed sorting out. The film begins with the return of an old friend. It's great to see Dr. Gordon back, even if it is only for a few minutes. Elwes slips back into the role perfectly, but gives us a much darker Gordon. Meanwhile, Hoffman is hellbent on killing Jill. It all gets a little too personal at this point. SOme traps are used for distractions, and ANOTHER cop with links to Hoffman is brought in as well. Donella gives an awful performance. So bad, it sticks out in even this rather simple franchise. His delivery of lines is so off putting that it dragged me from scenes. The main trap of someone that has lied about surviving a trap is just filler while other plot points are finished. It isn't the perfect ending, their are still questions. But it will do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>saw 3d......had it not been the part of the saw franchise...it could have easily been gone in history as an unnoticed one....but since it's the part of one of the most exciting franchise...the expectations were humongous.....and it crushes them quite well. The only thing which it carries from its prequels is amount of gore..and yes not to forget those traps...but it disappoints in the rest of the department...The story,screenplay,writing..everything is pathetic and it reaches to a limit from where it can't get worse...The way the series has been terminated....it could have been done easily in the 6th installment itself....but it appears that the makers just wanted to add some more money in their kitty...so they come up with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rushed but a good conclusion to a great series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Saw series, ever since I saw the first movie I ate up the rest of them. I didn't bother seeing the last one in theaters, and I waited for DVD. Its probably my least favorite Saw movie, though that doesn't mean it was bad. I thought it was good, but not as good as the rest. It almost felt like the movie was being rushed, but that's probably because there was supposed to be an eighth movie, so they probably had to rush it.Cary Elwes reprises his role as Doctor Gordon, alive and well, but we all knew that, now didn't we? This kind of gives away some events of the movie. It would've been better if we had seen Doctor Gordon and how he survived in the second, and left us to wait and see what happened.Overall, I thought it was good. The ending was MAGNIFICENT, though kind of spoiled earlier in the movie. I thought it was a good wrap-up to the whole series. Good in that sense.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading all these nasty comments and reviews about Saw 7 made me even more eager to watch the movie. I finally did, just out of curiosity. Besides, I'm a huge fan of the Saw movies. I'm not looking for deep, insightful stories, but mostly just the gore scenes, which first attracted me to this movie. Before watching the last movie, of course you can't do it without a good, all-day long, Saw marathon. Sadly, this probably is the reason why I gave this movie such score. Remember the glorious days of the first Saw, with the ending completely made you mind blown. Don't get me wrong, it still blows my mind even after watching it all over again. Then comes the Saw 2, which was again, still, mind blowing. So complicated yet fun. Then Saw 3, Saw 4, Saw 5, Saw 6...I started to realize one thing. After Jigsaw died, the movies were never really the same.It was shown VERY clearly in the Saw 7. The traps were lame and ridiculous. It wasn't even fun to watch. During the first scenes, two men and a woman were trapped because the woman was cheating on both of them. Since when does Jigsaw bother with people's romance? That was just weird I laughed the whole scene while eating my meal. Then Chester Bennington's scene came up (YAY FOR CHESTER!) but then he was GLUED to his seat. Doesn't sound like Jigsaw to me either. I was just excited to see Chester but not excited to see the trap. It was quick and weird. And of course, the crew just decided to follow with people's assumption that Dr. Gordon was the guy behind every traps. He didn't even show up that much in the movie. Wow guys, NOT PREDICTABLE AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. Well this part seems to be the most disappointing.There is one catch at the end: Dr. Gordon is still alive, being Jigsaw's successor, yet when he tricked Hoffman, there were 2 other masked people to help him. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?? I still couldn't believe it is really the end. "Jigsaw" is still out there, even though he is not even close to being the John Kramer.If you're curious then watch it, but you don't need to really watch it anyway. I'm sorry, I've always been in love with every Saw installments, except for this one. This last movie left me laughing to its simplicity and stupidity, unlike the first movie that left me in awe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best, but definitely has the closure you want.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so before you read the rest of this, take a look at this list and see if your preferences match mine:Saw 1 - The BEST Saw film. Most will agree, and for good reason. Saw 2 - An incredible Saw film. Brilliant twist and scary. Saw 3 - Very gory, and the plot twist was great. Fell flat in some places. Saw 4 - Traps start to make less sense but still a good, satisfying Saw film. Saw 5 - Worst in the series by far. Weakest plot, twist and just mindless gore. Ending was kinda cool tho. Saw 6 - Great recovery, spine chilling, awesome twist, mega gory. On par with Saw 2 IMO.So what to say about Saw 7? If you agree with me on my opinions of the previous films then here is my genuine opinion - Saw 7 was a little disappointing. I think the reason for this was that I expected way too much, hoping that this series would end with the MOST AMAZING TWIST and incredible plot lines, all questions answered, viewers immensely satisfied with the series.With a blank opinion on the film walking into the cinema people would definitely get that satisfaction. Gore-lovers would ADORE this film, especially those appreciating the retro-80s pink/red blood usage that this film has adopted. Saying that, this film doesn't deliver the absolute tension that 6 did with the traps (the breathing apparatus with the smoking guy, am I right?) but some did make me recoil in horror as to what was going to happen to these poor people (the racist's girlfriend under the car) and generally the film kept me on my seat. SPOILER SENTENCE - one thing that really impressed me was that they FINALLY showed the reverse-bear trap contraption actually ripping someone's face open. Savage and immense.In terms of plot and relevance of these traps to the individual were a little questionable. They were just imaginative ways of killing people basically, as opposed to a Se7en-style ironic punishment, like a dude who cuts himself for attention is put in a razor-wire maze and has to cut himself badly to stay alive sort of thing. Now it's more about the person's relevance to the main character like in saw 6. Acting from some people were terrible, others were pretty good. Chester Bennington from Linkin Park surprised me.The ending really surprised me, in more ways than one. It was -sorta- well thought out, and the few revealing moments in previous films really added up. I personally thought Dr. Gordon should have devised the whole Jigsaw thing and put John Kramer up to everything so that Gordon fixes his cancer. That would have added irony to the first film as well, but hey I guess I'm not in the position to tell people how to do their job.To summarise, definitely see it. It's definitely good closure. The series resolves very well, and ties up all the loose ends as much as it needed to. Don't expect the climax to leave you as jaw-dropped as some of the other twists in the series, but the series has been amazing to watch through my late-teen years, and this finishes off very nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The so called final chapter isn't a grand finale, but ends with a whimper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so this is the so called final chapter for this long running franchise and that is basically the only thing going for it. So yeah basically the only reason to watch this movie is to see the end of how it all comes down. And for the most part there isn't a distinct feature that makes this movie a great or even good final sequel. I am not even sure if this is the final movie, maybe it might get a reboot or something in the future. The 6th movie gave the franchise a chance but after watching this 7th installment I am glad there isn't going to be a 8th installment for next Halloween. It does fill in the missing pieces somewhat, but the movie just doesn't go in the epic grand finale direction. However if you want to see a lot of brutal torture machines and a lot of blood and gore, you might not be all that disappointed. The plot is very simple and not engaging at all, it just tries really hard to throw in a lot of victims that has to go through Jigsaw's machines. So basically most of the effort went to Jigsaw's machine and hardly went to the plot at all, which is a shame cause this is suppose to be the final chapter. I couldn't help but not pay much attention to this movie but just follow the very narrow story in order to see the end. The plot in this franchise is mostly ridiculous but it's taken to another level in this one, especially with the timing and character decisions.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a must watch to 'wrap-up' the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I have only seen this in 2D, but I know for a fact there were lots of those textbook 3D shots. And whilst they add to the overall experience they aren't necessary and so I don't feel like I have missed out on much. There were a few issues I had with the 'last of the Saw films': firstly the blood is too light to be realistic enough to suspend my disbelief for even a moment (I am an aspiring film-maker &amp; so I find it difficult enough to do this anyway!)- this may be due to the issue of having to light the scene enough so as to add adequate depth of field for 3D, secondly it misses those engaging Tobin Bell monologues that was a huge convention of the previous Saw films (but what can you do when you gave the main character terminal cancer in the 1st film &amp; had to kill him off at some point... and subsequently ran out of flashbacks), thirdly it misses (until the end) that iconic crazy music-video-style editing from Kevin Greutert. Onto the plot itself- its great to see Cary Elwes reprise his role as the, up until now, elusive Dr Gordon who vanished after the first Saw film. I won't spoil it too much for you but, as always with these films, expect a surprise. Again, Costas gives a fantastic performance as Hoffman. This film allows him to be the bad guy now he no longer has to play two sides of the character. But here's the point: there never was 'a bad guy' as such, I didn't view Kramer as the villain and, to an extent, I agree with what he set out to do- make the world a better place. But there may have been better ways to go about it. The point is that he wanted these people to live but Hoffman just carries out a bloodbath in this film where everyone is just being picked off one-by- one and it loses that essence of what Kramer was trying to do, which is what made the films so engaging in the first place. To the positives: We finally get to see the head trap work! Again, I won't spoil it for you but you will not be disappointed. The traps are new and inventive (which must have been difficult to do after 6 films of traps and then to have to keep coming up with new ideas), we get to see some old faces back into play through the Jigsaw Survivor Group and the film ties up all the loose ends very nicely... and then creates new ones! Which means it probably isn't "Game Over" for the Saw franchise. But how could they carry it on? Well, it wouldn't surprise me if at least 1 of the 2 survivors of the Saw V game have their allegiance to Jigsaw whilst the two survivors of the Saw 3D opening trap play a little game of their own. Who knows? Let the games begin...</fullReview>

It was a big surprise to see Dr. Gordon come back! We all thought he was dead when in reality he was helping Jigsaw with almost every trap!! I was literally like: :O! Fantastic twist and the best one in the series!! I would advise any horror movie fan to watch the Saw franchise as its unbeatable, no other horror movie sequels will be as popular or as good as Saw! There are a lot of unanswered questions though! My main one would be: Will Dr. Gordon become the next Jigsaw, or will he leave it now he done what he needed to (kill Hoffman)?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final chapter of the madman jigsaw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was out and about this Halloween weekend and figured I would take in a good old fashion horror movie to celebrate the weekend. I was at the local theater and took in saw 3d the final chapter of jigsaw.The setting for jigsaw's latest gore fest took place in what look like New York City to me. The movie centers on the survivors of jigsaw's traps over the last few films. They get together to talk about what happen with the self help guru and fellow survivor bobby Dagan played d by (Sean Patrick flattery). Sean has deep dark secret that unleash jigsaw's terror. There is a fight for the legacy of jigsaw between hi ex wife Jill tucker played by (Betsy Russell) wife and partner in crime Hoffman played by (Costas Mandylor) that cause a lot of grief for the local police dept as they try to solve his murder traps all over the city as Hoffman tries to catch Jill and keep her quiet? wink wink. The traps set all over the city are going to make you cringe. I guess that's the point with jigsaw right. The story line about how bobby Dagan came to be who he is in the movie a how he became the so called survivor is good for a horror movie like saw.The 3d effect made the movie bloody and gory, it actually made me cringe at the trap scenes coming out of the screen. One example is a scene that Jill tucker was dreaming about. Hoffman had her tied up in a warehouse and sent trap flying towards her and split her in half. The body parts came right out of the screen and felt like it would d land on your lap. The 3d effects in my opinion are a good thing for horror movies it adds to the effect of the movie. I thought the use of the junk yard at night was a great effect from the character Hoffman and his mind set.I would give it 3 stars for the story line and the 3d effects and some crazy traps that I won't describe I'll let you go see it for yourself. All in all I had a productive day before Halloween got my errands done, and took in a guilty pleasure of this Halloween treat.My link is http://thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too short, but a satisfying wrap-up to a brilliant horror series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel some people have been rather harsh with this chapter, Dr. Gordon's re-appearance may not have been a complete surprise to some fans, and after careful observation, I expected it too. However, to say this is the weakest of the series is very unfair to the creators efforts. Keep in mind, after months of friends trying to talk me into watching it, I finally gave in and began the series with an open-mind. I too, not being a big fan of gore/torture, liked and now own the whole series. Strangely enough, I expected somewhat worse from this series-torture wise than what I got. My biggest complaint with parts IV thru 3D is they made them too short, horror films can be 2hours long and still not bore me, the Scream series did the right thing-the story lines added up quickly, and they certainly never got boring.) This series didn't disappoint either, any of it overall, but there were a couple parts in this chapter that were a little cheesy, plus and I am so fed up with the so-called expert critics saying this series is poorly written, I beg to differ, I've been a fan of horror for years-Final Destination 2 and 4, even though I enjoyed them, were more poorly written than this! Long story short, I overall enjoyed this series, and felt it had a nice, bloody wrap-up. This is however my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The long-running "Saw" series comes to a conclusion with yet another gruesome installment. "Saw: The Final Chapter" (renamed from its theatrical version, "Saw 3D") attempts to wrap up any and all loose ends within 90 minutes in an effort to ensure that Jigsaw's legacy will not go on. Unfortunately the film-makers just can't get out of their own way and what the viewer is left with is just another "Saw" movie that provides no real closure but rather leaves a few loose ends dangling in the wind. But hey, the traps are pretty cool! To explain the plot(s) would be an insufferable headache. So to keep it simple, the test subject at hand here is a self-help guru (Sean Patrick Flannery) who claims to have survived one of Jigsaw's life-changing traps. Unfortunately for him, somebody is on to his secret and puts him to the test to see if he can truly live up to the story he has built his fame upon. You can almost see Tony Robbins squirming in his seat with each and every gnarly and nasty trap laid out on-screen.If you've seen all six "Saw" movies leading up to "The Final Chapter" then you pretty much know what to expect. Fact is, the series was played out about four installments ago, but the writers (Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan) have done a remarkable job of pulling plot devices out of thin air and creating new characters for us to despise. Speaking of despicable, beware of the acting in this film, which hits an all-time low. The worst offender of all would be Chad Donella, who plays newbie detective Adam Gibson. Donella obviously studied at the Matthew McConaughey school of acting and serves more as the unintentional comic relief of the show than an actual tangible protagonist.Having knocked the film for its convoluted plot and horrendous acting (Flannery, you're alright), it must be said that "Saw: The Final Chapter" at least delivers what the fans expect at this point. There's plenty of gore to go around with the traps themselves being every bit as outlandish and uncomfortable as you'd expect. Long-time fans will get a smile on their face as an old character comes back for one more round, which is appropriate because at this point nobody else but the die-hards are following along. Shamelessly, the film wraps up in an all-too predictable fashion, leaving the door wide open for the inevitable "Saw VIII: A New Beginning." Game over? Hardly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Saw franchise has been deteriorating since the first movie at a rapid pace. The first film had Jigsaw putting two men into a situation where they would have to do something to survive. Each had an opportunity to survive and it was a test (a brutal one) to force that person to do something to change their way of life and move forward. Saw was not about guts and gore. Along came the usual Hollywood B.S. and Saw degraded into another hack-em/slash-em franchise. Everything is designed to show more ingenious ways to kill someone with a huge lack of storyline. The thing that bothers me the most is how innocents are now being killed left and right. How one person has to save others or they die and that other "victim" has no opportunity to save themselves or an explanation why they are there without a way to redeem themselves. The latest installment has an innocent wife being part of the butchery for no reason. The essence of the movie is gone and it is just another teenage hack-me-up movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Return of the Doctor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way 'Saw 3-D' suffers from being too faithful to the formula. We want to see Jigsaw's struggle be carried out and it isn't. I don't really care about the Bobby Dragen subplot. I want the film to showcase the legacy of Jigsaw and the characters he's entrusted it to. The Dragen subplot isn't what the fans want. I got into it but it ends so cruelly even for a 'Saw' film. If you wanted to it let Dragen win his wife's freedom otherwise don't do it at all. But we didn't pay to see Bobby Dragen did we? We paid to see Lawerence Gordon.Is 'Saw 3:D' the best of the series? No. In all seriousness I think this thing should have ended with III because that is such a perfect ending. Could the 'Saw' series sustained it's self? No probably not. I think what kept it going was the wait and excitement for the return of a character that for some reason the audience really identified with. Saw could only end when Cary Elwes said so.Why? Why was this Dr. Gordon character so fascinating? I think by acknowledging him as the fan favorite that you admit the first 'Saw' was the best one and it was. What many don't remember though is that the first 'Saw' film doesn't fall into the genre that cinema snobs so affectionately call 'torture porn'. The first 'Saw' is a well written gritty thriller which contains Cary Elwes' finest performance. Over the course of that film we witness a calm and collected cultured man driven to complete insanity over the course of a film. It was fascinating and thrilling to say the least. Could Gordon survive? Wow that was the question of questions. He didn't look good at the end of the first 'Saw' and in all seriousness probably had no right in living to see another day. What the producers of 'Saw' did was really a very intelligent marketing ploy. They knew that should 'Saw' develop into a franchise that Gordon's fate would be the question on everybody's mind and they tortured the fans. Over the course of five sequels that didn't feature Elwes they threw scraps at us, always referencing Gordon's existence but never his fate. It built a loyal fan base. They couldn't end 'Saw' without Gordon and they couldn't just show his corpse because it would have been the insult of insults. Was the wait worth it? It depends. I have to admit I am a fan of the 'Saw' films. I don't see them as masterpieces of cinema but they have a clever villain in Bell's Jigsaw and a formula that works. As a fan I was thrilled to see Gordon crawl to up to that pipe to cauterize his wound. My regret though is that the film doesn't exploit Elwes at all. Cary is in the film for nothing more than an extended cameo.This entry fails to use what made the franchise work,Tobin Bell. I almost think Bell had more screen time as the corpse in the first entry. The ideal 'Saw' finale would have given Elwes top billing and made him the star and showcased his relationship with Jigsaw and the world after getting out of that trap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best film in the series, but it comes close.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what is being billed as the supposed "Final Chapter" of the popular &amp; financially successful SAW series (How many times have we heard that before.........?) the filmmakers attempt to wrap up their story. Best selling author &amp; "Jigsaw survivor" BOBBY DAGEN finds himself caught again &amp; forced to play another game, this time to save his trapped wife, who will meet a horrific end if he can't make it to her within an hour, while trying to save the life of his colleagues &amp; personal friends. Meanwhile, a detective goes on the hunt for Jigsaw apprentice DET. Hoffman, who in turn is seeking revenge on Jill, Jigsaw's widow over what she did to him in the last act of the previous film. Will Jill escape Hoffman's wrath? will the detective be able to kill Hoffman? &amp; will Bobby be able to save his wife &amp; friends? or will they all fall prey to Jigsaws already out of control violent game? &amp; will Bobby ever be able to tell his wife the real truth of why they were really caught? SAW: THE FINAL CHAPTER (Billed as SAW 3D in theatres) closes out the series (for now anyways) quiet nicely &amp; should please fans of the series. The direction was pretty cool &amp; the acting is still one of the many series high points. The film also manages to ratchet up the suspense &amp; continues to give fans cool &amp; inventive death scenes &amp; traps that they have come to expect from this series &amp; it was cool to see CARY ELWES come back, as fans finally get some questions answered regarding his fate at the end of the far superior first film. All that aside, another thing I applaud the film-makers on this time is avoiding spending to much time on past events involving Jigsaw, by going back to scenes from past instalments to show us some hidden secrets, the film wisely spends most of it's time in the present. What I also liked is TOBIN BELL, much like his role in the first film, is wisely kept off screen for most of the movie, in fact, he's barely in the film five minutes! &amp; the gore scenes are painful to look at &amp; very well executed for maximum effect. That said, I'm glad (&amp; hoping) that the series is over, at least for a few years, since the series has long worn out it's welcome &amp; as one can see from watching the film from beginning to end, there was really no more places to take this series, no more new avenues to explore. What started out as a truly terrifying suspense horror thriller, with the 2004 original &amp; it's sequel quickly evolved into just another pointless cash cow/slasher series with a new film being released every Halloween &amp; while I enjoyed the series, I felt that it took away from the mystery &amp; intelligence of the character of Jigsaw, not to mention the story, instead of going to the theatres to see a truly terrifying thriller, with audiences not knowing what to expect from the engrossing &amp; thrilling story, became more along the lines of "I wonder what cool trap Jigsaw &amp; his apprentice will use to kill somebody this time" it became more of a series, where people went to see other people being horribly mutilated grand gunogl style. In the end SAW: THE FINAL CHAPTER is pretty cool, it delivers in spades what the fans want &amp; expect from the series, it doesn't skimp on the gory, painful kills, it has a decent amount of suspense, interesting clues, red herrings, interesting twist endings, great directing &amp; acting, however horror fans who have seen their fare share of these kinds of movies, will more than likely figure out the films shocking final "twist" ending fairly early on. Recommended to fans of the series, one of the better entries in the SAW cannon &amp; one of the current horror films where the 3D actually looked good &amp; helped the film along in many scenes.***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we finally come to the end of the Saw films, and i can honestly say its about time too. With the release of Saw in 2004 came a new style to add to the genre horror, which was refreshing, original and quite frankly genius. What started as a low budget horror, filmed mainly in one room with minimal actors, Saw soon became a blockbuster and Jigsaw a new iconic name. The problem is what seems to happen with a lot of films, and that is that the filmmakers take it too far. The Saw sequence should of come to a close along time ago, and with each new release came all new cracks in the narrative.Saw 3D is by far the most gruesome to date, with every other scene showing a new and more cruel 'test' for the subjects. However as much as i like a gore fest, this film only seemed to be focused on this aspect and the plot and characters were lacking because of this. As a member of the audience, you were emotionally detached from the characters and therefore not really bothered if they survived or not.The one thing that did surprise me about this film, was the return of Dr Lawrence Gordon. However, to find out that he has been an accomplish of Jigsaw for a number of years, felt both unbelievable and unnecessary. How many more accomplishes can one man have? In actual fact how many 'tests' is Jigsaw actually responsible for? Looking back at all the Saw films, it has certainly been an interesting ride. The only thing that Saw 3D does, as do the rest of the Saw films, is take away from the first Saw which was original and fresh. With each new film, came a set of new flaws. And the sequels only purposes seem to be to try and fit as many traps and twists in as possible, which make them a lot less credible than the first. I can honestly say that i am glad the 'game' is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, Friday the 13th went 12 movies (including the remake and cross-over, Freddy Vs. Jason) and Halloween crept to ten films. Not all, make that hardly any, of the sequels were good. Seven Saws follow that pattern and I admit, Saw VII (or Saw 3D) was set to be the worst until the finale of finales actually redeemed itself.What's to say, by this point? More twists, more torture and more terrible acting and dialogue. Make that more of the same. I found myself wondering "Why am I continuously watching this torture?" And seriously?is there any more reason to watch this gruesome and so-called "inventive" ways of people hurting themselves or others time and again? NO.So, I loved the ending. For two reasons: it was, in fact, a good twist and it does feel like the end. I hated this movie until the final 10 or so minutes. Nothing felt new, nothing felt fresh. Hell, Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood, as bad as it was, as least introduced something new: telekinesis. And Saw 3D, aside from the horrid and gimmicky "JAWS 3D" tricks, just threw in some completely irrelevant tortures, such as the store front threesome.Side Note: that threesome torture scene, featured in the preview, actually gave me some hope. I thought they were going to bring Jigsaw's games to the public, finally. Well, that's new! Ha. Though that happens in the first few seconds, and though I thought that would be the finale, it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the rest of the film, nor even brought back up. Talk about gimmicks used for 3D; this one was just to get increasingly empty theatre seats filled.I digress. The story is (mainly) about a novelist that supposedly survived a Jigsaw victim's trap and tours the country and has even opened a group session to the press. So much for the second A in AA.Obviously, he'll be the target for the new Jigsaw protégé, Mark (Mandylor) as the cops close in on the killer/non-killer. Meanwhile, Jill (Russell) the widowed woman who at one time wanted to carry on her dead husband's (John "Jigsaw" Kramer, played again by Tobin Bell) legacy and now wants immunity.Well, it's the same show you've seen for four sequels by now?until you get to the climax. If you must watch this trash, at least make it to the final "surprise." It's not the best shocking conclusion I've seen, but it's satisfying for one that's seen all seven in the series. No matter if they want to make Saw VIIID, I'm believing this is the "true" ending, like when Terminator 2: Judgment Day or Halloween H20 should have been to real ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Saw 3D: The Final Chapter"... The End is Here... and it is a good (but flawed) conclusion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saw 3D" (also known as "Saw: The Final Chapter" or "Saw VII") is here. The ending of an era. The apparent final entry in the series that Guinness World Records recently named the most successful horror franchise of all time. This movie had everything going for it! Hype, the return of Dr. Gordon, the promise of resolution... erm... the 3D... everything! And was it worth is? More or less. "Saw 3D" was a good conclusion, and it did bookend the series well, and answer 90% of the leftover questions. But it was also flawed. But I can say, for all the things it did wrong, it did just as many right.Here's my little spoiler-free synopsis: Hoffman, having survived his death trap, is now after Jill, who seeks protection from two Internal Affairs officers. But Hoffman has a plan, and tonight their bloody battle will finally come to a climactic showdown. At the same time, Bobby Dagen, an apparent survivor of Jigsaw who has profited from his experience and celebrity, has been placed in a new game which will expose his lies and test the fibers of his being...The film is directed by Kevin Greutert (let's skip out on explaining the controversy, it's old news) and written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan ("Saw IV"-"VI").Commenting on the direction, even though Greutert was brought in at the last minute, the visuals are well-done. The film is well-directed, no surprise there. His visual style from "Saw VI" had to be altered somewhat to accommodate for lost time and the 3D, but it's still well made.On the 3D: I actually thought the 3D used in the film was well done. It was used to add depth, and was very subtle. They didn't fall back on relying on cheap gags too much, and aside from one or two "blood flyin' at ya!" moments, it was very tasteful.The writing, based on what we've seen, was decent. Though you can tell that Melton and Dunstan had enough ideas for two scripts. (As the story goes, there was originally going to be two more "Saw" films, and their scripts had to be condensed into one when it was decided that this entry would be the final chapter.) The film does move a little too fast, and we don't get to spend quite as much time with the characters as we ought to.On the acting. Well... the returning actors (Costas Mandylor, Betsy Russell, Cary Elwes and of course Tobin Bell as Jisaw) are all good. Some of the newcomers are decent (Sean Patrick Flannery does an alright job as the new lead Bobby Dagen), while others fall flat. Chad Donella as Gibson, the new central cop character stands out in a hammy, cheesy performance that elicits more laughs than tension. He's just too over-the-top.The traps this time around are a mixed bag. I'd argue that about half of the traps are incredible (I won't go into detail, but the fabled "Horsepower" trap is possibly the best stand-alone trap across the whole series! And there is one trap that made me wince with it's gruesome portrayal of poor dental practice) while the other half are only "allright." There are no "bad" traps, but it felt like with some of the traps, Jigsaw just threw up his hands and said "Um... I don't know what to do here." There are some other problems with the film. Due to the fact that there were so many story lines to tie up, the movie does reach a point where the story and characters stop developing, and we get what feels like climax after climax, as the story lines all try to wrap up. It works, but it hampers the suspense a little bit. Also, there is a factor of predictability with certain points of the film, which may leave some fans disappointed. But nothing that I'd say was inappropriate. I'm more than willing to accept a predictable twist, so long as it makes sense and was appropriate for the story, and that's how I'd classify the story... predictable at times, but appropriate.But overall, I enjoyed this film. While not quite the ultimate "Saw" experience fans hoped for, this movie does wrap things up pretty nicely. I can easily see this being the end of the series. And at the same time, it does still pull the trick of leaving you wanting more. So honestly, I'd be satisfied even if they do eventually decide to resurrect the series.I'm giving "Saw 3D" an average 5 out of 10. It is the end of an era, and as a fan, I am very sad. But, despite some enormous problems with the film, I am also satisfied overall. Farewell, Jigsaw! The past seven years have been great, and I will continue to re-watch your films until the day I die! For the last time, I sadly say, "game over."</fullReview>

Awful, pathetic, uninspired ending. Let me tell you something else: I ve read that they are already filming Saw 8 and it will be all flashbacks. Given the crappy ending of Saw 7 which, by the way, is quite an open ending, I bet all my money that there will be a Saw 9 and 10.What else to say? thank God I didn't pay for any of the movies.My advice: watch it on TV or download it.Nothing else to say...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great finale, otherwise disappointing movie (review from a Saw fan)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well there we have it folks! The ending to the Saw series! Well at least for the moment, until Lionsgate decide to announce an eighth film, or until some rookie director decides to re-boot the series in a few years' time. The yearly days of seeing bloody gratuitous violence invade our screens are finally over. As for me, I'm a die hard fan of Saw since the first film, but the most recent movies don't have the same depth as the original three movies, where Tobin Bell's character actually had a lot of meaning, whereas he is mostly (and mysteriously) re-used in every film, even four years after the character's death. Coming from the point of view of a Saw fan, this review will probably contain spoilers from this film and the other Saw movies, so if you haven't seen the movies, I recommend you click away from this review.I was a bit skeptical upon entering the auditorium from Saw 3D (or Saw VII depending if you're viewing the movie in 3D or not), partly because of Rotten Tomatoes' consensus saying it was the worst movie of the series. Is it the worse? No. I found Saw V (2008) to be pretty bad, but still I found a way to like it. Saw 3D is a bit better than Saw V, but otherwise, it's the second worst movie of the franchise. Perhaps I was expecting too much out of Kevin Greutert, who had given us the incredible Saw VI last year. This year, his film is mostly sloppily directed and, for the most part, badly acted. Sean Patrick Flannery, Chad Donella and Laurence Anthony give borderline acceptable performances, while the rest of the actors are just plain bad. Cary Elwes and Tobin Bell give the best performances, but expect their characters not to be used more than 5 minutes each.The traps I felt were very unoriginal. Besides for the opening trap and the closing trap, the traps in between were uninspired. I mean, am I the only one to believe that trap number one and trap number two resembled themselves a little? The spikes looked a lot the same, and really, it's a good thing that the challenges for main character Bobby varied a little because the traps looked no different from one another. The trap with Chester Bennington was unbelievably unrealistic. Another thing that bugged me was Gibson's character. He was unnecessary to the franchise, it just felt that the scriptwriters threw him in only to kill him afterwards, as if to say that by the end of this film, the Saw series will have killed all possible cops and have dealt with all the possible characters. I felt bad for Donella, because he really tried to make Gibson likable. The 3D was also lack luster, being used in the opening scene and on three other occasions in the film, none of them being more than five seconds each.The good parts? Well the seventh Saw film shows us a pretty good ending twist to the whole franchise. Gordon's character might be used only five minutes, but he does play a HUGE part in the film despite very little screen time. The film seems to take us back in time by showing us clips from all six previous instalments, showing us familiar locations such as the infamous bathroom with Xavier and Adam's rotting corpses, and a familiar foot seems to be in there as well. The image is also beautiful, only because of the 3D (the screen is HD if you are viewing a real-D 3D projection). The opening trap is pretty exciting, and some of the dialogue (rarely) is actually pretty amazing as well. But of all of the positive points, the ending is the best. You will not believe how much I enjoyed it! There is also a few hidden messages for the fans only, like when Hoffman kills the cops (meaning Hoffman was not a real Jigsaw killer since Jigsaw had never really killed anybody, while the ''Reconstructing your life'' door has an effect on the poster, where Jigsaw is being rebuilt on a construction site.So final view? Saw 3D feels a bit rough over the edges, but overall, I enjoyed it and I had a good time. The seventh instalment might not be the best, but it offers an impressing twist and a couple of exciting traps. The series, now being an excuse to show bloodbaths and torture scenes, might have lost some of it's queasiness. But overall, whether you are disappointed by the final movie, or if you enjoyed it, when Hello Zepp plays for the final time in theatres, you should be sitting in your seat with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Ending to a Genre-Inspiring Franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every year I get excited over the prospect of a new 'Saw' movie hitting me in Halloween. (I have been able to watch them eventually, just not at the cinemas!)Saw 3D is not the best movie out of the franchise but it's definitely not the worst. The good points: Firstly, the fact that Hoffman is still as evil as ever. Jill and, of course, Jigsaw are also present and these three characters really carry the film on their shoulders. The main guy we follow throughout the movie is not very likable at all but I'll get to him.The traps are crazy including the first ever trap in a public place. This was cool yet I found it slightly disappointing. It didn't live up to the hype it was given and wasn't very long at all. The actors were awful, too. There is a wonderful garage trap which was wicked and featured Chester from Linkin Park as the 'tested' person. The infamous 'Reverse Bear Trap' also makes an appearance in another Saw movie. And the ever talked about twist at the end showing who the killer is. I was pleasantly surprised even though I had guessed it would be them. Definitely wraps the franchise up perfectly.Now the bad. The acting in places was absolutely awful. Too over-the-top even for the circumstances the characters are in but still. Tobin Bell has the least amount of screen-time in the whole series (unless you include the body on the floor in Saw). Such a shame because he really does bring Jigsaw to life.I mentioned the lead character earlier who I thought was unlikeable. His whole story is boring and annoying. He just comes across as a complete douche-bag even when he's trying to save various important people in his life. Not a hero at all.The 3D was also pretty lame considering it had been bigged up so much although it definitely looks better than post-converted 3D movies.So, overall, Saw 3D is a nice wrap to the series and definitely a brill movie. One to watch and to add to your DVD collection. Saw will certainly be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak entry. Mildly satisfying closure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, it finally comes to an end. I can't make up my mind whether this was good or bad. I loved the return of Doctor Gordon, but the twist was rather noneffective considering he only pops up in the movie twice. I didn't like how Jigsaw was only in one scene. I didn't like how Jill has been turned into a damsel in distress. Nor, do I like how bad the effects are. But, the last act of the film is quite strong. I loved Hoffman in the police station, it was rather cool. The twist was entertaining, but as I said before, non affective.This is pretty much all I say. A weak entry with a mildly satisfying closure. Please don't make another one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a Saw fan for years now. From watching the original masterpiece downright to the most recent, I can admit it was a roller-coaster ride...but with bumps along the way.For me the first 3 movies were good. Their twists were great and the storyline plausible. The 4th one wasn't bad but the producers were already relying heavily on traps stretching their Saw philosophy far away from the original psychological thriller. The 5th was simply crap. The 6th gained back some of the lost ground but still the story was feeding on traps: a curse that sealed Saw's series fate. The 7th...well not much fresh stuff had been put on board making the movie us unintelligible as its predecessors.In short, the whole demented journey started smartly enough with 2 persons trying to save each other to an idiotic carnage that was only allowed to be made if people died in barbaric traps.The storyline never resurfaced high above the ground making Saw 3D another good excuse to make some more bucks. The truth is that the final chapter sucks and Bobby Degan's situation (an echo of Jeff from Saw 3, Rigg from Saw 4 and William from Saw 6) is completely forced to make the movie 90 minutes long. I thought that Chester from Linkin Park was going to have an impressive role, but I won't speak a lot about it...also the producers said that Chad Donella was going to leave a mark in the movie. What were they exactly hinting at by that? Chad is a good actor but here, he's only role was to keep the police on the show. Frankly, I watched the movie with interest only when Jill, Hoffman and Dr Gordon had their screen time.On a positive note, this threesome continued to work on their own character as the scared and pitiful Jill, the killing machine Hoffman, and the mysterious Gordon. The climax, although it was predictable from Saw 2, is what makes the film worth watching, and absolutely nothing else. There was no big twist but it worked out nicely. It was the first time in my life to see a standing ovation in the theater after a horror movie ended! However I won't say this is the end yet. Unfortunately we're left with a question when Hoffman blows up the house of horrors. Who saw the movie will understand.In the end next Halloweens will miss Saw. In my opinion it's better this way.</fullReview>

There was a surprise or 2 and it wrapped up some loose ends we were wondering about before.

		<fullReview>OK. First things first. I really really loved Saw 7; I would love to congratulate director Kevin Greutert and the whole crew of the movie. They just did a FANTASTIC job with it and you guys really made your fans happy. Having said that, I actually am obsessed and in love with the saw saga since came out in 2004, and the whole story that goes within because its not just another typical "horror" movie; there's a REAL STORY that makes u wanna know every single detail of whats going on there. However, I have a few questions that cant get out of my head. Yes, we all know now that john (jigsaw) helped Dr Gordon when he saw his foot off in the first movie, but of course we saw that in saw 7. My question is, if Dr Gordon survived after crawling out of the bathroom with the help of john of course, WHY HE Didn't RETURN FOR ADAM? I mean, he knew Adam was still inside of the bathroom ALIVE, so, why he didn't go back to help him? after all, thats what he said to him in saw 1, remember? and he didn't. Thats my number one question. 2) After being saved and helped by john, why did he help him in his saw traps? he was just a victim at first, he didn't know what was going on at the bathroom when he was being tested, so, why did he? and why he didn't continue working at the angel of mercy hospital? why moving to another hospital? 3) what happened to his family? last time we saw Diana and ally was when they were getting help after being kidnapped by Zep. 4)this is a really good one, WHATS THE DEAL WITH THE HOUSE? I mean, we all know that the house from the first and second movie is the same one from the 5th movie where strahm died, but WHY THE HOUSE WAS REMODELED or RENEW. It looked like it was abandoned in the first and second movie, WHAT HAPPENED THERE? 5) This is a really good one too, what was the deal with the fire alarm that we heard in saw 1? It seems like that was linked to the 5th movie with the fatal 5 plp. Saw 7 didn't explain if Mallick really burned down that house/building or whatever that place was and if the drug dealer that gave him the heroin to do it was really Xavier from saw 2? U guys following me so far? hahaha6) We realized in saw 4 or 5 that Hoffman was one of the detectives that was investigating the "disappearance" of Dr Gordon (strahm saw that when he was checking Hoffman out, when he was getting suspicious of him, and that was in some folders he was reading at the police station), but he didn't know that Dr Gordon was kinda accomplice of jigsaw.So if he didn't know and clearly he didn't because Dr. Gordon put him in the bathroom at the end of saw 7, and cuz of the letter "I KNOW WHO YOU ARE" in saw 6, why Hoffman never checked him out to make sure he would never come back?...this is more like an opinion of my own than a question. I just wanna know what u guys think. 7) who helped Jeff at that factory when detectives tapp and sing (saw 1) found the place, what happened to that guy? 8) how did Hoffman know Amanda was involved in the death of Gideon? (the baby of john and Jill) he wasn't there. it was just Cecil and Amanda, so how did he KNOW? I have a lot more questions but if keep writing and writing, ill never end, so this is it so far. LET ME KNOW WHAT U GUYS THINK SAW FANS. LOVE YA. LATER! PS: ANSWER BACK :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Acceptable Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Halloween 2004 a "Saw" movie has graced the silver screen and started what is tentatively going to be caped as a seven year tradition. The seventh and purportedly the final installment of the Saw franchise titled "Saw 3D" hit theaters with a bang the 2010 Friday before Halloween and has been received by most followers of the franchise as closure and a wrap up of a great succession. As the title suggests this seventh chapter is being presented in a third dimension which unlike some of the other 3D films out there, appeared to make great use of this strategy including having blood and guts come flying at the audience and giving the viewers many nice first person perspectives of the terror that blazes throughout the picture. With the "cool" 3D aspects set aside, the story of the Final Chapter seems to be a little weak and uncreative when compared to other better received previous installments including "Saw II" and "Saw VI" the latter Saw 3D shares a very similar story line with where the audience follows a protagonists and his journey through transformation of traps designed to give him and his acquaintances a better outlook by means of a series of painful tests and allegorically placed traps. As mentioned before Saw III and Saw VI shared this similar basic plot structure, however unlike the forth mentioned Saw 3D brings many other aspects to the table along with the main game so in a sense this repetition is considered to be "ok" by the reviewer. One of these new aspects includes the return of Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) whose character had not been seen since his escape from the industrial washroom trap of the first movie. The idea of bringing back past characters is a significant part of Saw 3D, and really gives it a push for tying up loose ends, something that this film did to near perfection. Perhaps another new theme which should be noted is the amount of sympathy that the viewer may feel for the struggling characters even though not much screen time was put into their personality development, something which is rather new to the series, as is the past most of the victims are so unlikable or represented in such an appalling way that there is little or no sympathy for their pain and demise, although it should not go unsaid that there is still the traditional arrays of low characters which include the lead singer of Linkin Park and his Neo-Nazi followers as they participate in a side plot of the film, which sees perhaps the one of the most shocking chain of events in the series played out in a matter of seconds. This shock, along with many new and creative tests and traps can only put points in the plus column of this concluding film. With such a sincere combination of a traditional Saw horror and action, along with the added bonus of the third dimensional facet, Saw 3D does exactly what it set out to do, eliminate all loose ends and unexplained story lines, while keeping with all the traditional themes and inspirations which has given this franchise the legacy it holds today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet again assorted unfortunates are placed in over-elaborate traps in order for them to try to avoid unpleasant deaths for themselves and others - and when I say unpleasant, I mean grimly and explicitly gory. Given that this particular effort is in 3D, this means lots of physical trauma leading to blood and tissue being sprayed at the camera. Exactly what you would expect, in fact.Tobin Bell puts in another appearance as Jigsaw - no mean feat given that he died four films ago. I found myself wondering just how many old grudges he had which resulted in him devoting vast resources and planning to posthumous payback schemes.Betsy Russell and Costas Mandylor put in repeat (and, presumably, final) appearances as Jigsaw's widow and bent cop Hoffman, and Cary Elwes turns up to reprise his role from the very first Saw movie.There are no surprises here, but I must say that I liked the unexpected ending. The 3D wasn't bad, but was far from essential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Corrupted Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) survived the trap that was set by Jigsaw's former wife Jill (Besty Russell). Now Hoffman is mad as hell, he truly wants Jill dead and he is adding some new traps for his victims for the last time. Hoffman has his eyes on Bobby Degan (Sean Patrick Flanery). Who is supposed to survived a Jigsaw Trap. Bobby is a self-help guru, who achieved fame by writing an successful book. Hoffman has kidnapped Bobby, along his wife Joyce (Gina Holden), his publicist Nina (Noami Snieckus), his lawyer Suzanne (Rebecca Marshell) and his best friend Cale (Dean Armstrong). Bobby has 90 minutes to save all of them before it is too late.Directed by Kevin Greutert (Saw 6) made an entertaining horror-thriller with some amusing cheap thrills and some gross-out moments. Greutert is no stranger to the "Saw" series, since he edited five "Saw" movies (From the first one to the fifth movies). Tobin Bell, who played Jigsaw is barely in this one. Since his character died in the third movie. Screenwriters Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan did really tried hard to keep Jigsaw character alive by only using back-stories to that character.Since i seen this movie in Real 3D, the 3D effects did work quiet well. But the biggest surprise of "Saw 3D" is Cary Elwes, who played Dr. Lawrence Gordon is the original is back in a small supporting role. Although, i wished Elwes role was bigger. But Flanery is a stand-out in the role. "Saw 3D" is actually better than some of the sequels. This was an fun movie to watch in a movie theater with audiences. Since this is the last "Saw" movie, one of the best parts of the feature is the surprise if predictable finale. Fans of the series will be quite happy with this one. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that being a massive fan of the Saw franchise i was really geared up for the new and "Final" film of the series and am sorry to say i was really let down. The film itself focuses more on the violence and traps than actually bothering to hand the main characters the screen time they need to wrap up the loose ends.I always liked the even blend of story and violence from previous entries but this one is an all out gore fest that really does take something away from the film. I don't want to give anything away even though the film is decent this is genuinely the worst in the series and it has clearly run out of steam and i hope they don't try and milk anymore films out of this already dry franchise.The 3D aspect was not bad in some scenes but don't expect an Avatar experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best SAW-movie ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that in the first place I didn't expect something new or extraordinary because we're here talking about SAW, where the principle of every death the same is. BUT the opening of the film was MIND-BLOWING! SERIOUSLY! To 'play the game' on a square where everyone can watch it BUT can't prevent it was just hilarious! So I think it was a dignified end of the sequels with great effects like always. Another thing is that I really just can't understand why the hell the producers made the movie with '3D-Technology'...I mean, was that really necessary to do that? The 3D-effects weren't that special or great at all... All in all for every SAW-fan, this movie is absolutely recommendable! Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D not so 3D (Concise review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Saw franchise and after watching this movie, I wasn't satisfied with it, by it I mean as a whole, the story was excellent and the ending was decent. but 3D wasn't the best choice. Unlike the other Saw movies where it seemed to be more realistic, The gore itself didn't look real. The funny thing is that they couldn't find a good time to use the 3D, so they had to make a lot of explosions just to make you feel happy with it.Another negative point in this movie is the victims, a lot of people died for no reason. in the past movies there were some good reasons or at least a reason to kill someone. but in this movie they have taken it too far. You throw an empty can from your car and then you end up being in jigsaw game WTF.In a nutshell, the movie is decent but not the best. if your a big fan of Saw franchise watch it but don't expect a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a brilliant satire in embryonic form here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These films have become a fast food franchise of menaces; each trap, set piece and sequence still has had more ingenuity applied to it than any of the dialogue, to the extent that the certification of the films is a moot point - we go to see these as slightly more meat flavoured Looney Tunes shorts come to life.By this point, anyone who is actually sticking with the series would forgive them simply bringing Jigsaw back from the dead - because, cinematically they do this throughout '3D' using flashbacks and Tobin Bell's voice as the audio guide to the chambers of horror Jigsaw heir Hoffman has hatched. In fact it is the heightened rusty, ergonomic aesthetic - a "clunk, click" chunkiness - to the Mythbusters-style death devices that maintains interestAllied to the usual cypher-characters-dispatched-like-Freakazoids-good-idea-bad-idea guy is something of an original idea. The industry of Tony Robbins-style self-help gurus is parodied slightly in the depiction of Sean Patrick Flannery's character. His is a man who has woven a self-help book career out of masquerading as one of Jigsaw's survivors. His character's arc is told efficiently, but so much more meat could have been wrought from a Tony Robbins/Doctor Phil style character having to face up to the inadequate nature of the advice they preach and punished fittingly as a result. The fact that the producers wimped out of truly putting this character through the mill - instead cutting back and forth to Hoffman's revenge on characters the audience couldn't care about in the slightest - betrays the fact that 'Saw' has lost its teeth. It does however, with the nod towards media satire, have a claim as being the first 'Saw' sequel since the original to possess a brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw Is Saw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*This is an honest review to see if you should watch it or not. You can't go into Saw expecting a perfect movie with no flaws. The producers are always looking for a small loophole to fill in the next one if the box office pours. There are plenty of loopholes for them to fix. I personally feel that there was basically no story and the traps were taking up the story.The traps: In my humble opinion, the traps were AMAZING and GORY. If you're going into the movie just expecting the traps will be good, GO. It's the goriest of all Saw's and it has not disappointed.If you're going to this movie hoping for the best story ever, you'll be extremely disappointed. Gordon's back, we all know it. What I hate about this is that even though they show him in the beginning, they fail to mention him until the end. Everything before that is Jill and Hoffman, and the traps. Sadly, Jill and Hoffman weren't most of the film. Most of the film was BOBBY DEGAN, who is a new and completely worthless character. So he lied, doesn't mean you have to ruin the finale with it.Overall, This movie is spectacular for traps, a bit cheesy at times though, but still well worth it. Super Saw fans will enjoy the REVERSE BEAR TRAP. They should've made this movie two hours, so they can expand on the story. Jigsaw was only in ONE scene. Gordon was In 2. Basically the whole movie was about a new character named Bobby Degan.If you're in it for the gore, WATCH IT!3/5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Final Chapter"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: Watch all previous Saw films before this one!The first couple of minutes of the film are eye-candy to any SAW fan, unfortunately the rest isn't much. The primary negative about this film is how much it is recycled. About 20 minutes into the film, fans will realize how similar the story is to that of the sixth installment. This is a major let down because is sucks up the originality of the plot and characters. Especially the protagonist Bobby Dagen(Sean Patrick Flanery), who is strikingly similar to last years protagonist. Both of whom are doing something which is cheating the public and are forced to undergo a series of tests to save people who have worked with them in order to live. A new detective named Gibson(Chad Donella) is introduced, and quite frankly i would rather have a detective from any previous installment come back to life and substitute with him. Donella's acting is very poor and least convincing of all, and it is because of him that many will say how horrid the acting is; yet this is a huge misconception. In my opinion Flanery is the most convincing protagonist since Dr. Gordon(Cary Elwes) in the first film. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is barely in the movie, he shows up for if not less screen time than Gordon. Both of whom seem to have only Cameo's. This is outrageous because he is in fact the main character of the whole series. We all understand that he died in part 3/4, but that should not be a valid reason for his cut down role. The use of flashbacks could have given Bell much more deserving screen time, as SAW VI gave us. It is really sad that Jigsaw could not be in the final installment more, it would have served good.SAW 3D is getting a lot of attention because Elwes is back as Gordon. Fans will be either disappointed or pleased to see him return. Although he is only in the film for a few minutes(total), he does play a pivotal role. This is where the two opinions diverge. The negative of Gordon is his screen time, yet his role is where he shines. SPOILERS: At the end of the film it is shown that Gordon was saved/healed by Jigsaw and later served him as a surgical necessity to future "games". Despite how clever the twist may be, it is not fully elaborated on nor explained. Assuming this is the last SAW film we may never know why Gordon did what he did; sad how the series does not pop the balloon, instead it just fills it up more.Aside from all these criticisms, SAW 3D does shine indeed. In fact one of the best things about the film is the traps. They are more creative and graphic in this one. SPOILERS: The only problem with these is that every trap ends with someone dying; no one lives. Fans who go to see the movie for the traps will be overwhelmed with joy. For those who are not worry about the traps and are viewing the movie for the story, you will not be disappointed. At least if you enjoy the end. The story is concise and not loaded with confusion like previous entries. It is also meaningful, unlike the useless SAW V which did not add nor take away from the main storyline of the series.The 3D is very affectionate but not well done. It is no AVATAR in terms of depth, but it does change the formula a bit. There are moments in the film where things fly out to the audience in a good way, other times it is poorly done. Such as the opening, a characters intestines fly out, but it is ridiculously computerized and no where near realistic. But these are only a few parts. Overall the 3D was great and a change to the series.SAW 3D is made for the die hard fans or those who watch the film for the gore and traps. If you fall along those lines go see the film in 3D. If you are unsure or in the gray area, i would recommend waiting till the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Final Chapter, hopefully.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie after watching Saw VI and seeing how its ending looked like the perfect set up for the finale of the series.The first complaint I have is that there is a gory scene in the beginning of the movie involving a love triangle between two young guys and a girl. The guys are faced with the choice of saving the girl they love and trying to kill the other guy, or just saving themselves and letting the girl die after finding out from the tape that she is a slut. The problem is, unless I missed something, this scene really has nothing to do with the plot of the rest of the movie. It seems to me that it was just a vain attempt to woo all the little young lovebirds spending their parents money. The 3D aspect of the movie was disappointing. There were only a few moments when I got even remotely excited with the 3D thing and still those were mediocre at best. Eighty percent of the movie would have been better without the glasses except the picture is blurry without them, so gotta keep them on.Also, I was surprised that the movie ended pretty much where Saw part one began with the foot trap. I was under the impression that the cops knew about this building by now and might look there before Hoffman had time to die of thirst (that's not to say that he would be any better off being found and facing the consequences of his murderous rampage).Apart from all that, it was a pretty nice gore fix. The reverse bear trap on Betsy Russell really stole the show. Not good, but not terrible. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trap-wise: lacks creativity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cons: Victims' ways of death in SAW 7 are mostly similar to those appeared before. Joyce's being burnt alive can be compared to the furnace in SAW 2. The opening trap resulting in death of the two-timer is even less menacing than the falling pendulum trap in SAW 5.The poking of Suzanne's eyes and mouth is similar to the bedroom trap for the rapist in SAW 4. Cale's being hanged to death is plain ordinary, like the hanging room trap in SAW 6. The jaw-tearing in the garage trap and the wisdom teeth-plucking both remind me of the classroom trap in SAW 3. And of course the reverse bear trap returns again; it caused Jill's death and although her face opened by the device is clearly filmed, it is not as gory as the shotgun collar that blows Lynn the doctor's head off in SAW 3. Pros: One original idea in SAW 7 is the fishing hook trap that it forbids the victim to scream or cry, which is an instinctive reaction for everyone in tremendous pain. Suggestion: Perhaps the writers can draw inspiration from the Bodies Exhibition to design more brilliant traps. I wish SAW 7 were not the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is going to be short and to the point.It was pointless to make it a 3D Movie. The experience would have been just as vulgar and disgusting and CHEAPER if it was 2D.The storyline: Well, I think we can all agree the any possible interesting storyline was 100% gone after Saw IV so I had zero "storyline" expectations.The characters: There is not one interesting character in the story and when it's accompanied by bottom notch acting it becomes laughable.The gore: Top notch kill scenes. The only apparent creativity is in the "games", which disgusts me as a human being but bravo with actually being able to increase the vulgarity after 6 prior installments.The finale: Closure... finally some closure.I have nothing horrible to say about Saw 3D as my expectations were not very high.I can say I do not think a better series of Horror/Thriller films exists or probably ever will exist but I would have also said that if only the first four were made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ending, but not one of the better movies in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no spoilers here don't worry....I gave the movie a 5 out of 10 only because it didn't "feel" like a Saw movie until the final 15-20 minutes. Some of the traps seemed way to far fetched and I am not sure if it was due to the 3d, but the special effects seemed a little cheesy in this film.That being said, the ending was great. If you are a true saw fan it isn't really a twist, but it ended the way it should have.However, if they ever decide to do an 8th film, there are ways they can still continue.Definitely recommend seeing it....the ending is exactly how it should have been though there are still some questions unanswered, but in my opinion it is not one of the best in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously? Its like they decided "you want traps? you want blood and gore?... well sit through what feels like 2 hours of not much else and we'll see how you feel about wanting more after that" I did enjoy the movie.. Compared to 2,4 and 5 but I guess I was hoping for more a bit more plot then traps.. maybe a throwback to Saw 1 (as this really is a movie for the fans.. few regular folk care anymore) but it wasn't to be.. There were a few great traps in this that were genuinely disturbing and not too silly. For me the fish hook trap was the best, I could actually feel my stomach churning and yet this was probably one of the least graphic on screen. The tooth pull one had a similar effect and Bobby Having to do what he claimed he had already done was a great idea.. Less was definitely more imo. Now if these traps were spread out a bit and not just mashed together with the 101 other traps in the movie I may have.. whats the word?.. cared? But they were too diluted by the overkill. I think the biggest example of this was the trap which followed the fish hook one.. If he failed the hook trap she got spikes in the neck, fair enough. In the very next room if he failed the girl got spikes in the face... hmmm dejavu??.. oh and both girls died.. in fact everyone in a trap died. That also annoyed me. Did that reaaaally have to be the case? Couldn't bobby actually have redeemed himself and actually saved the poor innocent girl? Couldn't ANYONE have actually been "saved" by a Jigsaw test? isn't that the point? No we have to see a complete innocent burn alive and the "bad guy" (bobby) curl into a ball feeling sorry for himself. Whats the lesson there?? Don't lie or your innocent loved one will be brutally murdered whilst you get off pretty lightly?.. genius logic guys. I was really bummed after that and my ears were so tired from an hour or so of screaming that I almost missed the twist.. Maybe after all, this is a movie for the fans? maybe we'll eventually all get credited somewhere as we have all thought up the apprentice gordon storyline at some point, but most of us have been a bit more imaginative as to wtf gordon would help out in the first place. As predictable as it was, it was the ending I wanted though.. I just wished we had a few less traps and another 2 mins of the Gorden/John backstory. Maybe a 3rd and less predictable twist would have been after agreeing to and helping and aiding John, Jill AND Hoffman.. Gordon THEN takes down Hoffman with other members of s.u.r.v.i.v.e and its revealed that Gordon decided to bring down the whole legacy from the inside.. A twist within a twist.. but what can I say? the writers were off the ball by the end. Im glad the didn't try and stretch it over 2 films and as much as I have loved the Saw series, its this final instalment that has killed any desire in me to ever see a Saw 8 (this film gave me enough Saw to last 2 lifetimes)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Saw 3D' is a disappointing finale to a pretty good series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For six straight years, the Saw series was a staple of Halloween. As they said in several of their trailers and TV spots, "If it's Halloween, it must be Saw." Each film had something new to bring to the table, and each film usually had some redeeming qualities even if the film itself was bad. So, when 2010 was announced to bring us the final installment in the Saw series, most fans were upset. After all, there was originally going to be a Saw VII and a Saw VIII, but due to less-than-amazing returns on Saw VI (thanks to Paranormal Activity), it was combined into one final installment. So, all of this begs the question, does Saw 3D (or Saw: The Final Chapter, as released on home video) effectively wrap up the Saw series? Let's find out.Saw 3D (or The Final Chapter) follows Hoffman as he tries to get to Jill, Jigsaw's wife, as revenge for what happened at the end of the previous film, while a man who lied about being a "Jigsaw survivor" to become famous is tested.Let me start off by saying, this film is a mess. It's one big giant mess, and that's the best way to describe it. Taking a step down from every other film (yes, even Saw IV), this film really does feel like they crammed the scripts together for what was originally to be Saw VII and Saw VIII.Let's get some positives first. The acting from all of the returning characters (Betsy Russell, Costas Mandylor, Cary Elwes, Tobin Bell) are all about as good as you would expect. For the first time in this series, I can't say the same about the other characters. Bobby Dagen, as played by Sean Patrick Flanery, is just an awful character and while Flanery might not be a bad actor over all, his acting in this film sucks. I can say the same about the other character tied into Dagen's game. Gibson, as played by Chad Donella, is okay. He over-acts sometimes and half the time looks like he's disinterested, but he does alright for a character with zero development.I did like how Cary Elwes's character (Dr. Gordon) from the first film returned, and I did like where his storyline went. Sure, I didn't exactly like how they executed it (it was very rushed and seemed like it came out of nowhere), but I did like that he got to come back for the last ride. I did also like Hoffman's hunt for Jill. Sure, it wasn't explained enough, but it was rather entertaining watching Jill try to hide from Hoffman in a police station. I probably don't even need to say it, but the music by Charlie Clouser was as good as usual, and worked especially in the final five minutes.Let's get to the negatives (because holy hell, there's a lot of them). Most of the traps were very bland and uninteresting. Bobby's test, as a whole, was just so wholly unintriguing that I just couldn't help but be bored. All of the tests were either very simple or just so generic that it feels like you've seen them before. There's only so many twists you can make out of the whole "series of traps in a building" thing before it becomes tiring, and this is the film where it finally became that.The two traps towards the start of the film (before Bobby's test begins) are truly just uninteresting. What made the other ones interesting is how realistic they felt, or how helpless you knew the others felt. The Public Trap is just illogical and trivial, and took me out of the film. Why is Jigsaw now targeting three people in a love triangle? I absolutely hated this trap. And while I know the Car Trap has some effects on the rest of the plot, it just wasn't a cool enough trap, and again, I didn't care at all.The entire film looks really odd, especially in the blood department. Now, I know it was done because the film was originally released in 3D, but couldn't you have fixed the pink blood for the home video release? Especially if it's not in 3D? It just frustrated me because every time I noticed it, it took me way out of the film.Overall, guys, Saw 3D: The Final Chapter is a disappointment. While the acting, some story lines and the music are all as good as ever, the overall test, most of the traps, some of the characters and the pink blood really ruined the film for me, and made this a subpar ending to a pretty good film series. I do hope they make a Saw VIII, if only to correct the mistakes that this film made.3/10. | Grade: D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's talk about the DVD first. I watch all my DVDs on my computer. For whatever reason, I could not bypass the previews and ads no matter how I tried. So I was already frustrated by the time I got to the actual movie. Now let's talk about the movie. I loved the original. I hated this one. The original Buzzsaw character was witty and animated. This one is boring and lacks wit (even though he seems to try at times). I found I did not care about any of the characters, so it did not matter if they died. And the death scenes, for the most part, were not all that original. Original death scenes are what made the first film so entertaining and frightening. They had the stuff of dreams, of nightmares to play with and the studio messed up. They had modern day special effects to work with and still created something that wasn't as affective as that which was presented to us decades ago.The acting is largely good, save for a few moments of "over-acting." I cannot believe the high ratings from viewers. The central dance was OK, but the lip-sync was absolutlely terrible, my dog could have done better-- and he doesn't speak human. Lucky for me my DVD was scratched so I missed a few scenes, sparring me the ordeal of having to watch the film in its entirety. Do yourself a big favor and look for something else. "Le Sang des b?tes" is actually (pardon the alliteration) a better made film on the same topic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The series ends on a bum note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bland, ineffective finale to the series. Whatever the deficiencies of the previous films, at the very least they had momentum and a gruesome inventiveness. The last few sequels may not have been strictly necessary but this is the first one to feel entirely pointless. The ongoing plot is played out, the new characters are entirely unmemorable, and the big callback to the first film is just silly.Its listlessness may be in part due to returning director Kevin Greutert being literally forced to make it; he was dragged off competing movie 'Paranormal Activity 2' thanks to the 'Saw' producers invoking a clause in his contract. His direction is unimaginative in the extreme, but who can blame the guy? Even the montages seem lazily put together. It doesn't help that regular DP David Armstrong has gone and taken with him the series' grungy aesthetic, in its place a brightly lit and thoroughly cheap-looking movie. When this was at the cinema I was quite excited by the potential in an outdoor trap where the participants are watched by a huge crowd, and by the concept of a Jigsaw survivors group. Unfortunately nothing much is done with either of these ideas and the whole thing has the feeling of a big sigh and 'Well, may as well make another one you guys'. The 3D added nothing and on TV it's flatter than ever. Pffttt.</fullReview>

You see the first few had a real story and meaning, but as it continued on it basically turned into a gore-fest that made it big in the theaters. There was a nice concept to this movie but it was poorly executed, and done rather poorly. The only reason these movies are being watched now are because of the gore, and if that is what you want in movies then definitely check this out, but if you are looking for a well made and well created movie skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr Gordon has returned! Wow what a surprise! Ugh, no not really. It was obvious that the producers were going to bring him back when realizing this would be the last Saw film and that they would want to make it as huge as possible. Unfortunately, the moment I saw him, I immediately knew how the movie would end with him being involved. How did I know? Because most fans wanted that. It seems that the writers didn't have any ideas so they thought they would browse the forums, jot down the whole "Gordon being involved theory" and end the film that way. While I have no issue with giving the fans what they want, that only appeals to some movies. It just didn't work for this movie. I don't like watching a movie and knowing how it will end. The whole point of Saw was to catch you by surprise with its ending but i was not surprised in the slightest bit. If anything, it just left it open for a future sequel.The acting in this film was also atrocious. The actor who played Gibson was awful, I laughed as he tried to pass himself off as serious. The other's were pretty much as average as always. Tobin Bell in my opinion is always the best actor in the Saw franchise. Was a shame we only saw him in 2 scenes though.Also as usual with these sequels, each one tries to outdo the last with it's level of blood and gore. This one was no exception. Except, this time, we have the opportunity to witness it in 3D. The 3D was pretty poor to be honest, was way too gimmicky and just involved chunks of bone and flesh fly at you. One thing that really bothered me was just how over-the-top the violence was. Particularly when Bobby is removing his teeth and blood is literally gushing out of his mouth like a waterfall. While most Saw films to this point have been over-the-top, this was just plain stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The SAW franchise does not finish quietly. The ruthless,insane Jigsaw(Tobin Bell)with his brutal and twisted spirit are recalled by survivor Bobby Dagen(Sean Patrick Flanery), whose own dark secrets are brought to the forefront. The infamous and terrifying human traps are recalled in flashbacks by the few that escaped with their lives. To be exact this is probably the most interesting plot since the original movie. A satisfying conclusion to the series responsible for hundreds of screams, flinches and white knuckles. There is the suspicion that Dagen is not the survivor, he claims; but actually a Jigsaw wannabe. Featured in this installment: Betsy Russell, Cary Elwes, Gina Holden, Rebecca Marshall, Chad Donella and Laurence Anthony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it was about 2006 when I watched the first Saw, and then the second and then was just in time for the third one coming out. This Trilogy is by far the best horror movie trilogy and the most original I have ever seen! I became a fan and went and watched the movies 4-6 every year and the purchased each one on DVD, and although the films got worse each year, I had faith that the final Saw would be amazing, tie everything together and end the series with a huge finale and twist.This was not the case at all, this is by far the biggest let down of a movie for me, out of every film I have ever seen, this disappointed me the most. Not only does it use the same structure story as 3,4 and 6 (someone having to save other people), it was defiantly done the worst, the characters were not likable which kills the suspense of the traps, which were also the most unoriginal and just down right stupid traps of the entire series, I could of thought of more interesting and realistic traps that the stuff these writers came up with. The casting was just horrible, and the core series characters (Jigsaw, Gordon and Amanda) were given no where near enough screen time, but instead the writers chose to introduce all these new characters in 90 minutes and then rush through the plot points that related to the rest of the series. Just writing this review is frustrating me, so I will try to wrap it up. Basically, this movie was just made for money, and the producers only focused on the Gore aspect and completely didn't even care about the story of Jigsaw and his "legacy". I was the only person I knew that kept saying "Saw isn't just about the gore, its got a great story that's actually going somewhere." Well thank-you to everyone involved in the writing of Saw 3D as you have now proved me wrong. You managed avoid to wrapping up all the plot points left hanging in previous films, which really let all your fans down, if you enjoyed Saw 3D, then you are really not a true saw fan. You really took Leigh Whannel and James Wan's original idea and really just pooped on it. 4/10 is me being generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If words could even begin to describe how terrible this "Final Installment" was, then ill try my best to translate my emotions. October of 2004, i watched the trailer for Saw and honestly thought it would be another movie i see, and disregard. I was terribly wrong.Still to this day it remains one of my favorite films of all time. The 2nd being great also, 3rd being somewhat of a downgrade but good for the most part, 4th being great, 5th being pretty bad, 6th being great, i then witnessed this "Final Installment" where it was "All Supposed to End"?I laugh at the fact that the brilliant minds who changed the horror movie genre for the better, were even associated with this 7th film. It was the stupidest, cheesy, desperate, money hungry teen horror film i have ever seen. It is a disgrace it was even related to the Saw series. Ever since film 1, Dr. Gordon returning was a cool, funny little "idea" thrown around that became such a viral idea that if he were to return in Saw 3D, that would just be downright stupid and thoughtless. Well you can bet that they threw Dr. Gordon in behind everything in a desperate escape route out of the series. Not to mention it being advertised as 3D...Saw 3D: The Final Chapter... That title right there instantly places it with the sub-par films of the genre's such as Freddy vs Jason, Prom Night, My Soul To Take, etc... And as an avid Saw fan, you can't help but to consider the series a 6 film series, excluding the 7th from memory (from the face of this planet if possible). And about detective Hoffman's melee massacre he pulled off in a police station. One fairly trained man with pocket knife vs dozens of cops which were armed, hmmm i wouldn't have expected him to walk away untouched. And the two mysterious masked men along side of Dr. Gordon? Well as a series known for leaving no stone unturned, surely there would be a clever surprise behind this masks. Nope, instead for the first time ever in the series, we are given the final 10 minutes of the film to be informed we have two more masked "Jigsaws" who will never be revealed.Bottom line, if your a fan of the Saw series, you will be much better off skipping this one and leaving the series up in the air. As one of the most creative movie series of its time, they really fell short on this "Final Installment" where "It all Ends". Actually, fell short in an understatement... They walked of the top of the Sears Tower and landed in China. Congratulations crew, you deserve every bit of a 1 star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could watch this movie more than once, but it definitely isn't one of the best I've seen. There is still suspense in everything that happens-meaning that this film will keep you captivated as far as what will happen next.If seeing this movie, you will want Detective Hoffman to meet his demise. The actor playing that part did a fantastic job in playing the villain. The only thing about this movie that I didn't like was the beginning death. Sure those two guys should have left that woman, but there was no real significance to the whole premise of the story other than that they were caught in a Jigsaw trap. Even the trap with the skin-heads was linked to something in the storyline. All in all, this wasn't the best movie I've seen, but it wasn't as bad as some of the other Saw movies. Give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was on the chance of a really redoubtable, but thought- provoking movie. The best part is that Kevin Greutert never ends his films like you feel that it's the end of it.. it's like series, but they aren't. The director is unfailing from surreal and creepy-crawly situations. When you just try to grasp the scary scene, presently comes the next. At the end you are not satisfied, cause at first you can't process the whole. You have to watch it twice or more to guess the message of it. And that message is not similar for everybody, everyone'll find out the message that suits she/he in it.I'd recommend it for anybody, naturally not for children. But it's not one of the most creepy films of all.</fullReview>

I'm glad they brought back Cary Elwes for this one.The film is filled with gore and blood as usual, but all the traps seem so rehashed. It's hard to keep coming up with different ideas to kill people in some kind of weird contraption. In this movie, the game is centered around a guy that got rich by writing a book about surviving jigsaw. It was all lies. He should have known Jigsaw would be coming for him.FINAL VERDICT: Only watch to final see the final chapter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Same old Same old and no surprises. Lots of deaths in lots of increasingly horrible ways. I can't understand why horror film makers would work so hard to echo the parody of Scream but seemingly without even flinching at the crap they are producing! With each Saw, its so predictable that the gore effects will be more visceral and nasty than ever. There will be more deaths by means of ridiculous traps that would take days to set up in the first place and truly make planning anyone's death impossible to time or fix when or where it would take place. I'm stupid enough to have watched them all, mainly due to the fact i really liked the first Saw, but to be honest like most movie franchises you will feel let down and slightly dirty and this franchise is certainly no different.Anyway, nothing new here and if you like gore to the max then for this at least you will not find many films on a par with SAW 3D. The fact this film is all about gore and sick scenes and absolutely nothing else is why its a little sad and for a better word...Crap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Muck like the Friday THE 13th Series, the only thing truly memorable about the most SAW movies is the massive amount of on screen violence and this installment is no different, but first, let's start with the story. It's more or less a rehash of the other SAW sequels, with some guy walking around a abandon building trying to save other people who have been put in different torturous traps, of course this being a SAW movie he naturally fails to save them and the end up dead and no one's surprised. The acting in this film is okay, but not memorable in any way. Same with the rest of the SAW sequels. The characters are pretty one dimensional and Extremely forgettable. Honestly the only good thing about this movie are the special effects. They're very repulsive, but they still are convincing. In the end this is a truly boring film, then again the only SAW movie truly worth checking out is the first one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saw 3D" is just a bad and senseless movie that continues what the latest installments already did: to be a bad excuse to show as much gore and guts as possible and torture/kill the (very bad) actors in every tasteless way possible. You can say that after part 2 the spiral just went down and hit rock bottom with this 7th disaster that hopefully will be the end of this franchise. Cheesy! And what was totally painful to watch is, how the makers try to stick with this "pseudo moral" when everybody feels, that actually its all about sick imagination without any excuse. And of course its ending is threatening the audience with yet more sequels to come. The "big surprise" feels as spectacular as some hot wind. Just let it be over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's talk about the DVD first. I watch all my DVDs on my computer. For whatever reason, I could not bypass the previews and ads no matter how I tried. So I was already frustrated by the time I got to the actual movie. Now let's talk about the movie. I loved the original. I hated this one. The original Buzzsaw character was witty and animated. This one is boring and lacks wit (even though he seems to try at times). I found I did not care about any of the characters, so it did not matter if they died. And the death scenes, for the most part, were not all that original. Original death scenes are what made the first film so entertaining and frightening. They had the stuff of dreams, of nightmares to play with and the studio messed up. They had modern day special effects to work with and still created something that wasn't as affective as that which was presented to us decades ago.The acting is largely good, save for a few moments of "over-acting." I cannot believe the high ratings from viewers. The central dance was OK, but the lip-sync was absolutlely terrible, my dog could have done better-- and he doesn't speak human. Lucky for me my DVD was scratched so I missed a few scenes, sparring me the ordeal of having to watch the film in its entirety. Do yourself a big favor and look for something else. "Le Sang des b?tes" is actually a better made film on the same topic.</fullReview>

The ending was so shocking - I didn't see this one coming.I won't tell you what happens at the end because if you want to be really shocked watch the ending of it.I really want to see it again.I think this one is for the fans only.10/10 is my rating</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great ending of the most successful series to hit the theatres. Saw the Final Chapter. Detective Mark Hoffman, who acts on his own as the Jigsaw becomes a more complicated enigma where by finding new victims to hoist his status. By killing more victims using the most innovative traps to date. What was even more complicated was Jigsaw's widow trying to bring Hoffman in with the help of the police department by keeping her safe from Hoffman's wrath after failing to kill him. Jigsaw did not want Hoffman to keep killing, in fact he abhorred it. The reason for this, was because Jigsaw's old acquaintances was involved with just Jigsaw. Never people who were not directly involved in any way. This is what Hoffman was doing. He was killing people who were not directly involved in his life as the doctors or lawyers or even policemen who were involved with the real Jigsaw. This turn of events led Jigsaw's widow to try and kill Hoffman by Jigsaw's information. Yet in the background, Hoffman was being watched by none other than the original survivor played Cary Elwes. A true complete person who became Jigsaw's real right hand man. By this alone, Jigsaw got what he needed to be done right, even though his wife was to be a casualty. Never the less this film is as always gritty with iron traps and hydraulic joists. One of the most popular movie genre's to this day. Tobin Bell, (Jigsaw) is always wonderful to watch as he reprises his role to give the audience what they crave, to see justice done by way of the chain, spike, chainsaw, ripsaw etc etc. Recommended to those who love gore, blood, justice, and the idea that not all people who are they seem to be. Especially Cary Elwes, what a great twist to a great movie. Everything comes in a full circle.</fullReview>

There was as such no role of Doctor Gordon as well. The movie didn't connected to all previous parts at all.. highly disappointing ending!!!At least I was expecting there would be more conceptual ending of the movie but felt really sorry for watching the series after part 3.Basically Saw series should have been ended after the 3rd part. There was no use of making additional parts. Basic series was fun with Jack.Anyways I would just say it wasn't worth watching. The director seemed to wind up the movie in a hurry. And this was the most stupid step I must say to take as extending the movie length wouldn't have cost them anything extra.The Saw series lost it's grip in this last part. I was a gr8 big fan of Saw series but got fed-up after the 3rd part.The traps were good but they didn't make any sense. As Hoffman was also not supposed to be safe in the second last part. This was useless. Hoffman also didn't play a good role in the final chapter.total waste of time I must say!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all the film was great but there were not as many 3-d features throughout the film(nothing really eye popping from the screen)and the story concept was a bit messed up about Bobby claiming to help people(due to the fact he "survived" from a trap that he claims to have won)through a guru group and a book he had launched out about the Jigsaw survival he went through. But when he had to undergo all those traps to save his wife, that something he should release to the press about his "survival" to get to his wife he knew that neither of them would survive and die but at least she finally learned the truth about her man and his "survival" instincts in Jigsaw traps. But throughout the film Hoffman had been trying to find Jill and get revenge on her but found her at police headquarters and guarded very good. He pleaded with police to give Jill to him and he would stop the traps but the police refused and they all wound up dead including Jill in the original reverse bear trap that killed her with no key to release her or cut her loose from a chair she was in. But Lawrence did let Hoffman be in a room full of dead bodies(bathroom scene from saw 1) and this time with no hacksaw to free him. So he finally got what was coming to him death and no one to be with but dead bodies surrounding him. Best film ever I hope they don't make another film because Tobin Bell is getting to old for these kinds of films now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Masterpiece fabulous story told in 7 years. Some movies are made to tell us Why the movies are made and give us a good reason to watch movies. Marvelously written and brilliantly filmed, Very Interesting and Intriguing. The message of the Saw series movies are clear -- don't abuse yourself, don't abuse others, control your emotions, and be fair. Do not take drugs, do not smoke, do not cheat or lie, do not frame others, try to forgive, do not keep vengeance, control the obsessions, do not make profits on others death -- Follow the Rules, and you will win in the end. Do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome/ heinous. There are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are TESTED. But I think its a glimpse of hell, what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life, because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues. Its not a game -- Make Your Choices! Cherish Your Life!When the Legacy was handed over from John to Detective Hoffman, it all started going in the wrong direction. He tried to fulfill John's Will, but as he had lesser human side, and was going himself against the rules. He became a Victim to be Tested by himself. The Final Chapter is also more interesting with more gore and gruesome scenes and more people getting killed now, mostly innocent and police officers. Before it is Game Over!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, it says "The Final Chapter", let's see if that holds true, just as with the "Friday the 13th" series "Last Chapter". But hey, why stop when there is money in it and the fans want more? Anyway, I found "SAW VII" to be pretty much the same as the previous six movies, all are basically the same. You have awesome contraption to torture, maim and kill people. And in part 7, they didn't slack on these. The traps here were cool and lots of them will have you curling your toes and cringing in the chairs.As for the storyline, well, being a "SAW" movie, there really isn't all that much story, but hey, we don't watch these movies for the story, it is all about the maiming and the contraptions. But the storyline does prove to be just as entertaining as the previous six, and there are a couple of twists here and there, but nothing awe-inspiring. And truth be told, once the ending was revealed, I was shaking my head, it was a bit too much. But hey, I didn't direct the movie. I am but a mere movie fan.I am not going to go into details with the storyline, because I don't usually give away hints and clues to movies, I prefer to watch movies with a clean slate, and get my own impressions of the story, so I do unto others as I would have them do unto me. But I will say, that the story is thrilling and you get caught up in it, wanting to know what happens next and what is going on exactly. Just as the stories have been doing in the previous movies.The cast in the movie, actually did a good job with their roles, as usual in these movies. Although I didn't really buy into Chad Donella's portrayal of Detective Gibson, he didn't stand out on the screen. But aside from him, the people were great. As usual, you know what you get with Tobin Bell and his unique voice. Costas Mandylor also put on a good performance, though I was a bit baffled at how nicely and quickly that huge gash of his on the face became almost smooth like a baby's bottom. That was kind of lame.I found part 7 a bit more brutal and gory than the previous ones, which isn't a bad thing. Some might say it is a step backwards, but it worked for me. Because the increased brutality just adds fuel to that part of the brain that makes us sit down and watch these movies, the makes us sit and watch people tormented and kill in unique ways. Yeah, the things we go through for entertainment. Ha ha...If you liked the previous "SAW" movies, you want to watch part 7 as well. It is a good installment in the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a pile of nonsense. This film lies in a fantasy world where elaborate traps can be made in public spaces by people doing the bidding of a man who tried to maim them. OK, fine, I don't mind that. I can allow poetic license here. The thing that really irked me was that the victims acted in such a nonsensical way. When presented with a plug and socket at the top of a chain that needs to be attached in order to save my (entirely innocent) lovers life the last thing I would do is pierce my chest with the chain and hoist myself up. OK, OK, I understand, that is poetic license again. There must have been some one watching or something like that. But wait... this time it is in 3d!! Well, not very good 3d. The most effective use of 3d was in an advertisement before the film. Much of the 3d seems more like a layering effect. Oh gosh, what about that twist. The twist that, to my knowledge, the fans basically wrote on discussion boards. The twist where a character from films before decides to illogically help his tormentor. A twist that is a pile of horsepucky. There is so much room for error in the supposedly intricate jigsaw of life-affirming torture that it is only plausible to the most forgiving viewer. I really don't think I have seen a worse film since the Spice World film and at least that had no pretensions. Only watch this if you are bored enough to be watching all of them in a row (and even then you can probably miss it out).</fullReview>

Then they call it the last one. The one to end the Saw franchise. And they mean that in a good way. You still cannot stop but wonder if they would have considered this, if a little movie called Paranormal Activity did not steal their thunder in 2009 (which might also be a reason the movies got released with a week in-between them in the US).But lets stay focused with this one. I did expect a bit more after the end of the sixth part (yes it does make sense to have seen all the other movies before that, though the makers say, it is enough to watch just a few, like the first one). Actually that story could have been the central theme. But instead it is almost sidelined by another story. You might feel like you have seen those things before (one way or another this is true), but the 3-D effect(s) might save the day for you. Unless you really wanna know how it ends ... or does it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Saw 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years the film got passed on to filmmakers willing to bring the franchise forward when the original creative duo released their reins on the film, and directors and writers jumped on it to varying degree of successes, each adding their own imprint on the franchise, to what it is now - there is a new Jigsaw, but the handing over of that responsibility wasn't as smooth as what was thought out to be, plus some added twists and turns that each film brought to the table that to some may turn out to be a tad ridiculous since it involved some major predictions and forecasting that is hard to reconcile if narrative convenience isn't part of the overall plan.With 3D finding its way to the big screen these days with almost a guarantee of increased box office takings, it's no surprise that the latest and I presume final Saw installment would go this route for its last hurrah. After all, it does seem that horror flicks provide for plenty of ingredients to exploit the format in a cheesy manner, though the budget here meant less things got to be thrown on screen toward you. Production values are dumbed down a little, and I almost let out a chuckle when the first obligatory trap to show off the 3D format, turned out to be nothing more than one, yes one, piece of intestine being hurled / dropped toward the screen during a disemboweling scene, as will other objects in limited fashion as the story wore on.Like the films that went before it, this Saw installment has its cast made up of a blast from the past. The last time I saw Sean Patrick Flanery on a regular basis was many years ago when the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles was the rage with his role as the titular character made famous by Harrison Ford. Here he carries the film as the central character in a plot about a self help motivational speaker Bobby Dagen who propels to fame, purporting to be one of the many survivors of a Jigsaw trap, preaching about living a new lease of life upon his sacrifice to break free. Needless to say when you cry wolf, you'll cry for real when the wolf puts you on its radar.As with most Saw plots, we follow the protagonist n his quest to free people from the Jigsaw traps, which very often is to no avail because of hesitation, lack of courage, fear of sacrificing, running out of time, or a combination of those as the Jigsaw traps were designed to exorcise some of such demons and become that perverse moral educational piece. While crime and punishment Jigsaw style got meted out sticking to established rules, the self-execution traps by the new Jigsaws in the later part of the franchise somehow had lost the plot, and although still toeing the line with developments to their respective characters in not respecting the thought process and rational behind the gruesome punishment, the main bite in overcoming these traps become non existent.On the side of the law, we follow Detective Matt Gibson (Chad Donella) in the footsteps of cops before played by Danny Glover, Dina Meyer, Donnie Wahlberg, Scott Patterson, Mike Realba and Athena Karkanis in pursuit of the serial killer, only to find themselves almost always coming up short. If there's a fault to this film, it is the persistence to the formula that has gotten stale, with Saw 3D being nothing more than just an incremental narrative effort in giving the audience more of the same, only with a different looking cast.What continues to work is the sophistication of the traps involved to produce blood and gore in copious amounts, as they get slightly elaborate with each turn that you wonder about the creative engineering involved that does stretch the imagination of how it's all being wired up by a single person. Some scenes were obligatory and didn't fit in with the grain of the film, two of which stood out like a sore thumb were the opening gig which was set in public (just how can one wire that up without suspicion is a great mystery) which highlighted the attitudes of a Youtube generation, and the one set in a garage which put 4 persons under a minute's threat in win-all-die-all fashion.While some may find issue with how everything managed to get looped back to the first film with the presence of Cay Elwes amongst the ensemble, I thought it was pretty decent in closing a chapter to a franchise in somewhat tongue-in-cheek fashion to how everything is treated so far with flashbacks providing real meat to the story, a technique employed to extend the longevity of Tobin Bell's screen presence. Some questions raised in the last two films when it tangent off under new management got addressed here, and I found it acceptable if I'm willing to put aside plot convenience.It may have taken a while to finally get this here on our shores, but for fans of the franchise there's likely to be no stopping you to watch how it all comes to a full circle with all its gory details intact and without a detectable cut. Non fans will be better off catching up with the previous films should there be any attempt to watch this, otherwise it'll turn out to be nothing more than an exploitative film that raises too many questions when the big reveals roll along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Final episode? I don't think so............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the fact that they billed this movie as "the final chapter" was just a marketing ploy to get more people to go see it. This can't be the end. For example, remember the SAW movie where the surgeon, Lynn Denlon, was assigned to keep Kramer alive? Well, Hoffman told Amanda that if she DIDN'T KILL Lynn Denlon, he would tell Kramer of her involvement in the loss of Gideon (whatever happened to Cecil? If anybody deserves to be in a trap, its HIM). WHY DID Hoffman WANT LYNN DENLON DEAD SO BADLY? That has never been revealed. (YET). Also, at the end of SAW VI, Amanda is crying and she bends down and looks through a keyhole and sees Denlon's little girl. Amanda says to her, through tears, (through the keyhole) that "don't trust the person who saves you." That hasn't been explained either. I also seem to recall Kramer telling Jill that he had "made a way out for her", yet Hoffman ends up killing her? That doesn't make sense either. What was Kramers "way out" for her? Nah, there's just too much left open for this to be the final movie. You watch and see if i'm wrong. As far as my review of this movie, I didn't think it was as good as SAW VI. The traps weren't as good, and in some cases, actually STUPID (the blind guy walking on wooden planks in mid-air - he had to get through the maze in 60 seconds - yeah right - that was a trap NOBODY could beat). Oh, and don't forget about Dr. Gordon's cameo. Here we have a man who was FORCED to cut off his own foot. Now they are telling us he's involved in the traps? I don't buy that. It has always amazed me how Kramer never has any problem finding someone who would go along with him. In Saw 3D, it is revealed that apparently, Hoffman and Dr. Gordon were working with Kramer at the same time. Why didn't their paths cross before now? (maybe that will be shown in SAW 8). Then at the end,two people with pigs heads jump out and inject Hoffman with the knockout drug. One is Dr. Gordon but they never revealed who the other pig-head person was. Another loose end. Oh well, maybe Saw 8 will be better, or if they want to make this one the final one, they can still continue the series by calling it something other than "SAW." Just remember that EVERYTHING is driven by money. If Saw 3D turns out to really be popular, they WILL make more, believe me.By the way,this movie is scheduled to be released on blu-ray and DVD on 01/25/11. It will be released in both the 2D version and 3D, but i'm wondering if we will have to have a 3DTV and 3D Blu-Ray player in order to see it in 3D, or if it will be marketed like "My Bloody Valentine 3D" and come with green and red lens glasses?**** UPDATE 1/26/11 **** I just got the blu ray of this movie and my 3D question is now answered - There is a sticker on front of the case that says, "Requires a 3DHDTV - NO GLASSES INCLUDED." D'oh! Oh well, at least i can see it in HD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing about the 3-D version of this is the smoke and mirrors...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not kidding about this. Went to see Saw 3-D (Saw) today and like others have noted, this film didn't use 3-D to its average except in two cases...smoke and mirrors. The smoke/fog scenes are very well done. Very realistic. There is also a scene where Hoffman stares into a perfectly done 3-D mirror. So how about the other stuff? Well, if you are looking for blood splatter and flying body parts, you will be sorely disappointed, there isn't much to be had. The Final Destination had more than this one. The blood drops in the credits are nice too. It really set me up for a fall. The biggest waste of not using 3-D was at the end when Hoffman was burning the building with the Billy puppet in full 3-D view...how hard would it have been to end the series with a creepy burning 3-D Billy doll laughing slower and slower until the fire burned it up and fell into the audience, almost Wicker Man (1973) style? Most of the budget of this film was spent on the beginning scene in the mall with the wood saws and Jill's dream sequence, where she is cut up into pieces on a rail while Hoffman supplies the kill engine. This looks great in 3-D but the problem is that the other traps deal no such 3-D gross outs. I was surprised with the lack of gross out, given the ultra-violence that was in Saw 6, with the people attached to the carousel. It is mostly people getting impaled by objects or hung. There is some coughing up of blood, but this isn't used to 3-D effect. One would assume Jackass 3-D probably has more gross bodily liquids being sprayed out in 3-D than this one does! I have some issues with Saw 7, which make me want to try to find a Saw time line. I feel I need to suspend my disbelief even in such a far-fetched world as Jigsaw's is. I wonder how John, dying of cancer, had enough time to visit the character who wrote the book about his time as a Jigsaw victim, yet do all the other stuff he did. It seems like the book would have had to been written very early on, when Jigsaw was only starting his games and not very known yet. Plus how did the author not get questioned by police about it or how there was no criminal record of those events? It was also hard to believe Dr. Gordon, a man whose family kidnapping by Zepp &amp; Jigsaw was one of the main points of the original Saw, would willingly work for Jigsaw. Or maybe we aren't supposed to remember that? Sure, Amanda was a drugged up mess of a woman, so you can see her becoming an apprentice and Hoffman, he was pushed into it...but Dr. Gordon as a willing helper seems very forced, despite the "clues" about the surgery instruments and keys put into living people in traps, etc. It's also just not as satisfying the third time around because it's happened all before. Funny that, since this means Jigsaw has had a good record of "curing" people in his own sick way!This Saw doesn't have the crazy camera-work other Saws have. The soundtrack, except for the end, is very lacking. It is like the typical Saw was rearranged to work at a more and faster gory pace for cheap thrills than build up serious tension. This really works against the movie. The build up of tension was what had kept the Saw series going. Like other Saws, the acting isn't the greatest. I never liked Hoffman and the way that character was acted until I saw Gibson. The scene where he calls Jill "crazy" a few too many times, is pretty comic, though all for the wrong reasons. The way Gibson is acted makes the Hoffman portrayal look like an Oscar worthy performance. Bobby isn't much better. I get sort of sick of people yelling at people to "shut up" when they have a fish hook and key stuck down their throat, instead of the more educated or sympathetic way of dealing with things like prior Saws had. OK, maybe only Saw itself had that. It just makes me really unsympathetic with the characters and their plight and takes me out of a good movie viewing experience.Overall, I give this movie, despite it's faults, a 7 for Saw 7. Fitting I guess, since the Saw movies always reminded me of the movie Se7en. It still retains having a plot after six sequels which is quite a feat and though I do like this series a lot, I hope it doesn't come back years later in a worse form. This Saw was a good enough ender without it getting over the top silly. I do believe the 3-D was a gimmick to draw viewers to the theater. Unless, again, you want to see some good smoke and mirrors. If you are new to the Saw series, I would recommend you watch the other six first, because you will get lost with all the characters and subplots. Now I am off to find a Saw time line!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best "Saw," but certainly not disappointing:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first one enough to go see the second one. Although the second was more grotesque, I continued onto the third one the following year, and then so on &amp; so forth. The thing of it is: the people complaining about this movie most likely paid to see it. It was the top-grossing, #1 box office hit on the opening weekend, which, realistically speaking, will persuade the writers to want to make an eighth one. I'm not opposed to the idea, but I can assure a large sum of critics and fans alike are dreading it. Honestly, I will never understand that the most fascinating thing about the franchise is that it has come out year after year with a successful sequel since 2005 when Saw II surfaced, but every year, the same critics and ex-fans are suckered in and then dis the movie on every movie website and magazine known to man. I think people really did protest last year and sit out on Saw VI, seeing the premier of Paranormal Activity, but strangely this 7th installment grossed a lot of money thus far and ranks at a 10% on Rotten Tomatoes. I find that fascinating...Overall, my critique is just this: I adore the series. I was oddly the only person in the theatre when I saw it on the first day it came out. It was in the morning, so I understood people would probably see it at night as it's a horror movie and it was Halloween weekend. I wasn't thoroughly impressed with the 3-D aside from a nice effect at the end (that I won't spoil for you) and a few other moments. However, I enjoyed the plot and the summation of past characters who had survived. My biggest complaint is that the writers could have went a little more into the background of the 'survivor' characters rather than create a whole new agenda with some new characters, as fans of the series (like myself) are willing to pay attention to the backgrounds of some lesser explained characters from Saw V and Saw VI. I thought they at least ended it on an uneven note, which is good for Saw fans, because an 8th installment, whenever it may be, would be rewarding... the people who hate the series don't have to go see it, if you think you got the point and find the characters mundane, well, don't torture yourself... some of us out there like psychologically draining horror...My theory on all the Saw installments and their hasty releases is merely this: think of Saw as a TV series, but the episodes only air yearly with cliffhangers that admittedly keep bringing the crowd back because they keep getting ideas and producing more of them. Like a TV series, the Saw franchise offered consistency, balancing the gore with character backgrounds and suspense. Maybe it's a little grosser than "Criminal Minds," but it is a surefire crime-drama as much as it is a horror flick. It at least avoids the supernatural aspect of horror completely and navigates it's viewers thru a series of different plots as more and more information is revealed.Saw VII / Saw 3D offered almost everything it usually does to a Saw fan. I didn't even quite care as much about the 3D fx as I did about the fate of the series and it's antagonist. I believe I'm a little biased in reviewing the series as something with it clicks with me, but I swear, if you watched all of them, multiple times, this seventh installment wouldn't be a complete train-wreck to you. The progression of the series from Saw IV to Saw 3D was quite amazing. It involves a lot of thinking to sort of connect the dots in these movies, and at least this last installment could be the end or could promise more, which proves the director/writers were smart enough to leave the audience with a little anxiety (which is good for some of us, and bad for a lot of us).Saw 3D -- Entertaining at least? Yes. Nice cross-over from Saw VI? Of course. Hate it or not, they made it, even convincing one of the most acclaimed actors (Cary Elwes)in the series to come back for a round of mayhem. It sucks to say so for the regular movie-going crowd, but Saw 3D was for the fans and for their theories on the fate of the characters that remained alive. I'm surprised at how many reviews this received in general as the audience was a little, um, absent when I attended the first showing in my hometown."Saw VII / 3D" was another trick for the faint of heart and those sick of it all, but it was at least a delightful treat for us die-hards who sort of hoped in the back of our 'twisted' minds that Jigsaw would come out in a pig mask at the theatre and put us in a trap...8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i LOVE the SAW movies... they are my favorite horror movies. HOWEVER SAW 3D was BY FAR the WORST movie i have seen in my entire life. the acting was horrible, the storyline was horrible, the opening scene and the ending were the STUPIDEST i've ever seen. i honestly knew from the opening scene that i wouldn't like it at all, but i decided to give it a chance instead of walking out of the theater right then and there. i mean, it was my first time watching a movie in 3D and i did pay $10 for the ticket. coming from one of the biggest saw fans out there, i can honestly say i hope they don't make anymore movies. they're just running it in the ground just like all the other horror movies. they honestly should've stopped at the third one. im not trying to mean or hate on anyone, but anyone who says they enjoyed this movie, liked it or even thought it was "ok" or "alright"... im so sorry :o(bottom like... don't waste and hour and a half of your life or the money on a movie ticket to watch this piece of crap film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well and truly past its expiration date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope the posters for Saw 3D aren't lying. I hope this really is "The Final Chapter". It needs to be. Logic, even to a horror sequel standard, is sorely missing and the trademark twists and turns are predictable and lack the WOW factor they should have. Screenwriters Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan do very little well in fact, excluding a few nice tiebacks to the first film, and it couldn't be more apparent on the screen. At least the pair's writing isn't as atrocious as the acting on display. Suffice to say that no-one in the cast is working on a movie like Saw 3D for no reason, the material matches their (in)abilities perfectly.But who cares about the writing and acting when there's plenty of new and awesome killing devices, right? Agreed, if there was actually anything original about the gruesome means of death on show. Instead we're subjected to tiresome attempts to make us wriggle and squirm by essentially rehashing the same violence over and over again. There's also a useless over-reliance on CGI, which becomes all too obvious in the opening sequence. Surprisingly the decent 3D is used sparingly, thankfully limiting the amount if computer generated innards flung in the audience's direction.A boring instalment in a franchise that is well and truly past its expiration date.1.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Ending to a Long Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most people did not enjoy this film, I really did.Of course there were problems with it but its just a movie. The acting in this movie was good and bad. Bobby and Gibson were pretty bad while Hoffman was awesome. The plot was simple and not as confusing as Saws can be but I think it could've been much better. The traps were good, a standout in my opinion was the Fish hook trap. Not being able to scream made the scene quite good. While the Bobby test wasn't too interesting the other part of the movie was, especially the end scene. Now, heres a very short and not too detailed summary.The final Saw opened with what happened to Dr. Gorden after he cut off his own foot. Then it went on to the introduce you to Bobby. I disliked the fact that we had another new character. I think the movie would have been better if the main game was played by somebody we already knew. However, it wasn't and we had to watch this man, who was pretty dumb, go through a series of games because he lied about being a Jigsaw survivor. He barely had to do anything to his own body. Most of his traps were causing pain to other people he knew. The only thing he really went through was pulling out his own teeth (which would NOT have produced as much blood as they had) and stick hooks in his pecs. He failed his test and his innocent wife burned to death which completely went against Jigsaws "morals".Throughout watching boring Bobby, we were also shown random traps, like the public trap and the car trap, which featured Scream Queen winner Gabby West. Jill Tuck ended up telling the police that Hoffman was now behind all of the traps and so Hoffman was after her for the movie. He even went through the police station and was all Michael Myers like killing everyone in his path to get to her. She stabbed him in the neck and ran away. Instead of being a smart, strong woman I thought she would have been she ended up being a runaway victim. Poor Jill even was stuck with getting the reverse Bear Trap on her and for the first time ever in the Saw movies, it went off. Hoffman burnt down the building with all of his traps and as he was walking away three pig masked people attacked him. One of them revealing himself to be good old' Dr. Gordon. We then learn that he's been working with John as an apprentice the whole time. We're supposed to believe Hoffman never figured this out? Sure. That's believable. The thing that brought this movie up a few points is the very end. We hear the Final Zepp playing reveal that the package Jill had in the previous Saw was for Gordon telling him that if something happened to Jill to take action. So he went to a familiar place with Hoffman. First we're shown numerous flashbacks of people in the Saw movies in the room and we're finally shown Hoffman, chained against the same pole as Adam in the bathroom trap. We even get to see the dead bodies of Zepp and Adam (which I didn't like seeing because he was my favorite character) Hoffman instantly reaches for the Saw but Gordan picks it up and throws it out of the room. It ends with Gordon getting to say the final words and ending the Saw franchise."Game Over"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Franchise Bites the Dust . . . With A Lackluster Wrap-Up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest entry in Lionsgate's "Saw" franchise" is gruesome enough to make the grade. Unfortunately, "Saw 3-D" is a poor way to pack in a landmark horror series. When the original "Saw" came out in 2004, it not only established new standards for horror movies in general but it also gave rise to the 'torture porn' genre. Although "Saw 2" through "Saw V" often generated greater quantities of blood, sweat, body parts, and tears than the original, the grisly franchise lost its edge until "Saw VI." "Saw VI" furnished blood, gore, and more?principally cogent satirical commentary about our economically depressed times?like a cherry atop a heap of manure. "Saw 3-D" boasts only one top-notch scene, but even it is flawed. "Saw VI" scenarists Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan conjured up a worthwhile premise, but "Saw VI" director Kevin Greutert botched the execution. The 3-D effects are at best mediocre. Aside from Costas Mandylor, the thesping in "Saw 3-D" is barely memorable. Sean Patrick Flanery of "The Boondock Saints" registers inadequately as a self-help guru who survived Jigsaw's nightmare torture and published a tome entitled "Survive." Again, the premise is imaginative, but Flanery's performance comes off as woefully weak. "Saw 3-D" qualifies as the most immaculate where set design is concerned. One of the virtues of the original "Saw" was that it occurred in an ugly, filthy room. We were fortunate because we didn't have to smell the stench that permeated that old, disused men's room. After watching "Saw," anybody in their right mind would want to scrub themselves until their skin shined bright and pink. Those surroundings were so vile that you would be afraid to touch anything. "Saw 3-D" lacks the sordid but atmospheric surroundings. The victims here die far too cleanly. Only one gets cooked alive in an oven like a chicken. The others are either perforated or sliced up. It wasn't enough that the victims died horribly in even the lesser "Saw" sequels, but they had to die in incredibly slimy surroundings."Saw 3-D" brings back the physician from the original. Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes of "Robin Hood, Men in Tights") is back, and we learn how he survived. Remember Gordon cut off his foot with a hack saw and slithered out of the room. Here we get to see Jigsaw (Tobin Bell of "Mississippi Burning") splash water onto Gordon's face and get him out the door. Gordon cauterizes his stump on a scorching steam pipe. Imagine the pain as well as the willpower that he experienced. Meanwhile, Detective Hoffman is up to his usual murderous antics. Desperately, he wants to silence Jigsaw's wife Jill (Betsy Russell of the cult hit "Tomboy") who wants to talk to Internal Affairs about him. Simultaneously, an Internal Affairs cop, Gibson (Chad Donella of "The Long Kiss Goodnight"), and his Africa-American partner Rogers (newcomer Laurence Anthony of the TV series "The Border") struggle to keep Jill alive and get the goods on Hoffman. While all of this is unfolding, Melton and Dunstan serve up their most tantalizing storyline. What if a man, Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery), who survived Jigsaw, went on a publicity tour to tout a book about the nightmare experience and help other victims? Just as previous "Saw" chillers punished the insincere and often gave the despondent a new reason to live, "Saw 3-D" puts Bobby through a ringer without comparison. The villain puts everybody near and dear to Bobby in jeopardy with formulaic consequences. People die that we have no sympathy for at all. The way that they die is gruesome, but it isn't as unsettling as the original "Saw." "Saw 3-D" is far from fun, if such an experience can be described as fun. The film's best scene is a cheat, at least until the victim makes the wrong move. Our villain takes out his rage on the least political correct offenders that society frowns upon with little remorse: racists. We are only told that they are racists. Of course, they are white and their demise is incredibly dismembering. Four racists?three guys and one gal?are confined to a garage. The leader is seated behind the wheel of a vintage El Camino with his back super-glued to the seat. Just beyond his reach on the far side of the windshield wipers is a braking mechanism that he has a painfully limited time to grasp. If he doesn't grasp it in time, not only will the car?poised on jack stands?crash to the floor with wheels whirling at high speeds and obliterate the leader's girlfriend, but it will also race toward the garage door where his buddy is chained up while jerking the chains bound around his other friend's arms, including a giant steel buckle piercing his tongue and jawbone. Mind you, the people that make these movie want to put us?the audience?in the worst kind of peril. Moreover, as an audience, we can accept it and cringe at it if we realize there is no escape. Indeed, the racist leader panics and everything goes south. A smart person would have either hit the seat release between their legs which would have propelled the leader to within his arm's reach of the braking mechanism. Or failing that, he would have levered the seat forward to clinch the device. Nothing is more anticlimactic than an imbecilic victim, and the racist leader and his friends pay for the consequences of their wickedness. "Saw 3-D" opens with a lame bit of torture gore that serves up poetic justice. The second best scene turns out to be a nightmare, but it takes advantage of the 3-D. The final scene where Dr. Gordon flings a hack saw at us lacks visual piazza. Everything has three dimensions, but the filmmakers don't take enough advantage of the format. Director Greutert and his scribes could revive the franchise based on the ambiguous ending, but the "Saw" series definitely dulled its razor edge with his routine entry. The seminal Lionsgate franchise deserved a better send-off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Farewell to Our Friend Jigsaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The alleged "final film." Now, after watching all six saw films over the past few weeks, my hopes were up for the last film. That being said, I am happy to say that I am entertained and liked this film a lot, but I am not without my gripes.First: the film is just a little too cartoonish. The first trap involves a girl that hangs from the ceiling half dressed and her breasts are paid a lot of attention to, especially with the 3D. Being a guy, I don't mind this, but it felt a bit gratuitous and I couldn't take the scene seriously. Especially with the accidentally funny dialogue. I've always applauded Saw for not falling to the clichés that most franchises eventually fall to like blatant cheese and camp. This film didn't take its self very seriously, and was very unintentionally funny at times. The lead cop, Chad Donella, is just there for comedy and is more funny than dramatic. One other thing that bothered me is the ending. Without ruining much: There are 3 characters that are shown in a scene, and I know who one is, but when I was walking out of the theater the first thing I said was "Who the hell were the other two?" They also make a decision that I didn't like with one of the characters.To name the good things: the traps are all very good, especially the one that involves cars. I won't say any more. The deaths are great, and there's plenty of gore. And, since it's in 3D, you get a bit of it flying at you. The 3D, by the way, is pretty good. I also like the guy who plays Bobby in the movie, despite being an Ed Norton ripoff and Bettsy Russel was also good too. I'm happy that, despite Tobin Bell having only two minutes of screen time, it still moved fast. Oh, and a question for the rest of you: Did you manage to hold back the laugh when he showed up at the book signing scene?Alright, in summary: There was no actor that I hated, but a couple I was somewhat annoyed with. I didn't care for the ending and I loved all of the traps.If they had at least fixed up the ending or the campiness, this could have been one of the best in the series.As it is, it's an 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw3d. Past tense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many "Saws" does that make now? Evidently, even its creators have stopped counting. "Saw 3D" is only the second film in the annual horror franchise I've seen (the first being the first), and this alleged "final chapter" assumes working knowledge of Jigsaw canon. My critique, however, is of "Saw 3D" as a stand-alone film, though my gut reaction undoubtedly echoes what you already know?this is a 'fans only' affair.The story of "Saw" fandom is one of diminishing returns. After being decimated at the box office this Halloween and last by the low-budget "Paranormal Activity" films, the series is struggling to stay relevant, or at least to sell tickets on shock-value alone. "Saw" has long since passed that threshold, and the obvious draw this year is the incorporation of 3D. It may seem like a gimmicky application of the technology, but having human entrails hurled into the audience is the logical next-step for the series, and may even be the highlight of this experience.As it turns out, "Saw 3D" is a lot like "Jackass 3D," albeit far less entertaining. Both are shameless excuses for elaborate spectacle, be they stunts or traps, and "Saw" excels at creating crass psychological experiments. Unlike "Jackass," however, it relies on a story to connect the grisly dots, though it really needn't. We don't care who these people are; the stars of the movie are Jigsaw's inventions, and the traps have more of an arc than the characters. So little attention is paid to the audience's emotional investment in the story that they might as well do away with one entirely. "Saw 3D" is boring and pretentious when it presumes our interest?the series would be better served by taking the "Jackass" route or going all out anthology. Compiling upcoming and established horror directors' takes on the "Saw" universe in a series of short vignettes could trim the fat considerably.It would certainly beat the muddled, uninteresting, and expository excuse-making of "Saw 3D." Morbid curiosity drives the franchise, and that the traps are paramount to the characters they ensnare is readily apparent. Almost immediately, we understand Jigsaw is teaching twisted morality lessons through his sadistic mechanisms?empathy for his victims is thrown immediately out the window. Here, our protagonist is faced with a series of time-based challenges to save the lives of his acquaintances, but fails every time. Who cares? The audience has paid in advance to see them killed.My qualms with that sentiment are not moral, but creative. What irks me is that the narrative is at odds with viewer expectation when they should be working in tandem. The script should be adding dramatic weight to the gore, but instead it feigns interest in its characters only long enough to brutally murder them. "Saw" needs to either attempt something more emotionally compelling, or not waste my time with its placeholder storytelling.If this is indeed the final "Saw" film, which seems more likely a function of declining attendance than anything else, my constructive criticism is irrelevant. There are a thousand and one ways the franchise could be improved upon, but "Saw" (judging at least by the first and final installment) is uninterested in adaptation or change. The creativity stops at the carnage, which is unfortunate because the series could be phenomenal in better hands. As it stands, the incorporation of half-hearted 3D is about the extent of its creators' willingness to innovate. At its best, "Saw 3D" is an appropriately squeamish theater experience?the problem is that it's otherwise boring.Not that it matters. As it turns out, "Saw" is like "Jackass" in another way. Fans know exactly what to expect, and can't much complain about receiving more of same. This many entries in, however, I can't imagine anyone will be sorry to see it go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the second or maybe third Saw movie I've seen so I'm not a hardcore fanatic or anything. All I remember from the last was that it had a little more story and less gore. I haven't seen the first saw but I can imagine it had a really good story to go along with it and more character time.This was gripping and definitely entertaining but the torture scenes are way too disturbing. They weren't just a little shocking or wild but straight up disturbing. I'm not really against it if it has a point but seeing these scenes were just unsettling and f-ed up. But all together the movie was somewhat gripping and worth seeing and had me on the edge of my seat. But I would just rate it as another Saw movie in the cannon that I wouldn't care to see again. Go see that Paranormal movie and at least you'll get more of a real horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderately entertaining, but mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw was an excellent film with solid suspense, adequate atmosphere and an emotional background which is not very frequent to find in the horror genre.Saw 2 was entertaining, but not highly memorable.Saw 3 was boring and unsatisfactory.Saw IV was at more or less the same level of the second film from the saga.Saw V did not know how to continue with the franchise and it entangled the story to the point of the incoherence.After that, we had Saw VI, which had the good idea of restoring the basic premise from the saga, minimizing the confusing "ret-con" from the previous movie and preparing a good road for future sequels...what now takes us to Saw 3D, which despite being moderately entertaining, is mediocre.To start with something positive, I will mention that the screenplay from Saw 3D is quite accessible, and it is not necessary to remember every detail from the previous movies to understand the moral and dramatic ups and downs from this new movie.On the negative side, I did not find the characters to be very interesting, and something which influences on that is that the performances are not very convincing.The old acquaintances from the franchise Costas Mandylor and Betsy Rusell feel apathetic and listless on their roles, while the new members Sean Patrick Flanery, Gina Holden and Chad Donella feel bland and feigned.As for the screenplay, its simplification of the sub-plots and its aleatory victims occasionally blur the flow from the story, so the final revelation I was expecting to link the divergent elements from the story never came.However, I have to admit that the gore effects from Saw 3D are pretty good.Before watching the film, I was fearing to find a saturation of bad special effects and ridiculous scenes designed the emphasize the 3D technique with which the film was made (as it had happened in the deplorable The Final Destination), but fortunately, director Kevin Greutert did not abuse of that "gimmick" and he respects the balance of practical and digital effects.Nevertheless, the "game" prepared by the villain does not provoke too much anguish or tension.The first film from this saga comparatively had few blood, but a much bigger emotional impact.In other words, an example that less is more.In conclusion, I think Saw 3D deserves a slight recommendation because I have to admit that, despite my complaints, it never bored me.Nevertheless, it did not leave me very satisfied, mainly because I expected more from the conclusion of this saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank Goodness It Is Finally Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a deadly battle rages over Jigsaw's brutal legacy, a group of Jigsaw survivors gathers to seek the support of self-help guru and fellow survivor Bobby Dagen, a man whose own dark secrets unleash a new wave of terror.Let us just say it: the best film in the series was the first one. Part two was decent, but after that it was a convoluted mess and it became more and more challenging to keep the characters and plot straight. While this film does its best to tie everything together (especially by bringing back Dr. Gordon), it is still part seven within seven years... and if not the weakest, at least among the worst. The 3D was not needed, and we have moved far away from the tight story we started with.For what it is worth, I have to give credit to writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan. First of all, they are nice guys. And second, they have done a fine job writing this film (and the other films they have done). If I was given the chance to write a film, I would too, so I cannot put the blame on them. If anything, they deserve credit for writing a script that kills the series. I cannot hold it against the director, either... he has been involved since day one in the series, so this could be seen as his baby more than anyone else's, perhaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D: disasterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 3D: The Final Chapter is supposed to be the last movie in the Saw franchise. Hopefully it is. This movie is supposed to be shot in 3D but the movie itself barely utilizes this effect. This is a killing contributor to the film. There are only some blood guts and limbs being thrown at the screen, the producers could have done much better. But by not using this feature to their advantage, the movie lacks some major special effects. I believe it actually takes away from the film. On top of that the blood is pink and looks unrealistic. It is quiet annoying to see someone being ripped apart and it's only this pink paint that pours out from the body. Fans of the Saw franchise like the realism of the blood and guts, but by using the pink it ruins it and takes away from the movie. Saw continues to bring its gory game to the film, but the contraptions and traps that these people find themselves in is lacking creativity. Many of the traps the actors find themselves in are not that creative. Some are brought back from previous Saw movies and some are new, but lack creativity. This movie isn't all that I was hoping it to be. It lacked many features and the story line was tied in with 2 other stories that just failed miserably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actors played poorly, the story seemed taken out of a cheap copy of a cheap horror book. It doesn't have anything to do with all the saga besides the fact that it closes it. Everybody dies. I mean... that is not the point. they should learn a lesson and do things right. Effects were horrible. I forced myself to finish watching the movie. In the other movies I knew when someone was about to be kidnapped but they were still able to scare me. With this one... I could watch it with kids and eating. Seriously, they could have done better. A whole lot better. They proved it with the first six ones. This one almost made me puke but not cause of the blood. It was awful. I think it doesn't even deserve to be called a Saw movie. Definitely awful. I expected a lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...or it's simply my age (I'm in my golden thirties)- but this was a real bore! The first "Saw" film was- at the time it was released- extreme and I must say, pretty good. The concept was new, innovative and groundbreaking within its genr?. I had quite high expectations, but I was disappointed by the lack of using the full potential that 3D movies can do. I expected more "in-your-face" episodes; judging by the trailer. As it turned out, I might as well have watched it without the glasses. Another thing that goes out to the writer(s)?: Why not write a more intriguing plot, make more suspense and excitement? Pure gore can only take you that far.</fullReview>

Although movie ends, many questions still remains unanswered, i hope they'll come up with the 8th part soon.All said n done ull only enjoy this movie if ur a real saw fan n if u have all the background, Lastly thanks to the entire saw team for entertaining us for past 7 years.....Cheers!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jigsaw definitely saved the best for last. A lot of loose ends are tied up. All the pieces now fit together. The final chapter has everything you could ask for in a Saw film. It did seem a little rushed, but it was very suspenseful. I loved all the new traps and twists. The only flaw is that Tobin Bell didn't have enough screen-time as Jigsaw, but you may not notice because of all the new games being played. It was good to see Cary Elwes back as the infamous Dr. Gordon. Hoffman has become more of a serial killer this time and tries to find Jill. An author named Bobby Dagen has written a book about how he survived a Jigsaw trap, but it's all a lie. When Bobby is really thrust into a game, he has sixty minutes to save his wife, or she will die. The Saw franchise has had a good run. I'll miss seeing them at the theater every year. I highly recommend SAW VII 3D!!!</fullReview>

The acting was great, The traps were clever, The new characters were acceptable for the SAW universe. The 3D was amazing...I didn't expect it to make Saw look great. All the questions were answered greatly. Jigsaw is now the best anti-hero ever. SAW is the best horror series to erupt into an unforgettable franchise. The die hard fans of this series will deeply love this movie. This has been the biggest treat for Halloween to me. I went in expecting to have 3D ruin the story of my favorite series...but it made it more enjoyable then I thought. It was really clever and ingenious. Now here for the past 7 years, our Halloween tradition of this series never failed to show us how clever it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly after seeing this movie I could only realize how good saw one is and how much saw 2-6 sucked. saw 3d is best by far. It gives the audience answers to all questions. If you have seen 1-6 and you have given up you need to get to a theater. The main guy in a trap is a faking saw survivor and he gets caught. he gets put into a series of traps similar to saw 3 except in his opening trap he could die. He goes through and fails to save everyone, and then has to rip out two of his teeth to get to his wife. as he lied about he needs to attach two hooks to his chest and climb and plug the two cords together to save his wife. he grabs the two wires but the cut he gave himself was not deep enough, it rips off and falls. the time runs out and his wife is placed in an oven and is burning. He runs at it and electrocuted himself. During the end of saw 6 Hoffman survives his trap. He is trying to go back after Jill. Jill dreams of go-cart trap, thats not how she dies. Hoffman leads police into his new crime scenes, one has a chain gun come up and kill them the other a gas that kills them. Hoffman has tapped into security and kills the guards. He gets to Jill and locks her to a chair. He puts the Amanda head trap on her head. She dies and Hoffman lights everything on fire and tries to walk out but 3 people in pig costumes stop him. they stab Hoffman and the one takes off his pig head, its Gordon. the others were survivors. Gordon takes him to his house and locks him in with no saw to rot to death. It was revealed that Gordon was the one who helped jigsaw the most. However the "Chester Bennington car trap" was not important for revealing information like the public trap, it just gave the police clues on where to go next. Everyone dies in the chester trap and the two guys survive the love triangle killing the girl. It could have done without 3d but it did answer all of the questions. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So in my eyes Saw 1 was amazing. It blended an edge of your seat thrill with a great and new story. Saw 2 on the other hand, although enjoyable didn't capture the magic that #1 had. The thing is some poke fun at how many saw films have been made. Well I don't see why just look at Halloween or Star Wars for that matter. The reason there are 7 Saw movies is because fans still go see them and that results in a good box office. OK so this is supposed to be a Saw 3D review right? Let's get to the review now.I was really pumped going into this Saw because I really loved #5 and #6 because they followed more plot over traps. Saw 3D is no different which is why I enjoyed it. Let's get the negatives out of the way. When I heard Saw in 3D I was pumped. Unfortunately while the 3D was very good, my expectations exceeded it. This is only a minor problem and it is actually really my fault not the movies. Also the dialogue is a little off at times. The good... Hoffman is a badass, Cary Elwes is back, and the story. Now Jigsaw dies in saw 3 but he has had a big recurring role in every other saw film until now. Yes I said it, John Kramer doesn't show up except in one tiny but VERY powerful scene. But the real brilliance of this film lies in both the opening trap and the car trap. Both are very excruciating to watch but are just brilliant traps. The story keeps you at the edge of your seat until the end and then slaps you right in the face with what the series is known for... incredible twists. Now it was stated that this is the final film but what is so remarkable is how they still set up a twist for a possible 8th movie. Now I truly believe the series isn't over if and only if this movie exceeds at the box office. After seeing this movie I can tell you, I WANT A 8th SAW!!! SO GO OUT THERE AND SEE THIS MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Saw became into a meat grinder ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone already knows that the greatest franchise Saw is not what was created. With each film, it lost itself in the good that was in it at first. Saw 7 (or Saw 3D) is no exception. This film can be viewed as part of a great franchise, which with a bang shedding all the saw the atmosphere, or as a separate film as a thriller, horror, detective.Well, I want to start with the bad, with the cons, and they here very much. Mr. Greutert working with the films Saw a long time, it seems completely lost in their own tricks to earn for themselves and the company more money, so he closed his eyes with the writers on that story and his line are hidden deep in the traps and the various murders. Yes, they have forgotten about the philosophy of John, and about him in practice. That is, all would do well with the plot.At the expense of the characters and their roles. On the secondary characters I did not even say, someone was needed, someone may have been superfluous. But what did the creators of the seventh saw with Mark Hoffman (my favorite character), I was extremely shocked and disappointed. Former detective now cut all in a row, even more cruelly than ever, in general, he became a "Terminator-killer." Yet, he still attracts me thoughtfulness of his actions.Bobby and his game seemed all too lengthy, and at first even I was extremely surprised, why do we need such a character and all adjacent to it. But Bobby - is not so negative. It laid the relationship with other characters, so he looks like a some others who nothing know about death and Jigsaw's games.And what disappointed most of all - it's the ending movie - its predictability. Just a pity that the filmmakers did not have the mind to think of something incredibly exciting and unexpected Saw 7. But I cant say that this ending is not predictable was epic. Is it was shocking.And now the pros appearing in the film.Acting was at the height, very pleased as always, Costas Mandylor - he was the best, and his talent helps the movie. Cary Elwes, of course, though its not great, but the important role played good, want to note and Sean Flanery. Yes, and the other actors were fine.Effects and trap are was awesome very much. Virtually every trap pleased, and the effects of blood, etc. are very real. It is sometimes forced to shudder, and sometimes forced to close their eyes in disgust.Liked the music, although it was hard to hear amid the general chaos in the film, but it is there, to be considerate, good old recognizable motifs. This is good and the music returns to us the atmosphere of SAW.But generally, if we take Saw 3D the film in isolation (which is really hard to do), it is even quite good, with interesting flashbacks and twist. Therefore, I can only judge objectively, or only as a fan of the franchise. As if there was not, it's not the worst of all the Saw, and I like it more than vice versa ... Just because we are so used to it already and loved; Saw already exhausted, but still afloat, disturbing the minds of viewers and fans ...Just because this part of this is what is worthy, but my heart of a fan cant put bad score...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last part in the series but the last two failed a bit because everybody has seen it and the torture porn genre was over. But still Saw kept it's success and had to deliver to the fans. Kevin Greutert was back in for directing and he was involved from number one so he knew exactly what to do. It was filmed and edited in the typical Saw style. Even the writers staid the same so on that part they knew exactly what to give to the fans.But due the failure the producers had to think how to attract us to watch Saw 7. They did it on two ways, first of all, they picked in on the 3D craziness. Luckily it wasn't filmed just for showing the 3D effects. There are a few 3D made shots in it but they luckily doesn't bother you watching it in 2D. The saw being thrown away and one trap is especially done for 3D. Still I have my doubts about the future of 3D, over here the hype is already over and prices of 3D LED TV's are crashing. Secondly they brought in some traps that are really disgusting. In Saw 5 and 6 some traps were a bit laughable. They even brought back the reversed bear trap, the one the fans loved, as an ode towards the fans. My only point of negativity is the fact that one trap takes place at a shopping era, were everybody is watching what is going on. On the other side, the tooth trap was a bit exaggerated. Face it, numbers being tattooed on teeth? Really. Maybe this is the Saw were we almost haven't got Jigsaw in it or John Kramer, nevertheless it worked out fine scriptwise and even on the gore side it splatters out fine. The acting was okay. Some may have problems with Costas Mandylor, sometimes he was not convincing. But again, by going back to the real traps and by moving back to the original Saw it is once again one for the Saw geeks. If you never have seen previous entries then don't bother watching it, you won't understand anything. It is even a tradition to end with a big surprise, well, here again there's a surprise, and with that fact they could go on with another part, so far they didn't, this should be the final one. But haven't we seen that all before? Gore 4/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is quite amazing, even though as with the other films I felt all but a couple of the traps were weak, the story is what makes it go for me. This is Hoffman's brilliant plan to get Jill and use John's traps to do so. The writers have done well with the 1st public trap, which I have seen criticized by others for not being important to the film. It clearly is very important to the story, as it put there to tell the police and public that there was a game on, and it will continue. Everything comes together very nicely at the end. I would say that there is one Gordon's alive youtube video they copied from as well as a teeth trap that I saw on the message boards here years ago, I wonder if they can get royalties for that? Anyway, get through the painful traps, enjoy the moments that come towards the end, as they are made to be intense and you need to imagine what it would be like to feel it. Poor Jill Tuck and great closure sequence, even if predictable. Saw 8, I don't mind either way, I think the Collector 2 or even dare I say it Phone Booth 2 would get me into the cinema quicker, but I would still go to see how Dr.Gordon celebrates Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hey guys, I can say that I am a huge SAW fan, I watched each film since 2004. I was really very eager to watch the "final chapter" and now I can say yes it's worth watching it with paying extra money for stupid 3D glasses. Acting was cool, tricky games were fantastic, and most of all you will like the way they end up the game. I congratulate the team who produces these wonderful final series. I thank them all again for having us this wonderful experience of fantastic series. Coming to the details of film; I have only 1 negative criticize; 3D; there is no need to make this film in 3D because 3D was not so with good quality. Since 3D was awful you come up with an idea that producers wanted to make more money of it. But it is not such a good way to do like this, as film watchers we don't want to pay money for useless details like 3D. Other than this one film was wonderful, I am really sorry that I will not be able to see the next since this one was the final one :( So guys go and watch this epic ending film without losing any time, :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this short and sweet.. The anticipated return of Dr. Lawrence Gordon, and the wonder of what he's been up to since 2004 is finally answered in the, probably-not-the- last Saw 3D. This is probably all this film has going for it. The terrible acting by the cast, the insanity of the 'traps' and the complete lack of logic Saw 3D has, means it was destined to be one of the worst films of 2010. The 7th film in the never-ending Saw franchise follows Bobby Dagen, leader of a self-help group for 'Jigsaw survivors', as he is plunged in to another deadly game of life-or-death. The typical sliding from one scene to another is like a cheap Powerpoint presentation, which is all Saw has become. A presentation of "look how unrealistic and ridiculous a film can be in 90 minutes." Despite this not being the WORST of the Saw films, it is very close to being. The first film saw the emergence of a highly original and gripping horror thriller, but, all the rest have become an almost laughable, predictable let down. To be honest, it seems as if every person is an accomplice of Jigsaw's, and the amount of detectives and policeman who have been killed, leads me to question why anyone even bothers to solve his crimes. Surely it would be safer to just let him get on with it, not give him any attention and perhaps he'll get bored and stop? That's exactly what the audience has done, and it seems that this SHOULD be the last instalment thanks to the "decrease in box office performance for Saw VI" However, who knows? The ending of Saw 3D suggests there is more to come. If there is going to be a Saw 8 I hope they spend less money, as it seems, the higher the budget; the worse the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameron Should Sue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For as much credit as I have given James Cameron over the years, I find it a disgrace that the industry has turned his technology into a corny gimmick to be be used as a cheap trick for films like this. I've been a fan of the Saw films since the beginning. But, to say that this franchise is tiresome would be a mild statement all together. It's almost laughable that they have made seven movies in seven years. No one could spin out movies that fast unless they were pure crap. And we're not even getting to the acting. It's a horror film, and it's not Silence Of The Lambs horror, so I'm not expecting all that much. But the acting in this film is a down right insult to anyone with a sense of intelligence. The concepts brought to this film were also boring and lame. The opening scene with the girl was so unoriginal. No thought went into it. That's obvious to me. The gore was overdone, and not in a good way and as I mentioned before the 3D should never have been done on this film. This is a sad way to end the franchise. I'm not satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory! But poor finale to saw!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i recently watched saw 1 - 6 and although too gory for me, i found them to be very good.I'm not into the gory side of saw, but i find the traps, characters and twists to be amazing. i found each saw exiting and i loved all the twists so i was very exited to see the final saw and the final twist. unfortunately i found this saw to be poor and the twist predictable.this film had a basic trap storyline like all the others, like in 2 its the house, in 3 its the man going through, 4, the cop going through tests, 5 its the group of people fighting for survival to get through the tests and 6 with the man going through to get to his family. this i thought was a bad idea as i thought it would be better to have the whole film about the main characters. i know this was to carry the film along but i felt it took up too much of the film and all it offered was over the top gore.i don't want to give too much away but knowing Dr Gordon was back i thought it was going to be interesting, but i found his part too predictable to be true, i was still waiting for another twist afterwards only to find the credits.overall, if you like gore, this is in my opinion the goriest of the bunch, the traps were not all that great compared to all the others and the story was good but not good enough for the end of the saw legacy.i enjoyed it, but was disappointed so I'm giving this a 5/10.</fullReview>

I sure hope there will be an 8th sequel, because this series are really original, clever scenery, nothing what is what it seems...

		<shortDescription>An insult to our intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw should have ended at VI (some debate it should have ended after 3). If you thought V was dull, you are in for a ride.Throw logic out of the window and watch traps without much of a coherent story and plenty of deux ex machina.Producers have kept squeezing every dime out of the Saw series ...and this is the result. As a longtime fan, I feel let down and even insulted by the sub-par quality of the story. It hardly feels like a Saw movie. More importantly, John, the namesake of the franchise is hardly in it. This should have never been released - or, at least, would have needed much more work, storywise...it felt rushed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's be honest- it's not the twist that's the problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you my personal taste about saw series so far. Saw 1 was original and new, and I knew there'd be Saw 2. Great. Saw 2 is just my style with house and stuff. It was great. Saw 3, first time strong gore and filling in the holes as a bridge. The twist is different, but it's not bad. I enjoyed it. Saw 4, yes, was a bit stupid, but I just didn't see it. Moving on. Saw 5, lack of development and all, but hey, it was fun for a midway. Saw 6? Great story, emotion, everything. Within twist instead of a big picture, but it also delivered Jill vs Hoffman.Now, this "3D" one...As a fan, it's a bit of a disappointment. I do understand that this was the ONLY way to logically end the series without being too far stretched and ridiculous just for the sake of twist. Yes, but that's not the problem. If it LED up to that, if it developed up to that, without too much distraction and instead with focused, concentrated, at the edge story and impact, I would've walked away happy.First, it didn't have nearly as many emotional conflicts or development as saw 6. It was here at one point, there at other, back to here, regressing, and suddenly all the way over there...I couldn't concentrate. It was like watching an animal pushing a random button, trying to guess which one he'll go for next. Every trap was a new movie for me; let's put it that way. It seems so separate and discontinuous.The story itself was loose and all over the place with just random fill-ups and behind stories without a Saw 6 style of concentrated within plot or overall big picture Saw 3 style. What was the point of this, that, and this? There are way too many distractions. Not to mention how "illogical" parts of the movie that USUALLY goes unnoticed just pops up like a darn 3D to us when those distractors exist. And even if there were no distractors, some devices were just humor. Jokes. I see as the series goes on, science improves as well. Let's be honest. This is not the best of the series, ESPECIALLY if I have to have high standards (due to this being the LAST). I still love it as a series and I still enjoyed the movie, but they could've done better. If the twist was going to be logical and what we expected it to be, then they should've concentrated on intensity build up and character development with emotional conflicts and originality and unforgettable setups of traps, even. I've already heard there will be Saw 8. I don't know; who knows. But I've heard of it, and if they're really considering, they shouldn't tell us that the movie will be the last; that'll just leave us having too-high expectations.Watch it for the sake of finishing the series- but let's just enjoy the movie with blank state and feel relief of getting what we expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a way to end the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>being a saw fan since the original back in 2004 i had noooo idea whatsoever that this franchise would go as far as it did a lot of my friends said the series would end at the 3rd film but i knew better. Saw 3d (Saw 7) is by far the most explanatory one to date not only does it reveal facts and questions we all had but it also presents us with characters that were brought back (lawrence gordon) I will admit that during the series there was some question as to whether or not gordon was involved all along and i didn't think he was honestly i thought he died off-screen but nope he is back and revealed as the true accomplice in almost everything the traps were downright gruesome probably some of the biggest traps I've seen since maybe saw 3 but everything about this film including the 3d effect was astonishing and so my fellow fans of saw i must say that this movie concludes the final chapter that is SAW and with that i say farewell jigsaw you will be missed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While Saw 3D isn't a good movie, it's close enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of (****)The title pretty much sums up my feelings toward "Saw 3D". It's not a good movie. It's not even recommendable. But it's close enough, and really, that's all that matters. It's kind of like the continuous "Friday the 13th" series. "Saw 3D" is that one installment that is potentially one of the better movies in the series, even if it isn't high art. Let's cut to the chase: "Saw 3D" was made for either the gorehounds, fans of the traps, die-hard fans, 3D fanboys, or Dr. Gordon fans. If you don't fit those descriptions, I advise you seek out another film. While this installment carries a whopping 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, most critics view my perspective: "It is what is; Take it or leave it". I wouldn't consider myself a fan as this franchise really never had a good movie. Saw III (in my opinion), came the closest to being a good film. Saw IV and V on the other, were just awful. Saw II tried hard enough, but besides Saw III and II, no other film truly impressed me, including this one.How is Dr. Gordon's return? Pretty cool, not going to lie. The opening sequence definitely will excite fans. How is the 3D? While most complain about the 3D, call me moronic, but I liked it. Saw 3D used the most expensive 3D cameras and yes, filmed with them. The result, as expected with filmed expensive 3D cameras, was solid. Now the 3D wasn't as strong as "Afterlife" and "Avatar"'s 3D, but nevertheless, it was really good. How are the traps? Extremely impressive. You can tell the director is dedicated to them. How's the gore? Saw 3D is the most disgusting of them all. The body count may be well over 30. This is one messy movie.Now... how's the acting? Pretty amateur and nothing to sneeze at. Pretty standard acting. How's the script? Another major flaw. The dialog is pretty cliché at moments and nothing truly sticks out.Overall, "Saw 3D", as a sequel, is fine. It could be a lot worse, but it could be better. It has a specific audience and that's pretty much how it should stay. I don't see the little old bitties going in line to see people get sliced-and-diced and I'm pretty sure most adults that have reached 30 and over won't venture into this latest splatterfest. You can do a lot worse, but... you could do better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Finale to the Series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really great sequel and fantastic conclusion for the series. It has been interesting seeing these characters interact and weave though these films. It's sort of like you don't know who will be coming in next from which one of the past and your curious as to how Jigsaw has manipulated them. We also see long running characters continue on with Jigsaw being the most constant, though we do see Cary Elwes again and revisit some post nastiness from the original.Though there have been a couple of "Saw" movies that have only been so so, this one really does hold up as a great conclusion. The addition of the 3D format has helped this gory exercise in brutal gadgets and modern medieval torture contraptions. We see impaling, stabbings, piercings, hangings, slicings, cooking and rippings . . . There was one bleeding towards the end where the blood was getting that Hammer style red, almost pinkish tint . . . I'm not sure if that was intentional or not; I would actually recommend darkening that before releasing on DVD and Blue Ray. However, that's only a minor complaint The acting is decent and works for this film. I won't say there are any Oscar performances because these films are more about style, plot twists, mystery, grueling torture and suspense. The actors do well with their parts.I do hope the returns are strong for this film, even though I do wish for the series to end on this. I realize that they love the cash cows, but it would be nice to see something not completely ran into the ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXTREMELY disappointing - here's why (no spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no spoilers here because the film makes no sense.The plot is a complete mess. There seem to be three main story lines running: ONE, Hoffman wants to track down Jill to get his revenge for what she did to him at the end of VI. It's a boring premise but at least it makes sense.TWO, Bobby Dagen is put a multi-roomed trap for profiting from the Jigsaw legacy. We've seen this before, but at least there are some satisfyingly gory moments. Suffering and despair abound.THREE, a cop from Internal Affairs is being led on a wild goose chase by Hoffman. Now, I am at a complete loss to explain WHY this storyline was included. It makes no sense whatsoever. The cop has some history with Hoffman? Hoffman is testing the cop? I've seen it and I still can't figure out what the hell happened.Having created a sprawling incomprehensible mess, the story has no choice but to implode, leaving this viewer with a metaphorical black hole of two hours wasted.For hardcore fans, the last few minutes will be satisfying - if only they had turned those last few minutes into an entire film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D: The Final Lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it is finally here. The finale of the highest grossing horror franchise of all time. As the "final lesson" begins, Detective Hoffman is struggling to regain all power of the game and its components. With Jill Tuck leaving him for dead, most would think he wouldn't have survived. But he does, thanks to stitching himself up BY HAND. As another game is set in motion, Hoffman wants Jill in his possession and won't stop until he does. A cop, who arrives on a crime scene from a trap, discovers that Hoffman is the man in control of the game and remembers when he saved his life. Many people die, and Hoffman tries to sew up all loose ends. However, there is a certain someone who is waiting in the shadows, someone many people who have watched the saw movies will probably forget. Lets just say he has had something to do with all traps, and as it is said in the movie, all of Jigsaw's work. The answer and the ending will amaze you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 3D was the perfect ending to this horror film franchise. What all started out as a small psychological thriller, turned into the best horror franchise ever created. Saw 3D contained massive amounts of gore for those gore fanatics like myself, an all-star cast of returning characters and some good new ones, and as many twists and turns as you could think of. At one point in the movie I realized that I was actually biting my nails, which is the sign of a great suspenseful movie. And believe me this movie had plenty of suspense! Since my older brother in 2004 sat me down, tied me to a chair with the lights out, and made me watch this movie, I've been hooked. The way the director tied every single saw into this movie made me satisfied that nothing was left out. Go re-watch all 6 saws and then go see this. You will not be disappointed one bit! all i have to say is one simple thing.....since the 3rd saw I had a feeling it was Dr. Gordon all along. Never could put my finger on it as no jigsaw ever limped around while they wore that cape thing. But I knew it was true, in the 6th one i believe, when the doctor said that the cuts on the body were from a different knife...almost of surgical quality. That made me 100% sure that Dr. Gordon had survived and was a part of this whole fiasco. And I'm glad it was him to end all of it!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

The scene during the television interview also displayed some terrible acting from the characters behind the camera crew as well as the woman interviewing 'Bobby'.The 3D was disappointing.At times there seemed to be too much going on at once with too many cuts to different locations</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently I'm a complete sucker for the Saw franchise because to me the movies provide, provide and provide. Not having the opportunity to view the movie in 3D makes the movie a tad disappointing seeing that the effects are still in the release copy. It's kind of a bummer but I was able to look past the annoying visuals. Saw: The Final Chapter, (6/10) would cap the franchise off beautifully since the last game ends by going back to Saw's original roots; it's so favorable to fans. The traps set forth for Bobby as the main game player were simplistic yet refreshing since they weren't ridiculous. The same cannot be said for the car scene which was lame and laughable. This movie more so than the others obviously had a bigger budget, resulting in a different and unlikeable modern atmosphere. However, it would be a very nice way to end the Saw series with a terrific script and entertaining movie. Seeing that for now this is all she wrote, I can't help but say. GAME OVER!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Saw series goes 3D for extra yuck appeal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 3D AKA The Final Chapter (at least until the slated Part VIII gets filmed) hops on the 3D bandwagon and, as a result, proves even more outrageous than its predecessors, chucking its mangled body parts right into the viewers' laps. Admittedly, the result does look a less classy than the previous movies?not quite as stylish or as smartly edited?but the end result is just as fun, the film's trashier nature quite befitting of a series that has only got more demented and OTT as it has progressed.After a gloriously silly opening scene in which Jigsaw goes public, putting his victims in front of a horrified audience for the first time, the film proceeds to introduce the focus of the killer's final game: leader of a Jigsaw survivors self-help group, Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), who hasn't been entirely truthful about his past. To teach Bobby that it's not nice to lie, Jigsaw (AKA Agent Hoffman, played by Costas Mandylor) subjects him to a series of gruesome challenges, the prize at stake being the life of his wife.Gory highlights this time include a gang of skin-head racists (whose leader is played by Chester Bennington from Linkin Park) being torn apart and crushed in a junkyard, a dream sequence that sees Jill Tuck being reduced to several bloody pieces by a huge blade mounted on a rail, someone having their eyes and mouth pierced by spikes, a trap that requires a woman to keep silent as a fish hook in her stomach is pulled up and out of her mouth, and a splattery 'Jigsaw classic'?the reverse bear-trap?for a major character at the end. At times, the violence is so extreme that it's almost comical, but it sure is entertaining.</fullReview>

But if we compare this "episode" with the previous episodes, surely you will find that it's much better. But yeah !! It still have so much problems. Like the bloods look more like tomato sauce, some twists are absurd and sometimes this game looks like a typical reality TV show !! But what I think is this episode is free of almost all the errors above . Brutality checked... plot twisting checked... and last time twist checked. I like it. So I will recommend to everyone. Actually I watched all the SAWs in between three days. So it helped me to understand the twists and plots. So I will recommend to watch them by having little gaps. It will help you catch the movie.

		<fullReview>Does Saw go out with a bang or a whimper? Actually it goes out with a groan and a snore. Instead of dedicating it's over-edited and slight running time (90 minutes, with a fade-out at the 85-minute mark) to wrapping-up all of the plot strings left hanging from previous movies this seventh film instead shoehorns in YET ANOTHER bunch of hopeless morons who cannot stop and use common sense for just two moments to get themselves out of series of grisly traps. It falls very far below the social commentary of Saw VI and it all feels like arbitrary filler.With Hoffman now on the rampage and after Jill a new detective on the case (about the 40 millionth cop featured in the series) shelters her from his wrath while another game plays out in an abandoned asylum. Why on Earth Hoffman would still honor Jigsaw's wishes after he marked him for death at the end of the previous movie is obviously not something you're supposed to think about.Liar Bobby Dagen is the schlub who has to fight his way through the latest traps as punishment for telling porkies about being a Jigsaw survivor. The cassettes say that Bobby has been publicizing these lies for "years", which does not fit in with the chronology.This plot was completely unnecessary. There's no twist at the end either, all Saw 3D does is confirm what everybody had been suspecting since the end of the first movie - Doctor Gordon IS alive (and apparently still practicing medicine) and is in cahoots with Jigsaw. So...did he return to his family or not? Why is he considered "disappeared" in the other movies? Looking for answers? You're not going to find them here. Jigsaw's narration also claims that Gordon has been helping him for "years". But since this movie takes place a couple of months after VI, which happened immediately after V, which took place right after IV, which took place simultaneously as III, which took place a few months after II that revelation could only make sense if Saw II took place years after Saw, which is obviously not true.Kevin Gruetert, who seems to direct the movie like a kid waiting for the final school bell to ring, has ZERO idea of how to utilize the 3D gimmick. Hanging? Wooden planks? A string down the throat? Really? Really??? Jason Voorhees had a far superior 3D adventure 28 years before this movie. It's Saw VII, not Saw 3D.The series had a few interesting moments and good ideas, but this one just makes you glad that it's finally over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The final saw movie. For some reason it went by many titles. Saw 7, Saw 3D and Saw: The Final Chapter were the most common ones, but for the sake of continuity I shall stick to referring to it as Saw 7.The plot of the last film revolves around Jigsaw survivors of the previous films, surprisingly including a certain doctor Gordon from the original. But as usual not all is as it seems with these characters and they soon find themselves involved in another game. Meanwhile our new Jigsaw from the previous films has a few loose ends to tie up, while the cops are once again hot on his trail.The writing in saw 7 isn't fantastic. While it does tie up loose ends and answer questions, it feels anticlimactic throughout. The characters are bland and uninteresting, the dialogue shallow and there are no real twists along the way. There is a big twist at the end which is satisfying, if predictable, that I won't spoil for you, but other than that the story of saw 7 isn't that interesting.The acting in saw 7 on the other hand is good. Once again we are watching the same main characters as in the previous saw movies, and their performances have not changed. Tobin Bell, the original Jigsaw, gets more flashback cameo appearances and of course Carey Elwes, who plays doctor Gordon, is also very good, despite only having a small yet important role in the film.The direction in Saw 7 is good. There is some serious tension and the anticlimactic script is handled well. The editing is executed nicely with some very clever transitions.Overall saw 7 is an anticlimax. The viewer is left asking himself "Was that it?" This is a shame, as this is the big finale to the series many people have been looking forward to. It's nice to see some familiar faces and it ties into the other films well, but remains disappointing. If you've watched all the saws up to now, you might as well watch this one, just don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grisly finish to the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final SAW movie is as unpleasant as all the others, with the added gimmick of being in 3D (although I ended up watching the 2D version on DVD). Despite much publicity about it being the last in the series, it doesn't really feel much like one as it leaves the door open for further sequels down the line.Plot-wise, it's business as usual, with a new round of participants playing one of Jigsaw's deadly games plus all the bits with detectives hunting down the killers. You definitely need to have seen the previous entries in the series to make sense of it all, at least the scenes involving the criminal investigations.Much of the time, the plotting feels quite obvious, like you're watching the scriptwriter playing a game of chess with the characters as pieces, gradually moving them into the relevant position before the play-off. In case it all gets a bit much, though, there's a string of inevitable and excruciating self-torture scenes which seem even more graphic and depraved than before.Characters are hooked, drilled, spliced, exploded and more besides, all captured via exemplary effects work in ultra-gory detail. Such scenes are designed to make the viewer flinch, and boy do they work; there isn't a great deal of imagination to them (aside from the intriguing multi-participant 'garage' trap) but they certainly keep the film moving for those who have the stomach for it. I think the scene involving a fish hook is by far the most gruelling.So farewell to the SAW franchise; I can't exactly say I enjoyed sitting through these productions, but they passed the time well enough ? I suppose!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An idea for a trap to be processed in Saw 8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually this is not a review but i would like to share my idea for a trap to be installed in Saw 8..the thing is it should be a man who is anorexic in his lifestyle and runs a yoga firm.. as to his gym students he generally takes control of beautifully shaped girls in his directing them steps of yoga he always try feeling their sexually sensitive parts and pretends as if its a yoga move.. eventually it so happens that he gets kidnapped by the pork head and finds himself in a trap as he gets up he finds himself in a place having a round floor with sharp spinning wheels on top and the jigsaw video lets him know that he must keep eating all those eatables present kept on the other side and keep increasing his weight so as to keep himself safe else the place where he is standing starts moving like a lift and kills him by the metal spinning wheels.. as he keeps eating his weight keeps increasing and by his weight the lifting of the place where he stands become slow.. etc etc.. loll let me know how u people find this idea.... :-D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I guess one could call it entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all of the Saw films until now, so I knew I should see the 'final chapter'. Look, the first Saw film is very good, but it itself ant no horror masterpiece and it did have a lot of flaws. However, that twist is great. Saw 2 and 3 were very good as well, flawed but still as a trilogy worked. Saw 4 and 5 were still entertaining, since we know the characters and all, but there was just no passion anymore as one could see. Saw 6 was actually a surprise and turned out to be better than 4 and 5. Saw 7, unfortunately, sticks with 4 and 5. The dialogue at times is just plain ATROCIOUS! The acting as well for the most part, but when it is doing the traps they are still entertaining, although the traps here really weren't all that original. The twist itself wasn't very original either and at this point I hate how the writers keep messing with the past, this one going back to the original Saw. WEAK WEAK WEAK.But as always with a Saw film, it was entertaining. Saying that, there's not much else to look forward to. Ever since the first there is no real talent involved. This film isn't very well-made, the editing overbearing and overwhelming like always, the cinematography dry and passion-less, the music redisposed over and over again, and as twists are concerned this is probably the weakest of the final reels. I actually wish the Saw films will continue. I don't really have respect for them as films, BUT they do provide good entertainment and I really wished the series had ended on a much better note. But Paramount is smart for holding unto Paraormal Activity, because there are only two films of that franchise SO FAR but they have both been better than any Saw film. Oh.... and 'Game Over' has gotten REALLY old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people would say the the Saw series of films should have finished long before it got to number seven. They certainly aren't everyones cup of tea by any means but there is something about these films that i have found perversely entertaining. Sure , they are badly acted , they make very little sense and they are in the most part , sick as hell but it's the contraptions and the dilemmas the characters are put in , that make these films worth watching.This is supposedly the final Saw movie ( Yeah right!) and it is in the same mould as most of the others. Lots and lots of blood , produced by wicked inescapable traps , interspersed by some awful acting . You can really see by the camera work that this film was made for the 3D market and i would have liked to have seen it in that medium . I wont be sorry to see the end of the Saw movies because , quite frankly , they have long outstayed there welcome but i would much rather watch one of these than a Harry Potter movie. In fact if harry Potter was in one of Jigsaws traps i would pay mega money to see it!.</fullReview>

Apparently, this isn't the novel version of the popular torture-horror franchise, but the series' conclusion.When Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery) writes a book about his heroic escape from one of Jigsaw's famed death traps, he becomes a best-selling author.Later when Bobby's claims are exposed as lies, the cop posing as the deceased Jigsaw (Costas Mandylor) kidnaps him, his wife and his manager, and locks them in an insane asylum where they must best his elaborate devices for real.Elsewhere, Jigsaw's ex-wife (Betsy Russell) seeks police asylum from her husband's apprentice.While the traps are still clever, the intricate storyline that's been building over the previous 6 installments fizzles. Besides, if we start killing dishonest authors, God would be in trouble. (Red Light)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last (?) installment of the franchise. Satisfying conclusion to the series. Best one since 2. I say B</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jigsaw (Bell) has one final trap set up for a survivor, can he survive again? After Bobby Dagen (Flanery) becomes rich after writing a book chronicling his survival from Jigsaws traps he finds himself in another one. This time with bigger implications. When the police finally find out the truth can they get to him in time? Let me start off by saying I am a fan of the Saw franchise, in spite of the gore factor. Jigsaw has always reminded me a little of Hannibal Lector, a brutal serial killer, but there is a reason for what he does. The first one is excellent due to the fact it changed the genre, but through the years it decided to remove the plot aspects and see how many people they can cut up in 90 minutes. This one was not nearly as graphic as the other ones (ran out of ideas?) and only one scene made me squirm while watching. It is a Saw movie so you pretty much know what your gonna get. They did a really good job of tying up the series for a satisfying conclusion...but (no big shock) they left it open if they did decide to do another, like they did with the "final chapters" of "Friday the 13th", "Nightmare on Elm street", "Scream", "Final Destination", etc... Overall I liked it, but again I have liked all of them. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - Yes, I would like to watch them all in order again to see how they all fit together.</fullReview>

Costas Mandylor is once again one of the many members of serial killer Jigsaw's mentors as we watch yet once again, people trying to (with not much success i might add) escape the cleverly made traps that make the Saw movies what they are. Didn't get to catch this in 3d however I don't think i missed much as you can usually tell what is 3d and what is not when watching the 2d versions of these 3d films. Without delivering any spoilers, I will only say this and that is a lot of unanswered questions get answered. Sadly this is the last of the series but i guess its better to call it quits whilst the series is till hot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game Over!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since 2004, the Saw franchise has been a reliable source of thrills (and bucks) every Halloween, despite critical indifference and the fact that the writers had to make the whole deal more complicated with each new installment after killing off the series' master villain, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), at the end of Saw III. Sooner or later, the story had to come to an end, and the "disappointing" box office returns of Saw VI became a perfect excuse to wrap everything up in the seventh chapter, with the added bonus of 3D.Picking up from the climax of the previous movie, Saw 3D is the final round of the battle between Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) over Jigsaw's legacy. With the psychotic Hoffman willing to do anything to get away with his crimes, John Kramer's ex-wife has no choice but to go to the police, upping the stakes when she asks for protection. Meanwhile, someone still has to suffer in the latest game, and this time the designated victim is Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a celebrity thanks to his book about how he survived a previous Jigsaw trap, which has angered other survivors like one Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes)...Being the last film in the series, Saw 3D aims for the jackpot in terms of shocks, finally giving us the money shot promised back in the first installment. Save for that moment, however, the gore, especially with the added dimension (yes, that means guts flying out of the screen), appears to be played for laughs, particularly in the customary teaser sequence which, minus the return of Gordon, looks like a parody of what has come before. The same goes for the game scenario: what felt fresh in 2004 has now become trite and predictable, a mere excuse for gratuitous blood-letting.Still, the movie has its good moments: however briefly he is on screen, Bell remains a creepy presence, brilliantly backed up by Mandylor and Russell, and Elwes' return to the franchise is as much fun as one could expect. Plus, the ending, complete with "Game over" nastiness and Charlie Clouser's iconic theme music, is a proper closure for the series, making good of the promise that Jigsaw won't make any more appearances on the big screen. And, although it's less sharp than Saw VI's look at health care, the film's stab at celebrity TV and its consequences makes for decent social satire.In short, Saw 3D is every bit as flawed as the other odd-numbered episodes, but has enough meat on its bones to make Jigsaw's final hurrah worth at least one look. Besides, it's the last one: that's got to count for something, right?</fullReview>

The movie will never be able to match up yo the original film but I must say, this was an out standing film. The film did distinguish itself from the other films and will have you on the edge of your seat. If I had one complaint about this movie it would be the 3D effect. They were all unnecessary and wasteful of budget. If you go see this movie please do so in 2D.

		<shortDescription>Torture porn gives it's last ounce of life in this tiresome sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 3D is a film that combines grotesque imagery and an unflattering, disappointing 3D scheme in attempt to make a good Horror film. RealD is now at the point where it's becoming just a marketing tool to lure in people who usually wait till DVD to see a film. Although since RealD is only compatible at the theater and not for at home viewing, the company says "hey look at this new film...IN 3D!!!" Some films like The Final Destination and Jackass 3D use it well, but films like this it's just not needed. I never gave a movie a star rating on it anyway. It doesn't contribute to the amount of stars I give it. It's like grading the film on the screen it was shown it. But if I did grade this one on it's 3D, it would get a one and a half.The Saw franchise has become a joke in the Horror world. It's overwhelming amount of sequels, parodies, and recycled concept has become nothing but a neverending joke. It may state "THE FINAL CHAPTER" on the poster, but in a few years, we may get a TV show on Chiller or Syfy or even a prequel, spin off, or God forbid a remake to start this whole mess over again. Saw 3D does a fair job at wrapping up the series, but it doesn't take too much effort to wrap up a poor franchise. Just poor some more salt into a wound already infected or just throw the final brick in a still flowing jam, it's all the same. It doesn't seal the problem for good, but prevents it for a short time so your mind can fade away from it.The film is about a man named Bobby Dagen, a self help guru who writes a book about how he overcame a trap made by the infamous Jigsaw killer. However, Bobby wakes up in another trap and is now forced to find his way out. Turns out the self help guru needs help from one when we learn he lies about actually surviving one and now his horrible lie is now coming back again. Karma at his finest.This is not the full plot, but not seeing four, five, and six of the series, I'm in no mood to try and explain it when I don't understand it myself. There's not much interesting here. There is a trap that has someone trapped in a car in a junkyard, and without giving anything away, I will say that it's my favorite trap of the film. The beginning is rather interesting, but still isn't the main highlight as it's not a trap because there is no way for anyone to escape. A choice needs to be made.Saw 3D doesn't have much going for it. Even with the gimmicky "3D" in the name it won't attract many people as many are already tired of seeing it in so many ads surfacing around newspapers, the internet, and magazines. If Saw wanted to pull this madness off they should have done it when people weren't mocking the name and bashing it worldwide. It has it's ups and downs, but pales in comparison to the great film that is the third one. It's gore is not CGI, but practical effects (thank God), but lets see this done with something new, not for the seventh time.Starring: Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Betsy Russell, Sean Patrick Flanery, and Cary Elwes. Directed by: Kevin Greutert.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D: The Final Chapter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was advertised not as Saw VII, but as not only being 3D, but billed with the subtitle The Final Chapter, I didn't know whether this was genuine of not, but I didn't care. Basically the film opens with a flashback of Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) after sawing his foot off and escaping the bathroom, and then we go back to Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) escaping the reverse bear trap. Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery) meanwhile is acting as a Jigsaw trap survivor promoting himself as a help guru to make money, give false hope to hundreds of people, and meet the real survivors who have a new perspective on life. While the police continue investigations and try to find Hoffman, he is demanding that he gets Jigsaw's widow Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) or the games will not end. Of course, Bobby is captured and wakes in a trap for being a compulsive liar, and he is set a number of tasks to go through to try and help himself, his wife and some colleagues. Flashbacks reveal more about Hoffman and one or two of the traps while John Kramer (Tobin Bell) was still alive, and eventually Bobby reaches the trap that he lied about surviving, and you are almost glad that it doesn't end well. In the end, Hoffman destroys the Jigsaw workshop along with Billy the puppet, and a final unlikely accomplice is revealed along with flashbacks John included, when Hoffman gets his punishment. Also starring Chad Donella as Gibson, Gina Holden as Joyce, Chester Bennington as Evan, Dean Armstrong as Cale, Naomi Snieckus as Nina, Rebecca Marshall as Suzanne and Laurence Anthony as Rogers. The gore in this one is just as strong as the previous films, one or two are in a way self parody, and the 3D element is alright with a body part or two coming at you. It is a good sequel, and if it is indeed the final chapter, quite a good way to go out, but I personally question the ending of the film, to be continued? Traps include: two boys in front and a girl being lowered above a saw which can be pushed either direction and all in front of a crowd in daylight (a public execution), the crash test car with a large spike on a track running towards the girl (a dream sequence), a racist skinhead super glued to a car seat with his girlfriend under the car wheel - his friend behind attached by a chain with a hook in his jaw - and another friend in front who will be run over, the man in the suspended cage above a floor of knives, the woman with four blades in a circle activated by loud noise pointing towards her throat where the key on a long string is, the two people hanging on barb wire above many upside down running lawnmowers, the non-floor room with a few planks of wood to walk across while blind folded and the woman with a chain on her neck pulling her to the floor which will turn into an oven. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, if you're a true 'Saw' fan, you'll get your money's worth. But the same can't be said for the 3-D aspect, because the 3-D parts are few and far between. Basically, it's just an advertising gimmick (I had the same problem when I went to see "My Soul to Take" a couple weeks ago, and for all the other 3-D movies I've seen in the past 3 years; I have yet to see a 3-D movie that's impressive and offers a lot of it). In the trailer, we were promised that we would experience the traps. I'm sorry to say, the movie offered none of that. I wasn't really disappointed, considering it was just a way to get us to see it. Some 3-D movies offer little of it, and some, sadly, offer none of it (animated movies, for example). So if you plan on seeing this picture, I'd suggest you look for a theater that is showing it in 2D, or wait until DVD (if the version is available). And as for the story, this installment, unfortunately, turns into a slasher movie near the end. Talk about a cheat! Story: *** out of ****3-D: * out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I liked Saw 3D and thought it was a pretty good way to end the series. I gave it a generous 8/10 instead of 6 or 7 in hopes that they won't end the series here with still SO MUCH unanswered. The pieces are still not in place fully. For a single addition to the series, this movies scores big time! For a series closer, not acceptable. If they close the series with this movie, all I can say is there better be about another hours worth of footage on the Director's Cut explaining all they left open. But, the movie itself was good and very enjoyable. I was however disappointed with the subpar 3D and am about to go see it in 2D to see if I like it better that way, as I am not big on gimmicks. Saw is a puzzle of several movies all containning pieces to a large puzzle and, though we don't have all the pieces, it is still a great and totally unique series. The game was kind of pointless and the length was something I had a problem with, as the movie should have been longer and more full of explanations of unsolved mysteries, but it is definitely a must-see for Saw fans and probably the best since the 3rd Saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAW VII not 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first off, the 3D wasn't necessary, its SAW VII in my eyes. i have been a true SAW advocate since the beginning. loving the traps and the suspense of the story. and i must say, I'm glad to see a good finish to a good story. unfortunately like most movies, this was not without its flaws. for starters, the main game did not attract me at all, it seemed very random and it lacked the "final game" vibe. however the game was, in my opinion, only added to keep us in suspense of the main storyline: Hoffman vs Jill. that is what i was really interested in! each time we would get a piece of info of the Hoffman vs Jill, it would go back to the game forcing us to wait for the next piece of info. the return of the legendary Dr. Gordon was so epic that it sent chills down my spine! the opening and closing scenes with Gordon was simply amazing. the one thing i didn't like about the ending was it was an ending we all saw coming, yet at the same time, it was an ending we all wanted. Gordon is the last man standing (pun, since he only has one foot) by this film, you simply want Hoffman to die, if you haven't already in saw 4 (or 5). Hoffman becomes a simple flesh and blood killer instead of the jigsaw recruit jigsaw wanted him to be. Hoffman's main goal is to exact revenge on Jill for placing him in the signature trap of the SAW films: the reverse bear trap. Hoffman's strategy to getting to Jill is clever, he sets up a trap, the victims die, as the police are investigating an explosion occurs which gets everyones attention, then Hoffman removes a corpse from a body bag, places himself into it which inevitably will be transported to the morgue/police station where Jill is being kept safe. Hoffman exits the bag and goes on his killing spree and finds Jill, places her in the bear trap and finally we get to see someone die by that trap (unfortunately its Jill). Hoffman thinks he is home free until he is attacked by none other than Dr. Gordon who is Jill's "silent guardian" (a wish that jigsaw wants Gordon to carry out) and then it all ends where it all began: the bathroom. Gordon locks Hoffman in the bathroom without a hacksaw, delivers the closing line "game over" and slams the door shut ending the series and making Hoffman getting what he deserves-to let time rot him away. great finish to a great series. what made this film get a 8/10 from me, the game was weak, and the 3D was useless, i wasn't even impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While not as good as it's predecessors, Saw 7 is a good way to end the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watch my Saw 3D Video Review at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6OcxcraCAASaw 3d has been very negatively received by both critics and fans, it currently holds a 9% approval rating on rotten tomatoes which will most likely decrease in due time. But being a longtime fan of the series, I ignored the critical response, and I'm quite glad I did.In saw 6, Jill tried to kill detective Hoffman with an upgraded version of the reverse bear trap, but she fails and Hoffman survives. As you would expect, he wasn't very happy about it. In Saw 7, Hoffman begins a series of new games and Jill runs away, Hoffman tells the police that if Jill isn't given to him, the games will continue. This leads me to my first problem with the movie, Jill was somewhat of a wasted potential to me, after watching 6, I thought Jill would turn out to be a very important character for the franchise, but in 7 she was reduced to a coward, she runs, hides, and eventually goes to the police for protection. Sure, it makes sense that she would be discouraged after her failed attempt to kill Hoffman, but I expected a lot more from her. Anyways, the subplot is about Bobby Dagen, a man that falsely claims to have survived one of Jigsaw's games. He becomes famous after writing a book and motivationally speaking about his traumatic experience. His words get him into trouble with Jigsaw and he is subsequently forced to face the consequences of his lies. The setup for Bobby's game is very similar to last year's Saw 6, where bobby must go room to room and try to save everyone involved in his rise to fame. It's not quite as good as it was in Saw 6 though, mainly because in Saw 6, the main character, William, was faced with moral choices, like when he had to choose to save either the file clerk or his secretary. There's none of that in Saw 7, instead it's, "Do this or they die" with every single trap. It's not to say the traps aren't great. In fact, Saw 7 has my favorite trap in the entire series, where a skinhead is glued to the front seat of a car, I won't give anything else about it away, but it's absolutely amazing. But I felt that some of the other traps were a bit too big and complex for one or two people to have made, like the short lawnmower trap scene, or the oven capsule towards the end, don't get me wrong, these traps are awesome and have satisfyingly gory results, but I thought they deviate a little too far from reality. The acting is somewhat of a mixed bag. For starters, Sean Patrick Flannery and Costas Mandylor do a great job. I really liked Hoffman this time around, his descent into madness was incredibly well done. You'd probably expect me to praise Tobin Bell's performance, but unfortunately, he only has about 5 minutes of total screen time. Even though there wasn't much else to say about John Kramer, I couldn't help but be very dismayed by this decision. Then there's Cary Elwes, or Doctor Gordon, his presence made this movie a must see for me, and while he also doesn't have much screen time, his appearance and role in the story did not disappoint. Chad Donella, who acts as Detective Gibson had a very unnatural performance, I don't blame him though, since he was given some pretty mediocre and cheesy lines. As I mentioned before, Betsy Russell or Jill was a let down, it's sad because she did a decent job in the previous movies, especially in Saw 6. This is the first movie of the new 3D trend that I've seen, so I can't give a comparative evaluation for the quality of the 3D effects. I can say that the glasses were extremely uncomfortable for me to wear since I had to wear them on top of my regular glasses. The 3D effects weren't used very often, but when they were, it looked pretty cool, I enjoyed seeing the blood and gore projected in 3D. But I don't think the 3D was necessary, I would have enjoyed the movie just the same if it was in 2D. Saw 3D wasn't the best in the series, but it was far from the worst, that honor goes to Saw 2. The movie itself is just good, not remarkable like Saw 6. It was the phenomenal ending that made the price of admission well worth it. The numerous flaws were immediately forgiven when the credits rolled. I don't care if you disagree with me, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the conclusion, especially after being terribly disappointed with the LOST finale. THE GOOD: +Great ending +Dr. Gordon's return +Some awesome trapsTHE BAD: -Not enough Tobin Bell -Jill's wasted potential -Some bad acting/dialogue -Traps too extravagant</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Changes I'd Make to the Saw Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. Jigsaw wouldn't be captured/killed until the FINAL MOVIE. He's the killer... no one else has to continue his work... well, maybe Hoffman because Jigsaw has blackmail on Hoffman.2. I'd make it clear that Jigsaw designed every single trap. Hoffman isn't an engineer, and the movies make you think that Hoffman creates all these traps himself. Where would he find the time to design and build the traps?! 3. Dr. Gordon did not have to be a part of the traps either... he could have turned in Jiggy and got away with it... Jiggy didn't have real blackmail on him (except for the cheating on wife stuff).4. The traps would be way better. It seems like the traps from Saw 3-7 were thought up at the very last minute. They are not gross enough.5. No trap would ever be performed in broad daylight. The trap at the beginning of Saw 7 was a joke and had a stupid presentation.6. If Jill and Hoffman wanted to just shoot each other with a gun... they could, and be rid of each other once and for all. Why the traps? If you really want to kill someone, you don't even risk giving them a chance to survive a trap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Saw one last time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Halloween will never be the same again, as the seventh and final instalment of the franchise bows out in all its bloody glory.Where to begin? Kevin Greutert returns to the director's chair and somehow manages to come up with new ways to kill people in the most gory and ridiculous way possible, in arguably the goriest entry since Saw III. It also sticks to the grainy underworld feel of the previous films with a sturdy focus and pace.It was however a bad move to shoot the film in 3D, and Greutert has nowhere near used the technology to his full advantage. Unfortunately, this adds to the comedy element, as I spent most of the film laughing at the torture porn instead of relating to the characters' pain. It's also a shame that Tobin Bell's fiendishly clever serial killer Jigsaw has just one short scene for the 90 minute run.The final twist will please fans greatly, but unfortunately the writers leave the story on yet another cliffhanger, with the possibility of an eighth film, but thankfully Hollywood has promised never to make another one...but watch this space... Overall, nothing will beat James Wan's Saw I, but beats Saw III, IV and V by a clear mile. However, without watching the previous six films, don't even bother paying to see this as the film fills in plot holes and loose ends in a satisfying way for fans.It's the end of a very grisly era; fans will love this, newcomers won't, so this is a strong recommendation to fans. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is It Really Game Over?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two days before Halloween in 2004 the newest horror film series began with a bang with the release of "Saw" causing audiences all over to crave more of this new type of extremely gory yet clever horror film. Audiences received what they wanted when "Saw II" was released near Halloween in 2006, followed by "Saw III" one year later in 2007. What audiences did not know was that this trend would continue year after year for seven years straight. This trend has continued this year with the 2010 release of "Saw 3D ? The Final Chapter" two days before Halloween capturing its name from the new sensation of 3D technology. The basic plot of the film begins with the continuation of the ending scene in Saw VI and revolves around a number of Jigsaw survivors from the previous films seeking help and sanctuary from the gruesome life-changing test that they were put through. They receive support from each other and from a proclaimed self-help therapist known as Bobby (Sean Patrick Flannery, "The Boondock Saints"). He has become very famous from writing a book about his own personal experience with winning a Jigsaw game. However, Bobby may not be who he portrays himself to be and is in line to suffer the consequences of Jigsaw's legacy that has been passed down to police Detective Hoffman in prior films. Tobin Bell's character Jigsaw is still very much alive in the film even though his teachings have been tailored to fulfill certain character's own self interest. However, by the end of the film there will be redemption and the truth behind Jigsaw's legacy is reinstated. The traps in the film will not disappoint Saw fans because they are taken to a new level of gruesome, gory horror. The most gruesome trap in the series is present in the film and will make any sane person cringe at the pain and anguish it brings towards the characters. The best part of the film hands down is the ending, which delivers its usual slap in the face to the audience when everything is explained creating a more satisfying ending to the series than the ending of the sixth film. The entire series culminates in the ending stretching all the way back to the original film and flowing through the rest of the series. Every question a is answered at the end of the film therefore succeeding in doing what "Saw VI" failed to do a year ago.The biggest problems with the film include a lot of empty space between the entertaining commencement of the film and the climatic ending that becomes very dry and wanders away from the feel of the Saw series. Also, the worst acting in the entire series shows up in this installment especially from Chad Donella's portrayal of Detective Gibson. He is not alone though. One of the survivors says one of the dumbest lines in the entire series in a very serious environment that is hard to take seriously with her statement, "The only thing that I have to look forward to is handicap parking at the mall." Lastly Jigsaw's game is not worth seeing in 3D because of the hefty fifteen-dollar ticket when a ten-dollar 2D ticket is available. The new traps do not look any better in 3D, but are a lot more gruesome to a whole new level in this installment.A lot cannot be expected from the seventh installment of a horror film series though, but as long as there are fans and the film is making money the series may not have an expiration date. Die-hard "Saw" fans should see it now in 2D while others should wait for its DVD release. Similar to the sixth film, "Saw 3D" is supposed to be the last "Saw", however, is this true or will the legacy of the famous serial killer Jigsaw, that Tobin Bell has played for almost a decade now live on? Or to quote Jigsaw is it "Game Over?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just seen Saw 1 , this one is OK, pointless 3D, same old traps....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have just seen Saw 1 and now the final one, i don't think i need to see the rest of them. i hope so. its all the same old excess BLOOD, GORE, extreme torture, Body parts falling....... but this time in a unnecessary 3D. don't know about the rest of them but this one was just fine , not bad. Critics are seriously hating it. as far as blood and torture is concerned it was great (OMG can't believe i am actually saying that) this movie must be just same as the other one, since i haven't seen the rest of them i liked it. the whole environment atmosphere and the suspense that is created.after watching the rest i may scream enoughhhhh .... and change my review but for now , this movie was OK. story and screenplay is weak of course as usual at many places. Movie was shorter than I expected, about an 1hr and 30min. was hoping it be longer since it was wrapping up the series but it is what it is. Saw 3D didn't have an incredible story, it had a slightly predictable twist but the bottom line is it wrapped the franchise up, answering (most) questions and was a fun film along the way. If you have seen the others and enjoyed them then you can't afford to miss this. As for the '3D' aspect, that wasn't necessary either. Most of the traps looked fake, and the 3D was a little over the top. 'Saw' just jumped on the bandwagon in an attempt to get more money. After this ludicrous end to the series, I only consider the first 'Saw' to be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasted opportunity ######Possible Spoilers######</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this on Friday. Walking into the screening for this film I was eagerley anticipating the bookend to this flawed but consistently entertaining horror franchise. I must confess I am not a die hard Saw fan but have religiously made the journey every year almost always on opening weekend to watch the story unfold. Within minutes of sitting in our seats soon followed an argument with the cinema usher and a group of local chavs who did not seem to understand the concept of paying extra for premiere seats which they had almost certainly not done. This in itself pushed me to the brink of overwhelming irritation and when they finally were asked to leave I breathed a sigh of relief the general annoyance of the evening having been erased from my memory. The film that unfolded before my very eyes actually happened to irritate me just as much if not a tiny bit more than Manchester's local chav's! From the off the writing seemed lazy. The death scenes although once again elaborate seemed to lack the intensity and visual foreboding of its predecessors. I always viewed Saw as a very interesting franchise as the premise has remained interesting despite few radical changes since the off. In the latest chapter however the cinematography is all too familiar and the fact that the majority of the cast would better suit a lighthearted guest spot on Glee didn't really help to hold a rather weak plot together. All the while i was looking to forgive the film, relying heavily upon the climactic third act of the film as I looked at my watch (knowing the running time) I realised I was already in the final third and at this point knew there would be little satisfaction to come in the remaining 20 mins. I'll give Patrick Melton &amp; Marcus Dunstan kudos for the twist. I didn't see it coming, I really didn't! But only because i didn't think the writers would discredit such a much loved horror saga with such an abysmal jump the shark ending. That being said I still sadistically enjoyed the gore in the film however intentional or not I did feel that a lot of the violence evoked laughter more than anything else. In short, was i bored? No. Was i satisfied? No. After the likes of films like Inception it's time for Hollywood to take note. People don't want the same regurgitated mess time and time again. Inception proved that movie-goers are willing to accept new ideas no matter how complex and for the writers of Saw to produce this as the franchise's swan song felt like a bit of a slap in the face and lacked the ambition of previous installments</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i think thats all loose ends tied up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>having been a fan of the saw series i must admit that after 4 my expectations got lower (saw 6 raised them a little), so when i went to the cinema, not expecting much, i left very pleased with what i got. i admit saw might not be the greatest series ever and all the negative it gets are very true, in fact looking back at past saw films jigsaw is a bit loose with his own rules. he actually have quite a few innocent victims die or get very messed up in the head during the course of a game...and thinks he's helped them to??? so he isn't perfect (then again he is trapping them so the true victims really fight for survival...but that's not a good defense, innocents shouldn't have to suffer because of who their connected to) but it does what it sets out to do and that's aimed at the saw fans which i am. the traps themselves along with the 3d aspect (not really coming at you as it makes itself seem but still pretty effective) are really inventive, although the end trap was a bit jump the shark moment but i guess... *spoiler* ...with jigsaw having more help than anyone has realized and having helped built more of the city than we all knew (saw 2 game mentioned it, kinda helps actually he is smart and was housing developer or something, he could have pulled it all off...its a stretch but i can accept it) maybe the trap at the end could be made possible.*final thoughts and spoiler* end of the day i got my money's worth and am glad how its ended but i have a strong dislike for one thing, after saw 1 i thought i would never see a victim again that i would root for to live, if i truly thought they had changed, until saw 6, in which i hated that kid for killing the guy cause i actually thought he'd changed. now the victim in this film i liked his acting and again i wanted him to live cause he had changed...well they did that but they still managed to find a way to make me go what the f*** and made me really hate who came up with that ending. if i was the guy i would just want to die straight after.anyways, it did deliver a good finale farewell which made me happy. also because as probably one of the biggest saw fan (its not really a good thing i know), saw was milked for way to long. saw 1 - end it there,great film would have a strong cult. OK then, saw 3 - end there, an alright trilogy. fine, saw 6 - just end it i enjoy the series but im an addict please stop! saw 3d was good and thank god its over (im conflicted, what can i say)8/10 not a bad way to end the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really care about this franchise, I really do. Back in 2004, I read a review for the original that stated that some guy in the movie was practically forced to cut his own foot off to live and I remember being mortified by the idea. Anyways, that dread quickly turned into morbid curiosity and me and my younger brother went out that day and watched the first one. Then came the sequels... we never looked back since.Every year, the Saw films kept bringing us back together to discuss the new entry in fine intricate details. Hence, I have to admit I am a little bit sad to see this franchise go. But go it did and SAW 3D pulled it off well for the most part.I appreciate this film, but it's definitely not for it's depth. I mean, how many seven part horror series do you know have a narrative as stable as this? Didn't think so. This movie is unique in that it recycles elements we have witnessed in previous entries and presents them in a much more purified form. The pacing is fast and the typical amount of hesitation that comes with being in Jigsaw's traps is absent. There are no moments where characters waste time on screen. You can tell that the director, Kevin Greutert, worked hard at making this film hyper-efficient in its storytelling. May we be reminded that the plots of Saw VII and Saw VIII were mashed together to make this entry, because it definitely shows.Here's the problem: There is so much base to cover in the Saw universe and so little time to tie off all the loose ends. Then again that's what it does right. SAW 3D takes all the elements that made the Saw franchise what it is (albeit in a purified almost retrospective form) and ties it into a nice little package. There are no major loose ends to nag the viewer at the end and although some will disagree due to lack of imagination or understanding, all the choices it makes are the right ones. The 3D is not so gimmicky that the film will be unwatchable once it hits the shelves in 2D and its core plot is original enough to feel as though we're witnessing something new. (for a Saw film)As a dedicated Saw fan I couldn't ask for anymore than this entry right here. This series has always been itself and has never strayed off it's path till the end. This film seals it. Thanks for the ride. (Oh, and please don't come back without Elwes or Bell.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final chapter?....I doubt it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where was Jigsaw? He IS the Saw films and although his brief appearances were disturbing but delicious, his absence was saw-ly missed.Plus I find Hoffman frustrating and confusing. On the one hand, he is capable of building engineering masterpieces but he is also quick to use a knife or a gun to dispatch anyone who gets in his path, so why bother with the traps? What is he, a mastermind or a maniac? Finally, I almost cheered when Gibson was blown away! But, why was he dispatched so quickly? If anyone deserved to be tortured, it was him.To summarise, if this was the first film, it would not have impressed me but its more aimed at the die-hard fans. If you've never seen a Saw film before, this is not the one to start with because of ongoing references to previous events and characters. I was able to predict most of the plot and there weren't any real surprises, but the subtleties were there if you looked hard enough. Fans will sit and wait for the DVD (director's cut and extras, yes please)...and then Saw VIII - its coming, mark my words (I am expecting at least Saw X(rated)...the slogan alone would be too good to miss).Definitely not one for the kids or during mealtime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one which may be the last one took things up a notch the violence seemed very elaborate, however the storyline seemed a bit "blah" the 3D effects weren't really needed in this one, the only time it really stands out is when the kills start and you see blood and gore splat, other than that your just watching people "blather and walk around in 3D which isn't really fun.. I wish it could have been a bit longer, this movie seemed way too short to be a finale, and it just ended with the possibility to continue. Perhaps Lionsgate should sell the rights to someone else to start a new series, perhaps give it a new name..Anyway good movie, not bad, you definitely get what you came in for, this is the first Saw where was really biting my lip and squeamish during the torture, i mean they really had grown men all in the theater turning their heads who all thought they were going to man up and laugh while it was going on lol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw VII... errrr Saw 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***NOTE: This contains spoilers to PAST movies, not Saw VII***Another Halloween means another Saw movie. This time, I was hoping my seventh annual Halloween weekend trip to the theaters would be better than the previous two trips. As it turns out, the latest Saw movie is much better than the previous 2 films, but that's not saying much.Saw VII? I mean Saw 3D, is the supposed 'final' chapter in the successful Saw series. Those of you familiar with the series should be anticipating this movie, whether it be for reasons of curiosity, or because of shear relief that this franchise if finally over. While not a die hard fan of the series, I have found them all enjoyable. Very rarely does a horror franchise come along that spawns more than 3 movies. When they do, you couldn't ask for a better collection of films than the Saw series. Even if you despise all the torturing and twists that occur throughout, you honestly cannot tell me any of these movies is worse than Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, or Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Simply put, this series has been consistently engaging and highly watchable, no matter what your final opinions may be.This time around, the formula stays pretty much the same. We follow a man named Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery, Boondock Saints) going through a series of traps trying to save people closest to him. The plot is pretty much exactly the same as Saw VI, except this time the character is not an insurance agent, he is a self-proclaimed Jigsaw survivor who has made millions off a self-help book. As expected, there are numerous other story lines intertwined as well. Jigsaw's apprentice Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is hunting down Jigsaw's wife Jill Kramer (Betsy Russell, as seen in a plastic surgeon's office) because of how she left him to end the last film. She ends up hiding out in a 'safe house' under supervision of Internal Affairs Agent Gibson (Chad Donella, Final Destination). Meanwhile, Gibson is trying to track down Hoffman before he kills any more people.There is nothing new to offer here, except that there are more traps in this movie than any other entry in the series with 11. Most of these traps are clever and original, while some are rehashed. More importantly, the aftermath of all these traps are quite gory, except one or two. I would say that this is the bloodiest one of the bunch, and that is saying a lot given how gruesome most of these are. If you don't cringe at a few of these death scenes, you may want to check your pulse. While some of the bodies ended up looking like plastic dummies, I still applaud the effort put in. Since the death scenes might be the only things in this movie that had any effort put into.One of the worst aspects of this movie is that the majority of the characters had no background or connection to previous entries in the series. Yes, they brought in most of the survivors of past movies for a few scenes, but this movie should have been more about them, while containing a more original plot. Instead, we have to follow around Bobby. Why the hell is newcomer Bobby the main character in the final movie of the series?!? Who cares about him, or the singer of Linkin Park that appears in the junkyard game? The one person who definitely belongs in it the most is Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), and he is in this film for maybe 5 minutes. That is unacceptable, especially for the finale. As hard as the writers have tried to make each movie connect, I was let down by the final product here.Another disappointing thing about Saw 3D is the fact that the main killer, Hoffman, doesn't really follow the Jigsaw recipe the entire movie. He chooses random people to 'test' and most games are not survivable. Plus, he turns into a Terminator towards the end and just slices and dices his way to Jill. Also, the chase scenes through the hallways looked incredibly staged and extremely cheesy. Decent slasher action, but Saw is not, and never was, a slasher movie.Another thing that bothered me is that most of the traps were pointless, even more than usual. For instance, why was there a public 'game' at the beginning? This was completely out of place and had no connection to the rest of the movie. There seemed to be too much left unanswered for it to be considered a conclusion. Unless there is another movie being planned down the line, in which case it might answer all the remaining questions. But if that happened, it would be a cheap marketing move to lie to the public to get them to see the 'final' movie.In conclusion, the filmmakers could have done way better job here, being that this is the 'final' movie. However, this movie was a lot better than Saw V and VI, but not as good as the first 4 movies. Yet again, the 3D was a disappointing gimmick. While some scenes involved body parts flying at the screen, it was mostly tacky and largely forgettable. Overall, I recommend this movie to fans or anyone who has seen the others, mostly because Saw 3D does offer some closure on a few characters and story lines. If you don't like any of the Saw movies and don't care how the series ends, don't feel bad about skipping it. Besides some great traps and death scenes, the plot contains most of the same ole tricks and the end doesn't blow your mind, 3D or not.Total Score: 5/10 Buckets: 4.5/5 More reviews at SplatterFilms.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Saw Series has now ended and everyone knows what happened and if you watched the movies you weren't surprised but rather excited you figured it out. I was very into all the Saw movies and watched them all many times each, trying to figure out where it was going. The second movie with the guy with the key beyond his eye gave the ending away to the last movie pretty noticeably. It was great that they were able to put so many clues through out all the movies and really tie them together in the end. Even though the story was good I think they needed to just relax on the blood and guts. I mean I am all for making it has gross as you possibly can and making people cringe in their seats but they took it to far again and it was so unrealistically bloody. So I say if you are a Saw fan go see it for sure and if you really like the blood and you like the feeling of getting chills and cringing go and see it. I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because as an over all movie its nothing great, the movie its just another average movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is slightly better then last two just on sheer entertainment factor alone. It adds nothing to the story line, the characters and 1 dimensional and you don't care what so ever about them but it has some pretty interesting kills so it keeps your attention.However in the other saw movies all the blood and gore was actual make up and not CGI. The blood and gore in this is all CGI and what isn't just looks retarded. Somehow they made the blood and gore worse. Is anyone with me and misses the days where CGI blood didn't fly out.This movie is about yet another copycat serial killer of the Jigsaw murders(I know I didn't see it coming either) who sets up very elaborate, very impossible scenarios in which people kill themselves in.This movie was slightly better then the last two but thats only because the last two were so bloody awful. This movie is terrible and just stay away from it. If you want to watch a good saw movie watch 1,2,3 maybe 4 just stay away from the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Saw I-VI, but the seventh movie really just ruined everything. and there is only one reason why, and its because the blood was pink. its a blood and gorr movie, which means its main focus is on blood. bad blood effects are OK in B movies but for well known movies like saw this just feels lazy to me. and to top it of, there were pink in everything else too. pink paint lines on the floor. pink light bulbs, and pink construction materials. not saying that the movie would be a 10 if the blood were realistic but it would be a lot better and maybe then i would be able to watch it without checking my facebook and instagram 10 times during the movie due to boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Final Chapter"? Ha! Sure Saw sequels, sure, OK I'll play into your game this time. After 7 years of Saw we supposedly have the last sequel with Saw 3D. I just have a hard time believing that Hollywood give up on this amazing franchise, amazing how many people criticize these movies yet still they make #1 at the box office each time. However I have to admit I was more excited to see this sequel because it marked the return of Cary Elwes back into the story and Sean Patrick Flannery was in the cast who I feel bad that he isn't a bigger star and fell into the horror genre too quickly. Saw 3D doesn't fail on the blood and the gore and is probably the most gruesome of the sequels, however it didn't feel like it should have been which I think it could have been a huge concert. I thought the traps were extremely clever and the story is better, I would say the strongest since the third and to see how all this crazy madness ends was almost bittersweet. But the film left off where I think it could still be picked up again, God help us all. Of course the acting isn't anything grand, but what else would expect? But the first trap makes up for it by making it the ultimate couple's counseling trap and solves problems better than Jerry Springer. It's all craziness from that point on and no one is left to have a choice in living.After witnessing Mark Hoffman survive the reverse bear trap, Jill Tuck goes to Matt Gibson, an internal affairs detective at Hoffman's precinct. She offers to incriminate Hoffman in exchange for police protection and immunity. Hoffman, meanwhile, abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsely claiming to have survived a Jigsaw trap. As the police investigate the junkyard and search for Dagen, Hoffman sends videos to Gibson, offering cryptic clues to his location and promising to stop the games if Jill is delivered to him. Bobby awakens in an abandoned insane asylum and is informed that his wife Joyce has also been abducted and will die if he does not reach her in time. Dagen navigates his way through the asylum, finding his publicist Nina, his lawyer Suzanne and his close friend Cale all in traps. Despite his efforts to save them, all three are killed. But the plot thickens as we find out that Jigsaw had recruited an old friend who might be able to end all this madness once and for all.Like I said my only disappointment being is that I didn't feel as this was that big of a deal, I wanted sort of a "best of" with all these sequels. We do have some reoccurring characters from the first movie which is cool and we finally find out what happened at the end of the first film. I think the trap for the character Bobby was pretty cool as we know that if this was real life, someone would be trying to cash in or lie about being a survivor of the Jigsaw. I love that his friends he had to save we just unlikable so you couldn't wait to see their deaths. It's a bit disappointing though that we don't officially find out what happens to everyone, there's still a bit of closure and I think this was a pretty satisfying sequel. Definitely if you're looking for cool traps and to finish this insane dark cop drama, I would recommend it. However if you don't like these movies, don't bother seeing them, you know what they are and they don't lie about it. But just wait and see in a year or two, "You thought Jigsaw was done, you thought it was over, but you were wrong, DEAD wrong!" and so on.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot of this movie. I've been a huge fan of the series up until the sixth installment and was looking forward to see how the story will end, but honestly it was not worth the wait. This is by far the worst movie of the year even for fans like me I think that this was only made for financial reasons. I seriously felt robbed as I walked out the theater. This is only recommended if you don't have nothing else to do. I guess the producers are the ones to blame. 3d was only a desperate measure to keep the people interested but it is terrible done. Secondly the screenplay seems to be written with crayons and doesn't add anything interesting to the story. It is so sad that the once interesting movie going experience has turned to a nonsense crap that left me disappointed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not follow the rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read quite a few reviews that address the twist at the end, and other frustrations, but nothing bothered me as much as the feeling that Saw 3D violated the "rules" at the heart of the Saw movies. That is, the series was pretty successful at maintaining some common threads that were at its foundation: John is a sympathetic character, the classic anti-hero; he's brilliant, and somewhat omniscient. Bad people get what they deserve, in one way or another, even if they learn their lesson and are redeemed. Totally innocent characters like kids and unaware spouses don't die. John gives everyone a chance to to help themselves. John loves Jill and protects her. John is smarter than everyone. John is able to out-think and out-plan everyone; he is always in control, even when he sits back and waits for events to unfold.The most obvious betrayal of the rules for me, was that, in Saw 3D, Jill dies! Even through in Saw VI, John promised her "a way out," and had earlier provided her a mysterious key that she would "know what to do with when the time comes." I thought sure it would be that darn key around her neck that would unlock the trap that eventually kills her. I guess the key was only to unlock the box in Saw VI? Anyway, it seemed "wrong" that Jill would die - John is/was simply too smart to let that happen. I found it tough to accept that, after six films of unerring planning and brilliant scheming, which kept him 10 steps ahead of everyone, including his "students," he fails to protect Jill from Hoffman, a man who John was more than capable of outsmarting. I realize Jill probably does not fall easily into the "totally innocent" category, but she worked at a clinic helping addicts and lost her baby. She's as close to a saint as anyone in the Saw world - so what if she tried to kill the maniac Hoffman? Also, I didn't like how the lone character who was truly, completely innocent (Joyce) dies the most excruciating, horrifying death of all. Heck, event the racist skinheads died relatively quickly, but Joyce gets roasted alive. Not fair! That's also something John was too smart (and logical) to let happen - after all, the innocent mother and son trapped in Saw VI were never in any actual danger. For the Saw films to work, they need to "follow the rules," just as Jigsaw always insists, and this one seemed to forget that. I felt like John needed to win in the end for the series to tie everything together neatly in a satisfying way. Well, maybe Saw VIII will be clear everything up...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw ends the series with a bang, a rip, &amp; a buzz.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To those that have grown to love and hate the Saw series, here it is. The final Saw. How much you will like the end of the series depends on how you go in thinking about it. Here's some advice: Don't think about it so much and watch the movie. Also, stop expecting it to change. It won't.In this one, a self-help motivational speaker is a survivor of Jigsaw's traps, and launches a book to promote helping others. But there are secrets to be uncovered from both him and the others involved from the previous installments, and will be pitted against, you guessed it: traps.There's a whole lot of death here. A LOT. The body count registers more then any of the others, as far as I can tell. Hoffman himself is as dangerous as any trap. Most of the traps are OK, but there is one in particular that takes place in a junkyard garage that is gruesomely well done. The 3D effects? It was fine. Rather then doing a quick conversion, the producers actually implemented the 3D effects from the start. Some were very well done, others were very minor and simple, but at least not overdone. Still, I could have seen the movie in 2D and given it the same rating.What makes Saw so appealing to me is the fact that the writers go that extra mile to tie up loose ends, filling in details of the past. It's obvious that they are making it up as they go along, and if you do wind up thinking too hard about it, it's absurd. Thinking back, so are most horror series movies. As usual, it's best to have seen the previous Saws in order to understand what is going on. Sure, this 7th Saw has its share of problems: a few too many unnecessary flashbacks, not enough screen time for the two big returning actors (John &amp; Dr. Gordon) &amp; timing issues. (The clock shows only 5 seconds left, why are they still working on it 20 seconds later??!)Another bothersome thing to me is that somewhere along the way, they tossed out "teaching the wrong-doer a lesson" and moved into "just kill anyone in the way" in order to progress the story. I think it could have worked without that, and it gave a bad feeling somewhere in the pit of my intestinal tract. But in the end, these are minor issues. You go see a movie like Saw to see who's the backstabber, how did he/she do it, and is person X going to make it out alive, not for sentimental crap. Those that continue to want to see a different movie, or a Saw that is aiming for an Oscar are in for a big disappointment. If after Saw 4 you were tired of it, don't be silly. Stop watching it and stop wasting your time.I've also seen comments on how flipping back and forth from one story line and character to another is confusing. The previous Saw did this too. Well, I was never lost. It was easy to follow, and it made it all the more exciting. Seriously, if you can't handle fast-paced action sequences, slightly complex multiple story lines, and huge amounts of blood, go watch something slow and boring like Paranormal Activia, or whatever the hell it's called. Yes, director Kevin Greutert wanted to do PA2, but why? I do recommend Saw 7 over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a die hard Saw fan from the beginning, never missed a movie premiere &amp; I don't even go to the movies, just for Saw movies. This was disappointing. First, the more gore does not make a movie better, it makes it worse &amp; the producers are getting out of control with the gore. The enticing factor of Saw movies is the twisted-ness. I still like the traps &amp; the reasons for them, never disappointed there. But the fact that I had to cover my eyes more than half of the time &amp; I felt like I wanted to puke by the time I left, just didn't sit right. Second &amp; most of all, PLEASE find better actors. Where do you find these clowns? Do they not get paid enough to get good actors? I'm horrible with names, but the main officer (not Hoffman)was atrocious!! He sounded like he was reading a script! Hoffman was no Tobin Bell. I wish he would have never been written off, it's gone down hill since. The movie was very predictable, total bummer. I knew the book writer was a fraud from the very beginning, it was obvious. Then when the real survivor from the meeting group, with the cane showed up, again it was obvious he was going to pop up again &amp; where else to put him, but as an understudy to Jigsaw. Lastly, when I pay for 3D, I'd like to see some 3D!!! I recall ONE thing coming at us during the movie, the rest was bland &amp; not worth the extra money. All in all, I am extremely disappointed with this movie &amp; though I would love to keep the movie going, it seems the writers are exhausted &amp; need to throw in the towel before they make a horrible name for Saw movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disgraced lieutenant Hoffman goes on the warpath against Jigsaw's widow as the last of the tests unravel in a hellish scenario, replete with disembowelment in three dimensions.My problem with this movie is knowing how much better it ought to have been. Speaking as a legitimate Saw fan since the birth of the franchise, I could not believe how much the current creators of this new instalment had to press the audience to suspend their disbelief. Saw 3D does not fit the tone of the other movies at all. The story is essentially sacrificed for ridiculous trap scenarios that do not even make sense or are even feasible. In the first Saw films all the traps the characters had to endure were genuine plot devices that strung along the narrative, not gratuitous over-the-top deaths of strangers the audience is never going to care about.The ubiquitous twist, of which the franchise became known for, was a ham-handed "surprise" entrance by Dr. Gordon. While I was a big supporter of Gordon being alive the whole time, his appearance in this film is total fanboy pandering. I expected a much larger conspiracy in that respect.Finally, Jigsaw/Kramer. What a mess. What primarily drew audiences in was Jigsaw's perverse moral compass, his seemingly cruel yet poetic agenda that played with the will of people, his want in answering the darker questions on the human condition. In this movie, dementia must have set in, because he's punishing twenty somethings over a misspent relationship while abandoning his dynasty to a mope who has some serious bloodlust and a cripple doctor who apparently has completely avoided public scrutiny.Wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The same ol' saw, nothing new, nothing fresh, nothing to care for, the pointless continues...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the first movie but I somehow hate the series because it gets dumber and dumber. Anyway, last year, Saw VI proved me why this franchise needs to stop because I had witnessed the worst Saw movie and that frightened me but not in terms of horror but in terms of what studios are trying to sell. This year I hoped for the best since Saw VII (or Saw 3D, such a stupid title) was/is supposed to be the last one in the series and the movie that will give all the needed answers. I stood in my theater chair and I waited for the movie to start. Suddenly, two guys and a girl are in a glass room in some open square in full day in one of Jigsaw's traps... The nightmare started... But where were the cops?... Oh, I forgot it's a movie, that's an excuse... After that, I was simply disappointed by all the chaos in this movie. Saw VII it's a pretty short film, the action runs fast and that's not a problem since I got bored by it... Even if some of the traps looked "awesome" the usual stuff was still there, nothing new, no twist, no nothing... All were just other jigsaw traps and this time like in the last 3-4 movies, some of the traps were ridiculous and unreal not to mention the acting was so lame I mean... Jesus... There's a lot of situations in which a normal person would not react like these actors reacted but HEY... I know... It's a movie... and that's the excuse... The storytelling in this last saw movie is... ambiguous since laugh about it or not, the end even if it gives away the details and the answers you're looking for it still let's room for another saw movie... Ain't that great? When you think the journey it's over, when you think they delivered everything they had to, you just remain there and question yourself... Another Saw movie would be possible?... Of course it would... It's the Sawwww seriessss... To finish with the story structure this movie is better than the last one, at least it gives away the long-awaited answers but still it manages to get stupid and irrelevant... Many situations in this whole series have no actual motive behind them, no real background, they were just thrown in for the sake of it and just because it may sound/appear cool to the audience...The gore in Saw is mediocre... the effects at times were pretty bad and I never noticed the 3D, maybe only in once scene but other than that what a waste of money for that unrecognisable 3D... Technically this movie doesn't achieve it's goals... It just fails... The acting, like I said, is bad, there's no emotion, no soul, no fear, just screams and stupid grimes on people's faces...I honestly don't know what to think about this, I'm biased... It's an average saw movie... better than the sixth but even with this so-called "ending"... this one is another failure for this franchise... I'm sorry saw producers but you need to quit and let the market breathe for a moment... We're just tired and bored by the same lines, the same clichés, the same routine, the same on-going twists that could last for like forever, we're tired of the Saw series and hopefully it will end...I don't have anymore things to say, it's a pretty short review because I just didn't liked the movie... It was on a such high "meh" standard that I can't or I don't want to describe it too much... Do what you want, go check it out or leave it alone, I don't really care because to me it's not recommendable unless you want to know what the "end" really is...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAW's final chapter...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a huge fan of the SAW series since the first one came out for being how original, chilling, and dramatic it was. When I heard that SAW 3D is the last one, I was bummed but yet satisfied of a conclusion of a thrilling giant of a series. Let's face it. If they made several more rather than finishing it now, the franchise would crash and burn for running out of ideas and getting too unreal. As for saying that, is feels right that SAW 3D should be the last of this tremendous horror story of revenge, redemption, rebirth, and revolution.SAW 3D's story plot, in my opinion, overall, was pretty good. I was expecting of a more tighter story like the previous one, but it's still good as it is. It's great to see old characters of the past in this one but I didn't feel that much depth with the new characters. I would get to that later in this review. The 3D effects, in my humble opinion, wasn't that special. Sure, it exaggerates depth (foregrownd, middle-ground, background), but what's the purpose. Plus, there was only two or three scenes that had guts and other things "coming out" at you. Overall, don't expect anything great about it.In this final chapter, Jigsaw's last orders for Jill is to kill Hoffman with the Reverse Bear Trap. Things don't go as planned when Hoffman cheated out of the trap, ripping his cheek open. In pain and rage, Hoffman begins his hunt for Jill. Jill goes to the police and specifically asks for Detective Gibson for safety. Gibson and Hoffman though had a rocky past when Gibson filed police brutality on Hoffman. Hoffman knew Jill went to him so this is perfect for Hoffman to get some payback.During this battle, Jigsaw survivor, Bobby Dagen, gets all the popularity for writing an autobiography about his life-changing experience. The only problem is though that he's never been in a Jigsaw trap before. For being a complete liar and con-artist, he's been put to the test to see if he can be a true survivor by rescuing his friends and his wife.Back to about the characters, It is great to see Cary Elwes return as Dr. Gordon! Lets be honest. Everybody was waiting for his return! But this version of Dr. Gordon was completely strange. Sure, your life won't be the same after you amputated your foot and cauterizing it with a hot pipe, but he acted TOO weird. He sounded more like Heath Ledger's Joker more than the doctor we knew from the very first film. Bobby Dagen was played by Sean Patrick Flanery. He's best known for being in the Boondock Saints films and the Young Indiana Jones show. I was quite surprised seeing him in a SAW film and he played Bobby fairly well. The times that I felt he feels out-of-place are the flashback scenes. I don't know why, but I felt he didn't put that much effort into his character in the flashback sequences. One character I just did not care about is Detective Gibson. To be honest, he felt very unimportant. The only reason why he's suppose to be important because he had a light grudge with Hoffman in the past. Secondly, the creators made the actor act very unprofessional as a cop, saying the word, crazy, five or six times in one sentence.In conclusion, SAW 3D is awesome! Few flaws, but still great. It's obviously a must-see for SAW fans. Sure it's a bummer that SAW has reached it's end but it was well worth the ride that we've gotten from the clever creators of the past six years. GAME OVER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trap heavy, but a weak conclusion to a seven year franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film honestly felt like it was just trap after trap after trap until we reached the finale. The traps were bigger and sure, they looked pretty great in 3-D, but they were happening to new characters; characters we didn't know or care about. It seemed like they tried to cram as many traps they could into an hour and a half to capitalize on the 3-D trend. On one hand, that isn't all bad. If you're a fan of the series, you'll probably still enjoy the countless amount of traps (seriously, you won't be able to remember all of them after it ends). If the film was just another Saw sequel, these bigger traps and new characters would be fine. But this is labeled as the last film of the franchise and other than what's revealed in the final minutes of the film, nothing is answered or unanswered that wasn't revealed in Saw VI.The script seemed pretty horrid at times. Coincidentally, both examples are from the Detective Gibson character. So maybe just his dialogue was written terribly. At one point, Gibson calls Jill, "crazier than a sack full of cats." Who says that? Even a crazy person who witnessed someone putting a bunch of cats in a bag would think that was lame. Later on in the film when Gibson is talking to Jill, he literally says the word, "crazy," about every other word. This isn't the exact dialogue, but it went something like, "I knew you were crazy the moment I set my eyes on you, you crazy woman. You're crazy. Crazy. I knew you were crazy." So hey, did you hear? Gibson thinks Jill is crazy. It was just very redundant, but many would use that word to describe the Saw films anyway.The biggest issue of the whole film is the lack of John Kramer. He literally has like two flashback scenes and an intro video. That's it. Sure, the man died four films ago and he's been surviving on flashbacks and memories ever since, but Tobin Bell doesn't deserve top billing if he's only in the film for five minutes. The highlights of the film mostly lie in the short amount of screen time Dr. Gordon gets. Cary Elwes' return to Saw was probably the biggest drawing point of the film. The problem is that when you bring a character back from a previous film, especially in the Saw films, you can probably guess what that person was brought back for. So the predictability was a bit of a letdown.The ending itself actually made it feel like Saw 3D was a return to form or at least an attempt to get back to its roots, which sounds pretty good on paper but isn't once you see it on-screen. Unless Saw 8 actually winds up happening and continues on with mostly new characters, then the whole thing feels like nothing more than a huge tease.Saw 3D is not a satisfying conclusion to a horror franchise that has run the past seven years as it leaves too many unanswered questions to gratify hardcore fans, but is still fairly entertaining thanks to its endless amount of traps and return of Dr. Gordon. The film does seem to wrap up everything for the John Kramer character, but makes you wonder if the series is really done or if it was left open ended on purpose in case it does well at the box office for the seventh year in a row. At the end of the day, Saw 3D may be considered a pointless sequel that will either leave fans wanting a more definitive conclusion or wishing it never happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It says there are spoilers but I'm really just referring to past films so nothing about this one...that matter.I never thought so many years ago I would be all grown up, still enjoying these movies. More than that, I can't believe I'm writing a review for the final episode in this saga.I won't talk about Dr. Gordon because he's in the film very briefly, almost like a cameo, but it just puts a big happy smile on my face seeing him again.I also won't talk too much about John Kramer, who, besides a video at the finale only has one, brief scene the entire time....but come on, the dude is dead and we know all about him, so really, they couldn't have done MORE back story...his one scene ends with laughter from the audience and a fuzzy feeling inside like "dude, you were the man"...the final videotape will go down as my absolute favorite scene of any of these films.THE PACING: The director shot this the same style as 6...in fact, everything feels like 6, which is fine with me cuz 6 was terrific.THE MUSIC: Best music yet, pulse-pounding the entire movie..there's always ambiance.HOW IT RANKS: Well, this is tough...the ending is 100% satisfying, but the plot with Bobby is something that was done better in 6. So...the beginning of this film and the ending propel this movie to 3rd place status...not bad for the 7th movie...6 would be 2nd, and, sorry haters but I loved SAW 4 and how it happened during 3.THE TRAPS: OK, these are MINOR SPOILERS...Overall the traps were good, definitely the most suspenseful in a while and by far the most gory...If you are squeamish about things going into the throat ur not going to have nightmares, you're probably going to just drop dead...sorry...but seriously EVERYTHING involves the neck once the plot gets going....well except for fish hooks...especially 1, tiny fish hook that provided the most squirms and murmurs of the night....all-in-all they were good, and surprisingly suspenseful.THE ENDING: (NO SPOILERS....PROMISE)....could not have ended any other way because I feel totally satisfied....there's no itch for the next one, there's no plot to cover, no back story unmentioned. You leave with the amazing score pounding in you and it's like "sigh, this is the last time I'll hear this during Halloween in the theater" THE 3D: Wonderful...seriously...they provide tons of jump scares that are totally effective and yes, guts do fly at you...while there aren't guts all the time the field of depth is drastic and really cool to watch....if you bank with Chase, by your tickets on moviewatcher and get buy one get one free...seriously...$10.50 for two people to see a 3D film...awesome.One final thing...the opening credits mixed with the opening scene...were awesome...best opening credits ever.sorry I had to add one more thing...minor spoiler tho... the special thing at the end in the evidence locker was so amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Return of Dr. Gordon and The End of the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahh, we have reached the end of an era. Regardless of whether we like it or not, Saw is the horror franchise of the last decade. I also read today that Saw is the third highest grossing horror series after Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. After this one though, who knows if it will surpass either of those. Jigsaw has joined Freddy and Jason (and Michael Myers) as a classic horror icon. Now on to the actual movie.Saw 3D opens with the glorious return of Dr. Lawrence Gordon played by Cary Elwes, arguably the best actor to have been in the Saw series at all. We witness how he originally dragged himself out of the trap he was placed in during the original Saw movie. He proceeds to cauterize his wound on a hot pipe which he encounters in the hallway. While he screams in pain, the opening credits begin. We then meet Bobby played by Sean Patrick Flanery of The Boondock Saints. He is a public figure who has earned everything from publicly speaking about his time as a victim and then survivor of a Jigsaw trap. It is revealed very quickly that he has lied about this and he is kidnapped by Jigsaw (now Detective Mark Hoffman) so that he may be put through a real test. The rest of the movie follows him through his game.The director Kevin Greutert kept many elements from the previous Saw films the same. Greutert is quite the veteran of the Saw movies, having edited Saw I ? V and directed Saw VI. Knowing this, you would think he'd be perfect for this, but you would be wrong for the most part. While Greutert certainly has exceptional editing skills, his directing could be considered lacking. I want to repeat that the editing in the first few movies was very good and I found it to be one of the best parts of the film.As these films have progressed, they have gotten more and more bloody. The first film had almost no blood in it whatsoever but as they went forward, they began to lack more and more plot and replace this with more and more disturbing violent deaths. We began to see this especially in Saw V, which in my opinion is the weakest link of them all, the newest film included. The end of Saw VI reminds me of when I first saw Dawn of the Dead. In Dawn of the Dead, there are a few slow motion sequences which really give you a taste of the Zack Snyder that was to come. There was one death in particular at the end of Saw VI which was extremely gratuitous in its violent nature, which unfortunately was just a fraction of what was to come.The biggest problem with this film was that every death was ridiculously violent, showing entrails falling out of stomachs and limbs being ripped off while bodies were cut in half completely. This type of gore is not what I like to see in my Saw films because it distracts so much from the plot.Overall, the story would have been a good one were the gore not so distracting in nature. The one thing which really made the film worth it for me was the return of Dr. Gordon. Without him, this would have been a complete pass. There was also a disturbing lack of Tobin Bell. Even being the title character, he was confined to two scenes. If you are a fan of the Saw films and enjoy the mythos of them, then you definitely need to see this. In terms of the history and back story of all the films, the ending truly does come full circle and complete the series. While the film itself was not very good, it really did finish the series as it should have. If you have not seen the other films and you do not know much about the characters, you're likely going to be better off skipping this.The big question here is: Is this really the last Saw film? I think we can all agree that the likely answer is no. I could lean both ways about this; certainly, if this makes enough money, they will make another. It's a cash cow that I imagine they are not exactly ready to give up. From the ending, it is hard to tell which way they would go with this. It ends in such a way that if they leave it untouched it could be the perfect ending to the series. However, it is also left in a way that it could be picked up and continued. I suppose only time will tell what they will decide to do with Jigsaw.With the initial six films, I generally have them in three categories: Saw and Saw II are exceptionally good and I would recommend them to anyone; Saw III and Saw IV complement the series but are not great stand alone films; Saw V and Saw VI are pretty much not good in any regard with a minimal amount of the trademark "Saw" twists. It is unfortunate for me to admit, but aside from the very last five minutes, this movie easily fits in to the last of those categories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While we bid farewell to the horror series, we also have to ask, is it really over? Horror movies have a tendency to come back from the dead, very much like their characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What began 7 years ago with a film about a couple of guys waking up in a dingy bathroom has evolved into one of the most successful horror franchises in history and now comes it's grand finale, in time for Halloween and in "eye popping 3D"! The film also marks a welcome return for Cary Elwes, playing the role of Dr. Gordon whom we last saw crawling out of Jigsaw's bathroom at the end of the first film. 6 films later we finally learn about what happened to him.The new film picks up right after the events of Saw 6 (2009) and shows Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) putting the reverse beer trap on Hoffman (Costas Mandylor). As Hoffman escapes, Jill goes to the police and tries to cut a deal; information for protection. Meanwhile, a group of survivors from Jigsaws traps form a support group. Among them are Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery), who has been making money from selling his story to the media and Dr. Gordon, minus his lower right leg.Gibson (Chad Donella), the detective working with Jill Tuck, has a history with Hoffman and is determined to track him down, but as a new game is set in motion, time is running out. As all of the plots converge, Saw 3D is 90 minutes of gruesome torture and revelations which don't really come as surprise. For Saw fans, it's an ending they might have guessed a long time ago, but still, it's really good to see it on it screen, although you can't help but feel the franchise ran of out steam several movies ago along with Jigsaw and Amanda (Shawnee Smith) who snuffed it in Saw 3 (2006).Though Jigsaw's aim was to highlight the error of his victim's ways and make them value their own lives, Hoffman's motives are those of a homicidal manic; he just wants to kill and therefore for the past 4 movies has not been as interesting as his predecessor was.While we bid farewell to the horror series, we also have to ask, is it really over? Horror movies have a tendency to come back from the dead, very much like their characters. The Final Destination (2009), Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) and Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday (1993) are testament to that, so is it likely we'll see another one any time in the foreseeable future? While Patrick Melton, Saw's writer, has stated it is indeed the grand finale, I say "never say never". As long as there are horror icons, there'll always be a way to resurrect them if the fans want to see them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw VII (2010) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seventh (and last?) installment in the long-running series is very disappointing and by the numbers, and that's a shame if this is to truly be "The Final Chapter", as it's being billed in some ads. I went in expecting something kind of special for the occasion and what I got was completely standard stuff. The opening sequence was staged in a different venue than had ever been tried before, which I mistakenly thought was indicative of a welcome new direction for the storyline. But my hopes were quickly dashed. I would say that as early as Part 4 I was starting to feel like the filmmakers were just throwing in whatever plot twists they could think of, and making things up as they went along, but nowhere is this more evident and desperate in feel than in Part 7. I liked where the plot seemed to be going in bringing back some survivors of Jigsaw's earlier death traps, but nothing was followed through with this angle, unfortunately. Instead, a few weak "surprises" were attempted, and the biggest "reveal" at the end came as no payoff to me, because it's easily hinted at much earlier on. There were many questions left unanswered, things that did not really come together, and I felt nothing for the main male victim who's the pawn in Jigsaw's latest game of death, which really made the whole race against the clock rather boring to me. We've seen that routine before, and done better.As I said, if this is to truly be THE LAST CHAPTER, it is a pretty unsatisfying conclusion. In all fairness, this saga is so exhausted by now that it would be wise to put it to sleep finally once and for all, except that this doesn't end the franchise in a strong enough way. But I think the producers played it safe so they could leave their options open, by NOT labeling SAW 3-D as "The Final Entry" on the title of the film itself. If it makes money, they can continue, or just pull the limp plug here if it tanks. Once fan word of mouth gets around, I would guess even serious SAW devotees would stay away from this one in droves. As for the 3-D gimmick, the effects were really lacking. Several times during the movie I wanted to take off the special glasses, as I forgot I was supposedly watching third dimension. "Game Over," indeed. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this film with moderate expectations. Thjs last few installments were rushed and not that great, but I enjoyed the twists and turns they provided. THIS movie, however, which could have been a 2 hour finale to a widely successful horror series...is a 90 minute pile of fake guts.The traps are stupid.The deaths ALL look fake.The pacing is way off. When the movie ended I had NO idea we were even in the third act.There are still some loose ends.The 3D was only cool in 2 shots.There was virtually no suspense.The acting was the worst of the whole series. (with the exception of Tanedra Howard and MAYBE Cary Elwes).oh, and the ending is 100% predictable and STUPID.Here's my "spoiler"...Where the F was Amanda?????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'STAR WARS' of slasher films finally comes to an end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'SAW 3D': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) I've been a fan of the 'SAW' series since the original and enjoyed every chapter immensely. Upon first viewing of the original I was a little thrown by Cary Elwes's bizarrely bad lead performance (as well as co-creator Leigh Whannell's) but I was blown away by the unique style and creativeness of the film; it was certainly a step above most slasher films and very memorable (and I think the two lead performances kind of added an extra weird quirkiness to the film). The second and third chapters were (surprisingly) in many way far superior to the original, although not quite as classic, and really raised the bar for the slasher film genre. It was a really cool horror trilogy (some call it the 'STAR WARS' trilogy equivalent in slasher films) and was nicely wrapped up. Then they continued the franchise with an unnecessary fourth chapter that was a step down from the original three but still a well made slasher film with very creative death scenes. They took the story in an entirely new direction with a new bad guy, Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), to continue the infamous villain Jigsaw's (the always impressive Tobin Bell) legacy (while still keeping him a major part of the film franchise in flashbacks, a pretty unique idea for the slasher film genre). The fifth film was a little better than the fourth and the sixth even better but comparing the latter three 'SAW' films to the original three is like comparing the new 'STAR WARS' trilogy to the original. Even though the series went down hill a little it's still been the most consistently good slasher franchise in movie history, no other horror film with continuing sequels can boast as high of quality for every chapter as the 'SAW' films. Now we reach the seventh and final chapter and it's a little disappointing, finally the series is seriously running out of gas (so it's a good thing they're ending it) but it's still an entertaining horror film, probably the weakest in the series but still fun to watch.The series concludes the tale of Jigsaw's mad legacy with Hoffman once again playing out Jigsaw's tests to force flawed victims either to painful redemption or even more painful and gruesome death. In the last chapter Hoffman was nearly killed by Jigsaw's wife Jill (once again played by Betsy Russell). He narrowly escaped a 'Jigsaw test' set by Jill (while receiving major facial damage) and now he wants revenge. His secret is out (as Jigsaw's successor) thanks in large part to Jill running to the police for protection. So Hoffman sets up a few final tests, one involving a man (Sean Patrick Flanery) claiming to be a 'Jigsaw test' survivor and using that notoriety to make money. At the same time Hoffman develops a plan to infiltrate the police and kill Jill once and for all. Elwes is back as the original film's survivor Dr. Gordon (for the first time since the original film and this time not hamming it up quite as much) but his intentions are unclear and it appears as though he might have been driven mad.Once again the death scenes are completely over the top and just as creative and grotesque as ever. This time of course there's the added bonus of being in 3D as well with body parts and blood actually flying right at you. The story is nicely wrapped up but not in as satisfying a way as fans wanted. Sure there's more twists and some cool action but the series has been so much more creative and involving until now. I was expecting a lot more from a finale to this series. Part of the problem is that Tobin Bell is severely underused, sure Jigsaw is dead but the three chapters leading up till now have found plenty of ways to use him. He's the driving force behind the series and one of the genre's most fascinating villains. He hasn't been so minimally used since the original film (where it wasn't revealed he was the killer till the very end). The dialog and acting is pretty bad in this chapter as well, there has been a fare amount of it sporadically in past films but certainly not to this extent (except for maybe Elwes and Whannell in the original). This chapter seems more dumb-ed down, like it's going just for the blood and guts and crowd pleasing gimmicks. There's very little of the character development and drama that made the others so intriguing. Still it does have some pretty cool and creative death scenes, like I said, and it's entertaining and fun to watch. I expected a lot more from a final chapter but it's still better than most of what other slasher franchise's have to offer.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is the best 'Saw' movie, it is the worst 'Saw' movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Opening scene will blow you away, you will be on the edge of your seat, you will love it, and you will hate it. You will feel more grief and sadness then you have ever before in a 'Saw' film, you will be disheartened. The gore is amped up so much-if you thought that the previous movies were barely watchable or the traps were as bad as they could get, you haven't seen anything yet. You will feel so much. "Saw VI" had the tag-line: "The Game Comes Full Circle". Yet that tag-line is better suited for "Saw 3D", everything really comes together. This definitely is the best "Saw" movie, but it takes away so much that you can't love everything about it. It IS a great ending to the franchise, and it does not fail at being a great final chapter. The 3D is excellent and does not disappoint. The movie only let me down in one area, I personally thought the gift of life was not given enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Sequels!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, there were some really dumb parts, and the acting wasn't top notch, but this sequel actually felt like the 2nd and 3rd films. The 4th and 5th were pointless and didn't need to happen. And although I really enjoyed the 6th, it was pointless too.At the beginning of the film, i guessed the ending, and towards the end knew what was going to happen. Only because they showed Dr. Gordon at the beginning and never showed him again, and after six films of wondering what happened to him I knew they wouldn't let him go out like that. I almost feel like since they couldn't get the actor that portrays Dr. Gordon to come back that they needed to drag the story on for four more sequels just to finish it. I feel it would've worked out better if they ended the 4th film like that and brought closure to the series sooner, instead of having sequels that started talking about people that we weren't too familiar with, nor did we really care about.Overall this was a great Saw entry and is worth watching, it's a good closure to the series.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weak, uninspired, lackluster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Saw 3D, and it's awful. In fact, the entire franchise has been crap since Saw 3. The original Saw had a great idea, Saw 2 lost the plot slightly, and Saw 3 returned to the original storyline. Saw 4, 5, 6 and now 3D (Saw 7) were very average. Gone was the really interesting Jigsaw plot, and replacing it was a hacked together story about the police officer who took on Jigsaw's legacy (but I'm still not sure why).Enough of that. What about Saw 3D?The gore: some very obvious rubber dolls, and the games weren't well filmed (for the most part). Darren Lynn Bousman (director of 2, 3 &amp; 4) did a pretty good job of making it seem realistic and confronting. Unfortunately, Saw 3D didn't live up to it. The games are as you'd expect - bizarre and gory, but they lack any real depth. You know that the poor people are going to die (due to the plot setup), so it's a bit dull.The plot: I never got into the whole Mark Hoffman plot of 4 onwards. It seemed weak, and unconnected with the storyline of 1, 2 &amp; 3. It also seemed to miss the whole point that the first three films made. Although people still had to make choices etc, there was less focus on the people involved somehow. The first three films captured the essence of Jigsaw's plan. All the rest seemed to just focus on games and Hoffman.Anyway. The plot is okay on paper but it doesn't pull it off like the others. I won't ruin it, but I thought the idea was ultimately better than the execution. I will say this: another reviewer here claims "The plot sees the former survivors of homicidal genius Jigsaw band together to stop further copycat killings, while Jigsaw's legacy reaches its completion". That would be interesting, but no, they don't.The 3D: Uninspired. It would have been better had they gone for a cheesy "things pop out of the screen at you" approach, which would have been fun (amidst the killing and whatnot). There were a few times I noticed the 3D effects, but it's an hour later now and I can't even remember them anymore.The budget: Low, I'm guessing. There's a scene where a character is running through a warehouse, and it's like she's jogging on the spot. Very amateurish.Overall: pretty weak. If you're a fan of the Saw franchise, you'll probably get into it. If you're (like me) a fan of the first 3 (and I'd even include number 4 which had it's moments) then save your dosh and catch it on DVD. The 3D isn't worth it.Gore: 5 Plot: 2 It sounds like I don't know how to count, but I'm giving this one 1 out of 10. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best in the series!!!! Although some of the acting is weak (mostly the main detective) and a few of the scenes feel very rushed, the ending makes up for it! There are also at LEAST twice the amount of traps. Although this might be a problem for some I personally loved it. Another problem some might have with the movie is the run time, and as I said above some of the scenes do feel rushed, but the overall movie doesn't. Although slightly flawed (They're not that prominent), this movie left me satisfied.Bottem line whether you're a die-hard SAW fan or just a horror movie buff this is a must see.</fullReview>

I don't believe I will ever see another series like Saw again. Everything was just perfect in this movie. The traps were amazing the story all tied together perfectly and I never saw the ending coming but let me tel you, it will blow you away. It was just perfect. I am sad to see it end but I think they ended it at the right time otherwise it just would have ended up the Friday the 13th and been crappy! My only complaint was the 3D. They did not need this in 3D. You only see a few body parts fly here and there. I would have rathered watched it without the glasses. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say this the saw movies hold a special place in my heart. The first saw was the first movie my husband and I saw together before we started dating. The opening of the first trap was so intense. You didn't know how it would end, but I found myself clapping for the guys. I understand some people would think thats harsh but come on she had it coming. I'm also really glad to see that the director from the last movie also directed this one he tied it all together. There is a lot of hidden stuff to look for. For example look at the evidence room you can see some of the most famous traps form past movies. The traps,the plot and the end was a true ending to a movie. I found myself leaving the theater a little sad but this is one of those movies that will be in the horror hall of fame!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But you might as well go out with a bang! Saw 3D is without a doubt the perfect conclusion to the long drawn out horror/torture franchise. After Saw 3, fan base has slowly started to decline over the years, but fortunately with the help of Saw VI, and Saw 3D's brilliant director, Kevin Greutert, the saga has come to a brilliant, yet well-deserved ending.The acting has taken a tremendous leap from the previous films, and the traps . . . Ooh, don't get me started, you have to see it to learn more. FYI, not for the little ones; this movie will make you cringe, wrestle, and writhe with terror for Greutert's display of violence and gore.Without a doubt, this is Saw's biggest and most daring achievement, but it is one to be admired. Its brought the series up from its metaphorical rut, which would be Saw 3, Saw 4, and Saw 5, but in the end, you will be satisfied. Worth every single penny, and in brain-twisting 3D. Saw 3D, is this year's, Halloween treat to the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Jigsaw that should never be put back together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the late serial killer Jigsaw might say, let's play a game. A computer game. And when you've tired of that, why not visit Thorpe Park, and try 'Saw: The Ride', the biggest G-Force roller-coaster ride in Europe. Then afterwards, perhaps pop across to 'Saw Alive' - "the world's most extreme live action horror maze," which, according to the PRs, "will make the grotesque fiction of the films a reality". In Thorpe Park.And finally, and perhaps least importantly of all, there's the films. Oh yeah, them. Only the world's most successful horror franchise according to the Guinness Book of Records. As if the world, and all its doings, was something to cheerlead for.Anyway, Saw 3D purports to be the last in the series (the words 'chinny' and 'reckon' spring to mind for some reason) - more to do with failing box office receipts than anything approaching a conscience - so, as the vast iron gears of the Saw franchise finally grind to a halt (fingers crossed), let's strap on our plastic bibs and utility mittens and get through this, one more time.Those of you who've been following this torturous soap opera will know that the keeper of Jiggy's legacy, Detective Hoffman (the delightfully named actor Costas Mandylor), has torn himself out of his reverse bear trap and is presumably looking to kick seven shades out of John Kramer's treacherous widow Jill (Betsy Russell). That would be a correct supposition. Meanwhile, a survivor of one those fiendish flesh-flaying traps, Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), has started his own 'Jigsaw Survivors' self-help group, and is currently doing the chat show circuit, complete with his own PR and media lawyer in tow. But is he all he says he is? What we're witnessing here isn't just the death of a franchise that has knowingly traded in utter crud year after year, but also a sort of self-loathing mea culpa, as it gasps its last. Because the most significant thing about Saw 3D isn't the 3D (it's awful, like all 3D films), it's those PRs and media lawyers. Who die, horribly. And via some of the skankiest, nastiest, "Heath Robinson is real annoyed"-style contraptions yet.This is satire, clearly - something the hermetically sealed series only thought might be cool to employ in the penultimate movie, when, with mischievous relevancy, it fed a bunch of insurance executives and lenders into the traps during 2009. Satire suited Saw. But, too little too late.Wanna see something way creepier than Saw 3D though? As you enter the left hand entrance of Screen 5 of London's Vue Cinema, West End, where I caught this particular screening, take a sharp right and check out the low ceiling, slightly to the right of the neon Exit sign. Because - I kid you not - smeared all over it, is what looks like a massive bloodstain. I sat directly under it all the way through the film, and I swear I felt it dripping.</fullReview>

It had some of the best traps, it wasn't as disgusting as the third one but it was by far the most painful "saw" movie.

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D: Epic Finale(?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 3D, in my own opinion, deserves the highest of praise. The plots, the traps, the storyline, everything fits together. Yes, some acting was "so-so" and some traps had no place, but overall, awesome! The "anti-climatic" return Dr. Gordon and his long awaited reveal as the hidden accomplice to Jigsaw was intense, though predicted. Some people unfairly died (i.e. Joyce) but i feel that Jigsaw has a plan and everyone's fate was already decided. The 3D was a bit shaky,but overall delivered. The finale was very intense and epic. But it leaves many questions unanswered, as revealed in an interview. Will Gordon continue Jigsaw'a legacy? What happens to Bobby? Who helped Gordon kidnap Hoffman? Will Hoffman survive? Hopefully Saw 3D is not the end, but if it is, then it was a great way to end the series. Some of you may disagree, but a true Saw Fanatic, like myself, will truly appreciate a grand finale like Saw 3D! But I do want Saw 8 to happen to fully answer every question left. On a final note, Saw 3D was a great finale (?) and definitely lived up to the hype. Highly recommend! Game over(?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Saw series ends on a high note.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoffman continues the game that Jigsaw started and must cover up all his tracks. After surviving a trap himself, he sets out to kill the person who put him in it. Jigsaw's wife, Jill.I went into Saw 3d with mixed excitement. The last few Saw films have gotten more outrageous than the last and even more complicated. Even though Saw VI was a step up, I didn't expect them to keep it up. Much to my surprise, Saw 3D is one of the best entries in the series. So what can you expect from this one? Well, elaborate traps, blood and gore and of course twists. Exactly what the series has always been, but this time it was fun. The 3D aspect didn't add much, it was used to throw things at the screen in whichever trap. Dr. Gordon from the original returns here, we finally get to see what happened to him after he sawed off his own foot. Why bring him back now? His screen time is significantly short, yet adds more layers to the already convoluted series. For me, I separate the first film from the others. I still think it stands alone in terms of story. It was never meant to be a series that has gone on this long, but I am interested and intrigued at how they continued it and branched it off into what we see every Halloween. I still say that the most shocking ending was the first, with the second one right behind it. The rest became routine and this one is no exception. The kills however are the highlight. They are gory as hell, probably the goriest in the whole series. I was laughing and cheering with each death. Finally we have people working together in a trap and finally we get to see the original bear trap around the face work. It's been 7 or so years, but it finally worked. The film follows two story lines. In one Hoffman is trying to get revenge on Jill. In the other Sean Patrick Flanery must go through a bunch of traps to save his friends and loved ones. This structure follows Saw III and Saw VI. I'm not complaining because both of those entries were decent. Each trap he comes to he sees someone that has helped him earn money from his lie. Each attempt at saving them either will end in success or failure. Since this is Saw and as I mentioned, one of the bloodiest ones yet, you can imagine what his success rate is.I would also love to thank the editor, for once this film decides to ditch the hyper kinetic editing style. We can actually see what's going on now. There is one small scene where it is still employed, but the trap is very minimal that you don't care. It might have taken 7 films to finally realize that it was useless and distracting, but they did it. I had a really fun time watching this entry and I hope it is the last, as they say it is. They said that about VI, but it was left open for another entry. This one seems to tie everything up, but there is always that chance, they could possibly continue the series, but with how things turned out I would simply beg the question why? I did that 4 films ago, but they were still intriguing at some level. Look to any other horror series that has more than 4 films and the quality dips drastically. Saw doesn't. Sure, they had some weak points V was pretty lame, but in the end, they all had some redeeming qualities about them. They all were connected on some form and it feels like one long story because they always pick up exactly where the previous one left off. My main interest in this series, aside from the gory deaths, would be to see how well they connect all the films. I would have liked to have seen more characters make it through more films. It seems with each new one there is a new detective. At the same time there are so many characters from the previous films that I don't know which film they appeared in. They all seem to blend together and none of them stand out. The series should have ended with VI, it was the one that closed the series well. Change the ending to it and everything could have been great. Saw 3D ties up whatever loose ends Saw VI had. The Saw series was never made for critics, it is clearly a genre and fan tailored series. This entry will please those fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody, thrilling and chock-full of twists - If it's Halloween, it must be Saw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting where Saw VI left off, Jill (Betsy Russell) flees the scene and subsequently seeks police-protection after she fails to fulfill her Husband's wishes in killing Hoffman (Costas Mandylor). Enraged and hungry for vengeance, Hoffman embarks on a mission to kill her and ultimately emerge as Jigsaw's unchallenged successor. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flannery), a self-help guru and past 'survivor' of a Jigsaw trap, is forced to partake in another brutal game as he desperately fights his way through a series of horrifying tests in order to save his wife (Gina Holden) from the clutches of a sinister device.All I have to say is this: HELL YEAH! This was one of the most entertaining, downright fun films of the year. The blood came in gallons, it was nail-bitingly suspenseful, and despite its arguable predictability, the twist was amazing. With my immense Saw fanboyism noted, I can still guarantee that you don't need to be familiar with nor a fan of the series to enjoy this; anyone who can appreciate a bloody, unpretentious B-Movie romp should have a blast. The series started as a harmlessly fun B-Grade thriller, and it will end as one too. Sure, things may have gotten convoluted in the midst of this phenomenally dense story, but in the end, the essence from the first film is still gloriously alive and thriving.The gore was nothing short of INSANE. I'm not exaggerating here. Blood sprayed, limbs flew, heads exploded; it was an utterly theatrical spectacle. As always, the writing was taut, twisting and tremendous. The final twist was predictable as hell, but how can you rightfully tell me it wasn't one of the most epic sequences in the history of this series!? As a die-hard Saw fan, I was cheering and first-pumping in my seat as it unfolded before me. It was pure art. The traps were utterly brutal, they had me constantly squirming and cringing in my seat as I couldn't help but morbidly cherish the sensation. It's amazing how fresh and innovative they can still be even after six installments. The performances weren't the best (Namely, Chad Donella's portrayal of the one-dimensional detective 'Gibson' was pretty bad), as duly expected, but there were nice flourishes of brilliance from Sean Patrick Flannery in his portrayal of the intriguing character of Bobby Dagen. Betsy Russell and Costas Mandylor were adequate as respective nemesis's.All in all, this is an incredibly entertaining thrill ride. Although as a Saw fanatic, I can't help but feel a little unsatisfied by the climax. The revelations beg for more sequels, plus ending with Hoffman getting locked alive in the Bathroom is hardly a concrete conclusion. I like ambiguity, but everything felt a little too open-ended.Otherwise, it's a bloody blast of a film. Whether you hate the series or love it, I advise you to switch off your brain and merely bask in the glory of the Saw universe. You can't deny that these films will define this generation of horror. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing end to and even more amazing series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can i really say about saw? well for starters, its gruesome, psychological torture, with great twists. After seeing the seventh installment i have to say that I'm truly amazed. SAW VII was definitely one of my favorite installments in the long running horror franchise. The quality of the movie blew me out of my seat. The acting was pretty top notch, the traps were gruesome, and the ending was completely incredible. I got chills throughout my body when watching this movie. The traps actually really grossed me out in this one. I actually was squirming in my seat for the first time. And i have to say, the 3D in this was way better than i thought it would be. it was done well enough to were it wasn't cheesy. I loved this movie so much. I will miss the saw series. Its the best thing thats happened to horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Good -- 3D Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just came home after seeing Saw 3D. Last weekend I watched I through VI, and last night rewatched VI to prepare for today. First, I was amazed at how few people paid to see it in 3D. There must have been fewer than a dozen in the audience. The movie is a good ending to a great series. although the blood and gore was a bit excessive and gratuitous. The acting, as always was B-, and I would liked to have seen more of Tobin Bell. Sad to say, though, the 3D was a total waste of money. Shame on the producers for soaking the public out of least an extra $4.00 per ticket for nothing. By all means, all Saw fans should see this last installment, but save your money and see it in 2D!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D - for Saw fans, it's pretty good... 3D NOT NECESSARY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT!*** I've been a big fan of the "Saw" series since the first one. I got to see "Saw 3D" the day it came out. It was pretty good. As these "Saw" sequels go, it was one of the better ones. However, why did they shoot this film in 3D? The story and the visual effects really have no benefit from the 3D, as there are really only a couple of scenes (namely trap-scenes) that are fun in 3D. This film would've been equally as good without the 3D. THE POSITIVES: (1.) The traps are awesome, disgusting and gory. Just the way they should be! If all you've seen is the preview, it doesn't give away much about the traps in the movie, of which there are plenty. (2.) The story, or "puzzle", all comes together, finally. (3.) Acting is better than previous sequels and better than some reviewers are saying. All characters are believable, considering the premise of the film. THE NEGATIVES: (1.) Not enough Jigsaw! Tobin Bell's character is easily the most captivating element of these films, and even with flashbacks, it seems like Tobin Bell is almost completely left out! (2.) Carey Elwes' short performance leads to a predictable plot. You can tell how the movie is going to end after you see Elwes' speak for the first time. (3.) New characters and trap-victims are not very well explained or felt. While the traps themselves are really cool, the victims are not involved in the plot as much as they are in the previous films. (4.) The main victim is someone who hasn't appeared in any Saw films. I found myself not caring at all about the character's demise. This did not seem like a fitting "end" to the Saw saga. (5.) As I previously mentioned, the film would have been just as good without the 3D. Most of the movie is character acting, so other than the traps, the 3D is disappointing.So, I guess I listed more negatives than positives, but this film is gory as hell, and I love the Saw films, so I give this final Saw film 6 out of 10. Maybe wait until video if you aren't as into the Saw films as I am, 'cuz the 3D really isn't worth extra charges at the movies. If you are a fan, go check it out! If you like the other sequels, this one doesn't fall short in comparison. Oh, and just so everyone knows, there IS room for a sequel, with the way the movie ends. So don't be surprised if we do in fact see a future Saw film. I think the film puts a solid ending to the series though, so I hope they stick to their word about this being the final Saw. We'll see next Halloween. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost everyone paying a 3D price to see Saw #7 (Saw 3D) knows that the admission includes cheesy sets, wrong-color red, non-sequitur scenes, screaming babes, and a hero who goes through a series of gruesome tests to save someone he loves, usually to no avail. The new element is body parts hurtling out to where you are, a perk that wears not well and not long.Murderer Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) survivors convene in support group to work out their legacy of trauma at the hands of the master. The leader of the group, Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery), has allegedly survived Jigsaw but brings baggage that will ensure the bloody enjoyment of the blood-thirsty audiences. It may be a warning that this iteration pays no real respect to the other six Saws by having Bell appear only briefly.Saw 3D seems to reprise most of the creative torture motifs of the previous six installments (although I am no expert because seeing any one a second time would be akin to the torture on the screen). Yet, I am moved by the dramatic possibilities of Dantean punishments, whereby the subject painfully dies according to alleged sins. For instance, a publicist is dispatched with three pointed rods through her vocal chords and mouth, with the hero yelling in frustration that she should have "shut the f___ up" while he tries to save her. Hint: the more she screams the less likely she is to survive, so not screaming would be a distinct advantage. Difficult for a PR type.Need I say more about the melodramatics and less-than-actors-equity acting, neither a priority when your purpose is to out Jackass Jackass 3D. However it could be a strategy to have a lower order "B film" for the nostalgic effect.Nothing else in the film merits mentioning?it's all pretext for torture, dismemberment, and death, subjects that grow old very quickly. I'm betting this is not the final chapter, and when the next one comes, I'll pass the responsibility for reviewing to my partner. This is enough torture for a year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was disappointed. I wasn't expecting anything great but it could have been a better send off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as good a send off as I'd hoped and in a small way it's an "F you" to Saw fans. But I still didn't think it was terrible despite it's many flaws such as some pretty fake looking make-up effects(the blood is clearly pink sometimes and there are a lot of pretty fake looking bodies). A lot of the dialogue is bad and I don't know if that was intentionally played for laughs or just bad writing. Also there are never any twists which was part of the reason that made the Saw franchise so good in the first place. and not much is revealed except something I won't say because it would ruin the movie even though it's pretty obvious. The story isn't as good as it could have been. The story is what drew me in to the franchise,but in this one it's pretty bland. It has pretty much the same basic plot line as 3,4,and 6. But there are good things to be found in this movie. Most of the acting is pretty bad but there are few actors and actresses that are good such as Betsy Russell and Tobin Bell who by the way doesn't have enough screen time as he did in the previous movies. Some of the 3D effects are good even though most of the time it's just body parts, and sharp poles being flung at the audience.(by the way the gore is sometimes a little disturbing and there were a few times where I felt like gagging.) It's also nice to see most of the survivors from the previous films even though they don't really do anything to progess the story and most don't have dialogue, and are only there to show that they truly survived. All in all I found this to be a pretty disappointing ending to a good mystery/crime/horror franchise but it has good moments but if you can don't pay 13.50 for this. Wait till it comes out on Blu-ray and Netflix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Saw yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was amazing and the 3D adding more disgusting chills to your spine. I saw this on the night before it came out, and I was the only one in the theater which disappointed me because I thought more people would be excited to see it. The characters and the traps automatically gave it a 10/10. Go see this movie or you will regret watching the other movies. What was weird about this movie was that they changed it up a lot; more traps, more gore, and a different kind of style (hence the 3D aspect). What I also liked was that the trailers didn't give away any spoilers at all, even the foreign trailers. Many people usually stop watching the Saw movies after Saw III. If you were one of these people and you are seeing Saw 3D, you might be disappointed because you will not know what is happening, so if you plan on seeing Saw 3D, watch Saw, Saw II (2), Saw III (3), and Saw VI (6). The reason I say not Saw IV (4), and Saw V (5) is because those movies won't help you understand anything. So as a epic Saw fan, I recommend you see this movie at your local theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of Saw?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this film is supposed to be the final one in the Saw series, and so you're probably wondering, does it end any good? Well, the movie does conclude the saga quite well, but also I feel the series really did lose it's steam after the past 3 movies. Most of the reoccuring characters are again killed off on this one, though Dr. Gordon's appearance in it was a nice touch to the first Saw and concluding the series, and has quite a good twist to it. The death trap puzzles in this one are as usual brutal and over the top again. However, as predicted, the main character gets screwed over by the end of the movie, though this time, he totally blows it (as he doesn't save anyone in this one!). Hoffman and Jill's conclusion are good, as it kind of goes back to a callback of Saw 1, though is it the end? Overall, if this is really the end, I'll say that Saw could have ended on a much worse outcome, though at least it ended on a "pass" A 6/10, and much better than Saw 6!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll make this short and sweet.I loved SAW VI, and was overly excited for this one. SAW VII is predictable and honestly a little boring. The traps are sub-par, and characters are forgivable, but all this movie is 90 minutes of fluff. The whole movie is filler with a plot that goes nowhere and an ending you see coming a mile away.This movie doesn't answer many questions if any really. As an avid SAW fan, I can be satisfied with this film and hope they leave the series alone from here. It had a good run, but I don't think they can squeeze anymore life out of this franchise after VI. It was a good effort, but it falls short of anything special. But the 3D was pretty good!.Next Halloween won't feel the same without my trip to see the new SAW movie, but I think I can manage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, I am so disappointed with this ending... I now rarely write reviews on here but I feel I have to warn about just how damn poor this final Saw is...Well, in the first place, I've always been a Loyal Fan from Saw, since the beginning... I've loved the trilogy, Saw IV not so much because it looked sometimes forced and had some plot holes, but I think that V and VI altogether make sense and a very clever story with cool twists that weren't expected at all.But... well I guess this day had to come, the day when Saw would be "killed" with a very, very poor ending... what can a I say without spoiling anything... some facts (not really important plot spoilers) about this...- Jigsaw is no longer important to the series... - it's frustrating because the story used to be all about his ideas and philosophy. - No classic soundtrack used... - (so this was the ending and they had to use lame songs in the traps and not the cool style / music the others have always had... ). - A final twist that everyone expected (at least the previous ones had a small part that surprised or wasn't really predictable).. - This one was not only dumb but completely unjustified.. the whole movie seemed like so and very, very rushed. - So many new and unnecessary characters... - Abysmal acting, and new people that you won't really care about. - Gore looks fake as hell - Everything looks like fake stupid plastic now. - No plot at all... - After 6 successful movies of cohesive argument and smart twists, we get 3D BS and a very poor conclusion.It really hurts to rate this movie so badly.. as a Big Fan of Saw... but it's time and it's fair..There's nothing more to say, to the producers, director and everyone involved... thanks for screwing up one of my favorite horror movies and series of all time.. I really, really hate you! * Final Rating.. 2/5 *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final chapter ends on a high note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saw 3D" picks up right where "Saw VI" leaves off. Yes, "Saw VI" the one no one saw (no pun intended) because they were watching the first entry to a new horror franchise that will be milked into at least four or five movies called "Paranormal Activity." The basic plot of "Saw 3D" focuses on Jigsaw survivor Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery) who has become a self help guru to help those who have been victims of Jigsaw's games. It's only a matter of time though before Bobby's dark secrets are revealed and a new series of games begin...cue "Saw" music.Let me first say this, I actually felt that "Saw VI" was the best film since the original. It's truly a shame that no one really went to see that chapter. It seems that the movie going audience doesn't like a lot of sequels especially in horror and I don't get why Hollywood doesn't it at this point. Most people like first to third film in a franchise and usually by the third film the audience starts losing interest. Want proof? Look at the majority of horror franchises including "Nightmare on Elm Street," "Friday the 13," and "Child's Play." The films started tanking after the fourth entry. This is the same thing that happened with "Saw" as a series. People got tired of every Halloween another one of this films hitting the theaters and it just felt very repetitive so they lost interest."Saw 3D" is actually a really good ending to the franchise. Sure some will say the 3D is a cheap way to lure people back to the theaters to see the film but hey so what? It's Hollywood and they always do it to us. The deaths in "Saw 3D" were probably some of the most violent and over the top death scenes out of every film in the franchise. I am sure that is done for the 3D effect and to make the audience feel more apart of the action so to speak. This factor seems to be the reason for the negative reviews in the film and I have to say what are you expecting its "Saw" and most people watch them for the death scenes so of course they are going to make sure those are the most elaborate.The acting in the film is typical just like the rest of the series. Some of the acting is really good and some is really bad. I look at it this way, for a horror movie the acting lives up to it's normal standards and some roles are actually above and beyond the normal horror movie standards. Some of the best acting highlights in the film were Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Sean Patrick Flanery and of course Cary Elwes. The low acting point would have be Chad Donella and a few other other smaller roles in the film. As I said, for a horror film this film has the lackluster acting with a few standout performances.My favor factor about the "Saw" franchise is the storyline and how they always tie things together at the end of the film. Sure the traps are cool but how they make all seven films to make sense is what truly intrigues me. When you go see "Saw 3D" you will probably ask yourself how the hell can this franchise end when you watch it. Well that's the best part of the film to me. The last 10 minutes where everything comes together is what really makes "Saw 3D" a satisfying end to the franchise. I will say this right now for those who haven't watched all films, meaning from one to six, you MUST see all of them before you see this movie. It will not make sense if you don't know all the previous films.I must give both writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton some credit here. These guys wrote the last couple of films in the series and they tied all the films together very nicely. Sure the basic premise is simple and has been since the first film but the tying the films all together takes some credit. I also have to say Kevin Greutert who directed this film and part six, did a great job as well. He really made the deaths in this film gruesome and made people in the audience squirm. I went to see the film with my fiancée and her two friends and they were all screaming and squirming in their seats! In the end, "Saw 3D" is the most convoluted and over the top film of the bunch but you know what it worked. The 3D effect although it was a gimmicky way to sell the film really worked to make it's audience feel more apart of the film. The highlight however is the way the entire franchise comes together in the end. While it's not the most amazing ending ever, it's a great ending especially for a horror franchise. "Saw 3D" is not my favorite film in the series and I would say its probably third in line after the original and the sixth film but it's definitely a satisfying end to a series. It works especially well if your like me and have watched all the previous films and enjoyed how the stories all flowed together. If your a fan of the series, I don't think "Saw 3D" will disappoint.MovieManMenzel's rating for "Saw 3D" is a 7 out of 10. It's a solid ending to what I would say is one of the best horror/suspense series in recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My sister and I have had a small obsession with this series from the very beginning. Halloween is already my favorite holiday and once Saw came around, it just got even better. The first movie was raw, gritty, gruesome, and awesome! It took blood and guts to a whole new level, but still had substance and an actual plot. The other five sequels were not on par with the first, but they each followed the story, adding to the plot, and enhancing the Saw universe. The final film blew my mind! It tied up all the loose ends, answered all questions any fans had, and ended with a bang. I still have to say Saw was my favorite because it got everything started, but this one is a very, very close second.</fullReview>

I had a really big expectation for this movie tonight. When I saw the trailer I was really impressed but trailer is little different then movie. Movie is in 3D technology but there are no special 3D effects to remember. There are few interesting characters in movie but story is average and simple. That is all you need to know.

Saw 3d was for the fans and it gives us what we deserve. It truly comes full circle. Acting is somewhat improved believe it or not but the story is what ya come for. Jigsaw is on the top of his game and there are lots of cameo's from last films. There is lots of gore and torture...more than any other Saw film for sure. Do not bring the little ones. You have been warned. Go see it Go see it Go see it, worth every penny. It's pretty close if not better than being the best Saw movie in the entire series.

The ending is the best of any horror movie, I have ever seen period. SAW 3D is the best final chapter of any horror film series. SAW 3D is highly recommend!!! Freddy and Jason step aside. Jigsaw is taking over. The SAW series will stand the test of time in horror movies. You can't go wrong with SAW, and you won't be disappointed. SAW 3D is the king of 3D horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind saying this for one reason ! This final movie is simply the best. It answer all our questions after all thoses movies. I'm a big fan of the Saw movies, and the first was my favorite until now. The real fans of the psychological side of SAW will like it. But the pure gore fans as well because we get a lot of them. Sean Patrick Flannery has been added to this part and he's doing an amazing job, easily the best actor of the whole series with Cary Elwes, Bell and Mandylor. The atmosphere is still very present in this grand finale and we get flashbacks but not as much as the previous ones, one saw movie was almost an all-flashback movie and was not that good for this reason. As far the 3-D, it delivers, it could have been more but it's not as poor as Piranha 3-D, i would say that 30% of the movie is in 3-D which is good. The blood most likely is in 3-D and feel you are in the movie, the smoke too. So for that, they did a very good job with the 3-D effects for the big screen. This movie is highly recommended for pure fans, you have to see the previous movies to fully enjoy this one. And to thoses who tell you they stop after part 2 or 3, don't listen to them, they don't know what they are talking about. This is an awesome series and the only good horror series in the 2000s era so we have to respect a true series for true fans !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Way to End the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 3D (2010) ** 1/2 (out of 4) The seventh and apparently final entry in the series has a group of Jigsaw survivors standing behind one (Sean Patrick Flanery) who has written a book about battling your odds. The only catch is that he's really not a survivor of Jigsaw but soon he's kidnapped and thrown into the game and trying to save his wife. Meanwhile, a detective is trying to find out some secrets from Jigsaw's former wife while also trying to bring down Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) who is still carrying out the deadly games. Thankfully this latest entry pretty much stays away from many of the events in previous films and doesn't have the pressure of trying to make them match up to previous events. I think it's rather refreshing seeing a new stories, although we still get characters from previous movies showing up. I think this is a very good entry in the series and it certainly ends things on a very good note so let's hope it really is the last. I think there's a lot more imagination going on this time around but what also helps is that there's a pretty good story as well. I thought the idea of someone writing a fake book to try and make money only to then really be put into the game was a nice touch and one that makes for some nice drama. Director Greutert does a nice job with all the games but he also manages to build in some nice tension and especially during the final ten-minutes where two different games are going on and we cut back and forth between them. As expected, most people are going to be coming for the games and they are very good. I thought the open game with all the public watching was handled very well and it was a refreshing break because they throw in some nice comedy, which works pretty good considering the situation that the three characters are in. The other games turn more graphic and dark and these include a terrific one with some glue and automobiles. The game played by the survivor pretty much has him going from room to room to face down one friend after another. I thought these games weren't the strongest of the series but the drama in them was pretty good because of the direction and the story working so well. I thought Mandylor, Flanery and the rest of the cast were very good and we even get Tobin Bell in a few scenes. There are a few other guest returns but I won't ruin them for the fans. As I said, the final ten-minutes were very good and they were almost good enough for me to bump this up another half star. With that said, those who against these movies in general aren't going to change your opinion based on this one alone. Those who enjoy the series should have a good time here. As far as the 3D goes, there are several scenes where bodies are getting ripped open and guts come flying out of you. Nice touches but I don't think there's any major reason to have to watch it in 3D if your theater only gets the flat version. Either way, SAW 3D is a good way to end the series but I guess this will really depend on the box office take and how long they want to keep the series dead until a remake comes along and starts it back up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Shocking Ending In Cinematic History: IN 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the movie theater, I thought to myself "It's impossible to outdo the geniuses that were Saw V and Saw VI, why are they even trying?" When you think of superior plots in the film industry, it is hard to overlook Saw V. Everything in that movie fit together so well, it must've been difficult to live up to those expectations for Saw VI. BUT THEY DID, Saw VI made the whole story come together. There was no longer a question of "What is in that envelope that just appeared randomly in IV?" or "Is that pivotal character Agent Perez really dead?" Where could this series possibly go from there? Nowhere but down of course, but we were wrong again! Saw VII proved that the series still had a little life in it, and wanted to bring back what made the original film so successful. The audience loved the mystery of who is Jigsaw so much in the first film, and we lost the suspense after the fourth movie. There were no twists anymore, just awful endings that they called twists. In reality, no one ever liked Hoffman and he led to the demise of the series. The traps in this movie were not as creative as the traps in the other movie, but that can be overlooked because what the audience really wanted to see was how the ending would turn out. For the first time in 3 years, we didn't care about how shocking the traps were because we just wanted to find out the mystery. Luckily for us, the mystery was solved for all of us approximately 5 years ago on IMDb. The directors clearly read what every fan boy of the Saw series said, and just pasted it together in making the ending of this franchise. Yes, we got what we wanted, but I feel cheated by having to pay $15 for a 3D movie, with not many 3D effects to get some closure with this series. We all knew how this thing would end when we found out that Cary Elwes was going to be in this film but we just wanted to be sure that the writers and directors read up on the latest IMDb message boards. In conclusion, the movie was a predictable yet satisfying end to one of the greatest 5-movie long series' of all time. Yes, I said 5! Including Saw 5 &amp; 6 is like including Halloween 3: Season of the Witch or Rob Zombie's b.s. re-makes as part of the Halloween series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best ending to a horror franchise ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>after spending the day watching saw I all the way to saw VI at home i went to the cinema to watch saw 3D with high expectation. knowing that this was the last one in the series i expected it to deliver something different. with Cary Elwes returning as doctor Gordon i knew this would be good. the plot of the movie was very different camper to the other saw movies and it have more chilling traps. not Every scene was made specifically for 3D but it was enough to be watched in 3D. If your a big fan of saw then you must watch this because the ending will have you at the edge of your seat. For me who has always been a big fan of the Saw series this movie certainly deserves 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without Question, the Best of the SAW Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The SAW Series has taken too much unfair criticism. It is, in my opinion, a superior franchise about relationships. Some want to compare it to the Halloween series, in which a spectre offs verious teens with a supernatural machete. But the actual plot is more similar to Robert Redford's debut film, Ordinary People, but with gore. Both are about young persons who've been traumatized. Also, there is the similarity between the impact of the down-to-earth psychologist in Ordinary with that of the down-to-earth justice of "Jigsaw". In addition, Saw 3D is beautifully photographed, from start to finish. Kevin Greutert is at his peak in capturing the small beauty of simple scenes alongside the breathtaking wonder of the ramshackle interiors. My teenage son, who is not given to being maudlin, left the film fairly choked up. He could not get over the eye to eye contact between the girl and her tormentor, and the unspoken feelings therein. He said he could not imagine anyone seeing the film without tearing up a little. Kudos to Kevin Greutert! He is establishing himself as one of our finest filmmakers.</fullReview>
