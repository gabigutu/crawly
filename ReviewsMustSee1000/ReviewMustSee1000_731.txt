		<shortDescription>A very accomplished movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really nice to stumble upon good movies when you don't expect it. Nowadays, we are becoming more and more guided by the marketing that goes behind the movies, to realize when we actually go see them that we are often left unsatisfied.Felon is a movie about a man who is working hard to create a life for himself and his family, he has worked hard to establish his own business and feels as though he is finally ready to start reaping the fruits of his labour. Then, life brings a unexpected twist and he finds himself in prison. From this point on, we see transformations of a man who is forced into a new world where he has no control.This movie is a great glimpse of the extreme conditions that the American correctional system can create. It also displays very well how people can get corrupted by power. All the actors in this movie shine and portray perfectly their characters. The story is very well told and by the end of the movie, you are left reflecting on how the correctional system has so many flaws and how it drives people to become their worst, both as inmates and as guards. However, the film also shows that even in these circumstances, there are great acts of humanity and compassion.A very good movie, definitely worth the watch. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky to see a screener for this film. At first I wasn't expecting much as the last film I saw with Val Kilmer-Conspiracy-I shut off 15 minutes into it in disgust.Felon, is an excellent film with great acting, a great plot and good dialog. This is by far the best movie I've seen Stephen Dorf in and Val Kilmer gives a solid performance. While the storyline flirts with typical prison antagonists and a pseudo-familiar plot the story is very realistic and highly believable.Lots of suspense, good solid action, excellent cinematography and great acting make this film a must see for drama/suspense fans. Its great to see Val Kilmer resuming his place as one of the best actors of his generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most prison movies are essentially the same story told with different characters. Usually the protagonist is convicted of a crime (which he did or did not do), is sent to prison and finds that they have to either adapt to their brutal new surroundings or die. Allies are won, enemies are made, death lurks around the corner. "Felon" is no different but three things raise it above most others.First is the setting. Filmed at the New Mexico State Penitentiary, the movie carries an air of authenticity and gritty realism that movie sets simply can't provide. Next is the casting. Stephen Dorff has always been a very underrated actor and here he provides a wonderful portrayal of a man let down by the legal system and cast adrift in a living nightmare. His descent from upstanding family man to an enraged prison inmate with fire in his eyes and blood on his knuckles is perhaps predictable but Dorff sells the portrayal to the audience completely. However, Harold Perrineau and Val Kilmer are the real stars here. The first (whom avid fans of the television shows "Lost" and "Oz" will already be familiar with) offers a great performance as Lieutenant Jackson, a happy family orientated man outside of prison but a monster within its walls. Kilmer, meanwhile, is John Smith, the philosophical but potentially dangerous convict who comes to befriend Dorff's Wade during their time together. The third and final ingredient that ensures "Felon" impresses, is the passionate directing by Ric Roman Waugh who also wrote the screenplay (based, apparently, on events at the notorious Californian State Prison). With the help of some incredible editing, the movie powers along at a frantic rate and rarely gives the audience time to breathe. If the ending is somewhat contrived, you can forgive it because the journey to reach the conclusion was so intense.Highly recommended, especially for fans of "The Shawshank Redemption", "The Big House", "An Innocent Man" and "Lock Up".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i cannot think of the words to praise this film as it is one of the most awe inspiring films i have ever seen. it will make everyone who watches it appreciate everything in their life so much more. truly one of the great films of this century....it will probably not be remembered like this but it truly is. The acting is superb, by all the actors. It is an emotional roller-coaster of a film, bringing you emotions as varied as sorrow, joy and anger. It makes you realise the unjust nature of the world we live in, and how the worst things can happen to the nicest of people. If i can sum up in a sentence what i feel about this film it is.....the best film i have seen for many years bar none,a truly inspiring piece of filmwork and story telling, a must see for everyone :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the better prison films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it a 10 out of 10 because it kept me in front of the screen, I think it portrayed the prison life from many different perspectives. Despite this dark storyline it's a film I enjoyed more than many others in the last years. It's the first time I leave a comment in 3 years at IMDb, just to let you understand how I enjoyed this film. All characters are developed to suit the overall story, without going too deep or to shallow. Especially Harold Perrineau surprised me, this is his best performance to date. Val Kilmer was just a pleasure to see, this dark Character suited him very well, his acting becomes better and better the older he gets. Great screenplay followed up by a formidable cast. I look forward to see more from Ric Roman Waugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that I'd always try to remember. The characters in the film are very realistic. Stephen Dorff, Marisa Nichols carried it really well. MR. Kilmer played a pivotal role towards the end, for all the dubious minds who'd question his character/ role in the film.I believe Ric Roman did a wonderful job by addressing the many different situations that we as humans can go through in daily life. It was simple yet smart and a powerful film. I may not watch it again for, I do not want to witness the horrid situations again, but I'd definitely recommend it once for all!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When your life is defined by a single action, you change the concept of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Felon is an outstanding film and externally well written. It's defiantly one of those films that you can watch again and again.Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff) is an average guy, successful business, and living with his fiancé and son. All is going well for him until one day a swift moment of judgement ends him up in prison. From here on in, his idea of normality and normal society rules get turned on their heads as he gets to grips with another world of prison rules and prison society ...but this film is much more than about one man serving his time. The line that John Smith (Val Kilmer) puts over a couple of times in the film, "When your life is defined by a single action, you change the concept of time", is interwoven into all the individual characters plots so brilliantly, this film hits you on some many different levels.Marisol Nichols, who I have only seen in 24 before, gives a great performance as Wade Porter's fiancé, struggling to make ends meat while he is in prison. Can't forget Val Kilmer who gives a Strong performance as well. In fact I can't knock anybody in it, it's not often that the actors, characters and script all seem like they where made for each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was just great, guys - I loved it!The acting was great, the script was great, the cast was great! I was actually moved by the performances and the storyline in this movie. It made me realize that I take lots of stuff for granted in this world. As easily as waking up in the morning - as easily and swiftly your life can be turned upside down. This movie perspectivates ones life and at the end, what you're left with, is the feeling of fulfillment and the urge to do something good to the ones you love - or find somebody to love and take good care of them.A bit gory and ironic at the end - but overall - like one of the other reviews said - one of the greater prison-movies! ...And Val Kilmer - OMG - GREAT JOB, DUDE!What a great experience, guys!

		<fullReview>I was expecting another prison movie with just more rapes and violence, but i was pleasantly surprised. Val Kilmer is great and Stephen Dorff is great as well. It reminded me a little of The Shawshank redemption and an Innocent man. It shows how difficult life can be for someone whom lives a hardworking and honest life to enter the prison system filled with career criminals and gang members.This movie encompasses friendships, hardships, and injustices. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say first off that I'm not into that whole action-thriller-nail biting-under ware staining kinda movie....which is OK because this film is more of a drama than anything else. It kinda reminded me of "The Shawshank Redemption" (another great movie) with Stephen Dorff being Tim Robbins and Val Kilmer being Morgan Freeman (the comparison is a little bit forced but still valid with the two movies plots being somewhat similar). The movie delivers a very diverse emotional palette, with tear breaking scenes all the way to explicit hardcore violence thanks to incredible acting by Dorff, Kilmer and Perrineau, truly bringing their characters to life. All in all, one of the best action dramas i've seen.....definitely a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb and intelligent drama-prison with an extraordinary acting by Val Kilmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture tells the authentic experiences of convicts of a prison that is a hell on the earth, reflecting the hardship existence of the inmates .We have seen men tortured,harassed and humiliated in a gaol where rules the strongest law.An ordinary family man (Stephen Dorff, also producer) is a fine worker with a good woman(Marisol Nichols) and one son. However he kills a delinquent in loyal defense. Then he's accused and as convict is sent to a severe jail. There is harassed and humiliated until that the fury and revenge emerge. He's only helped by a con (Val Kilmer)framed for life. The film takes place into four walls of a jail and its yard involving the tough life of the prisoners.The starring confronts risks and sufferings for reaching freedom.This interesting film is essentially developed in prison with some images out prison. The greatest part is narrated into courtyard prison because of it reflects the violent existence of the inmates, with the fights,threats,murders and where rules the strongest's law. In the picture there are thrills,violence,drama,tension and a little bit of action in the final confrontation. The picture obtained enough success, it's a real ¨Sleeper¨ . Stephen Dorff's interpretation is very fine but Val Kilmer is much better, he makes a terrific acting as the veteran convict who teaches at naive inmate to taking on the risks and dangers of the gaol ; his performance bears remarkable resemblance to Ben Kingsley in ¨An innocent man¨ directed by Peter Yates and that also has certain similarities in the argument. And of course, Harold Perrineau as sensation-hungry nasty warden is top-notch. Furthermore, the picture contains realist cinematography and atmospheric musical score. Ric Roman Waugh directs with genius and masterfully transcending the issue and gives something definitively original. The story will appeal to Prison genre enthusiast and Val Kilmer fans. Rating : Very good. Better than average, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The family man Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff) is living the American Dream with his girlfriend Laura (Marisol Nichols) and their son Michael: they have a nice house, he has just raised a loan to make his company grow and they are going to get married. However their dream becomes a nightmare when Wade unintentionally kills a burglar that had broken into their house in the middle of the night on his lawn. He is sent to trial and accepts a deal proposed by the prosecutor, being sentenced to three years in prison. During the transportation, there is an incident in the bus and Wade is framed and sent to the maximum security wing under the command of the corrupt Lieutenant Jackson (Harold Perrineau). His cell-mate John Smith (Val Kilmer) that was sentenced to life revenging the death of his family befriends Wade and gives helpful advices and hope to Wade to return to his family.The good "Felon" is another movie that discloses the corruption and brutality in the American Penal system, where the rules of a civilized society are neither followed by the inmates nor by most of the security guards. The dramatic story is engaging, and it is great to see Val Kilmer having again a top-notch performance after a long period of weak movies. Stephen Dorff is also great in the role of a family man that is unfairly imprisoned for protecting his family and dehumanizes and desensitizes to survive in the prison. The unrealistic conclusion is commercial and moralist, reducing the power and impact of the plot. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Felon"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Felon is a moralistic movie about a guy that is sentenced to prison cause of some circumstance which is best described as 'being at the wrong place at the wrong time', together with an action that is very understandable, but very unfortunate. Most of it takes place in a US penal institution and i don't know enough about that to reflect on it being correct. It probably differs from state to state and from prison to prison and even from one part of a prison to another, but looking at the movies and documentaries about US penal institutions, its probably not far of. I wouldn't last a day if i were ever sent into one of those and i really sympathize with any person who is penalized because of an error, corruption, or some grey area that is judged hard but from what everyone thinks it wasn't that bad. That last thing is what this movie is about and without getting too deep into who is to blame for what, i would like to quote Dostojevski - i think- who said that 'you can judge any society by its prisoners'.The filmmakers obviously wanted to address this issue, since the movie is all about that and ends with 'in 2008 there are 2.3 million people in US prisons'It is appalling to think that a portion of these people are wrongfully committed. (probably 10's of thousands)So as far as the story goes; this is really worth a view. Acting is great, specially Val Kilmer who i hardly recognized, but plays magnificent. I cant think of anything bad to say about this movie. You have to see it.Its very sad that ones life can be ruined just in a second, by some coincidence. The movie ends well, so we can all sleep good, but its a movie. Most people that get in like that, never get out, partly because they don't know the scene, don't know how to fight in that world and if they do, they will never be the same again.The American penal system isn't made to put people back in society. On the contrary, it criminalizes people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted B movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of a talented cast and some strong performances this movie is simply too ambitious in scope and lightweight in execution. Others have drawn parallels to The Shawshank Redemption which to my mind is an insult to the latter. A better stylistic comparison would be a more ambitious film like "Crash" which succeeds in spite of its wholesale contrivances and manipulative elements because it is an artful and poetic drama. Felon is not. It tries to be gritty and realistic while asking of the audience that they be willingly manipulated at every turn in order to embrace the film's message. A deadly, almost amateurish combination.Nothing more aptly underscores how convoluted the film is than the statistic which precedes the closing credits about the number of Americans who are in prison. The film makes so little effort to disabuse viewers of the notion that violent criminals are enemies of society that other than the lead the only sympathetically portrayed prisoner is a mass murderer (Val Kilmer) who meted out barbarian justice after the murder of his family. What is one to infer from that? Unless one comes to the table armed with the laughably naive sentiment that people are basically good and that prison itself invariably turns people on both sides of the cell into monsters there is no way to navigate this film to the desired conclusion. Yes, we get it. A good guy is a victim of circumstances and ends up in prison. He does bad things to survive inside. His incarceration nearly shatters his family. We feel his fear and empathize with his struggles amid the savagery of fellow inmates and sadistic, desensitized guards. We're asked to put ourselves in his place ... a standard device for manipulating viewers. There but for the grace of God go I, if you will. But it is intellectually dishonest to choose as a vessel for an indictment of a society that believes in punishment a man who was a victim not of that culture but of a countervailing movement on the far left to expand criminal rights. It is riotously funny that the filmmaker should choose a man whose transgression - killing a burglar - invariably elicits quiet applause in real life from the very law and order majority whose mindset the film seeks to indict. And because of that the film is a fraud from the outset in spite of its virtues.This was a rare instance where I actually sought out a film because of the reviews here and felt compelled to submit one myself to express my disappointment. It is not a film that stands on its own. To be moved as many reviewers inarguably were requires that one be willing to dispense with critical thinking, be emotionally predisposed to being sympathetic to the message or simply a European as they are a fairly reliable source of approval for anything which is over-the-top in showing American culture in an unfavorable light. It is an eminently watchable movie but of the sort one might deem a gem if seen for the first time on cable at 2 am on a Sunday morning as opposed to a film worth going out of one's way for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost interesting movie about the good guy in prison.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After accidentally beating to death a burglar on his lawn, the hardworking Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff, 'Shadowboxer' 'fairdotcom') finds himself convicted to 3 years hard time. To make matters worse, Wade on his bus ride to the State Prison, gets implicated in the murder of one of the inmates in the bus. After some time in solitary confinement, he gets placed in the maximum security section of the prison know as 'The Shoe'. The place is reigned by the evil lt. Jackson played by Harold Perrineau ('OZ' 'Lost'). Hard Time is surely upon the inmates for they are being put to fight each other under the supervision of Jackson and his team who eventually ends all fights by shooting the fighting inmates but only after a fair amount of fighting took place.The movie in itself is not badly done and features some great acting by both Kilmer (as the wise and ruthless bunk mate) Perrineau and Dorff. But there are some serious issues with the film.In brief: the movie is overwrought, crammed with the usual prison clichés and too unrealistic for it's own good. The character Jackson is simply too bloodthirsty to buy him as a character and it strains the caricature of the evil prison guard even further. Porter becomes the-guy-to-be-reckoned-with apparently over night. Where he's just a completely ignorant prison fish in one scene, he's already beating up everybody in the next. Felon also suffers from being way too straightforward and lacked heavily in the humor department.That said, there are some very convincing scenes and I would recommend this movie to those that are really into the underdog prison type of films such as Lock Up and The Last Castle. Even though those movies are surely not as good as felon, it's a better comparison than to compare it to Shawshank Redemption which is like comparing a decent pulp novel to any good work of literature.6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots Of Fantasy In Felon!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment this film is. As the first chords of the twinkly piano play, I could not but let out a groan. Have we not heard this insipid music before? Yes we have, in countless emotional dramas and it is supposed to evoke impending tragedy. The family of course is very happy and loving, kissing, joking and hugging. This is going to end badly!This film is shot with the use of "earthquake cam", which is a style of camera work that suggests a child has just been given a video camera and is having problems choosing what to let into the frame. Even the first breakfast scene, a controlled environment, is shot in this half-arsed way. I wonder what the likes of John Ford, Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa would have to say about the camera being used so ineptly?The story is very unconvincing. Our hero is white and ends up incarcerated for an accidental homicide while protecting his home and family. Are American Judges so ill-informed that they do not read the circumstances of the case? Here, our hero would not have been incarcerated in such a way. If our hero was black and poor then I think the situation would have been more convincing.The most interesting theme of this movie is the separatism of race imposed by the inmates themselves but this is never really explored as the prison guards are the real villains. Our hero is never overtly seen to join the ranks of the arian racists...that would be too politically incorrect.Val Kilmer is the saviour of this fantasy movie. His performance is excellent and he again proves what a fine character actor he is. If the portion of the American audience that believes this film to be a brutal representation of reality, then it only goes to show how skewed their vision of fact is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid prison drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the proliferation of prison movies since, well, ever, FELON manages to be a fresh and entertaining example of the genre. Stephen Dorff (remember him?) stars as an ordinary family guy who accidentally kills a burglar and finds himself in a high-security prison.The usual prison clichés abound, with a lot of the focus on brutal fisticuffs as inmates battle it out for supremacy. It reminded me a little of Van Damme's IN HELL, although while that was a pure action film with superbly staged fights, FELON concentrates on the drama between the characters.Overall, the film holds together well. Time is taken to get to know the characters, not just the prisoners but also those on the outside: the brutal guard who takes his problems home with him, the wife struggling to make it with a husband in prison. It's a film which avoids stereotyping heroes and villains and does well because of it.One of the real strengths - and this is a surprise - is Val Kilmer in a supporting role as a seasoned lifer. Kilmer turns out to be excellent, bringing real gravitas to his role; to put it bluntly, I've never seen him this good before, and watching him inhabit his role is a real pleasure. Dorff, too, is actually pretty decent, making it easy for the viewer to sympathise with his character's plight.FELON certainly isn't a classic film, and it's far from the best of the prison movie sub-genre, but it's one of those movies you catch on TV late at night which leaves a real impression. I really liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love, violence, violence, violence, love, violence and again love...usually this is the perfect formula for mass hypnosis. I mean, the movie starts well, the story is well written (altough it is far from realistic), well edited, well directed, well acted. This is the reason i gave it a 4. But the message, oh my god, the message is very problematic here. It is clear that violence is a downward spiral, and that only love can saves us from falling in it. Because hate is just the absence of love, just like darkness is the absence of light. And this movie treats this subject apparently pretty well, just until the end, when Kilmer's "hero like" voice sentences "Protects your family at all costs, even if you have to kill again...because if i would be forced i will kill the entire planet to defend mine". WHAAAAT???? Is this the final morale? To kill all other's families to defend yours...so that your family is more important that the other's families? If we would thinking like that it will surely be a disaster for everyone. But hey, this is exactly what the American government is trying to convince us to do. To think only at our asses (or American's asses in this case). We all know how important our families are for us, there is no need to remind it at all. I think that to defend my brother or my mother is just like the first Isaac Asimov's law. It is deep coded in me. I will surely give my life for them, and i want to believe this is true for every normal person on the planet. But "to defend them from who" is the real problem here. Because what i've seen, by now too many times, is that the enemies we are "forced" (like Kilmer's said) to face, most of the times, are not real at all. On the other hand, is it what happened right in this movie? Sry for bad English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a conventional and antiseptic sense this was a very bland film. Exploitative.But it struck a nerve with me and I found it very uncomfortable and ugly. I'm not much of a optimist when it comes to the world and this affirmed it for me, especially 'cause it's loosely based on actual incidents.One side of me was saying the depiction of the dualities of men was unrealistic. But I think that was me hoping for the best.And it affirmed my disdain for the legal and prison systems in this country. Disgusting. "Speedy trial"? Give me a break! We want to punish law breakers. Remove them from society. But the prison system is not punishment. It's torture. I don't even think we know what punishment is. We have zealous prosecutors and lawmakers who persecute by the pound when it should be by the ounce. It seems more sane just to shoot people in the streets.What prisons are (and this film accurately depicted) are time-bomb factories. Human time-bomb factories.

		<fullReview>The writing in this movie is atrocious.Whoever did the research for legal precedents for defense in home invasions obviously didn't do their jobs properly or the movie decided to take a wild creative license with U.S. criminal law.If someone broke into your house and attacked you and you chased them out onto your property and you killed them you would be found innocent by a judge and jury 100% of the time according the legal precedent in the U.S.On November 14th, 2007, a Texas man named Joe Horn shot two robbers to death on his neighbor's property after the men had robbed the adjacent house of $2000 cash and other valuables. The jury found him innocent of murder and other charges and declared he had a right to defend himself.Amadou Diallo, on February 4th, 1999, was shot down and killed by NYPD officers who thought he was reaching into his pocket for a gun, when instead he was reaching for his wallet. All of the officers were acquitted of all charges and found innocent of all wrong doing. Officers in other districts have been found innocent of this same scenario when the item mistaken for a weapon was a cellphone, candy bar, pen, and car keys for some examples.Guns deaths in this country in self defense situations, civilians in the U.S. kill more criminals than police, at nearly double the rate.Regardless of whether or not you agree that police or civilians in self defense have a right to kill another person, it doesn't matter because the plot of this movie completely disregards U.S. laws and just runs with a false premise.No one would be convicted of murder to quickly if they had accidentally killed someone that was robbing their home clearly. At worst they would get accidental manslaughter charges which that individual would be acquitted of by a jury.Also the movie portrays public defenders as being inadequate yet there is no basis in reality for this assumption as well.Overall the researchers and writers for this movie clearly did not do their jobs. This movie is closer to science-fiction and fantasy than drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very solid. Nothing quite rises above, but this will find its audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Felon (2008)There are three things to note here. 1) This is another prison movie that makes all too clear that high security prisons are brutal places, filled with racism, corruption, and hopelessness. 2) There are key scenes where prisoners face off as if in a mini-colosseum, and the guards taunt them (the convicts muscled and tattooed beyond), make bets, and shoot rubber bullets. 3) The acting is intense but just that little bit exaggerated and oversimplified to make you quite believe any of it.Not that you don't believe the violence straight on. All kinds of mayhem and fighting, and all kinds of sadistic behavior from authorities and prisoners alike, make for an unpleasant movie. This isn't Shawhank Redemption, In fact, if you find the end represents redemption of sorts, it only comes after years of hell. So if that gives an idea of the thrust of the movie, we still wonder is it any good? As a movie. And it is. It never gets bogged down, never rhapsodizes, never carries even the bloody scenes on for very long. It's filmed with energy. The lead victim/prisoner, played by Stephen Dorff, is on his stuff, running from bewildered to determined. There is a steady, familiar progression of events here that never quite takes a surprising turn, which it could use. It feels like a film with an audience very clearly envisioned, and it hits that target perfectly. I'm not in that group--it seemed like just too many other prisoner/prison films in the broad outline--but I could at least appreciate it was well enough constructed to work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sad part is that so much of this is true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say that I like it.I can't say that I don't like it.This sadly is the truth of what prison is like.You can get jailed for little reason and unless your defense is solid, you go to jail - whether it's long term or not, there are rules...and they are not the same as outside.Many times the guards are far worse than the inmates who are detained...and this proves it to a better perspective than most jail movies I've seen.It's a game that once you leave that courtroom, you have to learn very quickly.To those that commented on being charged and arrested for protecting your family - yes, sad but true...unless you were injured there was a weapon in direct contact, should you kill somebody or even injure them serious enough to be disabled or have physical problem, then you can be charged with murder, attempted murder, willful negligence and a slew of other charges.Even if you were in a convenience store and it was being robbed and you worked as a cashier...unless a weapon was brought onto you, should you defend yourself and hold and sustain the attacker - you are liable for criminal charges...even if there are witnesses and camera video recordings.The justice system is beyond messed.If you were to injure somebody in a related instance, it would sometimes be better to be killed in the same event - as the law can screw you severely.This happens in the US and in Canada.Nobody is innocent and that is the sad but true fact.Your own home, locked, secured and protected by you and your family has little value the moment you decide to defend yourself and have any good chance in doing so.Justice is blind, it's for the wealthy and the famous.Never rely on the public defender. Do whatever you must to get a lawyer that does not work for the county...they are a joke to the defense system and have virtually no trial experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Felon is good from start to finish . I enjoyed this film because its simple yet very direct in its message . A nice family man kills a person robbing his home . He pleads to manslaughter and immediately his life is turned upside down by the prison system.Val Kilmer puts on a super performance in this movie as a mentor and his deep thinking philosophy of the way the prison system works and cool calmness is just incredible and I think he really nailed his part.The film does not fail to deliver all the way through .Definitely a must see for the Val Kilmer fan or to learn more about how corrupt the American prison system truly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff) has it all - a loving fiancé, an adorable son, and a job with a future. Then, one night, a burglar breaks into his house, and he ends up killing him by accident.He is sentenced to three years in prison for involuntary manslaughter, and shares a cell with convicted serial killer John Smith (Val Kilmer).While he's in prison, he comes under the eye of crooked guard Jackson (Harold Perrineau), who holds fights between inmates.As his time increases, Wade learns the ropes of being a felon, and what he needs to do to survive in prison, while yearning for revenge against Jackson for the things he did to him.It was an alright movie, nothing really new or special about it, but it wasn't bad. I enjoyed the story and the acting, and I highly recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Underrated Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really bored one night and randomly picked a few titles to rent since I just wanted to watch a no-brainer flick for once. Seeing that I've never heard of this film but that Val Kilmer was in it, I gave it a chance.I was pleasantly surprised that it was an intense and very intriguing film. Granted, this isn't a Shawshank Redemption or a hardcore prison film like Blood In Blood Out but still, it drew me in ever so steadily. I agree that some of the acting was a little overdone but Val Kilmer, Stephen Dorff and Sam Shepard really shone in their parts. The only weak one in the cast was definitely Harold Primeau who looked thoroughly uncomfortable in his role as the caricature of a villainous, inhumane prison guard.You can tell that the director went to great lengths to preserve the accuracy of this film with respect to prison life in general. Having watched prison documentaries on Discovery and NatGeo, I can say that this film does not glorify nor undermine the no-holds-barred lifestyle of survival present in the corrections system.Val Kilmer does extremely well with his role as a convicted 'lifer' felon who has spent a significant part of his life behind bars. Stephen Dorff - who is thrust suddenly into this fish-out-of-water role after being convicted - is surprisingly convincing.Ric Roman Waugh - in the DVD commentary - ensures that the prisoners in this film are real-life gang members or ex-convicts who were also technical advisors. They even vouched for the authenticity and realism of this film in representing prison life.If you're willing to give this really underrated film a chance, go rent it. It's not a masterpiece by all means but still, a very good watch. I give it a crisp 8 for the courage of the director aiming for accuracy over needless 'Hollywood climaxes'. The plot and storyline isn't amazing but does the job well enough to keep you engaged for the full length of this film.All in all, an interesting watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has a tight script and will keep one glued to the screen. Its all about how one action can change your entire life. The move gives insight into a life in prison and conjures up feelings of pity, anger and sympathy at different times.Val Kilmer puts in a tight performance and i barely recognised him in the first short cause of his unusual beard. But he sure got his role all figured out and delivers a masterful performance. this one is for all val kilmer fans.This may not be the best prison movie..say something like shawshank redemption but it has its heart on the right place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nightmare Of Justice Propels A Fine Prison Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's safe to say that Felon is right up there with the best of the prison movie genre even if it in not the best. The writer, by using a series of unthinkable situations,set up one of the best premises of misapplied justice. The storyline further defines itself by showing how one wrong can continue to mitigate itself exponentially almost destroying not only the protagonist and his family, but others as well. This gives Felon some depth and keeps the viewer rapt.The character of Wade Porter, very ably depicted by Stephen Dorff, is a sort of "everyman" building the "American Dream" one hard earned step at a time so he can give his family what we all desire. He is derailed when he does what every American feels they have the freedom to do: defend that family from harm in the form of a burglar. When the justice system fails to interpret what he did as falling into "self defense" he finds himself sentenced to three years in a maximum security prison. As bad as that is things go much worse as he is being held and transported in the "system". I will spare all the details as it is excellently portrayed in this fictional, yet totally believable, film.As good as Stephen Dorff is, the richness of the film comes in the story and supporting actors. Val Kilmer continues to be an even better actor as he takes on support roles such as John Smith in Felon. He really inhabits the character and while he doesn't much care if he can save himself he has a need to change the system the penal system he knows is failing miserably. He gets his chance to do so and it really propels the film.If you only know Harold Perrineau from Lost then prepare for perhaps the greatest surprise of all. Lt. Jackson, as played by Perrineau, becomes the symbolic persona of all that is evil within the prison himself. He straddles the line of conflicted and sadistic like an acrobat walking a tightrope. Whatever he is has been molded by not just the kill or be killed attitude of a hardened prison guard, but likely by events in his past. I could go on, but again the viewer only needs to witness the skill at bringing this menacing power to life to decide that Harold Perrineau is exemplary in his performance. Other good performances by Marisol Nichols, as Wade Porter's fiancé, and Sam Shepard as Gordon Camrose, who at one time was a guard where John Smith was incarcerated, serve to ably round out this excellent cast.If you have a predilection for prison films you must see Felon. Even if you do not particularly care for films of the genre Felon is highly recommended. While not quite iconic like Shawshank Redemption, it is a powerful movie in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can cut to close to the bone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kilmer's performance is some of his best work in a long-time and glad to see he has become the actor I always believed he could be. Dorff's can sometimes fall a bit flat with the image of the rabbit caught in the headlights but that is more down to the character than Dorff's acting ability. While Kilmer's character is truly believable, Dorff's can stretch the imagination at times.While some of the scenes are exaggerated they are handled with the realm of reality, having spent 15 years in prison, being moved several times, I can say that this does happen maybe not to this extreme but in parts there is a lot of truth behind this. For people to dismiss that is even more unbelievable. I have met a large number of prison officers that are truly sadistic in their duties and have also found many that are truly concerned for the life that the prisoner has.This film is far from showing that prison is a place for power over man this is about mans will to survive and what he will do to accomplish that goal. I have met many that who would never dream of hurting someone to becoming someone that would not think twice about it. Also perhaps this film shows the things we wish not to see and think about what can happen behind the walls of any institution. Remember prison is about your loss of freedom and nothing else secondary punishment should not exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing, read the DVD case and was intriguing but thought it was going to be a disappointment. In fact, it shocked me as too how great it was and kept me in suspense and thinking, as the DVD back said, "It Could Happen To Anyone". This really make you think of all those times you have thought or said how and what you would do if someone ever broke into your home....Felon makes you think this could happen to me, and that alone is a scary thought. Especially after the realist depiction of what prison is like to the everyday common man and how it can make something your not. Even more so, how action of others (Kilmer situation) can influence you do act out! Wont explain, but you find out why Kilmer is there too....It Could Be You! The action fight scenes are engulfing, the acting by Kilmer and Dorff is amazing...Far from Blade and Heat....but performances just as good if not better! Def a movie to buy and own....def a movie to watch and appreciate what you have! Watch It! Def going to buy, cant believe went right to DVD....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No big words here. Felon is a good (but not original) story with solid performances from actors. It is worth your time and in the end it makes you ask yourself a few questions, if you haven't given a much thought about prison system in the States. Including brutal violence and the normal "tough guys in prison"-stuff. I recommend if violence don't offend you. Some minus points are from couple of non-believable story elements considering the amount of damage one person can take in a long time span and a few little glitches here and there. The atmosphere of the prisons section where the movie focuses was good, and you can feel the hostility when you are taken to the "jard". Seven stars out of ten. And it was nice to see Val Kilmers performance as the old dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most decent guy in the movie: the burglar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***warning spoilers***Let's face it, in comparison to the other protagonists in this movie the burglar is the one with "less sin". He "only" wanted to steal some money. He broke into a house, didn't physically hurt a soul, except for a little push to clear the way so he could get the hell outta Dodge. What did the other guys do? Val kilmers character who is portraited as some kind of hero, killed entire families as he said himself. With "entire families" I guess that would include children as well?..what a nice guy. People who had done nothing to him except being related to a killer. Dorffs character ran after a fleeing, scared small time crook so he could beat the crap out of him. That's vindictive. How can he feel threatened by someone running AWAY from him and out of his house? Not to mention the guard who is in a league of his own. What a sadistic bastard! (at least they had a somewhat good black guard by his side, otherwise this movie could be accused of racism?) I know I'm being cynical and sarcastic but this movie really has a strange philosophy. But I guess that might be the point of it, to make you think. But to me you almost feel sympathetic to people you shouldn't feel sympathetic about. So the point of the movie: it is okay to use any kind of force, including killing, as long as you feel threatened or hurt. Val kilmers actions were understandable since hey, he had just lost his whole family. The burglars action is not okay since he did it out of "free will". No one, at least as far as we know, forced him to break into Dorffs house. Except maybe circumstances, maybe someone had done something "bad" to him too which would justify his actions as well? If circumstances were to excuse people's behavior even the guard would be forgiven, since the accident of his son had made him suffer. At times I think this movie has a double morality, 1)on one side it shows that NO ONE is pure and without sin. And that EVIL actions comes out of suffering, pain and unfortunate circumstances. Taking that a step further it would mean that no one is truly evil. 2)On the other side it kind of says that: there are some truly evil people, like the burglar, and the sadistic cop, that does evil stuff just for the hell of it, out of free will. These are the TRULY evil people who deserve to get rid of. The other ones like Dorff and Kilmer, are victims that are forced into it. They are not to blame and should be left alone. But if they would have shown scenes when Kilmer slaughtered that family we certainly would get a different opinion about him. This is confusing.. If you give a mass-murderer sufficient screening time he appears more sympathetic than a burglar. Since the mass-murderers actions aren't filmed but the burglars are. And the mass-murderer gets the chance to explain himself. This movie wants to have it both ways. It wants to both get into the psyche of criminals, to understand them and also "punish bad people". To be a "sly Stallone" type of movie. That's why it leaves you more confused than satisfied, even if that might not have been the point of the movie. If I'd rate something in this movie it would be more about the cinematography than the message, since I'm not quite sure what the message is. I think the movie got too repetitive after the prisoners transfer to "the yard". It was a cheap, boring set, and seeing fight after fight with skinny guys beating up 40 pounds heavier opponents got somewhat boring. To me it doesn't deserve an 8. This is more like a 6 or 7 to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily empathized with character finds himself in murkiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had some strong plot lines, from the 'innocent man imprisoned' to the 'cold rules of prison'. The violence seemed fairly realistic, increasing the impending sense of fear encompassing the central character. Very watchable. Was probably made for a lower budget than many other films currently in release, but it clearly better than 90% of them. Kudos to the filmmakers, crew, and cast.Definitely recommend it. Val Kilmer does a great job; he could've stole a lot of scenes and made his character a far more sharply memorable one, but that would've only served to detract from the protagonist's dilemma. Kilmer's handling of his character was near pitch perfect in my opinion. He gave his character an extremely believable depth and solidity, and coupled with some great performances from Dorff, and the rest of the prison cast, created a malignantly sick and implosive atmosphere in the scenes. Well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Felon is a bitter and tragic prison drama that's packed with wrenching injustice, simmering anger and caged animal violence. Loaded with the kind of tough guy elements which make prison films exciting (check out Lock Up with Stallone), it's also has a tender side brought forth by its extremely thoughtful and well written script, which explores ideas that are both hard to swallow and very sad. Stephen Dorff, a guy who already has the gritty look as soon as he walks into a frame, plays Wade Porter, a simple family man who is just starting out at life along with his wife (Marisol Nichols). Their hopes and dreams turn into a nightmare, however, when a violent intruder breaks into their home one night. Wade strikes out in defence of himself and his wife, accidentally killing the criminal. Because of the backwards ass way the States run things, he is accused of manslaughter and sentenced to serve out jail time. He is then thrown into the dog pit, literally and figuratively. The penitentiary he is sent to is run by sadistic and corrupt Lt. Jackson (Harold Perrineau) along with his brutal enforcer Sgt. Roberts (Nick Chinlund). Jackson organizes vicious fight club style matches between the inmates, totally off the books and beyond any correctional legislations. Wade is forced to adapt, adjust and bring out monstrous aspects within himself to survive, and make it through his sentence with both his life and humanity intact. It's not an easy turn of events to watch unfold on screen, but necessary in the sense that this probably happens quite frequently to people in real life, and should be seen. The only solace Wade finds is with his gruff, veteran cell mate John Smith (Val Kilmer) a lifer who once went on a massacre of revenge against individuals who murdered his family. Smith is his guiding light, steering him through the hellish carnage of what he's forced to do and helping him to keep the candle of compassion alive within him, never losing sight of what is essential in his fight to claim his life once more. Kilmer is a force that will knock you flat in this role, an old bull with dimming fury in his eyes, a man with a bloody history that has forged the weary dog we see in the film. Late in the film he has an extended monologue to Wade, giving him both blessing and advice with some of the most truthful and affecting gravity Kilmer has showed in his career. The writer/director, who appears to be primarily a stuntman, should be commended for such a script, that could have easily been a straight up prison flick without the pathos that drips off its heartstrings. We as an audience view this painfully and prey nothing like this ever happens to us or anyone we know, hoping to see a light of hope at the end of the dark tunnel for Wade. I won't spoil it, but it's worth the hit that your emotions will take while watching, and there is hard earned catharsis to be had, and penance for the characters you want to shoot in the face along the way. The extends to brilliant work from Chris Browning, Anne Archer, Nate Parker, Johnny Lewis and a fantastic Sam Shepherd as another seasoned convict. This was correct to video as I recall, which is a crime. It's up there as my favourite prison set film that I've ever seen, a soul bearing piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll start off with someone else's quote...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read on an internet message board that someone said about 'Felon' and how it's "The best film ever to go straight to DVD." Well, I'm not sure it's the best ever, but I kind of know where that quote came from. It is damn good. However, it is also very BLEAK. Wow, is it depressing from time to time. It is dark, gritty, nasty, sad, frustrating and then all of those again.It tells the story of a decent family man who (sort of) accidentally kills a burglar one night and gets sent to prison. There he must learn the inner workings of the new 'society' he finds himself in. Many people may draw parallels with the excellent 'Shawshank Redemption.' Yes, they are both about similar subject matter, but they're both very different. Felon uses a lot of hand-held camera-work, giving it a deliberately amateur 'documentary' feel to it, which adds to the realism.Just like Shawshank, Felon has no 'weak links' when it comes to its actors. I don't normally think much of Val Kilmer, but here he plays his part well and you'll find you have sympathy for everyone here, even some people you think you may not normally like.All it all, Felon is a great little movie. It probably should have got a full theatrical release, but its sombre tone may well alienate the general populous. If you're in the mood for something dark then you'll probably appreciate this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hate and violence in this film is graphically portrayed in an unforgiving fashion. This led me to believe that there was maybe going to be nothing in the way of a story and that it would leave me feeling empty. That was not the case. This is a powerful film but it could be construed as immoral by some people. Some people live a life of violence by choice. It is maybe in their nature or it is just something that they have learned. Some people, on the other hand, get pulled into it and have nothing to do except fight back or be destroyed. This is what is being portrayed.I saw one comment from another reviewer suggesting that the message contained in the film is bad. I have seen another comment suggesting that it is not very realistic. I disagree. It is fiction but what is going on within the film is believable. The message that is sent out within the film is that life is not always fair... and all there is left for you to do is to keep fighting until the end or lay down and die. It is also showing that some people choose a life of violence and others are thrust into it whether they like it or not.This is a very powerful, very violent, but very moving film. Sanctimonious people who see the world through rose colored spectacles will probably not like it.</fullReview>

I also wanted to write this review to encourage everyone to watch the special feature, inside the shark tank, because it adds to the realism of the movie.

		<fullReview>With its Heart in the right place but its head and body somewhere else, this is a well Acted Prison Movie that is arguably a Realistic look at the "Life" inside. Unless you have been there and done that, who knows?But this seems rushed, underwritten and enjoys much too much its many "Yard" Scenes that are repetitive and boring. These Shaky Camera Shots are many and tend to upstage the more thoughtful and provocative parts.Not a bad Film and the always reliable Stephen Dorff does what He does, but Val Kilmer is the Acting Surprise here as a barely recognizable Sociopathic Mass Murderer with tender leanings and a passion for Philosophy.Realistic or not about Prison and its Microcosm and the Legal System, the Movies High Road gets lost among the Tattoos and Shaky, Showy, fight Scenes. Recommended for Fans of Prison Movies, Cage Matches, Body Art, and good Acting. Those seeking some insight or answers about the Film's Message may find it Heavy Handed, or at least a Puzzling and Twisted Bent about Family Values.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Felon '08</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A powerful movie that will get you have you emotionally involved, drained and white knuckled. A young small business man, Wade Porter(Stephen Dorff), kills an intruder while trying to protect his family. The system is fouled and fails Wade, who is convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to three years inside a maximum security prison. Porter will share a cell with a notorious mass murderer, John Smith(Val Kilmer). Porter will need to make use of any wisdom he can garner from Smith in order to survive. He must deal with vicious prisoners and a sadistic and corrupt head prison guard Lt. Jackson(Harold Perrineau). It will prove that the fit of the fittest is who will survive. Survival is the key in the cases of many of the characters, including some of the 'good guards' (Nate Parker, Greg Serano), the steadfast Laura, her mother (a small but well defined role for Annie Archer), and for former guard Gordon (Sam Shepard) a friend of John Smith. Dorff and Kilmer provide very strong characterizations as does Perrineau, but without the fairly large cast of 'fellow prisoners' who set the scenes, their overall performances would be less impressive. It is here that director Ric Roman Waugh demonstrates his talent for handling the mixture of physical brutality with the fragility of each individual's mind that makes the film work..MY RATING: 8/10</fullReview>

He tries to defend the property and chases him with a baseball bat outside in the yard where he manages to stop him but unfortunately for him it doesn't survive. Laura is forced to call the police and they condemn Wade to prison. The movie has its good parts and bad. One of the good ones would be like seeing the reality behind the prison the cruel punishment and how it lives there. The bad parts:1. The Lawyer. How Wade got a lawyer from the office and had no one to represent him personally? If you know that you don't have an attorney you don't hit in the head that thief who came over you in the house, you remain inside.2.The amount of money for him to go out on bail. It looked overly large even with two zeros greater than it should be. But as I'm not familiar with the amounts that are required in the U.S.A. for a prisoner to be released, then it is possible to be wrong at this point. 3.I understand that Stephen Dorff is the kind of bad guy after I saw him in Blade and the roles of bad-boy fits good but in this movie after making a few push ups on the edge of the bed was able to beat several prisoners there and may overcome?4. The character played by Val Kilmer after arrive in the same cell with Wade not to see him as more than just sit on the toilet then goes out in so called "backyard" and he supports with the hands against the wall and do a few push ups but none of the inmates doesn't dare to touch him.5. The head of the prison, so is this the way you deal with folks over there? Cast on as dogs so they can be fighting then to shoot them with a gun to stop them and you call the buzzer? What kind of example should give other employees there?Even with some minuses is a good movie but not for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch the special features on Felon they talk about how much detail and effort they put into making this a brutally realistic look at prison. If that is truly the case then we have a major and horrible problem on our hands as human beings. First of all...the main character is sent to a maximum security prison under the most horrible circumstances imaginable because he kills a man accidentally and in pseudo-self defense. There isn't a court in the world that would punish this man in this way. So after they make you ferociously angry about that...then they show this deplorable horribly awful violent world of this prison. I guess the major issue I had was that this film isn't as much entertainment as it is some sort of horrible documentary about violent prison life. I suppose I just found it hard to watch and really vile in so many ways. That doesn't make it a bad movie, in fact I suppose to evoke such an emotional response is a good thing but from an entertainment stand point I was more angry than entertained.Stephen Dorff plays family man Wade Porter, who just seems to have one horrible string of bad luck. He does a great job especially progressing from family man to this hardened criminal in the worst possible circumstances. Val Kilmer really turns in a terrific performance as murderous criminal John Smith. Kilmer gives one of his best performances in years and him and Dorff are fantastic together as the most unusual partners in crime so to speak. Harold Perrineau is also great as the hard as nails Lt. Jackson. He doesn't play the character as over the top or villainous but instead a very real angry, twisted individual. He's believable and has good on screen charisma.Ric Roman Waugh writes and directs the picture and certainly paints a disturbing picture of prison. I have trouble believing that a prison in the United States would be this calibre of horrifying. It works well for a thriller or action flick but if this is even remotely true than its downright disturbing. Waugh is a stuntman and his credits include a video game so I think he would like you to believe this is reality when in fact its his attempt at scaring people. It certainly taps into an inert fear in all of us that you could end up in this horrifying situation. In the end an absolutely disturbing plot to get him out of prison and end the reign of terror of the Lt. seems just too hard to believe. If you're a fan of prison films then I suppose this will appeal to you. While I found it interesting and thought provoking I don't think I would watch it again, certainly not for entertainment purposes. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thrilled to find Val Kilmer at his best; this is, as a previous member stated, as good as Shawshank Redemption, but not so similar as to be a clone-off. Fresh and realistic. I have been in jails, not prisons, got caught growing pot in '69, did five of six months in the Boys' Camp Glenwood; also some weeks in Redwood City County jail, so I have a fraction of a sense of the nastier prisons.Just a darn fine film, Kilmer should have gotten a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in my opinion.I feel strongly that parents should encourage their teenage children to see films of this nature, to give the youngsters an idea of the consequences of criminal activity. In our high-tech whirled with its law-enforcement machinations, the fake War on Terror, War on Drugs, War on Poverty, War on Dissent, War on Democracy, with prisons becoming such a lucrative private enterprise system, and with the harsh realities of our country's Corpstate elitist agenda, young folks need to be aware of the traps they will encounter.This movie tells many Truths about our Prison system.Bravo to the writer and producer, and certainly to every cast and crew member.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FELON is a passionate film which is just as brutishly fascinating as it is disconcerting. It is the classic tale of a man convicted of a crime he did not commit. Although, in this case, Wade Porter (played by Stephen Dorff) did murder a man, however, to any sane individual, it was clearly done in the defense of his home and family. And, it was only through skewed legal sophistry that he was sentenced to a maximum security prison. Since he agreed to a plea bargain, his case was never arbitrated by a judge or jury, and, as a result, he essentially convicted himself. A decisive and important subtext of the film might be that a court appointed attorney is ALWAYS a bad idea. Once in prison, Mr. Porter is subjected to mental and physical degradation that is alien to his hardworking, honorable, blue collar existence. His unit in the jail is run by a psychotically sadistic guard, Lt. Jackson (played by Harold Perrineau) who delights in arranging fierce gladiatorial bouts between the prisoners. Porter's cell mate is John Smith (played by Val Kilmer who is nearly unrecognizable under an extravagant goatee, and at least thirty pounds of additional weight) who plays the role of the wise and knowledgeable jail house guru. The entire correctional system runs completely contrary to any logical or ethical component of civilized society. Racism is the engine that drives every aspect of this corrupt hierarchy. The guards act only to redirect the inherent violence back on to the prisoners, and away from the administration. Forget 'rehabilitation', this satanic order is concerned only with the maximization of punishment. When the film concludes, the viewer is left wondering who benefits from all of the suffering. Although numbers vary, America certainly incarcerates a significant percentage of its population, and FELON examines one extreme example, yet it clearly makes the case that no one benefits from such draconian measures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film expecting no more than a couple of prison fights and some special appearances from the slowly getting in good films Val Kilmer. I was surprised. As soon as it starts I am hooked straight into the story. It relates so much to the current society which is what I think makes the film so great and at some points very powerful. Although i Haven't seen much or heard much of Stephen Dorff since his role in World Trade Center you will be pleasantly surprised by his acting, and the duet of Vil Kilmer and him stuck in a tiny prison cell makes for a much bigger film than it actually looks.After watching this I am now looking forward to any future projects from director Ric Roman Waugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film spins a suspenseful tale and has impressive acting. While there are a few story elements that stretch credibility, the terror of prison, such as being surrounded by psychopaths and the drudgery of confinement, is realistically portrayed. Stephen Dorff as Wade, was great in this. (Sad, that he is now seen on the small screen, hawking electric cigarettes.) Val Kilmer plays a lifer (for retaliatory killings related to his wife's slaughter) who finds in Wade someone who shares his reverence for protecting and sustaining one's family. In turn, he wants to protect Wade. Val is great in this role, as he is in so many roles. (If only someone would offer him a part as a guy who loses 100 pounds for some dramatic reason.) The consummate professional that he is -- He'd lose the weight, along with his character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Above all, it is all thanks to 3 performers: Stephen Dorff, Val Kilmer and Marison Nichols; the latter got my attention in 24-series. The plot is very intense and thrilling, full of unexpected twists and versatile characters. And dramatic events are not within the prison walls only, but also outside, related to both wardens and prisoners. And the ending is complex and sophisticated, consists of multiple scenes.As to the background based on real events, it is really annoying and ridiculous why Dorff's character was convicted and even after that he was put into such a prison where conditions set by the court are impossible to obey. I do not like mild and short terms in prisons here in Europe, but the U.S. system has evident imperfections as well.A good movie, but probably not for lady companies :)</fullReview>

Kilmer played his part without being overbearing and Stephen Dorf (who up to know I only know as having been in Blade - which I wouldn't consider a good recommendation) was believable and convincing. The gritty realism of the setting was a relief when compared to other movies that glamorize prison and the ending although a little too easy, rounded things of nicely. All in all I thought it was well worth watching and in some strange way even uplifting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic &amp; Sometimes Terrifying Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a B &amp; E, Wade Porter grabs a bat and attacks the intruder. Accidentally killing him, he is sentenced to 3 years in prison. Now he must cope with his new life and become a changed man in order to survive. I gave this film a chance because of Val Kilmer, he's one of my favourite actors. I can't put my finger on it, but he has something about him and his performances that I tend to gravitate towards. Here, he is in a supporting role, letting Dorff show his chops. I knew Dorff had it in him to be good, he just needed the right script. Felon boasts great performances and a gritty realistic and sometimes terrifying view on prison and what one must do to survive.If I were to describe the film, I'd call it Fight Club in prison. While the two films are totally different in themes, messages, tones and subject matter, both contain a lot of gritty fight sequences. The film takes the most terrifying aspects of prison (minus rape) and throws it in your face. Always watch your back, don't look at someone the wrong way, and get with a gang as quickly as possible. Ric Roman Waugh did a lot of research for this film and it shows. Everything comes off as authentic and not once did I ever question the acts of the people and their choices. In prison, there are no rules. The three act structure the film gives you is satisfying, even if the final act makes you bend the realms of realism a little bit. Waugh can be proud of this film and I look forward to what else he has to offer us in the future. As I mentioned before, I find Dorff to be an underrated actor. He's not bad, he just happens to make bad script choices and end up in horrible movies (except for Blade). His dedication to this role is respectable, and seeing Val Kilmer as his mentor only brightens my smile. Val deserves a comeback, but if he were to simply continue making films like Felon, I'd be perfectly happy. Of course it's not just Dorff in the prison, but how his wife copes with his sudden departure. How does she move on? Survive? Tell her son?In the end, Felon is a film that deserves your attention. It's not well known, which makes this seem like a hidden gem.</fullReview>

Chris Browning is another who helps make the film what it is. He plays Danny Sampson; a ruthless, sick skinhead set out to control the prison and dispatch of the weak throughout his gang.

		<shortDescription>What a surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just randomly picked this from the massive stack of DVDs at a house I happen to be watching over, I was expecting a simple, silly action movie....wow, the description does not do it justice.This is an inward movie, but not to the point that it will annoy many of the more mainstream watchers; it should hit the right note with anyone who can stand to watch it (it's quite disturbing at times).The camera-work is something that certainly struck me. It starts off rather shaky, and I'm not sure if this was deliberate or not..., but it soon grows into very competent direction from Waugh. I hope to see more from him in his new life as a Writer/Director.The action is gritty and the acting is, for the most part, top notch. While some of the lesser characters seem rather like not-so-good non-actors, the main cast are remarkably good. The likes of Val Kilmer and Perrineau are very reliable yet they manage to go beyond themselves and play roles I didn't think they could play. Val Kilmer manages to both scare and delight you as an inmate while Perrineau seems right at home as the twisted cop (or perhaps it's prison, due to his time on the wonderful 'Oz').Dorff is the biggest surprise. His name can be associated with some tripe, but he's at his best here and I thoroughly enjoyed his great performance.To finish, it's a movie that reminded me that looks can be deceiving. I reckon you'll think that by the end of the movie too, in more ways than one. 8/10</fullReview>

I'd definitely watch it again. Val Kilmer nails his role, and the tone of the flick is perfect for the topic.

		<shortDescription>the ultimate prison movie - a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should be shown in schools but, because of the harsh but realistic language, the do-gooders would have fits and fall in. Today's kids know all the words. If they had to sit through this most of them - those headed in bad directions - could change their ways. It most certainly would have them scared to death of life in prison. That should be the most important consideration, but it would not be. The sweet purists would be too busy tsk-tsking."Felon" is very difficult to watch. It is gritty, realistic, frightening and scary as hell. It is a no-holds-barred film that rates a 10-plus plus.The prisoners are bad guys, most of the guards are bad guys, a no win situation for Dorff's character. He gives a magnificent performance, reminding one of Bruce Willis. Val Kilmer once again shows great depth and deep knowledge of his character, and Marisol Nichols makes the most of a small but important role.The entire cast is excellent. The prisoners are perfectly typecast. The close-ups are revealing and, for a change, the background music stays in the background.Wonder what Bogie would think of this. I think it is one of the very best prison movies you will ever have the chance to see so, go see it. It will make you uncomfortable, but it will demand your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little weak towards the end but otherwise the convincing violence of the prison and its impact on the characters is engaging stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wade Porter is a normal guy with his own business and family. When someone breaks into his home, Wade defends himself ? chasing the man outside and hitting him with a baseball bat. Unfortunately he kills the man and has little option but to plead guilty in return for a three year sentence. With his wife struggling on the outside, Wade finds himself in a hellish world where violence and grouping is everything and the guards are almost as steeping in using violence and reputation to keep control as the prisoners. While the experience of his new cellmate John Smith offers him wisdom, others things conspire against him.On the basis of the actors I watched this film, not quite expecting what it would be. It transpires that it is not that unfair to describe it as "Shawshank but without the hope" because the basic dynamics of the film are similar in regards the prison setting and the central character being a relative "innocent". However the modern setting does not allow for much in the way of bonhomie with the danger and instead Felon creates a convincing and depressing world of violence where the wrong connections or even the wrong look mean conflict and death. For familiar with modern prison fare such as Oz will recognise it but it is brisk and brutal enough to avoid feeling like a cliché. For the vast majority of the running time, the film focuses on this world and its effect on those within it and in this way it is quite compelling. The actual "plot" doesn't work that well and the ending is all a bit too convenient and easy considering what has gone before and as a result it does end weakly.Instead I would have preferred something a bit more sobering and realistic to have concluded it, which would also have fitted better with the statistics given at the end. That said though, the majority does work and the cast react to it really well. Dorff looks great and sold me on how his character changes and hardens, almost managing to make that the theme of the film more than the plot. Kilmer is nearly unrecognisable and manages a role that could easily have been hammy and obvious. The narrative takes him that way and I thought he did really well to hold it off. Perrineau, on the other side of the bars this time, does great work and it is a shame that the film did not do better with exploring his character instead of using him more to get an ending. The support cast of criminals are realistic while other famous faces such as Shepard and a very old looking Archer show up. Nichols (to answer your question ? you know her from 24) is solid and ensures we do not forget the bigger picture.Felon is not a cheerful watch but it is a gripping and depressing look within the world of maximum security prisons. The narrative is not as good as the world and the characters but at least it stays in a supporting role for as long as it can ? but ultimately it is the flow and the ending is weaker than the rest of the film deserves. Not perfect by any means but still impacting and engaging stuff with several very good performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little sceptical before seeing this movie, I'd recently seen Kilmer in 'Conspiracy' which was awful, and seen Dorf in 'Botched' which was hilarious (in a good way). This mix - funny and bad - surely couldn't work in thriller, could it?Well yes it could, and does perfectly. Val Kilmer, although looking a little strange sporting a bushy goatee fits his role well as the inmate mentor. It takes a little time to get used to him in this role as he isn't the action hero you automatically expect. Dorf is convincing as the well-to-do family man (sort of) wrongly imprisoned.At the start of this film you may get flashbacks of 'An Innocent Man', but this film is far grittier and pulls no punches.It's full of violence with a splash of emotional drama, predictable but still fun to watch 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new kind of prison film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary : A family man is convicted of murder and must struggle to win his battle not only inside prison, but also to keep his family together.Review : This is one film that I am glad I saw. Not only is the storyline different to most other prison films, but the way it is made and the actors who create it, give you a satisfied feeling when the film is finished that you got what you paid for. I gave this a 9 because the way the storyline progressed, it seemed as though this movie would go on for another half an hour or so which, when you see the movie, would have been absolutely wonderful. Shawshank redemption is a good example of how this could have dragged on a little more to delve more into some of the 'side factors' of the characters.First of all, he way they shot the film puts the viewer in a somewhat 3rd-person view to give you the impression that you are actually there when it is all happening. The entire film is one that keeps you wanting more as it goes along and never slows down at any point. Each new aspect is more interesting than before, and continues all through till the credits.As for the storyline, a family man who is sent to jail on account of murdering an intruder, might seem to some people, boring. But, the actors are what make the film interesting. Val Kilmer was exceptionally good in this one, although I've never been a big Val fan, I thoroughly enjoyed his portrayal of a religious avenger who befriends our family man and teaches him more about life. Stephen Dorff was also excellent who evidently evolves as the movie progresses to follow his role nicely. Harold Perrineau as the prison guard captain was a nice add-in, although they could have used someone perhaps a little more 'scary-looking'.All in all, the original storyline, excellent characters, and general feeling of fulfillment makes this movie a definite see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best prison movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked the Shawshank Redemption then you will love this movie; by saying that I don't mean that the two movies are similar, it is just both of them focus on the human factor for the inmates, Felon takes this argument further by depicting the jailers as the baddies and elevate the hidden human qualities in some of the inmates like Kilmar's character ( a murderer with passion for philosophy). There is not even one dull moment in this action packed movie, it keeps the viewers holding to their seats with different emotional reactions, the actors in general were superb specially Kilmer and Dorff, this movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: This is a violent movie. With Action and Real Life situations. It is NOT for everyone.A man on his way to establishing a good life for himself and his new bride to be, finds himself placed in a situation of protecting his family. In so doing, he then finds himself immersed in a judicial nightmare that plunges him even deeper into a dark abyss of dog-eat-dog world of prison.I must say that the acting was just superb in all areas. The directing by Ric Roman Waugh (Whom also wrote this wonderful piece), was incredible.The outstanding acting of Harold Perrineau as Lt. Jackson is classic. His uncanny ability to make you hate him is just magnificent.Val Kilmer pulled off one of the best portrayals of a lifer that I have ever seen in a motion picture.There are very few flaws that I could see in this drama. I loved it from the beginning to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Felon is a simple, familiar story of a man who is betrayed by the rule of law and finds himself alone in the microcosm of the prison system. The set up is simple but effective and the film is devoid of the usual forced theatrics of prison movies. The focus is not on a thrilling escape attempt or a courageous quest for redemption in the eyes of the law. Instead it is an intimate portrayal of the journey a normal man takes from a happy, free man to an incarcerated felon. It is sometimes brutal and unflinching, occasionally pseudo-philosophical but always maintains a connection to the personal cost of the a prison sentence.Stephen Dorff and Val Kilmer head the cast, Dorff as the wronged man and Kilmer as an enigmatic lifer. The relationship is that of teacher and mentor, there is even a voice over with a montage, but the quality of the performances saves it from falling into overwrought cliché. Dorff proves that a slew of underwhelming roles sold him seriously short and Kilmer creates a compelling physicality and presence, despite his relatively limited screen time. To rate one performance over the other would detract from the impressive dynamic they create. The supporting cast are generally solid apart from Harold Perrineau, a man with no discernible acting talent who still turns up in all kinds of places. His character in Felon is supposed to be complex, gorged on power and alienated from his family but Perrineau simply can't pull it off. It is a shame in a film that does little else wrong.The film was clearly made on a budget but the grainy, mostly hand-held camera work works well in this setting. The shooting style reminded me a lot of Narc (which can only be a good thing) in its low key approach and sometimes arresting imagery.All things considered, Felon is a well made, impressively acted, tersely plotted drama which deserves to find an audience. It is better than many movies I've seen this year but can only be seen on limited release before a swift release on DVD where it will probably sink without a ripple in a sea of direct to video dross. If you find it wedged firmly between the latest Seagal pseudo action flick and some dodgy labelled classic that never was or will be check it out. Its worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal prison film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of Stephen Dorff,just don't seem to see a lot of him, not enough anyway. This starts like so many American movies,you just want to jump through the screen and become him,perfect wife, cute kid, business doing well, hell, they're even getting married and he agrees to an extra $650 for the dress. Then, one night they hear an intruder and Dorff ends up killing him with the aid of his baseball bat which of course he keeps under the bed, well, this is America!He's then arrested for murder, and you're left (as he is) thinking, hang on, this ain't right. Sentenced to 3 years, he finds himself in a max. security sort of 'escape from new york' type hell-hole, where all the prisoners do is fight each other for the amusement of the guards, one of which has serious issues with one of the inmates. Enter Val Kilmer, a sort of Charlie Manson( the English prison variety, not the American cult leader) character, a legend in the penal system for his brutality and quotes about philosophy.Sharing a cell, they make inroads to becoming as close as either man ever could in the circumstances and they do end up mutually respecting each other through the hardships they endure. When Dorffs wife sends him a 'dear John', Kilmer understands his pain and we are left wondering if he is actually as bad as all that. The yard scenes are depicted in a kind of gladiatorial way, extremely brutal and we've long past the point where we want to jump back through the screen into the safety and comfort of out own living rooms.This is primarily a hard, brutal ,prison drama, but underneath all that, its also a story about hope, faith and the need to put right a lot of what is wrong with present day society, as Kilmers character declares' i would have wiped out the whole goddamn planet just to have them back'. Brutal, yes,and un-compromising at times but there's also a message here regarding what is happening to certain elements of our society, all in all though, a cracking and well told film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will keep this brief. Felon is little short of a masterpiece. Dorff and Kilmer both deliver deep and emotional performances that goes right through the screen. This is Kilmers best performance since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Dorff, who I haven't seen in quite a while, does an amazing portrait of an ordinary man who is forced to make some terrible choices just to stay alive and be able to go back to his life.All characters are human and believable. The story is quite simple but in the same time moving and heartbreaking. The camera work has an almost documentary feel which heightens the story and makes the film even more realistic. All the pieces fell together seamlessly and made one hell of a movie. See it!</fullReview>

The acting is great and the story is just so real and raw. Val Kilmer did a great job and it was a very thrilling and emotional story.This movie is about a young man who one night kills a man who broke into his house. He gets charged with involuntary manslaughter because the man was running away from his house so he could not get off on self defense. He once good man goes to prison and discovers he and his morals have to change greatly for him to survive in prison.This movie was absolute perfection. Great acting, great storyline,great ending.

		<shortDescription>The truest form of actions and consequences...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie got to me. It touched me as deep as no other movie has in a very long time. The film's plot is very much like some other prison classics, like The Last Castle with Robert Redford and (dare I say it) Shawshank Redemption (yes, I do, shame on me!). The only difference is it is way more real and brutal than those films which is probably the reason I felt my heart racing through almost every scene. I'm not saying it's better than those films, I'm just saying it is different and I LOVED IT! Stephen Dorff plays an incredible role of something that I really could see as a role model for every generation - a true man who accepts the consequences of his own actions, the cruelty of others and refuses to break down. Val Kilmer also gives an astonishing performance as the badass, tough, nothing-to-lose number one convict who first gets the attention of everybody in the prison. Harold Perrineau is also great as Lt. Jackson... I must admit this is probably the first time I've noticed this actor and he stood out as well.Overall this movie is great! It brings a very serious topic out to the light, it never disappoints, the cast is great, the script isn't filled with the overused cheesy lines of the sad thing that is an innocent man in prison and other clichés like that, but when a deeper line IS delivered it goes so deep the viewer would easily shed a tear. In a year or two I'd gladly watch it again! In fact I rated it 8/10, but I think it deserves at least a 9...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original prison film that gets better as it progresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is about a family man that gets convicted of a murder, because he chased after a thief in his home and accidentally killed him in self-defense. When he has to get to trial, he basically has no other options but to plead guilty and has to serve a few yrs in prison. Basically 3 yrs and less if he is on good behavior. Now life isn't fair and this movie clearly shows that, by showing the brutal and painful lifestyle of being in prison and how unfair it is even behind bars. Plus the guy is pretty, has no scars, piercings or tattoos so trouble is bound to find him. The rules of prison in order to survive by choosing a side and etc, maybe obvious to some but the way it's portrayed in this movie is actually pretty intriguing. This is a original prison movie and a gripping one at that and also has some excellent characters. I especially like how it portrayed the officers, that even guys that has the badge can be a hypocrite and can go on a power trip. Thus I really disliked the prison guard captain in this, he is a good addition to the story but I had zero compassion or sympathy for him. Especially because he is a huge hypocrite that looks down on and doesn't give a crap about other situations and even makes it worse while throwing a huge hissy fit about his situations. Yeah it's basically human nature, but the way he did things really started to get irritating and really hated his character even if that character added to the progression of the plot. Val Kilmer was great in this as the badass inmate that know about prison politics and Stephen Dorff was pretty good as the convicted family guy. And the pacing of a guy who is hard working and lives with a honest lifestyle, fall and change because of prison is done really good. I really enjoyed how the plot progressed and was glad I took the time to watch this gripping and yet entertaining prison flick. It's a satisfying film and never loses it's edge, in fact it keeps getting better until the credits start rolling.8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Independent Filmmaking with A Great Political Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stephen Dorff and Val Kilmer", the cover read. I immediately thought that Val's most recent release would be more of his direct-to-video trash that glorifies his name and has three or four minutes with him in it. Not so. I gave "Felon" a try and I'm glad I did.Dorff is a family man who one night finds his house has been invaded. Blindly thinking of the safety of his wife and son Dorff chases the intruder outside and kills him, only to find the man in unarmed. Dorff is sent to jail, and is eventually sent to prison. Put in the same cell as a mass murderer (Kilmer) and forced to side with the type of men he probably never would have met outside his new walls, Dorff is also subjected to the cruel rule of the Warden (Harold Perrineau), by making his prisoners battle in "the yard".Very, very glad I rented this. In a more perfect world "Felon" would be nabbing the Oscars while films like "Avatar" would be left in the dust. The dialogue is fantastic, especially the lines given to Val Kilmer and Harold Perrineau's characters. The cinematography wonderfully captures the brutal violence and oppression the prisoners face daily. The direction is superb and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.The acting is all Oscar-worthy. Dorff is incredibly underrated, look to "Shadowboxer" for another example. Harold Perrineau gives a fine performance as the sadistic guard who runs Dorff's yard. Ditto for the other guards, especially an ironic performance by Nick Chinlund, where the same man who played Billy Bedford in Con Air plays the sole sympathetic guard. Sam Shepard and Anne Archer bring their classic ability as well, in equally great performances. But the one that really got me was Val Kilmer in one hell of a role. Totally Oscar-worthy and totally deserving.A great movie. I can't say enough about it. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie not expecting much. I was most surprised in a great way. The acting was wonderful as well as the plot. Val Kilmer was terrific as Wades cellmate John. Wade went to prison because he was a victim of circumstance. He wound up inside a corrupt prison . Wade killed an intruder outside his house and the 'spiraling' began. This film explored the Jekyll and Hyde of most of the characters, including a very rogue corrections officer. The film was interesting from start to finish. This was truly a well written film, by someone that did his homework, understanding prison politics. Treat yourself to this wonderful film. With shades of ' The Last Castle' you wont go wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It delivers just simple and clear message - don't give up, stand till the end for yourself and your family. At first look - seems like nothing new, same old story. But this time creators managed to pack those messages into amazingly short, but still very powerful movie. Plot can seem too fictional for some people, but it's not a big deal for such kind of movie, it does not pretend to be a documentary about life in jail. The "Felon" also lights up the psychological sides of being in jail, being prisoner or guard. But at the same time there are no boring dialogs or narratives. It's realistic, like "Das Experiment".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Val Kilmer and Stephen Dorf are both amazing in this film. I was skeptical at first but the film just grips you and makes appropriate twists that keep you captivated. Despite the twists it still remains very realistic. I'm also amazed that the story did have an abrupt ending, but felt somewhat resolved at the end. The characters were realistic and I really felt for them. I was at the edge of my seat by the last scene. I think there is an underlying message with both the corruption and honesty of the guards, as well as the deceit as well as courage of the inmates. It makes you understand the never ending cycle of the correctional system in the United States and the injustices of it all. Both the guards and inmates succumb to the evils of the system. It is amazing that anyone can keep their sanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film. It played almost like a film for TV with a realism so rarely seen. I knew i would enjoy this film as i always do enjoy this genre (not unlike Oz and Goodfellas) but i really did not expect to be blown away like i was. A truly excellent performance by Dorff who should now see some serious roles come his way, Kilmer who was great and Perineu who was also superb in his role as 'good guy' justifying what is inherently and ironically evil.It bears to everyones soul that life can be taken from you in unjust circumstances and could you deal with that trauma. I certainly felt with Porter throughout and empathised with his transformation. My only gripe was that 'Felon' wasn't long enough and came to a too abrupt ending.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful film that will you have you emotionally involved, drained and white knuckled. A young small business man, Wade Porter(Stephen Dorff), kills an intruder while trying to protect his family. The system is fouled and fails Wade, who is convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to three years inside a maximum security prison. Porter will share a cell with a notorious mass murderer, John Smith(Val Kilmer). Porter will need to make use of any wisdom he can garner from Smith in order to survive. He must deal with vicious prisoners and a sadistic and corrupt head prison guard Lt. Jackson(Harold Perrineau). It will prove that the fit of the fittest is who will survive.You will feel every pounding punch and each stinging rubber bullet. Violence is vicious and ruthless. And that feel of defeat comes oh so close. And being pi**ed is putting it mildly. Also in the cast: Sam Shepard, Marisol Nichols, Anne Archer, Chris Browning and Larnell Stovall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff) is an average guy, successful business, and living with his fiancé and son. One night, a thief enters his house.Porter wakes up,picks up a baseball bat and searches for the intruder. The thief quickly escapes from the house and Porter goes after him. Porter chases the guy outside and the thief seems to be reaching for something, Porter decides to take no risks and hits him with the bat in the head.The thief dies immediately and Porter is arrested for murder because at the time he hit the thief, he no longer represented a threat since he wasn't inside the house.Porter is sent to trial and is forced to accept a deal proposed by the prosecutor being sentenced to three years in prison. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is about the premise, although very interesting, I think its a bit flawed. I have a hard time believing that a jury would convict this man of murder, however, I do not live in America,so I'm speaking with little knowledge and truth be told, stranger things have happen in American courts. Anyway, during the transportation, an incident occurs in the bus and Wade is framed and sent to the maximum security wing under the command of the corrupt Lieutenant Jackson (Harold Perrineau).Inside the prison, Porter has to deal with the repercussions of the incident in the bus,deal with the gangsters, and try to make alliances because no prisoner can make it on his own. Luckily, John Smith (Val Kilmer), a very famous prisoner becomes cell-mates with Porter and teaches him the logistics of prison.As if Porter hasn't enough in his plate,his wife is having trouble paying the bills in the "outside world". Fellon is a terrific film that shows the hard and tough reality of the American prison system. The film is extremely well directed and written and the story couldn't be more engaging. Along the way Porter is faced with some interesting moral dilemmas and there's a lot of character development. Fellon was extremely well acted as well, Stephen Dorff was great as the man who gets his life completely upside down, Val kilmer's performance was a pleasant surprise and Harold Perrineau was outstanding as the sadistic guard Jackson. A very unlikable character and he played the role with perfection. Fellon is a raw, rugged, and realistic prison drama that shouldn't be missed.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this movie supposed to be reveling or something, I don't think that this would happen in real life, or at least they couldn't hold this in secret for a long time. But there was some true facts about prison too. Like when you are in prison, you must fit there or your life may turn in to hell. Sometimes (like in this case) the people who were good citizens get in to jail. So this experience will change them. Beiing surrounded by criminals will not make you a better person. So this is a lesson which this movie and so many other prison flicks gives us. It's not usual prison flick (somehow similar with The Shawshank Redemption), but still if you (like me) love prison movies, you''l like this one too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are occasions in which I find an occult joy in the world of the cinema.Well,Felon is an occult joy.This is an extraordinary movie and,for the moment,it's the best movie of 2008 by my point of view.I cannot understand why this movie was so ignored and it received a straight-to-DVD release while there is so much crap that gets released on cinemas.Felon produced an enormous impact on me on every level.This movie depicts the prison life in a very realistic way and there are some scenes which will stay in my mind for a long time.There are hard scenes but they are completely justified because they help for telling the story.The performances from Val Kilmer,Stephen Dorff and Harold Perrineau are monumental.I have always thought Kilmer is a very underrated actor who would deserve much more recognizing,because his work is always excellent.His performance in here is extraordinary and he can express a lot with his expressions and his dialogs,so we can know very well to his character.Dorff and Perrineau also make a fantastic job because they become on their characters so they never seem to be acting.Felon is a masterpiece which was sadly overshadowed.It's very weird to see a movie which produces a so big impact on the spectator without the necessity of cheap tricks.This is an extraordinary movie which deserves to be seen.This is the best movie of 2008 so far and one of the most underrated movies from this decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the years, there have been many dramas about prison life, Very few have ever been this rugged &amp; raw. It is somewhat similar to the HBO mini-series OZ, that ran for 5 or 6 seasons a few years back.FELON is not OZ, no single film could ever duplicate the energy of OZ.In its own right FELON is a first rate movie,it was very well written &amp; directed by Ric Roman Waugh,who primarily is a stunt coordinator., This is only his second attempt at writing &amp; directing.He has done a first rate job &amp; I for one hope to see more of his work.The plot &amp; story is based on actual happenings at a California prison. Granted it is predictable,BUT aren't most films.The acting is excellent by all.Stephen Dorff is our unlucky guy who gets sent to this rough prison. Its a pleasure watching him perform. Val Kilmer is almost unrecognizable with a beard, BUT as usual he is excellent,as a hardened killer &amp; cell mate. Harold Perrineau,so memorable in OZ, is a nasty, mean head guard, He is one heck of an actor. Anne Archer &amp; Marisol Nichols have the 2 main female roles as the mother-in-law &amp; wife to Stepehn. They are also excellent. Sam Sheppard is featured as well.Here is my GRIPE, granted the budget was under Three Million Dollars.it was no excuse to release this into only a few theatres for a one week run this past July. It is a far better movie than many of the leading box office movies.I felt it was raw, rugged &amp; realistic in is portrait of prison life. It may have not been overly realistic, NEITHER WAS OZ.or Shawshank Redemption for that matter.Others have mentioned the hand-heldcamera work. To m it came across as being very natural. Rent this or watch it on Cable, I doubt you will be sorry you did,.Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 94 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie in regards to such a brutal subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me point out that Val Kilmer is one of my favorite actors. This guy has three belts worth of work and still manages to stay off radar. I don't think I have ever seen a movie where Kilmer was in it that I didn't liked. This guy has true talent and many actors more in the limelight than acting should really take a cue from this guy. This is not intended to leave out other actors that all had done their part to make the movie as good as it is but DAMM IT, I want more Val.With that being said, if you didn't know, this movie is centered around a young family man Porter Dorf) who is takes a manslaughter plea for killing a man for trying to break into his home and then is sent to prison to finish the rest of his sentence. There he meets Smith (Kilmer) who becomes bunk mates and slowly forms a bond with him while showing him the ropes on how to survive while dealing with the harsh realities of corrupt prison guards, gang bangers, and sparing with other inmates in the yard in an ordeal known as 'gladiator school' in an attempt to keep the respectful association of a white supremacist gang that he thinks will protect him.This movie is good from beginning to end which is due in part to the supporting cast, like the eventual stress that consumes Laura Porter (Marisol Nichols) for being a docile female left with the burdens of being a mother and having to fend for herself and son while loosing everything, the stern and mysterious atmosphere held down by Smith (Kilmer), the gross corrupt conduct that's held by Harold Perrineau who plays Lt. Jackson a very evil S.O.B. to the deadly and calm Samson, a notorious Arayan Brotherhood leader played by Chris Browning.This movie has its moments that are beyond the graphic violence and intense hatred that is common in prison movies. It actually shows the mechanics although somewhat that manifest in Prison systems from personal to very personal in a professional setting.If there's one complaint about this movie that I would have is the death of Jackson because he was so unlikeable to me that it would have been nice to see him collapse when facing how all his dirt finally catches up to him. Of course his death was mandatory for other key parts to happen but in my minds eye, it seems that if Jackson's son Todd, survives he will have to face the dishonor and shame that his father has left behind which would be traumatic since Jackson was unbelievably two distinct persons in his personal and professional life. (Sins of the father). But other than that, this movie is a neat little item to grab from the video shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of real details in this movie about prisons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was an inmate in the California prison system, and this movie took me right back to that long bus ride down highway 5 to Corcoran State Prison. Felon is accurate about a lot of things in prison. The gangs,the visits,the inmates,the searches,the yard,the bus to prison,the inside of the bus,the reception center Thats all how it really is. The actors did a pretty good job at being cons, its a tough thing to fake. They did an excellent 100% real good job about the gangs and cliques in this movie, its all real. Excellent movie that i would recommend everyone and anyone to watch to get a good look at the world of prison, and how easy it is to go there. You'll see how it is to have no control and no one to go to for help, how you become nothing but a number and a body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant film. Like Frankenheimer's The Birdman of Alcatraz (1962)this film moves well beyond the issues of prison reform and ponders the many complex facets of human violence.John Smith (Val Kilmer) says something like "Make no mistake. We are all in prison." The film successfully articulates that "this could be you" perspective, but in a much broader sense breaks down the barriers between "inside" and "outside" even as it authentically recreates the "inside." One is left with the feeling that we need to completely rethink the relationship between prison and society -- as well as re-evaluate the function of prisons.Also--Val Kilmer is spectacular; under playing a powerful role. In my book he is one of the best actors of his generation. One is tempted to assume that there must be some problem with his career because he is not making "blockbusters"--but I tend to think that he is consciously choosing to be an actor instead of a movie star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Prison desensitizes you.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/Director Ric Roman Waugh may not have a large number of completed films under his stuntman belt, but if FELON is any indication of the quality of work we can expect from him, it seems he has a solid future. There are many films about prison life and prison breaks that keep coming down the pike, but few of them have the quality of being character studies of how prison affects the minds and lives of both those incarcerated and those on the outside who must deal with the realities both concurrent and future of living in the shadow of ultimate effects of prison experiences. FELON is a strong character-based prison drama. Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff) is a young man on the rise: he is planning to marry the mother Laura (Marisol Nichols) of his child Michael (Vincent Miller), his small business is finally becoming successful, and his family life is happy. One evening Wade's and Laura's sleep is interrupted by an intruder who steals Wade's wallet, then runs out of the house with Wade chasing him with a baseball bat. One hit with the bat the robber is dead. The police arrive and because of the logistics of the timing of the blow to the robber, Wade is arrested for murder. Unsuccessful attempts to explain the situation eventually lead to Wade's being sentenced to prison and he is sent to a prison run by a sadistic Lt. Jackson (Harold Perrineau) with demons of his own. A famous prisoner John Smith (Val Kilmer) is transferred to the prison and becomes cellmates with Wade. The racial violence between prisoners creates rules and gangs and Wade is caught up in the violence that occurs in the daily 'hour in the yard' experiences, until John shares his knowledge of prison logistics and advises Wade in how to avoid critical issues. The prisoners are not only violent among themselves, but they are also the pawns of the brutally evil Lt. Jackson and his crew who appear to delight in the traumas the prisoners create. It is obvious that the good guy/bad guy line is blurred and in order to survive Wade follows John's wise council to an ending that eventually results in some correction of the evils of the prison situation. Survival is the key in the cases of many of the characters, including some of the 'good guards' (Nate Parker, Greg Serano), the steadfast Laura, her mother (a small but well defined role for Annie Archer), and for former guard Gordon (Sam Shepard) a friend of John Smith. Dorff and Kilmer provide very strong characterizations as does Perrineau, but without the fairly large cast of 'fellow prisoners' who set the scenes, their overall performances would be less impressive. It is here that Ric Roman Waugh demonstrates his talent for handling the mixture of physical brutality with the fragility of each individual's mind that makes the film work. It is a tough film to watch but it is solid craftsmanship. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rare case" shown on screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning the end point is that this movie is a story as most of the movies, so don't believe to all but it could be a very hard to believe story from someone in your neighborhood with the description how the hardest organized societies are applying they kind of rules into the prison system and are loving it. So be ready, it could be your case I watched this movie when I was in Brazil and I told to my self, it could be worse(prison experience) only here, in Mexico or in Thailand;-) in comparison to the movie jail.It would make sense to read other reviews here, mostly the "I hate this movie", because they are trying to give another view then just positive feedback. Let's deal with the facts form my perspective: 1. There are rush scenes as in cloverfield etc. but they worked in my point of view very belonging to the purpose and it wasn't just these scenes, there are also "normal ones", so no bothering. 2. Regular family guy gets into a rough jail for a pretty normal behavior in a situation, but s**t happens, so you can just not believe to that and continue watching, it belongs to story 3. He experiences one of the worst societies in prison system and tries to survive 4. It's a rare case(good guy in a prison with the worst criminals, mostly organized and he is adapting to the world good enough to survive the hell not only with criminals but also guards). Word rare is also describing everything what he must undergo, hard to believe but stuff happens 5. What I saw is in most cases truthful, but this doesn't mean that 99% of the prisons are like this in US. If you don't believe, let's watch some National geography(maybe also discovery&#xf04a;) documentary about prison organized crime, as Aryan brotherhood and another. This is happening and thank god that you don't have to face it. 6. This movie I liked for mostly the fact that it was in some points true, see up, and it can put you in a situation where you never were, you don't want to be but the point is how will it in go in your case 7. fights are UFC style so mostly "tiring" to be real, never the less this movie is a HAPPY END, so the fights as they are natural aren't the total impact as you would experience them in reality, most of all the next days looks of your face aren't quite normal after such a beat up. And it is heroic that our hero is a hard cookie and as the story wants it, he will deal with everything, so Hollywood dream is kept also here;-)I gave it 10/10 because it was really touching and it drawn me into this story and mostly, this is a really hell of a good prison movie, which I like;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a prison action film on ... family values?!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best films of the year.Dramatical and brutal action (main incentive for men in movies) ends up with a solid moral statement, Family is the number one priority. I loved the excellent thriller aspect blended with the old-school republican values - hard work and protecting one's family at all costs.Another detail that makes the film so different is that the character is encouraged to accept the change in his soul, instead of forever blaming himself for the monster he became. The pressure and violence he suffered in prison rather stimulated him to treasure the simplistic American dream that caused him to survive.</fullReview>

Life on the inside is nothing like the life he knew.There are no-holds barred in the can; blood and violence; gangs and mayhem - but this facility goes beyond the evils of incarceration.The warden is a sadistic, menacing character (albeit a wrongly cast actor) whose penchant for bloodsports gets the better of him.Imprisoned unfairly and serving out an extended sentence, Dorff befriends a fellow inmate - John Smith (Val Kilmer).Together the two men forge an understanding of life on the inside.This is hard-hitting, riveting entertainment.

		<shortDescription>This movie caught me by surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not gonna lie, I didn't expect too much from this movie. I when I watched it, I couldn't believe how good it was. I mean, in every aspect. From the acting, to the character development, to the directing, to the superb story line and script. This is by far the best role that Stephen Dorff has ever played. He nailed this role down so hard I believe this role was tailor made for him. The character development of his character was amazing and "BELIEVEABLE". I identified with the character on many fronts. Wanting to protect your family and end of in jail because of a kink in our justice system. The adjustment his Character has to make is dramatic, and it is effecting his family and his life in the worse way. And he is unable to explain this to his wife, or anybody who has not been privy to spend sometime in our prison system.Val Kilmer was perfect in his role. His attitude, demeanor, and solitude nature was greatly acted, and his on screen performance was nothing less then charismatic. But one Actor who also did a hell of a job who I have not seen mention on this comments is "Harold Perrineau" who played Lt. Jackson. To really appreciate his performance you would have to have seen him prior, specifically his role in "OZ", which was a HBO series show. His role in that series, and movies that followed was the complete opposite of what you see in Felony. Always the good guy, and the more level headed one when it comes to films. So, obviously I presumed he was going to be a "good guy" here too. Point blank, he was a Bastard. And I was surprised pleasantly on his ability to make the audience resent him. And he was so good at it at a point I forgot I was watching a movie. Because the human element of hate and bitterness of the character was so real, we see it everyday to different degrees in various individuals, maybe even in ourselves to a degree.If your a hard working individual working towards a family or if you already have a family, you are going to be able to place yourself in the shoes of "Wade", and really identify with the storyline as it unravels and the turmoil it puts his family in. Again, Val Kilmer was great, and was an example of a "Wade", in his day when he committed a crime against someone who committed a HEINOUS crime against his family. They really interacted well between each other and the chemistry is definitely felt on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best prison movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I didn't expect much from this movie. There has been a lot of TV-series and movies with the prison theme ever since Shawshank Redemption came out, and not half of them is worth watching.I was in for a big surprise though. The plot is rock-solid, the acting is awesome, and the realism... Let me put it this way: When you watch it you will have a weird feeling in your stomach, the feeling you get when something is not right, when something seems hopeless. This movie really manage to capture the horror that "just an ordinary guy" feel when he's sent to prison with the bad guys. He goes there, thinking that he can sit his time in peace by just staying low and not getting involved with the other inmates. He quickly realize that things are not so simple on the inside as he first thought, and that every day is a fight for survival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't place why I exactly I love Val Kilmer in this film. Possibly because I think he is such a brilliant actor with such a variety of roles to his resume. I loved him in 'Top Secret' - he threw his heart and soul in his performance but similarly was excellent in 'HEAT'.Here his gravitas coupled with silence is a tour de force and this film should have been pushed a lot more in the US than it was - I hope it gets the credit it deserves in the UK when launched here. Kilmer is powerful but subtle and commands your attention at all times.The pace is great, the cinematography subtle but brilliant and the sense of tension is superbly realised. This is the best film I've seen this year, I cannot recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Excellent AND REALISTIC Prison Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply an excellent movie. The acting by everyone involved is excellent and this movie grips you. At first I was sceptical as I thought it was going to be another "innocent guy goes to jail" movie but this movie is so much more than that. The use of a real prison and real prisoners as extras (watch the DVD extras) is immediately apparent and gives this movie a perfect air of west coast prison life possibly never seen before. The feelings of hopelessness, vulnerability and frustration are well portrayed as is the random conscious-less violence. The gang name (Aryan Brotherhood, Crips, Southern/Northern Mexicans) are all real West Coast gangs and the language also is authentic. Someone who was a consultant in this movie definitely did time or worked as a guard at somewhere like San Quienten, Pelican Bay or Chino and the gangsters do for once look like the real deal. Dorff is outstanding and gives probably his strongest performance to date. Kilmer and Perrineau are also excellent.This movie has some harsh themes and won't be suitable for everyone. However it's a prison movie and you only have to look at the cover to know it's not "The Green Mile" and the few people who have given this movie a negative review shouldn't have watched it in the first place knowing this and frankly should feel a bit ashamed for writing bad reviews on a great piece of work simply because it's a subject matter they know nothing about and in truth find very uncomfortable. I don't like chick flicks but I don't come on here talking trash about them I just don't watch them. This movie refreshingly, lacks the Hollywood sheen of many prison flicks and yes there are clichés here but nothing is perfect and it's a movie not a documentary(although the camera style is geared towards this style).I really didn't expect this movie to be anywhere as near as good as it was so all I can say is watch it!</fullReview>

Story is its main weakness with little inspiration but its a gritty and well acted piece which while its certainly no classic its an above average tense, action packed heart breaker.This movie is every persons nightmare without spoilers watch the movie and feel his pain.The underlying theme of protecting your family at all costs will make many people relate to the protagonist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I last saw a "prison movie" so I went to see *Felon* with somewhat high expectations based also on its IMDb rating.I wasn't at all disappointed, actually it exceeded those high expectations that I had before the viewing. Kilmer and Dorff had great chemistry together in this one both portraying quite believable characters despite the somewhat far fetched plot line.Kilmer's physical appearance and voice were a bit shocking at first but it did suit him well for this certain part. It's a bit weird this film wasn't really promoted properly from what I could tell unlike other pieces of garbage this year (that shall remain nameless).The visuals can be somewhat brutal at times but nothing out of the mainstream today, a great film, worthy of a 9 in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie goes beyond film-making. This movie is a window into a world that none of us outside a prison will ever see (hopefully).The story is simply incredible. A strong insight into what goes on beyond the walls of the U.S. prisons, and how the U.S. justice system fails to deliver on all points, surrounding the main character Wade (Stephen Dorff). Stephen Dorff delivers the acting of his career, and Val Kilmer is sublime as always. This is truly a fantastic movie! Harold Perrineau, also known as Michael from the TV series "Lost", plays the bad guy, and he does so in a very convincing way.This movie is truly epic and i think so because the filmmakers have been able to make you feel what the main character, Wade, feels. He goes through the entire emotional spectrum of love, hate, anger, fear and pain.Such a good and intense movie is hard to come by.Hence the 10/10 score.If you're into sublime acting and a thrilling storyline, then go get this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the movie started out with a weak story (first time offender gets thrown into hard core prison) i was amazed how good Steven Dorff acted. But i liked Val Kilmer playing a much more intense role as the semi-psycho lifer that keeps to himself and opens up to the "fish". I had a hard time recognizing him, i first thought it was Jeff Bridges.... (LOL)I found the mother very convincing trying to change her daughter's mind into leaving her husband since he "let her down" and she needs to "move on".I really liked Harold Perrineau as the sadistic prison guard corrupted by power. He played much better than in Lost. Actually i was amazed by the portrayal of his role!Overall this movie lives by the acting, not the story, since this topic has been touched many times and nothing has been done to correct the inhumane treatment in prisons not just in the US...Anyways, i voted 10 for this movie since it left me with a deep feeling of sadness knowing that this might happen to anyone who is in the wrong place at the wrong time....And to the commenters that say this movie's story is that the crime of killing a burglar should go unpunished, i have to say that that's not true. The message is that there must be a punishment that is right for the crime. No one says that killing a burglar should go unpunished, but to sentence a father and husband with no priors to hardcore prison is not right! Probation, or in this case a low security prison for the duration of the sentence would be in order, but not a hardcore prison like the one portrayed in this movie... those should be reserved to hopeless cases that will never again will see freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed by the quality and the storyline of this film.Val Kilmer and Stephen Dorf have done a great job.The story goes as following:An innocent person is imprisoned for a mistake he has done.There he must fight for his everyday survival and face a sadist Jailguard who likes to see prisoners fight each other.Firstly,the storyline is coherent.It has no flaws or exaggerations.Acting as a whole is very good both from the protagonists and from the supporting cast.All of them act like the roles were written specifically for them.Secondly,the action is realistic.Prisoners get hurt,bleed,have feelings and honor.The guards have also their lives and the director gives us a spherical view of each person's character.The main characters are not flat and neutral but have attributes just like real people.To summarize,this is a great prison film.It mixes social issues along with action features,love and personal endurance.It is a film that anybody can watch not only to amuse hiself but also to acquire some knowledge of what is happening in prisons.Congratulations to Val Kilmer,Stephen Dorf and the director Ric Roman Waugh.</fullReview>

It's so simple that if you think about it everything that happens just can happen in normal life. An unlucky guy gets into prison, he has hard time with ongoings in there. And of course we've got some sort of crazy cop. His family is also having bad time, they run out of money etc.The director keeps it simple, uses influence of reality of the prison that movie is shot, doesn't delve into characters of event so much but puts on thing after another and keeps us up and watching.Just good film making, you won't regret it if you watch.

		<fullReview>Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff) is a loving family man, who's always does his best to support his caring wife Laura (Marisol Nichols) and their son. But when one night, Wade accidentally killed an burglar... who broke into his home. Wade finds himself convinced of involuntary manslaughter and sent to prison for three years or 18 months for good behavior. Wade finds out that Prison Life is difficult and he has to do anything to survived.Written and Directed by Ric Roman Waugh made an sharp drama with moments of brutality, truth and occasionally funny as well. Dorff, who also served as executive producer. He gives the best performance so far to date. Which for once, Dorff got to play an very human if flawed character. One of the best things about "Felon" is Val Kilmer's terrific performance as John Smith. He teachers the character of Wade how to survived in Prison. "Felon" also offers an change of pace role for actor:Harold Perrineau in a meaty role as a Corrupted Lt. Prison Guard. Although at times, it feels like Perrineau was doing his best Lou Gossett Jr. impression in his performance. There's nice supporting performances by Nichols and Sam Shepard.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an interesting if short behind the scenes featurette. I would have loved to hear an running commentary track by the filmmakers or the actors of the film. Which the cast and crew given their 110% into this very good film. Originally "Felon" was made an Direct to DVD project but it was an smart thing that Sony given this film an limited release before it was released on DVD for critics and audiences to see. The film critics have given "Felon" mixed reviews but there were many critics enjoyed the performances especially by Kilmer in a difficult role. "Felon" is certainly a must-see and the audiences will find themselves rooting for the lead character and Kilmer's role. Don't miss it. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The prison system doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is another movie attempts to show people why prisons don't work and why 85% of inmates return sooner or later to it. It doesn't concern itself with statistics, though, not until the end, which seems grafted onto a perfectly good film just to keep spectators at ease. I would have marked it with 8 if my wife wouldn't have insisted it deserves more.Bottom line, a perfectly average Joe goes to prison on a technicality, quickly gets caught up in the gang-cop war and has to endure homicidal inmates and sadistic guards. Not only the prison system does not fix his life in any way, it messes it up completely and changes his soul. The ending is a not-totally-unhappy one, because one can hardly call it happy, but feels fake. Just like those hero movies when you know the good guy would not stand a chance if anything at all would go a little wrong and the screenwriter would not be on his side, you feel it in your gut that this story would and could not end so well.Maybe in this whole thing lies the tragedy. Alas, it is an irony not many of the viewers will see. Val Kilmer does a great role. He and the story are the strengths of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...movie managed to get myself registered here and write a comment.This movie did to me, what anything that can be called a movie should do: it moved me. It do not really get why it keeps being compared to Shawshank Redemption and the likes, because the only link being the setting does not allow for that. In my opinion, since the story is about survival, comparisons to Cast Away etc. would be more appropriate; the individual accustomed to a certain kind of living has to adapt to completely new surroundings, shape himself into another being entirely in order to cope, and abandon his understanding about the state of order while trying to accept the new state he is being thrown into. In other words, like Dorff's character is saying, "this place is twisted".Hence, the story that unfolds not only shows us character development in the new-to-the-system guy played by Dorff, but also in the "seen that, done that" Kilmer-character, who can be emotionally touched by his new-made friend and cell-mate, eventually finding a way to fill out that blank tattoo spot on his arm.I can't find any flaw in the direction, acting or storytelling. For those who wrote that at some points the low-budget-factor shone through: i didn't detect it. I was very impressed with Kilmer's performance, also Perrineaus, and Sam Shephard playing Gordon. That scene near to the end of the film when Gordon visits Porter and they reminiscence about Kilmers character was awesome.The only negative thing i have to say is that by my impression this movie got far too little screenings in the US, since half of the comments here seem to come from other countries. That is undeserved, to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really speaks to me, not because the main character is the innocent man but because it shows you how one's life changes overnight, how people face the life in prison, adapt their new life and how people on the outside world are unaware of that. This movie also reveals the relation of a Cop and a Con and the tension between them. An excellent preview of prison life, makes everyone realize that how Things go completely wrong . This movie in spite of being low budget contains some serious acting and motivational story, it also gives a great insight of reasons behind the crimes from accidental to intentional vengeance and also how responsibility haunts one into going insane. It teaches the value of Family and believing in them. An incredible movie ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally Stephen Dorff gets a good role in a good movie and proves he has serious actor chops. Congratulations to him for hopefully firing his old manager and getting someone who can really represent his talent. Val Kilmer also shines bright, we knew he could act already but his manager seemed to sign him up for some real talent hiding turkeys so congratulations to Val too for getting it so very very right for this movie.This movie is powerful and compelling, its a dark story, violent and tough, but director/writer Ric Roman Waugh has painted it richly with many shades, characters are believable, and have motivation for their actions, and there are consequences.This is a well thought out well acted and well realized story made all the more striking because it makes sense. The bad guys are bad, but they're bad for a reason, and in any other movie Waugh wouldn't have to give them that depth of character, but it is to his writing credit he does and to his directing credit that his cast render those details so accurately and believably.Also of note Harold Perrineau steps away from his role in Lost and paints another dark character of conflicted emotions, an Marisol Nichols does more than look pretty in her role as torn wife trapped in Dorff's spiraling waking nightmare situation.In fact every character and actor does a top job in this movie. The hardened criminals are mostly real ex cons and do a good job of scaring the sh!ts out of you.Top work everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really kept me entertained from start to finish, despite being labeled only as a drama, as it was very intense and even action packed enough to keep you action-lovers out there pleased I would say. The emotional part of this film, on the other hand, was even better, it really gets through to you, as what happens is really nothing out of the ordinary (unless you have worked at a prison or are a lawyer I guess); and the message it delivers at the end is very interesting as well.And as of the more technical part of the movie: it had very good acting in my book; the script was quite clear and made sense throughout the whole film; and the camera work I found a bit cheesy at times, but it was still better than average in my opinion.Overall I would say that this movie is one of the better prison movies out there, certainly not of the caliber of the Shawnshank Redemption in all its aspects, but the feeling it transmits sure is.</fullReview>

Never mind the violence, it is a true and wise educational type of movie, I really think so, because it tells the very deep and certain truth about who we are deep down underneath, most sophisticated animals with various advanced instinct that come out in time of need and how different yet similar from one another can we be.</fullReview>

Steven Dorff plays in his finest role to date as a man who, in the process of protecting his family, is torn from them and himself.This film brings to light a side of society that none too many are familiar with: The United States penal system and its subhuman politics of both inmate, and prison employee.The suspense will entrance you, the violence will shock you, and the realism will hopefully bring to light that this story unfolds in our country on a daily basis. Everyday honest, hardworking men and women are forcefully turned into animals in a system that is not meant to rehabilitate, but to break you down.This film is, without a doubt, one of the most gripping and tragic tales that i have had the honor of experiencing, and i hope that it sheds light for the viewer more than it entertains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the only movie that has moved my heart in recent years. I accidentally saw this great movie on HBO. It was almost two in the morning and I was going to bed. Just before I went to sleep, I wanted to see what's on TV. The movie had started for about 20 minutes. I saw Val Kilmer who is one of my most favorite actor, and I decided to check it out for a few more minutes, but I couldn't stop watching. My eyes were full of tears, and my emotion was overwhelmed when I saw this movie for the first time.I just couldn't bear to switch it off. I kept watching, till it is over at around three thirty, and I was aware of my flight at eight in the morning. Thank god it was on HBO, so there wasn't any commercial.I'm holding a master in law degree, and I've seen the inside of a Taiwanese prison for 4 months, I had the chance to talk to many prisoners, and to see what's their lives really like. God, the movie is realistic; Due to the cultural differences, and different ways to run a prison in Taiwan, there are discrepancies in the minute details of prison life between two countries. However, prisons in all countries face similar problems. The director did a great job trying to show the kind of danger, fear and challenge, a prisoner faces in the cage: just to mention a few: corrupt prison guards (most of the time, including the warden), violent prisoner (because many of them doesn't have a future). How wealthy or influential prisoners get to be treated much better than the rest of the prison population.The one thing the director didn't quite get it, is to show how difficult it is for Wade to tell or show Laura the difficulties he faces in Prison. Director should show it is difficult for prisoners to communicate with the out side world, even with their own families. The guards would tap the phone, listening in their conversation, watch over their shoulders, use surveillance camera to spy on prisoners, just to make sure the prisoners don't talk about guards' misbehaviors and bad things happened in the prison(like guards selling electronics, drugs, or even woman. You name it, you can get it.). Some guards practically run a gang inside the prison; or if a prisoner gets beaten down, the guards would also make sure this doesn't leak out to their family members and friends. What happens in prison, stays in prison. Let's not forget, the guards check on every mail a prison sent out. The director should show more about Wade's shame, as a man, our society expect us to be the leader of a family, so he doesn't want to talk about things happening to him.I love Val Kilmer, he is one of my favorite actor. I love most of this work, the Sulton Sea, the Heat. A great actor builds solid characters on vivid foundation. It's a shame not to see him and his great work on the big screen more often. Let me also mention, the music was beautiful and punctual.More often than people in the judicial system would ever admit; people who don't deserve prison term, get locked up all the time (just like Porter). Prison is a place to teach its visitors lessons: for criminals, it's time to make connections with others or learn new trade craft. For people with a good heart (conscience), it's time to reflect and grow to make them stronger, wiser (like John). However, prison, for the most of time, eats away the goodness in you, gradually and consistently until it gets the best of you, and breaks you if your mind is not strong enough. The most important lesson a prison can teach you is at the end of the movie: "Prison desensitizes you, but it also forces you to see what's the most important: Family and loyalty because a con like you knows, neither exists in this place."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skewed morals outweigh quality of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't agree more with comments made by ValerinAmberz. Why are all the negative comments hidden away on the last page? This film has double standards, all the key characters are given multiple dimensions except one. The burglar hadn't physically harmed anyone, and was no longer a threat. Maybe he was protecting his family against a similarly cruel set of circumstances that led Val Kilmer to kill 16 people. On the one hand Felon paints a refreshingly rounded portrait of the villain of the piece, the prison officer. His extreme actions are the result of his life's troubles and pressures and the fact that society is happy to turn a blind eye to prison brutality as long as felons are kept hidden from view.In this way we are shown cause and effect, how everything comes full circle, no-one is born with original sin, there is no such thing as black and white. It isn't afraid to tackle the realities of the human condition. This reminded me of The Wire's nuanced approach to those who would usually be depicted as irredeemable.However on the other hand we are told that burglars are irredeemable and if you kill one, even one who's running away, then that should go unpunished. It doesn't fit. I'm confused by the message Felon is trying to convey. Either the moral of the story is that we should acknowledge that people are products of their environment, or we should assume that people who do bad things are born bad and deserve the ultimate punishment. It can't have it both ways.</fullReview>

Even Val couldn't save it (he was barely recognizable behind that bushy beard). I did enjoy the jekyll/hyde personality of the guard, though.I don't know what could have been done to make it a better movie. Certainly, a better soundtrack was in order.

		<fullReview>I cannot understand the fuss being made about this film.It starts well enough making you very empathetic towards the lead character Wade Porter who reacts to a situation in the way we all like to think we would. The system then takes control of things and his life is changed forever.There are some strong performances here, Stephen Dorf and Marisol Nichols cannot be faulted but they are not working with much to be honest.The storyline stretches the imagination a little too far and our naive and scared newbie to the system suddenly becomes a world beater and face to be reckoned with overnight. The final scenes seemed rushed to me, no real build up to breaking the system, just a sudden suggestion that if made earlier could have saved us all from wasting a fair amount of time. The marks I've given this film are just for the film, as I said the performances from the main roles was good including Perrineau who I liked in Oz too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm writing this because I was so offended by how many times the F word was used in this movie. I didn't count them, because I stopped watching, but I'm sure it must have been a couple of hundred. At one point, there was one in 5 straight sentences. It seemed this was the only way the actors could express themselves. Bad language maybe considered realistic, but on the other hand hitting a person once with a baseball bat causing blood to explode out of a person's head isn't realistic. People getting punched in the face 6-8 times don't recover with minimal scarring the very next day. As far as the movie is concerned, I found it quite moving. As I mentioned, I did not watch the entire movie, but there were some very interesting dynamics. I wonder if the prison guards are really this sadistic. Stomping on a prisoner's face several times because he was called a "nigger". Provoking fights. Taunting inmates.</fullReview>

I have yet to see a Prison Movie really tell it like it is, And unfortunately I probably never will.If the people believe this is how it really is then I bet they still believe in Santa to.</fullReview>
