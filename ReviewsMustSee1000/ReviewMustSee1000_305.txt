		<shortDescription>De Niro And Crystal Are Good. Yes...Yes They ARE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal square off in `Analyze This,' a satirical look at `family' life from director Harold Ramis. After witnessing a hit on a colleague outside a restaurant (and narrowly escaping the same fate himself, thanks to the need of a toothpick), mob boss Paul Vitti (De Niro) finds himself overcome with panic attacks. He sweats, cries at the drop of a hat, and can't breathe. With a vital meeting only two weeks away, he realizes he needs help, quickly, and sends one of his men, Jelly (Joe Viterelli), in search of a `shrink.' Coincidentally, Jelly has just been rear-ended in traffic by Dr. Ben Sobol (Crystal), who just happens to be a psychiatrist. And Jelly has his business card. Unable to discourage the adamant Vitti, Sobol acquiesces and agrees to treat him exclusively for two weeks, though he is less than enthusiastic about being pressed into the service of a well-known criminal; even less enthused, however, is his fiancee, Laura (Lisa Kudrow). The ensuing repartee between Vitti and Sobol, served up with snappy dialogue and impeccable timing, takes this comedy, artistically and otherwise, to the highest level. De Niro and Crystal are absolutely outstanding, infusing their characters with every possible nuance, while successfully avoiding the stereotypes that lesser actors may have relied upon here. The two play so well off of one another that the humor virtually seems to explode spontaneously. All the while, the likable Kudrow more than holds her own with her co-stars, proving, unequivocally, that there is so much more to her than just being a great `Friend.' Credit must go to Ramis, as well, for keeping things on an even keel throughout. There's funny scenes aplenty in this film, especially the ones in which the loyal but somewhat thick-headed thug, Jelly, or the winsome Laura take part. The most memorable, though, is one in which Dr. Sobol dreams that he is Don Vito Corleone in the movie `The Godfather,' when he is shot while buying some fruit. This is parody at its finest. Written by Ramis, Ken Lonergan and Peter Tolan, and with a supporting cast that includes Chazz Palminteri (Primo), Richard C. Castellano (Jimmy), Kyle Sabihy (Ben's son, Michael) , Molly Shannon (Caroline) and Elizabeth Bracco (Marie Vitti), `Analyze This' will keep you laughing and `doing lines' (`You...you're good, yes, you are...yes, you are!') long after the credits have faded from the screen. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not 'Hilarious,' But Still Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't "hilarious" as everyone told me it was, but it was still very enjoyable and pretty solid entertainment. Although a comedy, it has violence and a lot of profanity.Robert De Niro, as usual, is excellent and once again surprises viewers with his comedic talent. He plays a mobster (familiar territory) but one who needs psychiatric help. He's hilarious when he's crying! His "shrink" is played by Billy Crystal, in an untypical low-key character role. My favorite in this film was Joe Viterelli, the fat guy-mobster who has a few very funny lines. Viterelli is one of these guys you see in a ton of gangster movies and is always interesting.The female lead in here, Lisa Kudrow ("Laura") was not appealing to me, character-wise. Overall, a funny movie and much better than the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal form the perfect shtick. *** out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ANALYZE THIS / (1999) ***  It has been a long time since I have seen a comic duo form a better shtick than Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal in the mob comedy "Analyze This," a smart, amusing satire from director Harold Ramis ("Multiplicity," "Groundhog Day"). For a movie like this to succeed past a commercial level, chemistry between the main characters must be amiable and spirited. Crystal and DeNiro indeed mold amiable incentive between themselves, therefore quite a few hilarious moments emerge from their perception of the well-written script by Kenneth Lonergan, Peter Tolan, and Ramis himself.  "Analyze This" details the lives of two very different individuals. The first person is played by Billy Crystal, a calm, cool, and collected psychiatrist named Ben Sobol, who is divorced with a young teenage son and is engaged to soon wed a resigning TV reporter named Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow). Ben is currently dealing with a emotional patient (Molly Shannon) distressed because her spouse left and filed a restraining order on her. This woman's problems will seem like nothing when Ben obtains his new client.  Robert DeNiro plays the second person this movie examines, the most powerful mobster in the city of New York, Paul Vitti. He and his accomplices, including a chubby and clumsy bodyguard named Jelly (Joe Viterelli), are in the process of significant business when Vitti experiences an anxiety attack. On the road to a nervous breakdown, this emotionally vulnerable man comes to Ben after Jelly briefly encounters the therapist during a minor car accident. Ben is very nervous with his new patient, who forces compliments and demands upon him.  The first confrontation sequence between Ben and Paul is quite engaging. There is an instant odd couple chemistry among the two characters. The witty sessions Sobol and Vitti consummate are also very imaginative and smart. The scenes also have the intelligence to take Vitti's emotional problems seriously. The setup accurately introduces both the gangsters and the psychiatrist's family. We understand the mob boss's feelings of stress and depression; this picture is not all shallow slapstick comedy, there is a dimensional human touch. The film takes its conflicts seriously, but executes them in a cute humorous style. The audience can also relate to Billy Crystal's character, who is an average Joe with a typical American family in a complicated situation in which he is not entirely sure how to handle.Both external and internal conflicts are interestingly accomplished, well structured, presented, and written. The film does a good job of convincingly bringing the world of mobsters to life with well-cast actors and their rich, stylish accents. Paul Vitti's sexual life needed more exploration; although his adulterous intentions do induce a few laughs, the story could have gone somewhere with his infidelity. Vitti's family is also irresolute. The film almost never portrays them on screen and seldom does Paul himself discuss his children and wife. The Lisa Kudrow character is furthermore underwritten, never thoroughly examined and very shallow. The lack of chemistry amid Kudrow and Crystal leads to the unconvincing relationship Ben occupies.  Robert DeNiro is the perfect option for the comic role of Paul Vitti, who is a more difficult character than it may appear. DeNiro triggers a sharp comic edge and gives the right amount of exaggerated sentimentality to Vitti. Lisa Kudrow is fun to watch, producing a dim-minded character whimsically similar to the one in her hit TV sitcom "Friends." Chazz Palminteri and Joe Viterelli contribute different but energetic supporting roles.  "Analyze This" is unmistakably the right kind of movie for Billy Crystal. I am unaware of another Hollywood comedian who could have conquered his role with more proficiency and mirth; he is one of the main components that makes "Analyze This" work well. Harold Ramis's comedy obviously borrows ideas from past comparable films like "Grosse Point Blank" and "Mafia," but as this production proves, just because it was done before doesn't mean it cannot be successfully accomplished again with the right casting.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent comedy, excellent cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The charm of this movie is in the concept and perfect casting. Robert De Niro satirizes his past performances as a Mafia boss. And Billy Crystal as the unwitting psychiatrist who gets involved in the mess. It's truly funny and entertaining. The movie mostly benefits from very good direction by Harold Ramis and excellent performance by the actors and not just De Niro and Crystal. The verdict: 4 of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I found "Analyze This" a very amusing comedy, well worth seeing. There are a number of laugh-out-loud lines, a screamingly funny parody of "The Godfather", and a well-chosen cast that's very funny. Movie is also very well photographed, and is never boring for an instant.Some minor objections, though:(1) Robert DeNiro was funny and believable - except for his crying scenes. These scenes came across as somewhat forced.(2) Forgotten subplots. There are a couple of subplots - one with Crystal's relationship with his father, encounters with some FBI agents - that are started up, and then dropped and forgotten about. I strongly suspect this version we saw was cut from on originally longer print.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Comedy Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analyze this is a fine movie, with a great cast of likable characters and an interesting storyline. Billy Crystal plays Ben Sobel a psycho-therapist who practises in the shadow of his brilliant father, and is due to marry the woman of his dreams (Lisa Kudrow). Robert De Niro plays Paul Vitti, a mafia crime boss who is struggling with his emotions and his libido. This satirical slant on the classic mobster movies is excellently played out by Crystal and De Niro, who form a formidable comedy duo, with plenty of laughs.Rated 15 'Analyze This' doesn't shy away from profanity and violence, ensuring that it fits into the mobster theme seamlessly, delivering us a highly enjoyable movie without offending fans of the mobster genre.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nobody helps Paul Vitti"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A complete comedy farce. Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal are both great fun and so is Joe Viterelli as De Niro's hilarious security guard Jelly. It is amusing. Nothing is wrong with the film accept its language. No one should complain about its content. Its content is meant to be funny. When mobster Paul Vitti(De Niro) is suffering anxiety attacks for some odd reason, he sees a shrink named Ben Sobel(Crystal) to solve his tragedys and ways to move through the mob. The idea is small and it stretches out too far but its still great fun. To me this is De Niro's best comic performance of all. The most hilarious part in the film has to be where Crystal is in the church getting hugged by a stranger. An 8.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Don's Analyst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Niro has one of the best faces in Hollywood. And by that, I mean that a simple facial contortion can send the audience into a fit of laughter, or send a chill down their spine. In "Taxi Driver," his devilish, wide-toothed smile portrayed a sense of fascination and pleasure -- his character was being bombarded with images that made him feel happy, and almost hysterical, in a strange sort of way. When he stared into that mirror and asked whom we were talkin' to, he smiled because he was sick and liked the idea of having the control, and enjoyed picturing the end result.In "Analyze This," when he stares at Billy Crystal with his iconic "Who you talkin' to?" glare, it is not out of pleasure, but out of sheer amazement. In short, he is asking everyone in the room (and the audience) if he's the only one who's seeing what's going on, and the complete absurdity of it all. Watching De Niro's face in "Analyze This," and listening to the accompanying comical speeches, is the pure pleasure of the film. He steals the show.Paul Vitti (De Niro) is having problems. Lately he has been unable to work up enough will power to kill hostages, gain an erection, and has been found crying for forty minutes after watching bittersweet commercials on television. Normally this might be considered normal (for the most part, at least), but the problem is that Vitti is a Mob Boss in New York City, meaning that if he can't muster up enough strength to carry out his duties, word of his weaknesses will travel, and he'll soon find himself sleeping with the fishes.Ben Sobel (Crystal) is a frustrated, failing psychologist trying to raise a son on his own, and keep a relationship with his girlfriend (Lisa Kudrow) from falling apart. When he smashes into the back of Vitti's car, the Mafia kingpin's right-hand-man, Jelly (the late Joe Viterelli), asks him to help out his employer.Sobel is of course quite reluctant to begin practice on New York's most infamous Mafia figure, but reluctantly does so after being threatened. ("You know who I am?" "Yes." "No you don't." "No I don't." "Have you read about me in the papers?" "Yes." "No you haven't." "I don't even get the paper.")Meanwhile, a reunion of all the powerful Mafia figures in New York looms ominously nearer, and Sobel finds himself being targeted by the FBI, as well as professional hit men who find themselves being thrown out of hotel windows by Vitti. "Let me guess, he just jumped?" Sobel asks. Vitti is eager to use this as an explanation for the incident."Analyze This" is directed by Harold Ramis, the man who crafted "Groundhog Day" with Bill Murray, and who also played Murray's best friend in Ivan Reitman's "Stripes" (1981), about two idiots who join the Army in search of women and quick cash. Here, in what is literally one of his roughest and filthiest films, Ramis is able to poke fun at all the most iconic stereotypes of Italian-American Mafia figures. There's even a great dream sequence that mimics "The Godfather," in which Sobel wanders towards a fruit stand to buy some oranges, and finds himself assassinated by two hit men, with De Niro doing his best impersonation of cry-baby Fredo. Later, when recounting his story to Vitti in a church, the Mafia kingpin asks him, "I was Fredo? I don't think so." You will find yourself appreciating much more of "Analyze This" if you are familiar with its content. It may not be labeled as such, but in its essence it is a spoof of the last century's best gangster films, borrowing its plot from "The Don's Analyst" and benefiting from a wonderfully surprising (and humorous) performance by De Niro, who stretched his funny bones with Martin Scorsese's "The King of Comedy" and Neil Jordan's "We're No Angels," but masters the feat of effective facial features here. It does indeed help to know a bit about Mafia movies before you see "Analyze This," but even if you don't, you're still guaranteed to have a fun time.4/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsAnalyze This is not one of the best comedies ever,but it's certainly one of the best,inventive and most original in a long while.The script and comic timing are an ingenius success,and it's also intelligently compact,giving it little room to become ponderous and repetitive.Veteran gangster stars Chazz Palmenteri and Robert DeNiro gleefully lampoon their nasty gangster roles,to both chilling and uproarously funny effect.In the scenes where his charecter cries,DeNiro manages to stir up the emotions,but because he and his henchmen have such repulsive attitudes towards everyone,it's hard to like them,a detrimental thing in a comedy.The Italian-American's chemistry with co star Billy Crystal probably was'nt the most inspired or clever ever ,and Lisa Kudrow,not an overly talented performer anyway,is unintentionally wasted here in a mostly pointless role,and,like DeNiro,her relationship with Crystal is'nt the easiest to digest.Despite these minor hiccups however,AT is a hugely superior comic success ,with moments of absolute laugh out loud hilarity,and moments to touch the heart.Very impressive.****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even know where to start. I don't want to tell you much about this film because I don't want to spoil it for you by giving you account of the funny scenes. Moreover, that would be quite impossible anyway as the film is simply funny all the way through. Sure I have my favourite scenes, one in particular, which make me laugh just thinking about them. Seriously, this is a comedy with a great story and many laughs. As a matter of fact, I really laughed all the way through, from start to finish.I want to recommend you to lighten up and simply relax when you decide to watch it. Let go of any expectations or judgements. Simply watch and let the movie entertain you. It might seem as an obvious thing to do but it is easy to slip into that judgemental and critical feeling however subtle it might be, which will spoil any movie for you not just this one.I highly recommend this movie if you want to lift you spirit up for whatever reason as this movie will do it for you. It is my favourite and I do hope that it will be your favourite too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro is a natural.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old Bobby De Niro strolls through this film with a role he seems so comfortable with. It must surely be one of his funniest performances (ranks up there with Midnight Run), &amp; Billy Crystal provides a cringe worthy 'tough guy' parody later on in the film. You can't help but snigger and snort at some of the dialogue which is delivered effortlessly with perfect comic timing. If you got a bad case of the blues this is certainly a film to watch. I nearly choked on my custard doughnut when De Niro's tough guy character attempts to communicate in 'Psycho Babble'. The plot revolves around counselling a 'made' mafia guy and helping him to get in touch with his true inner self leads to some hilarious and ludicrous scenes. De Niro's sidekick 'Jelly' played by Joe Viterelli, comes out with some great one liners and Lisa Kudrow doesn't do too badly out of the whole affair either playing the stable well adjusted wife to be to a tee.</fullReview>

One of the best is Dr. Sobel's line when he walks into his home and sees the FBI he says,"...obsessive compulsive disorder?" and they say "Organized Crime Division!" Perfect. It shows how Dr. Sobel is so "outside" the entire context of the lifestyle of his patient. The most telling line is when he says..."What is my job here...to make you a well-adjusted criminal?" Well done film. Has more meaning than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Midnight Run but very enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Niro is mostly known for his dramatic roles and plays them very well, but he is also a very exceptional comedic actor. I first saw him play comedy in Midnight Run and was blown away. Who knew he could be funny playing an absolutely miserable person. Analyze This is not the better movie of the two but De Niro once again proves that he can hold his own against an actual comedian, Billy Crystal. It was a stroke of genius to give Crystal the straight part.The plot is not very original. Gangsters have always been the target of parody and in some cases gangster pictures are parody. James Cagney always played his gangster roles with some comedic touches. In Analyze this De Niro has to overcome anxiety attacks or panic attacks which he absolutely denies having. In comes Billy Crystal to help him. Actually, De Niro more or less forces him, without so much as laying a hand on him. The plot isn't really that important in a movie like this. It helps if you have seen De Niro in a straight gangster role first and then you can really see what's so funny about this movie.Like many comedies it has an abundance of stereotypes, most of which are dimwitted gangsters. It can get rather tiresome but when De Niro is on you forget about it. Therefore I will say that this average movie gets an extra point because of De Niro's performance.</fullReview>

Jeanna Elfman has less to do as Crystal's fiance, but she makes her character interesting anyway. Chazz Palminteri and Joe Vitirelli also contribute some great supporting roles. The best part of the movie is the scene where Crystal goes to a mob meeting. Like the rest of the movie, the scene is so goofy that we expect it to cross the line into an Airplane-style spoof, but it somehow holds together, and creates some explosive laughs.

But it is DeNiro that steals the spotlight and brilliantly plays a "slightly unlearned" Mob boss that becomes both impressed and disturbed by the psychotherapy analysis' of his life. The only movie that Cysrtal has been in that is better is arguably "when Harry met Sally".The acting is superb and the writing is smart. The dialogue appeals to the artsy smartsy crowd, while also reaching those that are less interested with intellectual stimulation. "Analyse this" is a must see film that I dare say is better than the title or commercials suggest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies of all time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There's Something About Mary," "BASEketBALL," "The Nutty Professor," and "Austin Powers." All of these movies were warm-ups for one of the funniest movies of all time that is released on March 5th, "Aanalyze This." This is the ultimate mobster parody that pokes fun at the gangster dramas. And nobody could make fun of themselves better than Robert De Niro.This is the first time since the brilliant "Midnight Run" that De Niro has been hilarious. De Niro shows the viewer that he can be just as funny as he is serious. And even Billy Crystal is funny (his first time since "When Harry Met Sally.."). The two leads, with great directing by Harold Ramis ("Vacation," "Caddyshack," &amp; "Groundhog Day"), and a wonderful supporting cast, make "Ananlyze This" one of the best movies of the year. And with the anticapted "Star Wars: Phantom Menace" &amp; "Wild Wild West" yet to be seen, "Analyze This" will definitely be remembered at the end of the year. This movie along with "A Fish Called Wanda," "Life Of Brian," "The Producers," "Young Frankenstein," "The Naked Gun," "Airplane," &amp; "This is Spinal Tap" is one of the funniest movies of all time! Treat yourself, go see it!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Sopranos" Meets "What About Bob?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was watching this movie that's the first thing that came to me. Here we have mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert Deniro) who has to see psychiatrist Dr. Sobel (Billy Crystal) to be treated for panic attacks, and he then becomes so dependent that he follows Sobel everywhere, even interrupting (twice) Sobel's marriage to Laura (Lisa Kudrow). So what we have is essentially a "Sopranos" - "What About Bob?" hybrid, with a dose of "The Godfather" thrown in for good measure. (I'm not saying that this movie copied "The Sopranos." I realize they were in production at the same time. Just that the story is essentially the same.)Not that this is a bad movie. Crystal and Deniro are good (although Crystal as Dr. Sobel doesn't strike me as a particularly good psychiatrist.) In general, the movie is mildly amusing and reaches the heights of hilarious when Sobel is "drafted" to represent Vitti at a meeting of mob bosses.Overall this isn't spectacular, but I would say it's above average.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance ruined by Lisa Kudrow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Analyze This", Billy Crystal once again proves his comedic wit, but it's another actor formally known for his dramatic roles, that makes the bigger splash: Robert De Niro!Before this, the mere idea of De Niro playing comedy could have been laughable. His strikingly dramatic screen presence as mob bosses, criminals and other dangerous men had been pounded into America culture. These two guys (De Niro &amp; Crystal) look great in the screen and the movie is worth because of this amazing couple. The only thing that looks odd in this film is Lisa Kudrow's acting. I really wondered who cast Lisa Kudrow in this? Her part is small but is clearly visible that she can't manage to be interesting and amusing till the end. I believe any other actress could have done a better job than good old Phoebe... Perhaps it's because she had to deal working with this two marvelous actors, but the boy that plays Crystal's son had no trouble with that and did a wonderful work. "Analyze This" is simply an enjoyable comedy that first explored a fantastic actor's comedic side, and provides yet another Crystal success.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Analyze This" is a film that used to be very famous in my country, and it has never really caught my attention before I found out what therapy was about. Last night I gave it a chance, and I must say I enjoyed it. De Niro performs a mafia leader whose life isn't complete, due to the emotional problems he's been facing. After going to some sessions, this guy, Paul Vitty, realizes that he feels guilty for the death of his father, and that's what makes he gets better and leave the criminal organization. The discovering scene is very powerful, and I really congratulate De Niro for that performance. Lisa Kudrow, on the other hand, even thought she's a lot of fun in "Friends", in here, her character is just useless and out of context; I just don't get her character or her acting in this. Also, this movie is never meant to be taken seriously, so don't expect it to be a smart comedy-- actually it's a little corny-- and you'll be able to have a GOOD time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Analyze. Just Laugh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analyze This (1999): Dir: Harold Ramis / Cast: Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, Joe Viterelli, Chazz Palminteri: Hilarious comedy about problems too big for one person. This is a parody of the roles that Robert De Niro is accustomed too. He plays a gangster seeking professional help and Billy Crystal plays a psychiatrist who unwillingly puts his wedding on hold to assist him. Structure is handled in sitcom fashion with De Niro interrupting Crystal's life at any opportunity. Director Harold Ramis satires the gangster genre and skillfully breaks tension in conclusion. Ramis is known as a director of lewd comedies. Among his best is Caddyshack and National Lampoon's Vacation. De Niro is hilarious as he is reduced to tears over a hidden trauma overwhelming him. Crystal is great as the frustrated psychiatrist juggling his job and his personal life. One of the film's pleasures is how the conclusion is handled. Joe Viterelli as De Niro's loyal bodyguard steals moments especially when Crystal takes control and enters a potential dangerous yet funny situation. The weak link here is Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's bride who is more or less a prop. Chazz Palminteri is cast because obviously Joe Pesci wasn't available. Through De Niro we learn that there is a breaking point to everyone. Through Crystal we learn that we can make a positive impact just by giving our time. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

This movie is funny and very well photographed and is never boring. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. There are also many minor characters who just seem to exist in this world. It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of thrills and action. But it is a true gem in which the only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the desperately needy relationship between the characters. Rent it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1957, there was a big mob boss meeting to split up the country. It was broken up by the Feds. There was never another meeting until now. There is a big bosses' meeting for the survival of the mob coming up. Boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is in a mob war but his anxiety attacks prevent him from inflicting violence. Psychiatrist Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal) is tired of his patients' petty problems. His son is spying on his patients. His parents can't even come to his wedding to Miami TV reporter Laura (Lisa Kudrow). Ben rear ends into Vitti's man Jelly (Joe Viterelli) with a tied up victim in the truck. Ben gives him a business card and later Don Paul Vitti comes in to see Ben for his problems before the big meeting in 2 weeks.De Niro is cashing in on his mobster persona to give it a different spin. That locks up that part of the movie. However the comedic aspect is surprisingly sparse considering the Harold Ramis name. Jelly provides a few good laughs. The DeNiro Crystal pairing doesn't come up with enough laughs unless DeNiro fake crying is funny to you. It's funny when DeNiro tries to tell the other boss his feeling. Considering this was made before The Sopranos, a psychiatrist and a mob boss is a pretty good idea. Harold Ramis doesn't milk enough big laughs. He just left too much on the table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A farcical pastiche of De Niro's mafia kingpin image</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In remembrance of the late writer-director Harold Ramis, whose GROUNDHOG DAY (1993, 9/10) is one of my all-time favorite comedies, ANALYZE THIS is another hoot although actually it is the brainchild of De Niro and Crystal, a farcical pastiche of De Niro's classic mafia mien (from THE GODFATHER: PART II 1974 to GOODFELLAS 1990, 9/10 and CASINO 1995, 7/10), he plays Paul Vitti, the notorious mobster boss, survives an assassination from his rival Primo (Palminteri) lately but horrified to find out his masculinity has been chipped away by certain panic attacks, he becomes a gun-shy and over-sentimental cry-baby, what's more vexing, his bed performance is effected as well. Therefore in order to solve the crisis, he visits a shrink, Dr. Ben Sobel (Chrystal), for treatment. The comic clash germinates from Paul's frequent and bossy interruptions of Ben's merry daily life, and even (not on purpose though) jeopardizes his wedding ceremony with Laura (Kudrow) by throwing a clumsy hit-man out for the window. Further on, things get messier when FBI bluntly involved and the film starts to lose its momentum, a test of their friendship is put at front, it meanders into a buddy buddy feel-good dud, the therapy gets the due breakthrough and thing finishes with a prosaic fracas, fortunately the two actors are the saving grace, De Niro's comic bent has been teased out nicely, which sadly would be over-exploited since then and now is on the verge of repetitive fatigue. Crystal contrives a more natural performance and he is a genuine poker-face humorist, it is not a demanding role for him, but his jest of a shrink's equivocations is the face-saving act in an otherwise disappointing coda ("I'm very good at being vague!").Kudrow barely steps out of her Phoebe impersonation and hasn't been given too much screen time either; character actor Joe Viterelli, on the contrary, imbues his loyalty with self-aware sense of wisdom, steals many laughters from two protagonists as Jelly, Vitti's heavy. There would be a sequel ANALYZE THAT (2002) reunites the same team thanks to its commercial success, but since Kenneth Lonergan (YOU CAN COUNT ON ME 2000, 8/10; MARGARET 2011, 8/10) is credited as co-writer for the screenplay, one might put certain high- hope to the storytelling, I guess this project is more a salary-earning assignment than a dedicated undertaking for him, anyway, it is a middle-of-the-road Hollywood annual treatment to responsibly squeeze some lighthearted laughter and send the pay-check to their top-billed stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analyze This happens to be a much better comedy than expected and not only it's witty, it's well-acted, well-directed, and just a fun movie to watch. Coming in a decade that features many high-profile gangster films, it's nice to see one that's not taken too serious. This film has many references to the Godfather trilogy which is pretty ironic. That can only make this film funnier.Harold Ramis's film is about a mob boss named Paul Vitti who seeks counseling for his emotional problems before he heads out to a mobster convention. The only problem is that his psychiatrist, Ben Sobel wants nothing to do with him.One thing that surprisingly works well in this movie is the unlikely pair-up of Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal. Based on their pedigrees, one wouldn't expect this to work out but it sure does. DeNiro relishes this role to make fun of his typecast mafia roles while Crystal does the kind of comedy he is good at. It's evident here that they had a good time and the chemistry is top-notch.Overall, Analyze This is a funny "spoof" of mafia films and it turned out better than I expected. Every time DeNiro does his "You're good" quote to Crystal, I just can't stop laughing especially due to Crystal's well-timed facial expressions. While not a perfect film, it's very enjoyable. Kudos to Harold Ramis in making this film work. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert De Niro as a mobster and Billy Crystal as his analyst. Just the premise is enough for a chuckle, but the resulting picture -- "Analyze This" -- is more than a high concept stretched to feature length. This is a funny and extremely satisfying comedy, the best in a while.The picture, which opens today, is not just funny in the moment. It's funny days later. Moments and lines are so perfect that they linger in the mind. In one scene, the analyst has a dream based on a scene from "The Godfather": He's Don Corleone, and the mobster is his son, helpless as a rival gang guns down the old man at a fruit stand. The analyst (Crystal) confides his dream to the mob boss."You mean, I was Fredo?!" De Niro says. "I don't think so." De Niro has figured out that his best strategy for playing comedy is to play it as he would a drama. He plays it straight and lets the situation determine whether it's funny. Audiences will be delighted and slightly shocked at the sight of De Niro, as Mafia boss Paul Vitti, weeping at a sentimental TV commercial. He's at the end of his rope. All the pain he's buried is clamoring to come into the light, and the result is a series of anxiety attacks.A nice aspect of "Analyze This" is that it never gives way to silliness. The setup is a good one, and director Harold Ramis keeps the movie true to it, in tone and style. As outlandish as things get, the characters' dilemmas stay real -- Who could a troubled wise guy turn to? What would an analyst do? -- and there's a dark edge. The threat of violence is ever-present, and with Chazz Palminteri as a rival boss lurking in the background, a happy ending never seems guaranteed.Easily, "Analyze This" is Crystal's best picture. Always at his best when bouncing off of a talented co-star, Crystal has too often found himself in romantic comedies in which he's made a wormy, unconvincing love interest.Here he gets to do great shtick -- in one scene, posing as a consigliere, he double-talks at a meeting of the Mafia commission. But he also holds up the screen opposite De Niro, as Ben, a bored therapist who blossoms into his emotional and professional adulthood over the course of a dangerous and stressful ordeal.It's dangerous because other mobsters are worried that the boss of all bosses is telling the therapist too many secrets. It's dangerous because the feds want to squeeze him for information. It's also dangerous because his patient has a bad temper and a violent streak -- and might, at any moment, turn on him.All the De Niro-Crystal scenes, and there are plenty, are a pleasure to watch. In the first, the crook shows up at the analyst's office, insisting that he's there on behalf of a friend. When the doctor tells him that he thinks the mobster is really describing his own problems, De Niro's take is priceless. He pauses, smiles in awe and says, "You're good. You got a gift, my friend." From there, the doctor can't get rid of this patient, who shows up everywhere. The one-liners and banter are unexpected: The mobster mentions that he has a mistress because there are things he won't do with his wife. When the doctor asks what things, he answers, "Hey, that's the mouth she kisses the kids good night with." De Niro has played so many gangsters that his role here could have seemed like parody. Yet in his own way, Paul Vitti is as real as the Irish gangster De Niro played in "GoodFellas." It's the same type but from a bizarre new angle</fullReview>

It is stretching things a bit far at times and things get a little out of their already out there orbit, but for the most part it is a fun and Entertaining Movie.It does have a somewhat believable look inside the Mafia and the Doctor's Couch and that makes this all the more bizarre as we watch things break apart in a National Lampoon kinda way. Most of the Comedy, that works the best, is verbal ("If I go Fag you die.") and are much better than the Sight Gags. The Gunplay and the physical Violence fail to satirically sting.The Movie works more than it doesn't, with the Deniro crying Scenes the most obvious misfire, but overall it hits more than misses and there are enough belly-laughs to make this quite a watchable take-off on familiar and popular Mob Movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro Excels As Paul Vitti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analyze This is a gangster comedy film that stars Robert De Niro as a mafioso and Billy Crystal as a psychiatrist.This film about a mobster seeking advice from a psychiatrist.Lisa Kudrow,Chazz Palminteri and Joe Viterelli co-star play key supporting roles.It was directed by Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Kenneth Lonergan and Peter Tolan. Dr. Ben Sobel is a New York shrink who's becoming a little bored with his upscale but neurotic client?le. Into Sobel's practice comes a guy with legitimate problems, Mafia kingpin Paul Vitti, a godfather who is being reduced to tears and panic attacks by stress and his guilt over his beloved father's assassination. Intimidated but also fascinated by Vitti, Dr. Sobel becomes frustrated when his mob boss patient becomes a full-time occupation, as Vitti summons the psychiatrist for his professional help at all hours and in all places, even including the doctor's Florida wedding to TV reporter Laura MacNamara. In the meantime, a power struggle is brewing with Vitti's long-time rival Primo Sidone, but Vitti begins employing the feel-good self-help jargon and techniques he's learned from Dr. Sobel to keep his enemy off balance. Just as the therapist and his powerful patient are making breakthroughs, the FBI attempts to persuade Sobel that Vitti is going to have him murdered, leading to a nearly lethal misunderstanding.It's a treat to watch Robert De Niro tweak every gangster role he's ever played as he was afforded such a perfect opportunity to flex his comedic muscles.This make it possible to get the best out of his performance as the psychologically- challenged gangster.This alone is one reason that makes this movie an above average comedy.Overall,it is a witty, upbeat comedy that is more concerned with making its audience laugh than any other of its cinematic virtues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Authentic Mob Comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy about a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) whose number one-patient is an insecure mob boss (Robert DeNiro).I have to give these guys credit. DeNiro allegedly wanted the film to be authentic, getting actors from Little Italy. The restaurant scenes were also shot in restaurants that had been gangland murder scenes. Very cool. I was already drawn in from the opening with the Apalachin sequence. While maybe not completely accurate, it is clear the writers made a serious attempt and I appreciate that.Heck, I do not even normally like Billy Crystal, but he really comes through here. The casting of Lisa Kudrow is a bit odd, but it is a comedy so I suppose that is fine. DeNiro shines, as always. He has somewhat typecast himself, but it works... so, hey, that is fine by me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy you can't refuse ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing that cinema taught us: it's the inner comedic value of the gangster world. While they used to portray charismatic and one-dimensionally villainous characters in the Warner Bros pre-Code years, or tormented souls in 40's or 50's film noirs and the French new wave, one movie changed everything: "The Godfather". Francis Ford Coppola's crime epic made a world out of the underworld, a universe with codes and dress codes, names and nicknames, principles such as loyalty, Family, Omerta and as many tight-lips as there were squealers. It put morality in a world of immorality and paved the way to a never-ending fascination between movie lovers and gangsterism.Indeed, no matter how we feel when the ending credits start, the initial feeling is often fascination. And one director in particular made it all the more entertaining because it was grippingly faithful to reality: Martin Scorsese, Marty who was to Gangster films what Ford was to Westerns. His "Goodfellas" provided the most dramatic example of how cruel and amoral the gangster world could be, but how can't anyone laugh at the presentation of a colorful character like Frankie Carbone or "Jimmy Two-Times"? De Niro made his gangster film through "A Bronx Tale" but you couldn't tell when the dramatic homage stopped and the unintentional parody started. It all started with "The Godfather", and Robert De Niro is probably the most emblematic of all the actors who played gangsters. So, it is not surprising for a gangster comedy like "Analyze This" to make the most references to "The Godfather" and to have De Niro as the main protagonist, playing Paul Vitti, a mob leader with deep emotional problem, a Don who is slipping, as would say Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozo (May he rest In Peace). Harold Ramis had the richer source of inspiration and the best actor to carry it, and I guess the reason it worked so well is because, as I said, there's a lot of natural comedy in gangster movies without the need of exaggeration (Brian de Palma's "Scarface" is another brilliant example as a drama full of unintentional comedy) and De Niro doesn't need to force himself to become funny. He made the same mimics in "Casino" and it was not supposed to be a comedy, hell even Brando's performance as Vito Corleone deliberately flirted with caricature."Analyze This" is funny because it doesn't try to be so, as if it was conveying the irony of Joe Pesci's Tommy De Vito who made Henry Hill burst out laughing in "Goodfellas" and then started asking what was so funny, one of the film's most famous scenes. Harold Ramis picked the right tonality, and it was crucial because a parody would have severely damaged the appreciation of the film, there was a spoof-movie of "The Godfather" made one year earlier (Lloyd Bridges' last film), and it was a critical fail. You don't need to make funny parodies of gangster films, just pay tribute to them with a comedic tone. Well, I guess, I made this point very clear, but that's the first thing that elevates the level of "Analyze This". Now, let's get to the second thing that serves the comedy: the presence of a 'straight man', it's the role of Billy Crystal's character, Dr. Sobol, as the psychiatrist who's asked to take care of Vitti, the kind of offer he couldn't, for his greatest displeasure, refuse. Now, just imagine yourself facing Vito or Michael Corleone, or a gangster of the same caliber. You know whatever you say must content him, if a "yes" gives a "no", then say "no", and vice versa. The first interactions between Vitti and Sobol are pure comedic gold, because they always carry this threatening presence. Vitti is vulnerable enough not to get too upset and even cry sometimes, De Niro delivers one of his finest comical performances, proving again his versatility, yet he's also capable to show the face of danger to make himself clear. And Sobol is the outsider; the common man who wants no troubles and yet gets himself stuck in situations none of us would want to be trapped. When he's encountered by Jelly, Vitti's henchman in an aquatic park and refuses to meet Vitti, you find him in a shark aquarium, sometimes, the film allows itself a sort of over-the-top humor, but it's always funny.But if the film works thanks to the Crystal and De Niro pairing, the Auguste and the white- faced clown, the scene-staler is definitely the late mug-faced Joe Vitterelli as Jelly, the man who only understands one language, intimidation, killing, bribing and protecting, the Mafia ABC. When a pedant doctor tells Vitterelli he had an attack, Jelly casually gets up and close the room's curtains, he is the wink to our gangster cinematic knowledge. He's so professional in the way he carries Vitti's tasks that the way he pops us in Sobol's most private lives is absolutely irresistible. If only for De Niro, Crystal and Vitterelli, the film is worth a watch, not to diminish the merit of Lisa Kudrow, weird but efficient as Sobol's fianc, Chazz Palminteri as Primo Sindone, Vitti's archenemy, and many faces you'd remember from Scorsese's mafia classics.Last point, the film even recreates a scene from "The Godfather", when Vito is shot in the orange stand, and when Sobol reveals to Vitti that he was playing the role of Fredo in the nightmare, Vitti's reaction said it all "I was Fredo, I don't think so?" the film remarkably interferes with the Gangster's pop-culture, denouncing its comical undertones. And it pinnacles in a scene near the end, when Sobol acts like he's the consiglieri of Vitti and try to recall all his gangster memories not to raise suspicions. That's the fundamental basis of "Analyze This" comical genius: if you don't like gangster films, you'll have fun laughing at them, if you like gangster films, you'll love "Analyze This".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Well Acted Comedy,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analyze This is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It's a really funny movie, I've seen it many times and the same scenes have me in stitches each time, it's a very clever parody on the crime genre and you can tell the writers, directors and actors did research to make the movie feel authentic. I didn't really like the scenes when the film parodied or made reference to the Godfather, I felt that it was better being a satire on mafia films in general and making reference to specific films was unnecessary. Robert de Niro and Billy Crystal both deliver outstanding performances, de Niro played the type of character that he is use to playing, but with a twist, he had to do scenes like the character having a panic attack that really let the actor shine, as for Crystal, he played a very funny and believable psychiatrist who is caught up in a situation he dosen't want to be in, and he portrays this perfectly throughout. Packed with big laughs and great character development, I would recommend Analyze This to anyone looking for a good comedy or crime film. A successful psychiatrist's life is turned upside down after a mobster seeks his help after a panic attack, and discovers insecurities he never knew he had.

		<shortDescription>Two big stars and an original idea add up to a great comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great idea! To cast Robert De Niro as a gangster in a comedy. With Billy Crystal as his co-star.DeNiro plays a mafia boss (Paul Vitti) who has become prone to panic attacks as an important meeting of all the Mafia families approaches. He goes to psychiatrist, Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) for advice just as Sobel's wedding approaches.The best scenes include Vitti hesitantly making contact with Sobel looking for advice for a "friend". Once Sobel realises whom he is dealing with he tries to get out of the situation but he is made an offer he can't refuse. Sobel's attempt to get married in Florida is also ruined when Vitti follows him there for some professional advice. There is also a very funny scene near the end of the movie as Sobel is presented as Vitti's right hand man to the other Mafia bosses and behaves the way he thinks mobsters should on such occasions.We know from "Midnight Run" that DeNiro is is an excellent comic actor and Crystal also has been in some very funny movies. DeNiro was a perfect choice as he slightly distorts the "tough gangster" character we are used to see him playing to get laughs as the character veers towards a nervous breakdown but still clings to the mafia lifestyle and attitudes he knows best.Joe Viterelli is excellent as Vitti's trusted but not very bright lieutenant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Treat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Analyze This' is a complete treat of a comedy. It is so funny &amp; sublime, &amp; the superb performances from it's supremely talented cast only add to it's booty. 'Analyze This' is a comedy about a psychiatrist whose number one-patient is an insecure mob boss. 'Analyze This' has a superb start, middle &amp; end. It's a complete entertainer, that relaxes your mind. The relationship between the psychiatrist &amp; the mob boss is infectious &amp; extremely charming. Paula Weinstein &amp; Jane Rosenthal's Screenplay is first-rate. Harold Ramis's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography is well-balanced. Editing &amp; Art Design are decent.Performance-Wise: De Niro &amp; Billy Crystal are at their funniest best. De Niro, like always, lives his character &amp; gives him an entire ark, while Crystal scores due to his impeccable comic-timing. Also, their On-Screen Rapport is top-notch! Joe Viterelli is lovable. Lisa Kudrow supports well. Chazz Palminteri is as usual. Others leave a mark.On the whole, 'Analyze This' is one fine comedy. I really enjoyed this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah. What is there not to like?Don't expect dying from laughter, or a masterpiece of comedy, or more of an authentic mafia feel or anything at all...watch this film for what it is. And so I repeat, resoundingly: what is there not to like ? 6.6/10 IMDb ?!!It's clever, funny, well acted. It's got Robert Deniro vs Billy Crystal, two absolute anti-poles of cinema. The supporting cast is just perfect. I don't like Lisa Kudrow but she fits perfectly. Yeah it's typical and commercial but it still is funny and definitely highly entertaining.The people who voted this below 8/10 are ppl who were looking for something closer to the Godfather - because objectively, as a comedy, there's no way this is an average or even slightly average comedy. Along with its sequel, they form a genuine comedy classic. And that's that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even the Godfather has a mid-life crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly funny movie. It is about a mafia boss, Paul Vitti (Robert deNiro) who is going through a midlife crisis. He no longer feels comfortable with his job, and he suffered a nervous breakdown, though insists that it was a heart attack. His bodyguard's car is hit by the car of Dr Sobel, a psychiatrist from the suburbs. Paul Vitti learns of this psychiatrist and decides to pay him a visit. There is little depth to the movie because it runs simply along the relationship between Paul Vitti and Dr Sobel. Paul is desperate to solve his problem, but has be raised in a manner in which he expects everything should happen immediately, and if it doesn't then he should shoot the person. Dr Sobel simply does not want to upset Paul Vitti, though he wants to get out of this situation. He is also trying to get married, but can't because he wedding is constantly interrupted. The humour works because the movie is done very seriously, yet we are continually being confronted by the absurd. The humour isn't slapstick, but rather we are laughing at the characters and the situations that they are it: a mafia boss who has psychiatric problems, and a doctor who has suddenly been drawn into the world of organised crime. The FBI are portrayed as the bad guys and we sympathise with Paul Vitti. We know that he is a mafia boss and a crook, but the movie reveals a human side to him. The FBI are the crooks as they resort to lies and deceit to get what they want. Dr Sobol is simply caught in the middle and doesn't know what to think. He ends up falling onto Paul Vitti's side because he realise that he has a problem and wants to help him. This is an absolutely hilarious movie. Generally I am careful about comedies, but this one promised and delivered. It is original and it keeps you interested and laughing right through to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's probably not necessary to have seen many Mafia gangster films to enjoy this movie, but it wouldn't hurt. You'll be better able to appreciate the Godfather dream sequence parody, and wouldn't need Dr. Ben Sobol's (Billy Crystal) diagnosis to figure out that Vitti is suffering from stress anxiety and panic attacks. The picture seems a natural for the talents involved, and DeNiro uses his facial mugging to sufficient advantage as he parries with Crystal's treatment methods. I generally don't enjoy movies that liberally sprinkle the dialog with the 'F' word, but when you put it all in the bada bing context of a comedy like this it takes off some of the edge. Joe Viterelli as Vitti's primary henchman Jelly was a great choice for additional comic relief, and even though I can't separate Lisa Kudrow from her ditsy 'Friends' character, she she did a fine enough job here dealing with her fianc's situation with his new found patient. That was a nice touch at the finale with Tony Bennett's cameo too, you should stick around for it. Bottom line, "Analyze This" is a funny movie (keep the kids away for the language), and You, You, .... You will probably get a kick out of it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Funniest Comedies I Have Seen In A Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Sobol, Psychiatrist, has a few problems: His son spies on his patients when they open up their heart, his parents don't want to attend his upcoming wedding and his patients' problems don't challenge him at all. Paul Vitti, Godfather, has a few problems as well: Sudden anxiety attacks in public, a certain disability to kill people and his best part ceasing service when needed. One day, Ben unfortunately crashes into one of Vitti's cars. The exchange of Ben's business card is followed by a business visit of Don Paul Vitti himself, who wants to be free of inner conflict within two weeks, before all the Mafia Dons meet. Now, Ben Sobol feels somewhat challenged, as his wedding is soon, his only patient keeps him busy by regarding Ben's duty as a 24 hour standby and the feds keep forcing him to spy on Paul Vitti. And how do you treat a patient who usually solves problems with a gun? This Is A Great Comedy. I Went In It With Mixed Feelings Especially When I Don't Like Robert DeNeiro But DeNeiro Does The Greatest Mobster Role Ever! I Was Laughing From The Beginning Of Paul Vitti's Appointments Til The Very End Of The Movie. It Was Hard To Believe DeNeiro Was A Respectable Actor Because Of The Crying Scenes. Oh God This Movie Is Hysterical Especially Ben &amp; Paul's First Meeting When He Says "If You Turn Me Into A Fag I'll Kill You" This Movie Is Too Damn Hilarious I Won't Spoil Any Other Jokes Because The Less You Know About Jokes In A Comedy Movie The Funnier It'll Be. All In All A Great Movie &amp; I Already Regard It As A Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a pleasant surprise to me. I just watched it on DVD 11 years after it came out. The title never grabbed me, but recently someone told me it was a pretty good comedy. When it came out on Blu-Ray paired with its sequel "Analyze That" recently I took a chance and bought it. I found myself laughing and really enjoying the story. Oddly enough, DeNiro and Crystal make a pretty decent comedy team. A funny script co-wriiten by Peter Tolan, Kenneth Lonergan &amp; Harold Ramis plus well paced directing by Ramis and a terrific supporting cast led by Joe Viterelli as a bumbling, but lovable gangster, Chaz Palminteri, Lisa Kudrow and newcomer, Kyle Sabihy all makes for an absorbing, fast-paced, funny comedy. The plot in a nutshell involves Gangster boss DeNiro who is malfunctioning in running his "business" hiring, or rather snatching, Psychiatrist Crystal to help him get back to normal and then the fun ensues. The film also has a neat soundtrack and excellent cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great leads in good natured comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Criminal mastermind Paul Vitti (De Niro) struggles with his emotions after seeing his friend murdered and sees psychiatrist Ben Sobel (Crystal) to cure him.The first thing that struck me about 'Analyse This' is that it contains two fine acting leads. And the second thing was that the promise for this film was very strong, after realising what the story was about.A hard nosed criminal tries to reconnect with emotions. And that in itself spells quite a few interesting dilemmas; given Robert De Niro is the gangster in question.After getting his career under way with his role in the second Godfather film Rob De Niro has cemented himself in strong dramatic roles that were all equally fantastic and here he branches out to the comedy genre, and he doesn't half nail it. Though the opening back story is one of the worst current day establishing motives in comedy history that is forgotten soon enough as we see Paul Vitti and a friend in a caf where bullets fly through the window and he loses a close friend.Two stories intertwine as Billy Crystal's Dr Ben Sobel is preparing for his wedding when Vitti intrudes on his professional life and soon the comedy ensues.What follows is an excellent execution of a brilliant idea. Having a stereotypical view of gangsters and mobs intrude on an everyman's life brings about some flourishing set pieces of action and typical Crystal deadpanning. I am usually against stereotyping in films, but here it works as a treat because of the fact they are so stereotyped that we can associate with Crystal's protagonist and laugh along at the humour and enjoy the spectacle.This turned out to be a key role for Rob as he brandished out further into comedy with the memorable roles in Ben Stiller comedies Meet the Parents and a scene stealing performance in Stardust. Billy Crystal lights up the room every time he enters. One particular moment early on when he lashes out at his patients to get a grip is the best moment in the film.The story whilst containing and maintaining this very good idea has a few flaws. The scripting doesn't have enough gusto in the action sequences and the supporting cast do little to add a strong real world vibe. Lisa Kudrow is bland in one of the worst love interest roles you will ever see.Plus the beginning and initial story setting is quite different from what is to follow and feels as though it's contradicting itself. It feels like a period drama then diving into modern America is too experimental.However this is a good vibrant comedy that boasts wonderful scene stealing acting, not to mention a gorgeous replica of a Godfather scene and is certainly worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro's hidden forte: comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this movie, who'da thunk that you could use the words "hilarious" and "Robert De Niro" in the same sentence? Not I. Now that he's done "Meet The Parents", it's clear that his flair for comedy was more than just a fluke in "Analyze This"...but I digress. De Niro was exactly the right combination of understated and comedic-tough for the role of Paul Vitti, the mob boss who suddenly finds it difficult to carry out his job. Vitti is one of the few people alive who, when he gets to the hospital emergency room, would have preferred to hear that he's had a heart attack rather than a panic attack. A fine line is drawn between comedy and violence in this movie. So when the curtains are drawn in the little area off the emergency ward so that the doctor could be beaten up (off camera) for having the gall to insist that Vitti had a panic attack, it's funny rather than appalling. Billy Crystal is the only actor (with the possible exception of Bill Murray) who could carry off the role of psychiatrist Ben Sobel, who makes his living trying to solve the problems of others but who has quite a few of his own, thank you. He's jealous of his famous psychiatrist-writer father. His overweight son spys on sessions through a hole in the ceiling. He's been through a tough divorce. And his attempted weddings to news anchor Laura (Lisa Kudrow) keeps getting interrupted by Paul Vitti's problems. Lisa Kudrow is wonderful and my only complaint with this movie is that she should have been given more to do. In the DVD version, Harold Ramis does admit in his commentaries that the mostly-male writing team couldn't think of enough to make the most of Lisa's considerable talents. Chazz Palmenteri is indescribably delicious as the rival boss who wants Paul Vitti dead. And the young actor cast as Billy Crystal's son has an easygoing, vivacious talent and has a great career ahead of him. Possibly as the next Billy Crystal! This movie was perfectly cast and is absolutely hilarious. Forget renting it. It's worth OWNING. On DVD, so you can have all the extras. This is currently my favorite Robert De Niro film (based on his acting abilities, anyway. "Cape Fear" is the only one that I loved based on my hormones alone, stirred by the darkly sexy long hair he wore as Max Cady). And based on acting abilities alone, needless to say, De Niro's is a formidible list. ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously a lot of people found "Analyse this" really funny.Which is nice.And I can see how it might have sounded hilarious at the Pitch - "Macho Mafia Don goes into analysis,de Niro and Crystal - Ramis to direct",but it didn't work for me.Mr de Niro may have found a new career in comedy movies in recent years,but he just isn't a comic actor.He is loud,blustery,mugs a lot and guys "straight" gangster movies,biting,in effect,the hand that has fed him for a long time.That's fine by me,nothing's sacred in showbiz,not even your old image....but he just isn't funny.By contrast Mr Crystal is way funny enough for both of them playing the stereotypical smart Jewish shrink too clever by half for the rather limited stereotypical Italian mobster. This is so obvious a device that the only time the movie made me laugh was when Mr Crystal was forced to play the de Niro role at a mob meeting. The various stereotypical Italian-American gangsters are stereotypically amusing enough but I can't help feeling a 1999 movie showing African - Americans to be predominantly pimps and robbers wouldn't have gone down too well. Is the Italian-American anti-defamation league still in business I wonder? No matter;the boys went on to make "Analyse That"as one might have expected which no doubt buffed up the bank balances. Mr de Niro went on to make "Meet the Parents" and it's appalling sequel which offered further proof - if it were needed - that he is not a natural comedian.If only someone would have the courage to tell him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny film, though still flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were rating "Analyze This" based on the value of its comedy and pure funniness alone, I would have given it an 8 or 9 out of 10. However, when judging the film as a whole, there are some serious flaws that bring it down in quality. On one hand, it is a very funny movie at which I laughed hard at many parts. I am definitely a Billy Crystal fan, and he is sharp and witty here as usual. In my opinion, Crystal steals the show in any film he is in by his wisecracks alone. Robert DeNiro does a pretty good job here as well, portraying a tough gangster who has to deal with his feelings and hardships. Some of the funniest comedy in the film comes from the Godfather parodies and references. Man, those are funny! The scene toward the end with Crystal pretending to be a mob boss is easily the funniest in the movie and one of the funniest I've seen lately. There is also a funny and engaging role by Joe Veterelli as Jelly, the mob sidekick. One problem the film has, however, is a poor job of acting done by some of the supporting cast, such as Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's fianc. Her performance makes several scenes at the beginning simply unenjoyable. Also, there are simply too many language and sexual-related jokes in the film for me to completely enjoy it. It's difficult to even edit these out for the sake of making the film more enjoyable. Nevertheless, I still laughed at this film and found it fun. However, if I watched it again I would most likely only watch certain parts that I especially liked.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is delightful. It's also sad and disrespectful, while maintaining a nice level of dark comedy. The dynamic between Crystal and DeNiro is the machinery that makes this work. Crystal is the quasi-neurotic psychiatrist while DeNiro portrays the panic-ridden, anxiety-prone psychotic with severe abandonment issues, and a strong need to maintain the Alpha Dog posture. Thus you have the grist for the mill.Joe Viterelli delivers a fantastic performance as Jelly, DeNiro's right hand man, but even Joe's marvelous performance is upstaged by an emotional DeNiro and the shrink who is trying to help keep him alive. The surreal feeling throws off those male viewers who cannot see the humor in an alpha dog losing his nerve; those viewers will undoubtedly dog DeNiro's choice to take on this role, saying he's gone soft, etc. It took great courage and security in his own masculinity to take on a part like this, and I applaud it, and him for having the nerve to do it.I found myself laughing from start to finish. This is a fine comedy, and I have shared it with many friends.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amusing Mafia Comedy From The Man Who Gave Us "Caddyshack!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tough guy Robert De Niro and shrimpy little Billy Crystal make amusing but mismatched cronies as an anxiety-stricken Mafioso and his reluctant Jewish psychiatrist in "Caddyshack" director Harold Ramis' "Analyze This," a boisterous, bullet-riddled, but formulaic wiseguy action comedy. If you missed De Niro's memorable roles as a mobster in "The Godfather, Part II," "Goodfellas," "Once Upon A Time in America," "The Untouchables," and "Casino," you may have trouble savoring the satirical gibes in this witty gangster movie make-over of the 1991 Frank Oz comedy "What About Bob" with Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. Notorious Mafioso Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is set to take over as Don of a Manhattan crime family when he finds himself going soft. During an interrogation, he cannot bring himself to beat a traitor to a bloody pulp with a baseball bat. (Remember in "The Untouchables" that De Niro as Al Capone wielded a Louisville slugger.) Afflicted with crying jags, panic attacks, and impotence, the overwrought crime boss confides in his right-hand henchman Jelly (Joe Viterelli of "Eraser") that he needs psychotherapy. Jelly and another hood are making a delivery, i.e., a live body tied up in the trunk of their automobile, when a divorced New York psychiatrist, Dr. Benjamin Sobel (a bewhiskered Billy Crystal of "Forget Paris") accidentally rear-ends their limo. Eagerly, the remorseful Dr. Sobel admits his guilt and prepares to call the cops, but Jelly and Jimmy Boots (Richard Castellano) refuse to make an issue out of it. Nevertheless, Dr. Sobel gives Jelly his business card. Before you can say 'Costa Nostra,' Paul Vitti and Jelly barge into Dr. Sobel's office, bribe his patient to scram, and make Sobel an offer that he cannot refuse."What's my goal?" Cringes an incredulous Dr. Sobel at the prospect of Paul Vitti putting him on 24-hour call. "To make you a happy, well-adjusted gangster?" Clearly, Sobel never set out to counsel criminals: "When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind." Now, Sobel has to cure the mobster without ending up face down in a New Jersey swamp! The complications in "Analyze This" pile up. Rival Italian gangster Primo Sidone (Chazz Palminteri of "A Bronx Tale") is dying for an excuse to whack Vitti. Meanwhile, Dr. Sobel boards a Miami plane to marry his TV reporter girlfriend Laura (Lisa Kudrow of "Mother"). Vitti suffers a relapse, and Sobel cannot spend a night in bed with his fiance with Jelly abducting him. When Laura and Ben are exchanging vows, Primo's hit-man tries to ice Vitti. Jelly kills the assassin and dumps the body out of the window so that it crashes several floors below into Laura's wedding dinner! Sobel cannot escape Vitti. Laura is as determined to stage their wedding without interference as Vitti is to call on Sobel when his anxiety flares up. Director Harold Ramis is an old hand at hilarity. Not only did he star as one of the "Ghostbusters," but he also helmed such audience pleasing outings as "Multiplicity," "Stuart Saves His Family," "Groundhog Day," "National Lampoon's Vacation," and "Caddyshack." Along with co-scribes Kenneth Lonergan of "The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle" and Peter Tolan of "What Planet Are You From?," Ramis drums up an above-average yarn that adroitly amalgamates laughter with lead. Predictably, Freudian jokes and goombah Italian humor are woven ad nauseam into the fast-paced but far-fetched plot. Basically, "Analyze This" boils down to a series of impromptu encounters staged between the increasingly paranoid Vitti and the neurotic Dr. Sobel about the mobster's unhappy life in the most outlandish places and at the worst times. Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal look like they had a blast. Their comic horseplay in "Analyze This" is infectiously funny. Both actors give marvelously self-depreciatory performances. Crystal is unbelievably bearable for a change because Ramis casts him as the straight-guy. Some of Crystal's scenes with De Niro resemble vintage Abbott &amp; Costello routines.Vitti: "Do you know who I am?" Sobel: "Yes, I do." Vitti: "No, you don't." Sobel: "No, I don't." Vitti: "Have you seen my picture in the papers?" Sobel: "Yes, I have." Vitti: "No, you didn't."Writer &amp; director Ramis and his scribes lose the light touch toward the end. The final scenes are as stiff as a cement overcoat. When Vitti cannot attend a crime family summit, Jelly forces Dr. Sobel to masquerade as their consigliore. Crystal's gangsta shtick is cute, but the scene is labored. Eventually, Vitti shows up and admits to his mobster cohorts that he wants out. Of course, no American movie is going to let a racketeer like Vitti off the meat hook, so Primo and Vitti shoot it out as the Feds close in to arrest them. At fade-out, Dr. Sobel visits the reformed Vitti in prison. Clearly, Ramis and his scenarists eschewed comedy and embraced 'crime doesn't pay' propaganda! No, "Analyze This" is neither as brazenly farcical as "Jane Austin's Mafia!" nor as polished as Prizzi's Honor." Nevertheless, this Robert De Niro &amp; Billy Crystal comedy is a funny enough movie that anybody who enjoys Mafia comedies shouldn't skip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro star in "Analyze This," a 1999 film about a psychiatrist and his mob boss patient. This very funny premise is well handled by the actors, director Harold Ramis and a fairly sophisticated script by Ramis, Peter Tolan and Kenneth Lonergan. With so many comedies today that are aimed toward the lowest common denominator, "Analyze This" is a refreshing change.The story concerns a mob boss, Paul Vitti, who finds himself wimping out, unable to kill or beat anybody up, and who goes on crying jags for no reason. One of his people has a business card from a Dr. Ben Sobel, as the two were involved in a car accident. Vitti then proceeds to disrupt Sobel's life totally by barging in while sessions are going on, having his henchmen bring Sobel to him in the middle of the night, and ultimately ruining his wedding to his girlfriend Laura (Lisa Kudrow). The Feds approach Ben about wearing a wire; they play a doctored tape with Vitti stating that he's going to kill him, so Ben agrees. However, Ben is beginning to understand that Vitti really wants to be helped even though he's resistant.There are some great scenes and funny dialogue, including Godfather references in "Analyze This." The character of Vitti using psychiatric terms to other mobsters is a riot - he tells his rival (Chazz Palmenteri) that he needs "closure" and tells someone else that he has aggression issues. I have to agree with one poster here who says audiences saw a cut of a longer film. There were subplots dropped. I don't totally agree about DeNiro's crying scenes. Some were more believable than others. His comedy is great; what makes good comedy is the ability to be an entire person, not just a funny one. Obviously DeNiro knows this, but the director may have wanted something broader from him. I remember seeing Maggie Smith in Lettice and Lovage and laughing myself sick for the entire show. Toward the end, she leaves a phone message which is a small monologue, and you could hear a pin drop in the audience. It broke your heart. "Analyze This" comes very close to achieving that kind of experience but just misses.Billy Crystal's timing is perfection as a scared, annoyed and frustrated psychiatrist who nevertheless knows something about "boundaries" and asserting himself. At one point, he stands up for himself and gets thrown into a shark tank. He rethinks being assertive."Analyze This" won lots of awards and nominations and was successful enough to spawn a sequel starring Crystal, DeNiro and the gang again in 2002, "Analyze That." Really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see the names De Niro and Crystal on a marquee the assumption would be that Crystal is going to be providing the laughs, but it's just the opposite in ANALYZE THIS, a sharp and amusing comedy which, IMO, proves Robert De Niro, in addition to being a great actor, is also one of the funniest people on the planet. I did not say a good comic actor, I said funny. The man is funny and he had me on the floor for the majority of the film as Paul Vitti, a mob boss who has allowed the pressures of his work take such a physical and emotional toll on him that he begins therapy with Dr. Ben Sobel (Crystal)and then implants himself smack dab in the middle of Dr. Ben's life, forsaking all other patients. Crystal hits all the right notes as Dr. Sobel, but it is De Niro who makes this film so special with his grandiose send-up of several characters he has played in the past. De Niro and Crystal get help from a strong supporting cast including Lisa Kudrow, Bill Macy, Pat Cooper, and especially the late Joe Vitrelli as Jelly, Vitti's stooge, who steals every scene he is in.</fullReview>

Robert De Niro as a mob leader may sound a little clich with the facts that he his a typical Mob actor according to some people, but i say he can play "anything". But the movie didn't boore me afterall, in fact "all" actors are great, Billy Crystal as a funny ,nerve loosing therapist. Joe Viterelli is very funny too. This movie has a great plot which i didn't get sick off, as i can do certain times. No it had me running through the whole movie, laughed many times, and it takes some in movies to make me laugh, but with Robert De Niro in there, i wouldn't worry to much. But although if you've never seen Robert De Niro acting before, if i were you, pick another movie with him playing serious like "Goodfellas" or "The Godfather part 2", trust me his performance will be a lot more funnier. Well i guess that's it, grab a bag of chips and insert this one into the DVD, you gonna enjoy it ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun for a light hearted entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a mob comedy where the mob turns anxious and demands a psychiatrist to treat him without his cooperation.This film is quite funny. A lot of jokes work, but mainly the funny parts are the unexpected intrusions of the psychiatrist's life, or the role reversals of the lead characters. Robert De Niro's character is adorable, he has got the mob feel and yet he is anxious and often cries like a baby. Billy Crystal is comfortable in his role, frustrated and humorous at the same time. Lisa Kudrow has such a small role that I think it is a waste. I was hoping for more psychiatry or psychoanalytic stuff in the film, but to my disappointment there is not that much. The plot is not groundbreaking, but it was enough for some popcorn entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have watched both Meet the parents and Fockers of De Niro but this is the 1st one I guess where he really seemed funny. The difference is, here he is the one who plays kind of fool (there it was Ben Stiller). One more movie where you can find this shade of De Niro is Raging Bull with some scenes with Joe Pesci. The movie maintains a good combination of light and sensible throughout. This was the 1st time I was watching a Billy Crystal and guess I have found another good actor to watch. The casting was also pretty good as in everybody did what was expected of them. The movie also carries a classic touch throughout, a pre-requisite for a De Niro starrer. Can watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny 2 very opposite characters run into each other's life, it is sort of like Anger Management. Great contrast between 2 different personalities and great performance by Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro If you like crime and comedy, there is not a dull moment A very well done plot between a powerful man DeNiro and a doctor Cyrstal. The characters are very well played, accompanied by another fellow whose name I don't know but he was in some other mafia movie in 'The firm'. The dialogs have 'substance'. Everything the said and done supports the ironic struggles that each of the 2 key characters are experiencing in his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only fitfully amusing when it should have been wickedly funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about Analyze This, the idea of a Mafia boss going to see a psychiatrist appealed to me a great deal. It sounded like the perfect springboard for a biting comedy, and since it was directed by Harold Ramis and starred Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the respective roles, I thought it couldn't go wrong.But when I finally did sit down to see it, I must admit I was somewhat disappointed. It never quite fulfils the potential of its very intriguing premise. Its ironic that Analyze This came out the same year as The Sopranos, an equally like-minded TV show. I'm not sure which one premiered first, but The Sopranos is everything AT isn't. There is more psychological insight and edgy, scathing material in a single episode of The Sopranos than there is in the whole 100 minute running time of Analyze This.Its not an unlikable film. Its pleasantly diverting and quite engaging, but this type of storyline really needed a much sharper touch. And I'm afraid Harold Ramis is not up to the task. Not to criticise the man. He can be a fine filmmaker when the need arises. He did after all direct the supremely entertaining Groundhog Day, which is my personal favourite comedy of the 90s. But with his follow-up Multiplicity, he took the idea of a cloning comedy and it only worked for about three quarters of the way through. Analyze This is an even lesser film.De Niro plays Mafia boss Paul Vitti. When a close friend of his is gunned down by a rival family, the shooting stirs up a few ghosts from his past. Now he's suffering anxiety attacks, and he's having trouble performing (and I don't just mean killing people!). If his rivals find out that the Godfather's gone soft, it could mean the end of him. He needs help.Crystal plays Dr Ben Sobel, a psychiatrist bored with his patients' same old problems. He's about to get married to Laura (Lisa Kudrow), a pretty TV anchor. But when he accidentally crashes into the back of another car driven by a couple of Vitti's lackeys, its an encounter that will change his life forever. Because Ben is the unfortunate chosen to be Vitti's shrink.Now Ben has the unenviable task of getting to the bottom of Vitti's deep seated neuroses. Which includes dredging up his troubled childhood, sifting through emotional barriers, and having to put up with a Mafia Don as your best friend.Its a shame that Analyze This only goes for the obvious stereotypical route. Because there's quite a subversive idea at the heart of it. While I was watching the film, I was thinking of alternatives not taken. Ideas not followed through. Promise only skirted around.There are occasions where you can see the potential to this comedy coming to the surface. But it never boils over. Billy Crystal gets dragged into the world of organised crime, but the comic material is only gently amusing when it could have been blackly satiric. Like the scene at the end when Ben has to pretend to be an organised crime figure. And its hardly the funniest thing in the world to watch. Despite Billy Crystal's best efforts.And as for Robert De Niro, he doesn't do too badly in the part. Actually that's a little cruel. He is fairly amusing in the part. De Niro's talents as a comic performer have always been unappreciated. And a lot of his counselling sessions with Crystal are the high point of the entire film. I love the scene when he chucks Ben into a pool filled with sharks because he steps out of line!But Analyze This is still not everything it could have been. It makes a lot of obvious references to gangster films, and it even parodies a famous scene from The Godfather, but even that's not as amusing as it should have been. Although the scene when Vitti confronts his demons in the middle of a bloody shootout completely oblivious to the carnage around him works quite well.And one major point in the film's favour is the late Joe Viterelli's character, Jelly. Vitti's right hand man, he makes sure things run smoothly for his boss, he knows his moods and his needs, and he's a sympathetic ear for anyone who's willing to listen. His very presence in the film is enough to warrant an additional star. He is the heart and soul of the whole endeavour.But I still came away from the film wanting more. I was expecting more, and it just wasn't delivering. Instead we get things like an annoying subplot with Lisa Kudrow whose marriage to Ben is constantly interrupted by Vitti's problems. She adds nothing to the film. What the film really needed was a director like Martin Scorsese to inject some real anarchy into the setup. In fact I can't think of a filmmaker more suited to this type of material than him. When he makes comedies, he has a real knack for drawing out black, gallows humour from the most ordinary situations.Analyze This is OK every now and again, but it hardly sets the world on fire. An oddity for a director of Harold Ramis' talents. Its better than the utterly pointless sequel Analyze That, but really you'd be a lot better off buying a season of The Sopranos on DVD. That way you can see how that series gets right what Analyze This gets so wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea behind this seems simple enough... almost obvious. Have Billy Crystal do his fast-talking, neurotic and repressed thing, cast him as a psychiatrist, and have this psychiatrist have to work with a patient that he would not at all want to work with, yet make it "an offer he can't refuse". Put de Niro in the role of an emotional mob boss. We all know he can do both that part and comedic roles in general. Heck, as a bonus, there's plenty of opportunity of psychiatry jokes. The movie is actually entertaining enough. The two stars fit well together, and their on-screen chemistry is sufficient. The movie keeps you entertained throughout, though there are occasional slow spots. The material is hit and miss, but most of it is funny. Kudrow was less wacky than I had anticipated. The acting in general is pretty good, and Palminteri gets some great moments. Dialog is good, mostly. Language is... free-spirited, let's put it that way. All in all, a funny enough film, worth a watch. I recommend this to any fan of the actors involved as well as anyone the plot appeals to. 7/10</fullReview>

But I was wrong.The acting and lines from De Niro and Crystal are out standing! De Niro's acting of a Gangster is really impressive, it would remind you of so many characters you've read about, and you won't be disappointed! But the better thing from it is the mixture between a gangster and a psychosis patient who is really "panic", and performed by Robert De Niro!

He does quite a good job.Billy Crystal is about as good here as ever-sometimes it lapses into his schtick but I enjoy him as the beleaguered uptight shrink here more so than in other things.Neat parts are the familiar faces from Casino, Goodfellahs and Godfather(see if you know whom I mean), Jelly, and the Tony Bennett cameo. Weak parts? Well-the ending is kinda tacked on, the crying stuff of DeNiro's is poo-poo, and you get the idea that much of Lisa Kudrow's, the father in law and Bill Macy's parts were pretty well left on the cutting room floor. Ditto that of the FBI, too.But it's quite enjoyable, funny, and worth it if you don't take it seriously or expect a 'Great' comedy. It's a Good comedy, def. one that never needed sequel, either.*** outta **** or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a crazy story about mafia, and psychology. Look at the man who talk with Paul Vitti (De Niro). He has a voice like Vito Corleone on Godfather. Then, if you've seen Godfather, the music at the restaurant looks like have the same sounds with scene of murders when Michael Corleone goes to the church.And then you find Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), a psychiatrist. He always want to look as a patience psychiatrist; truly he's not.De Niro have a problem. His head always in trouble (sick, I mean). But, not sick medically. He cannot control himself. He has an emotional trouble. He found Dr. Sobel through his 'stupid' assistant, Jelly (Joe Viterelli) in a car accident. Dr. Sobel gives his name card to the assistant.De Niro was a good actor. Yeah, he was the best for me. In this movie he shows that ability. Can you imagine: the great mafia, most people afraid of him, but when in trouble... he was crying like a little child! The most crazy scene I think was when Dr. Sobel and Paul Vitti go to buy some fruits. You know where Don Vito Corleone has been shoot by gun? Yup, at a fruit grocery! And, here, Dr. Sobel was shoot at food grocery, too. If you've ever seen Godfather, I believe you will laugh out loud! I think it's a very funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analyze this excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Analyze This" is a comedy that brings two actors that come from different genres to produce a very good film. We usually find Robert De Niro in an action film as a gangster and Billy Crystal known to be a comedic actor. While De Niro plays a gangster and Billy Crystal does have some comedic scenes, they seem to switch in this film. I don't remember ever seeing Robert De Niro's comedic side before and must say that it is quite good."Analyze This" is not a typical gangster shoot 'em up and kill 'em action film. De Niro's emotional side takes center stage beautifully as he shows it in almost every scene. De Niro plays Paul Viti the head of a crime family who is suffering from panic anxiety. After Viti suffers an anxiety attack, he goes to the offices of Dr. Ben Sobel played by Crystal.I love the dialogue between De Niro and Crystal because they exchange it with such ease. Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palmenteri play Laura Macnamara and Primo Sundone, respectively and they add so much to this already stellar cast. The script for "Analyze This" seemed to surround a plot that was well thought up and imagined as well as original. I'm very impressed with the writer's ability to come up with a unique plot such as the one presented in "Analyze This." The star power is great in this movie, which made it one of my favorites of 1999. I give this movie a very high recommendation for any De Niro fans or movie lovers alike around the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good, but not a great comedy. It is interesting to see De Niro playing a parody of the sum of all the great on-screen performances he has had until now. And in the process, he proves he is NOT human!Why? He can't cry, he is really unable to even act as if... Conversely, there are some scenes where De Niro's acting is actually pathetic (I never thought I was ever going to say this, but the scenes in which he attempts to cry are so bad, so unreal it is unbelievable). On the other hand, Joe Viterelli is excellent as Jelly, worthy of an Oscar nomination!The film is occasionally very funny, has its highs, but also its lows. The ending lowers the overall tone of the movie, leaving a sour aftertaste... I think it could have been much better! Nevertheless, all in all, this is a decent afternoon's entertainment with two great actors, a funny premise and some hilarious situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Sobel Wanted to Become A Therapist to Help Families. But This Wasn't the Kind of Family He Had in Mind!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Paul Vitti. One of the most powerful and dangerous mob bosses in the nation. Business hasn't been too good lately. He's been having panic attacks, which he would deny. He couldn't even find the strength to whack a stoolie anymore. This was bad news for in 2 weeks time, every mob boss in the country would be meeting upstate. The only other time all the family heads met was in 1957, and it didn't go over so well when one of the "wise guys" was cited for speeding, and it lead to an FBI raid to their meeting place. Paul's father, and good friend Dominic escaped, luckily. Back to the present, Dominic was killed in a mob drive-by. Paul had a good feeling who did it: Primo Sidone, a rat in line for being head boss of all the families. Paul needed help getting him through this stress and anxiety. Enter Dr. Ben Sobel, mild mannered wise-cracking psychiatrist. One evening he accidentally ran into the Catillac belonging to two of Paul's associates: Jelly and Jimmy. Ben apologizes and gives them his card. Jelly tells Paul about Ben, so he decided to drop by the next day right in the middle of one of Ben's sessions. Paul began to elaborate on his concerns, but he seemed to be holding much back. He was uncomfortable talking about it. It struck Ben as odd.Ben and his sarcastic son Michael travel to Florida, where Ben would wed the second love of his life, Laura MacNamara. Meanwhile, Paul discovered another big problem about him: when he was with his mistress, he couldn't get it up. So he seeked out Ben. Jelly pulled him out of a water show to see Paul, and the two take a walk on the beach. Ben sensed that Paul had a lot of repressed rage. The previous night he had a nightmare about baby's milk turning black. What's up with that? Unbeknownst to them, they were being watched...By the FBI. The next day, Ben and Laura's wedding. It didn't go over too smoothy, for a hit-man on Primo's payroll tried to kill Paul in his hotel room, but Jelly tossed him out the window and he landed right in the middle of the wedding! When Ben, Laura and Michael return to New York, they find an enormous gift from Paul on their front lawn. And another surprise: Feds in his living room. These were crooked agents and they wanted Ben to tell them everything Paul had told him. They even made Ben wear a wire. But he took it off when he found he just couldn't betray Paul, who meanwhile was under heat from his "associates" saying Ben already knows too much and should be put out of the way.Paul just couldn't bring himself to whack Ben that night in a secluded junk yard. At that moment, though, Ben strikes a chord when he makes Paul realize how much repressed feelings he had towards his father and his tragic murder. Ben also realized he too had a lot of repressed anger towards his own father. Also at that moment, two hit men, also on Primo's payroll try to kill Ben. Paul was too overcome with grief to shoot back, so Ben tried, and missed every time. Luckily Jelly had taken out the two hit men; Ben and Laura decided to try getting married again, but even before Ben could say "I do", Jelly arrived and, in a way, kidnapped him and took him upstate where the big meeting of the bosses was about to take place. Paul had decreed he would not go, so Jelly took Ben to fill in for him. At that moment, the Feds spotted cavalcades of black limousines exiting the Queens tunnel; Ben, in a $1,200 Italian silk suit, tried fitting in at the meeting, but it wasn't easy, being surrounded by every mafia boss in the country. He introduced himself as Ben Sobellioni a.k.a. The Doctor, (a.k.a Benny the Groin, Elmer the Fudd, and Phyllis Levine). Primo Sidone right away grew suspicious of Mr. Sobellioni and it looked like curtains for The Doctor, when suddenly in came Paul. He announced that he was leaving the mafia to start a normal life. Primo didn't like the sound of that, so everybody drew their pistols and a huge bout ensued. Ben took a bullet, but he was alright. Suddenly, the Feds burst in and incarcerated all the wise guys, including Paul; Epilogue: Ben went to visit Paul in prison. He learned that Primo had been whacked. So, Paul and Ben kept in touch, and from then on, Paul felt like a new man. As for Ben, he and Laura finally tied the knot and got a live performance from Tony Bennett, sent by...A friend.Analyze This. Well I have analyzed this and I think this is a very funny movie. It's hilarious. Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal are a great team. Robert De Niro is known for playing shifty gangsters and they seem to be all rolled into one with Paul Vitti. Billy Crystal's traditional sarcastic wit is played to perfection. Also here: Lisa Kudrow, Chazz Palminteri, Bill Macy, and Joe Viterelli as Jelly. Unfortunately, Viterelli passed away in 2004. Everybody in this movie was good. There was a 2002 sequel: Analyze That. Well, I'll have to see That. But for now, check "this" out. If you're a fan of De Niro and/or Crystal, then Analyze This is for you. Now there isn't much plot and the story is pretty weak, but the jokes and gags are first rate. A lot of black comedy. So I recommend you check out Analyze This today. It's a very rewarding form of therapy, not to mention cheaper. It's a comical offer you can't refuse.-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always wondered and wanted to know how an underworld don would interact with normal people such as doctors, mechanics, etc. Doctors definitely are gonna be a necessity. Analyze This movie to get a clue. Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro strike stunning on-screen chemistry. De Niro doesn't need any extra labels for his already well studded acting career and he doesn't stop short of pulling a winner off this one either playing Paul Vitti, a top of the line non-compliant gangster. Billy Crystal is the highlight of the movie however, playing Vitti's unfortunate psychiatrist assisting New Yorks most powerful gangster with his whimsical eccentricity. Analyze This is one of the better comedies I have watched which leaves little room for ponderous thoughts to fill up the void that most comedies leave you with. The movie is fast paced, compact and intelligently made with timely quirks and laughs. De Niro must be given an Oscar for that one scene alone where Crystal's shoulders play host to his gangster patient river of tears(Wow! Really!). Joe Viterelli plays Vittis hilarious right-hand man keeping a steady watch on his boss. The only out-of place cast is Lisa Kudrow playing our psychiatrists wife. I just cant place Lisa anywhere else outside "Friends". However, being one of the better gangster style comedies made of late, "Analyze This!" definitely keeps you entertained till the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see the names De Niro and Crystal on a marquee the assumption would be that Crystal is going to be providing the laughs, but it's just the opposite in ANALYZE THIS, a sharp and amusing comedy which, IMO, proves Robert De Niro, in addition to being a great actor, is also one of the funniest people on the planet. I did not say a good comic actor, I said funny. The man is funny and he had me on the floor for the majority of the film as Paul Vitti, a mob boss who has allowed the pressures of his work take such a physical and emotional toll on him that he begins therapy with Dr. Ben Sobel (Crystal)and then implants himself smack dab in the middle of Dr. Ben's life, forsaking all other patients. Crystal hits all the right notes as Dr. Sobel, but it is De Niro who makes this film so special with his grandiose sendup of several characters he has played in the past. De Niro and Crystal get help from a strong supporting cast including Lisa Kudrow, Bill Macy, Pat Cooper, and especially the late Joe Vitrelli as Jelly, Vitti's stooge, who steals every scene he is in.</fullReview>

Also, I thought that Laura (Lisa Kudrow) was a very pretty lady... especially in the outfit she was wearing while she was giving her final broadcast. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that all the action of this film really kept me on the edge of my seat.

		<fullReview>Analyze This is a fun comedy about mob boss Paul Vitti, played by Robert De Niro. Vitti experiences a life-altering event when he is almost killed by a rival mob. Although this near death experience is like many others that Vitti has experienced, he is left shaken and unable to face his daily life of crime. He has trouble functioning in bed with his girlfriend, cries at television commercials and experiences panic attacks. Clearly he is experiencing some kind of major stress and anxiety, which is interfering with his ability to be an intimidating, macho mafia thug. By chance, Vitti meets psychiatrist, Dr. Ben Sobel who is played by Billy Crystal. Sobel is bullied into taking Vitti as a patient. I don't blame him because who would dare to cross a mafia boss and risk sleeping with the fishes? Through many therapeutic sessions that were not at the most convenient times, Sobel is able to help Vitti realize that he has repressed grief and trauma from when he saw his father die and in turn he is scared that if he were to die he would leave his own son fatherless. I really liked the odd-couple pairing of De Niro and Crystal. They had good on-screen chemistry and were really funny. I also believed De Niro's character to be afflicted with an anxiety disorder. Billy Crystal was funny as Sobel, but I don't think I would go to him for psychiatric help. His techniques don't look like they are legitimate or ethical. I'm not sure that he could really help someone who is experiencing anxiety and grief. Overall I thought the movie was funny, but not necessarily true to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analyze This...Movie Review (somewhat of a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Analyze This is your typical run of the mill slapstick comedy featuring the comedy duo of Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiero. The two give great on screen chemistry and definitely give the audience a laugh. Most of the film's chemistry is derived from the contrast between the two characters. DeNiero plays Paul Vitti, New York City's top mob boss. On the outside, he seems to have it together, but we later find out that he is struggling with personal issues ? mainly the guilt of his father's murder. His posse begins to worry about Vitti when he suffers a debilitating anxiety attack during a major business deal. Billy Crystal plays Dr. Ben Sobel, just an average guy trying to get by. He runs his own practice, has two children, and is about to get remarried to Laura MacNamara, played by Lisa Kudrow. Aside from the fact that he's marrying a high strung, and overbearing news reporter, Dr. Sobel really seems to have it all together. We learn in the opening scenes that Dr. Sobel is dealing with his own family problems. His father is also a psychiatrist, who holds far more esteem in the psychiatry world than Ben does. Dr. Sobel's father is too busy having parties with the mayor and going on vacation to attend Ben's wedding.The worlds between these two characters collide when Vitti's main henchman, Jelly (a portly man who would do anything for Vitti) suggests that Vitti see Dr. Ben Sobel, whom was recently involved in a car accident with Jelly. After a forceful entry into Dr. Sobel's office, Vitti threatens Dr. Sobel into talking with him. While it is very clear that Dr. Sobol does not want to take him on as a client, his fear of turning away a mobster and getting "whacked" overcomes him, and he blurts out where he and his family will be staying for the next week for his wedding.From here, the movie becomes very reminiscent of "What About Bob?" You have an anxious client, who fearing being alone with their own anxiety, follows their doctor to their vacation get away and makes life for them and their family - a living nightmare. Following this tradition, Vitti and his crew follow Dr. Sobel on vacation and guilts him into taking him in as his special client and providing sporadic, spur of the moment therapy for him ? even during Dr. Sobel's on wedding. This is where the movie starts to go south for me a bit. While the acting and portrayal of anxiety disorder and sudden onset of panic attacks is very accurate, the treatment provided by Dr. Sobel is beyond unethical and unrealistic. This would definitely NOT be a movie to have people watch as an example of good practice. It is quite the opposite. For those unfamiliar with the practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy, you probably wouldn't be told the room number, date and location of where your therapist was staying, you probably wouldn't be helped if you showed up in his room in the middle of the night, and you probably wouldn't find him going to a funeral or shooting people with you either. Reality aside, it does add to the comedy and bond between the two characters in this movie. Overall, I would say "Analyze This" is definitely worth the one-time rental fees. The chemistry between DeNiero and Crystal is enough to keep one interested for the duration of the movie. The chemistry between Kudrow and Crystal, however, is beyond bad. In her most "UnPhoebe-esque" role, she adds little to the movie except annoyance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro was a bit disappointing in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm a fan of the more alternative and non-Hollywood cinema, I can enjoy a good Hollywood movie as well. When it is a good comedy, thriller, drama..., I'll be the first to admit that I liked it. 'Alternative and Foreign' or 'Hollywood', I just don't always understand why people want to make such a difference between the two categories. A good movie is a good movie, no matter where it comes from. That's also why I really looked forward towards this "Analyze This" when I first heard about it. A comedy with Robert De Niro as the boss of a crime syndicate, I really had a good feeling about it. Ben Sobol is a psychiatrist with a couple problems of his own. Not only does he have the feeling that he can never step outside the shadow of his famous father, because he never has such interesting patients, he also has an adolescent son who spies on his patients when they open up their heart and he is about to marry, but his parents don't want to come. To make things even worse for him, one day he is confronted with an unusual patient. Paul Vitti, the Godfather of a local crime syndicate, has anxiety attacks because of past problems. When he finally decides to see a psychiatrist, he must be very careful with his information. He can't give away the gang's secrets and reveal too much about his own situations because that would undermine his current position in the Mafia. But that's not even the biggest problem: Viti isn't used to people saying no to him. He expects that everybody who 'works' for him, so even his shrink, is prepared to see him 24 hours a day and leaves everything behind - even a wedding - when he needs them...The fact that Robert De Niro played a role that made fun of the roles that once made him great is of course remarkable, but it is also a good move. You're already familiar with him as a tough Mafia gang member / boss, which makes the shock and the fun even bigger when you see him completely breaking down emotionally. Still, it wasn't enough to save the movie in my opinion. The entire story around it was just a little bit too thin and the humor didn't always work well enough to make it really special. And I must say that Robert De Niro was perhaps not the best choice for this role either. I've always been told that it takes a lot more to be a good comedian than to be another type of actor and that might be true. I really like Robert De Niro, but I don't really consider him as the best actor for comedies. Billy Crystal was a lot better in this movie.Overall this isn't a bad comedy. Especially when Vitti had his anger attack and shot the pillow to pieces, I was laughing out loud, but that certainly wasn't the only funny scene. However, it just isn't enough to hide the thin story and the fact that De Niro wasn't the best choice of actor for that role. That's why I give this movie a 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro and Crystal have perfect chemistry together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Analyze This" is a comedy that brings two actors that come from different genres to produce a very good film. We usually find Robert De Niro in an action film as a gangster and Billy Crystal known to be a comedic actor. While De Niro plays a gangster and Billy Crystal does have some comedic scenes, they seem to switch in this film. I don't remember ever seeing Robert De Niro's comedic side before and it's quite good."Analyze This" is not a typical gangster shoot 'em up and kill 'em film. De Niro's emotional side takes center stage beautifully as he shows it in almost every scene. De Niro plays Paul Viti the head of a crime family who is suffering from panic anxiety. After Viti suffers an anxiety attack, he goes to the offices of Dr. Ben Sobel played by Crystal.I love the dialogue between De Niro and Crystal because they exchange it with such ease. Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palmenteri play Laura Macnamara and Primo Sundone, respectively and they add so much to this already stellar cast. The star power is great in this movie, which made it has become one of my favorites of 1999. I give this movie a very high recommendation for any De Niro fans or movie lovers alike around the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze ThisStarring: Billy Crystal, Robert DeNiro and Lisa KudrowGenre: Comedy/CrimeRated RAnalyze This is a comedy about a psychiatrist named Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) whose number one patient is an insecure mob boss named Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) who is pretty much like the godfather of the mob you might say. Paul Vitti has a few problems as well as Ben Sobel so Ben Sobel is picked out to work with Paul Vitti. Especially since this psychiatrist is about to be married... a fact that doesn't seem to enter into the Mafia guy's consideration, for whenever he feels a need to talk, that's when the analyst must be yanked away... one time right from the altar, literally. But there's more, for during this time the Mafia is doing a lot of jockeying to come up with a new Don and this makes the need to 'cure' the emotionally distressed boss all the more urgent and definitely secretive. One of my favorite parts was when Paul Vitti interrupted Ben's wedding! Another one of my favorite parts was when Ben suggested to Paul about getting his anger out was to punch a pillow so then Paul grabs a gun and shoots at a pillow and then he feels better! There is also a sequel to this movie entitled Analyze That.BOTTOM LINE: ANOTHER CLASSIC COMEDY MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crystal &amp; De Niro make a quality partnership</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSCreating a good film is dependent on countless factors, but one of the most important is the right choice in actors. In "Analyze This" Harold Ramis as director has the excellent partnership of Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro to work with.Simply put, in this film, De Niro plays Crime Boss Paul Vitti who is experiencing emotional problems. Into this equation comes Psychiatrist Dr Ben Sobel (Crystal) who finds himself being placed in the unfortunate situation of having to tread carefully whilst trying to cure Vitti.In "Analyze This" De Niro is once more trying his hand at comedy acting. Unlike "Meet The Parents" though, De Niro returns to his roots in this film by featuring the Italian Mafia. In "Analyze This", Ramis and company have basically created a satirical tribute to all of those films which so many adore. In one dream sequence, the film even re-enacts the scene from the Godfather in which Marlon Brando is shot (this time Brando is replaced by Crystal). All in all, this film just clicks.The plot, whilst admittedly weak at times, holds the course of the story well and leaves us with a few minor twists. All the supporting cast, despite not having much to do (this in effect being a film purely for Crystal &amp; De Niro), perform well and add to the story. It is that link between Crystal &amp; De Niro which makes this film what it is though. De Niro is a wise judge of films, and I'm unsure whether the reason he only appears in good comedies is because he chooses well or because he makes them good. Ultimately though, every comedy I've seen him in, I've been impressed with (even "Showtime" which is one of his weaker efforts).In summary, "Analyze This" is a good film. The reason it is good though is purely because of the comedy partnership of Crystal &amp; De Niro. The two work very well together and if it wasn't for them, then "Analyze This" would not be as good as it is. Watch this film purely for these two actors. If the sequel (which I haven't seen) is as good as this original, then there's a potential franchise here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I just couldn't stop laughing. But mostly just at the scenes with Robert DeNiro. He's such a great actor and he really brings a lot of life to the jokes. Billy does great as well, but like I said, Robert takes the movie.Robert plays Paul, a big time mobster who has a panic attack. He decides to go see Ben, a doctor to help him out with his problems. And when Ben can't make time for Paul, Paul makes time for himself with Ben.The movie is great and full of laughs. I would recommend it. The only thing that didn't work for me was when Ben was trying to be Italian. I think in some way, maybe they were trying too hard to be funny. But that's it.

		<shortDescription>A funny, entertaining film with an excellent cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised this film is rated so low by IMDb members. It was nominated for 2 Golden Globes (Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical Robert De Niro) and the American Comedy Awards awarded it Funniest Motion Picture.Billy Crystal was fantastic as the shrink who gets impatient with his patients, Lis Kudrow is lovely to watch as always, and De Niro is the amazing actor he's always been, this time really funny.I was cacking myself the whole way through, and in between laughs, the serious and sensitive moments were believeable and interesting. It's a great concept- the once-invincible now-blubbering gangster- and all the mob jokes are just great. Definitely a recommended film.A bit of trivia: The meeting of the families that De Niro talks about in the introduction of the film is a real event that happened in 1957 and the feds did move in and the bosses did run out the back. Only the bit about his father and the tractor hijacking is a fib.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite ever films. 'Analyze This' and it's sequel 'That' are quality entertainment of the highest order. The plot centres around a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) whose only patient is a crazed gangster boss (typical De Niro role except this time it's not serious!!). Both put in great performances and there was not a moment of this that I did not enjoy. The two actors go together very well and the result is a classic, laugh out loud, unmissable comedy that any comedy lover cannot afford to miss. And if you thought this was good, try the equally classic sequel 'Analyze That' yet another fantastic film. Whatever you do don't miss 'Analyze This' a classic for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not too promising a premise. Mafia capo runs into shrink's car and hires him to find out why he (capo) is having anxiety attacks. It could so EASILY have gone wrong.But it doesn't. Instead of being simply silly it's really funny, and at times, thanks to DeNiro's talent, we can even sense a real anguish behind the mask of no-nonsense machismo. There are times when he weeps abjectly and we feel what effort is involved in playing his public role. Crystal, in the Richard Dreyfus part, is good too -- an effective comedian rather than an actor. Lisa Kudrow is lovable in the way that, say, a stork might be lovable. There's an elusive bird-like quality about her, both in the way she looks and the way she moves. Her head seems to jerk from side to side when she talks, an avian delight. I sometimes get her mixed up with Rebecca Pidgeon. But never Walter Pidgeon, because Kudrow is really sexy too. The script is really pretty good, with a sufficient number of jokes to keep our interest. I won't get into them, for any number of reasons, but the scene in which Crystal tries to explain the Oedipus complex to DeNiro is just fine. "Wadda you sayin'? You mean I wanna **** my muddah? You ever SEE my muddah?" Well -- okay, one more from the script. DeNiro calls his rival (Palmenteri) and says he wants closure on the issues between them. After the conversation, Palmenteri turns to his flunky and says, "Get a dictionary and look up this 'closure.' If he's gonna hit us with somethin', I wanna know what it is."Nothing else is outstanding about the film. Towards the end it begins to take itself a bit too seriously perhaps. Crystal actually turns into a shrink and DeNiro into a patient, oh so unconvincingly. And at the climactic meeting, Crystal begins slapping Jelly around. I don't know which vaudevillians first thought that hitting someone was funny. I don't find it at all amusing, maybe because I've been traumatized by grade-school fist fights or something. Or an Oedipus complex, whatever. It's a funnier movie than I'd expected. You might enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a time where comedy either tries to be a little bit *too* smart for its own good (Will &amp; Grace) or completely dim (Dude, Where's My Car) it's nice to find one which gets the blend right. Analyse This is a slightly dark comedy about a Mafia boss called Vitti (de Niro) who has an upcoming meet with fellow bosses but is having mental issues in the day leading up to it. Anxiety, panic and stress are all taking their toll, and after his sidekick Jelly's car gets rammed by psychiatrist Dr Ben Sople (Crystal), Vitti goes to see Sople for therapy.The very notion of a mafia boss seeing a a shrink is the joke here, and it is played to its fullest potential without being flogged like the proverbial dead horse.All players have a whale of a time, and the double act of Crystal and de Niro is a dream come true - the chemistry is spot on.The dialogue is a bit muffled in places, but that's forgiven given the good gags are crystal (No pun intended) clear, and very, very sharp. This movie made me laugh out loud on a number of occasions, and this was on the third viewing.Great fun, and a cut above a lot of conceited comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was incredibly funny. It's the perfect pairing of neurotic humor from Billy Crystal and surly angry humor from DeNiro. DeNiro is also funny in that he can take on a more sensitive role, without seeming sappy. Lisa Kudrow seemed kind of unnecessary, but sort of serves a point. Mechanically, the two leads are great together, and seem to show more potential, especially since DeNiro seems to be making more with his comedies. This is a must-see, followed nearly but not overly strongly by the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold Ramis really knows what he's doing, there's no doubt about that. Movies like "Groundhog day" and "Bedazzled" are cold and clear proofs that he definitely is the new wizard in the field of excellent comedies and in a way some kind of a modern Billy Wilder of today's Hollywood. "Analyze this" is an exceptional movie. Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the same film that happens to be a crazy tongue in the cheek mobster comedy - that alone sounds refreshingly tempting and it delivers everything we expect. Dialogue is hilarious and Bobby who has played gangster in such ultimate mafia classics as "The Godfather: Part 2", "Once Upon a Time in America", "The Untouchables", "Goodfellas" and "Casino" gives the audience everything he has learned during his career and can offer. Alongside "The Freshman" this flick is one of the most successful gangster comedies there is. The sequel will never beat the original, I'm interested to see does it even come close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and one of the better movies of Robert De Niros comedy career. It's much much better than the disaster movies as Showtime and We're no Angels, both with De Niro.The story is about the mobster Paul Vitti (De Niro) who got panic attacks so he decides to go to "shrink" Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal). Something Ben don't like but Paul is coming back, what often brings out hilarious scene's.The whole movie is one big parody on mafia movies, espacially on The Godfather. De Niro is even funnier than in Midnight Run and again he proves to be the ultimate mobster in movie history, only this time in a comedy. Crystal is perfect as the nervous psychiatrist, and he and De Niro are a perfect duo. Lisa Kudrow is playing nice the "dumb blonde" as the Dr. Sobel's fiancee, Chazz Palminteri is playing convincingly as the rival mafia boss and Joe Viterelli is very funny as Jelli, Paul Vitti's helper.The movie is very funny and got some very good action scenes. I couldn't really find bad points, only sometimes the crying scenes with De Niro are a little bit too overacted and Lisa Kudrow was sometimes a little bit TO blond. But that all wasn't very bad and just small details. I give the movie a big 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smart and Classy Satire On Mob Movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Review on the Film "Analyze That" by John Ulmer Robert DeNiro stars as Paul Vitti, an Italian gangster who is having a bit of a mid-life crisis. He has not been feeling his regular self lately, and eventually after many break-downs, seeks help with psychiatrist Ben Sobel, played by Billy Crystal. Unfortunately, Paul Vitti is not about to be treated as a normal patient. He follows Dr. Sobel everywhere, waking him up early in the morning, just to get treatment. Sobel's fiancee, Lisa Kudrow, is not thrilled about this, and so turmoil begins. What could have been a loud and obnoxious modern comedy turns out to be a smart and classy satire on mob movies, and my only regret is that it had so much language.  "Analyze This" really has some funny segments, and only lost some of its seem towards the last twenty minutes or so of the film. I think the most famous, and one of the best scenes is when DeNiro first meets with Crystal, and tries to make Crystal think he is coming to talk about his friend. When Crystal guesses that they are really talking about DeNiro himself, DeNiro starts saying "You...you're good, you. You're very good!" With that Italian voice of his. Without spoiling the scene, I will just tell you it is laugh-out-loud funny. If you are tired of rude, dumb, foul and stupid comedies, check out "Analyze This." It is quite a surprise.3.5/5 stars --John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It was pretty damned funny. De Niro and Crystal made a good team. Sure, both De Niro and Crystal have built their careers on these characters (De Niro as the tough guy gangster and Crystal as the nuerotic worried guy), but just so long as they play them to perfection, like we know they can, then it's fine with me. This is also a fairly original idea, not never been done before, but still pretty clever.Besides De Niro and Crystal, I though Lisa Kudrow was very funny. Once again, she plays a sort of ditzy blonde, but she does it well, even though I hear she is very intelligent. Chazz Plaminteri was also pretty funny. I liked the line "I wanna go see a movie, but it's all just violent shoot em' up s***; I get enough of that at work". The kid who played Billy Crystal's son did a good job. I liked this movie because there was a mix of subtle humor and just being silly. I like how every single mafia stereo type is made fun of, like the thing with the nick-names, where Billy Crystal's character starts spouting off nonsense names like Sammy Da Schnoz, and Elmer Da Fudd. I good comedy for those who don't mind cussing (the previews should automatically drive you away if your opposed to cussing). 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy crystal can't resist the demands of his "jerry Lewis"-sized godzilla ego, and therfore decides to step totally out of character in the final and pivotal scene. (Previously, he and DeNiro had been dead on.) Then suddenly the uncontrollably grandios B.C. emerges. He gives up on his character and acting altogether, and lanches into a schlocky Borscht-belt low comedy stand-up routine that would have made Henny Youngman blush. In so doing, Crystal completely blows the carefully developed realistic tone of the movie. What's worse, this lousy scene which appears in the final cut, was actually shot after the movie had been satisfactorily completed. It seems that PRODUCER/ STAR, B.C. didn't feel he had gotten enough opportunity to do "his thing!" For me and my friends the movie never recovers from the fatuous B.C.'s selfish, and what's worst, woefully inept excercise in shameless self-promotion. "Billy Crystal?... Hey, in't he that guy who used to be funny?" Still, ( believe it or not,) there's much to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOOD HUMOR, FANTASTIC STAR - CAST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible SPOILERS*There is a particular breed of comic flicks, which basically revolve around nothing. These movies don't have any story, as such, and conjure up the giggles out of a very simple thing, such as the exploits of an eight - year old, left home alone, while his parents conveniently forget to take him along with them, on their vacation. Well, 'ANALYZE THIS', in some ways belongs to this cohort, with the exception that, the eight - year old is substituted by a panic - stricken, ruthless gangster. If the panic - stricken, ruthless gangster is played by a 'big deal' of an actor such as Robert De Niro, then the flick becomes one, with something more than just infantile and slapstick pranks. With Robert, even the tritest of a concept seems interesting, all of a sudden. Although this is an average 'cute' film, it stands well above the rest of its kind, due to some brilliant acting by veterans. The story is simple. Billy Crystal is a psychiatrist, whose life is made miserable by this notorious gangster patient of his, De Niro, who grabs every opportunity to force Billy to treat him, even though Billy is too frightened to do the same, and is only too happy to abstain from him. Most of the laughs are provided by this experienced pair of actors. Like a lot of his other movies, De Niro plays the role of a notorious gangster. However, the gangster in this movie suffers this severe phobia of losing himself, his manhood, and everything. De Niro plays the role of the weaker side of a gangster, unlike his other 'gangster' parts, with such a great ease. Be it a comic or a villain, De Niro can play them all, without any problem. Such is the greatness of this talented actor. Even Billy Crystal displays a good performance; especially when he turns into De Niro's replacement from a mellow and peaceful doctor to a rather nasty person, at the gangster's convention. Noteworthy is the fact that the horizontally challenged cast of this movie proves to be as funny as either Crystal or De Niro. The rather corpulent son of Crystal, who makes these small, brief appearances throughout the movie, leaves a good laughable scene behind, before making an exit from the shot. Also, Joe Vitrelli, who plays the part of De Noro's valet, is fat, funny and very cute. His name in the movie is equally cute: 'Jelly'. With good humor, and a hilarious and fantastic star - cast, 'ANALYZE THIS', gets an 8 / 10 rating from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert DeNiro Can Play Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro, an actor who is reknowned for his performances in mafia and organized crime dramas finally gets a chance to expand his range and with this film, he does an excellent job. "Analyze This" is much funnier than DeNiro's previous attempt at comedy which was in the dark humored tale, "The King Of Comedy." It also marks DeNiro's best performance since "Casino" successfully coming back with a bang after a slew of letdowns between "Casino" and this one. DeNiro's longtime friend, Billy Crystal serves as the costar and co-writer here. Shades of the film "What About Bob" and the TV series "The Sopranos" are evident in this tale of a powerful New York gangster named Paul Vitti (DeNiro) who's only weeks away from the possibility of being a "made man." An upcoming meeting between several organized crime families will determine this. As a result of the pressure, Vitti suddenly begins having panic attacks and he intimidates a noted psychiatrist named Ben Sobel (Crystal) into being somebody that he can call on literally any time. However, Sobel is just about to take some time off so he can go down to Florida and marry his fiancee (Lisa Kudrow). Vitti won't be left alone and he won't leave Sobel alone either. Sobel's vacation soon becomes a comic nightmare and a dangerous one too as some rival gangsters and their hitmen have followed Vitti and are trying to whack him. Chazz Palminteri has some good scenes as one of the rival gangsters. On a concluding note, this film showcases DeNiro in a modest and fitting comedic take on the genre that he had helped to popularize. Rent this one along with "Meet The Parents" and laugh along through an evening of top rated DeNiro comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie is even better without all the foul language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was on an airline flight. The version shown was obviously edited to cut down on the foul language and make the movie more appropriate for an airplane audience (with younger viewers). First I have to say I was quite impressed that the edit was as well done as it was. However, the main thing that I noticed was that it was a very good and entertaining movie, without having to employ foul language. The version of the movie that one sees when you rent at a video store is not this editted cut that I got to enjoy. It is still a fine movie, but I prefer the cleaned up version.The casting was great. De Niro and Crystal were wonderfully cast for their roles. I will be watching for the sequel, "Analyze That" (2002). I hope they think about producing this movie without the un-necessarily foul language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Crystal the comedy genius !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** some spoilers ***Analyze This is maybe not that funny and the script is maybe not that well written. Its an average comedy, with some funny lines making fun of all the mob-movies out there and a homage scene to The Godfather. De Niro's performance is ok but he does not seemed very challanged, sometimes even bored and Lisa Kudrow is funny but does not have that much screentime. BUT this movie has Billy Crystal and like in all of his movies he is outragous hilarious ! The one scene making this movie worth my time and money is Billy Crystal as a 'consilieri' at a mob meeting, smacking Joe Viterelli and talking crap. The whole scene looks like Crystal improvising because i cant imagine someone writing so much crap and nor can i imagine an actor memorizing all the crap :-) ! Its so funny, it will crack you up for days.</fullReview>

Robert De Niro stars as a mob boss who is forced to work with psychiatrist Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal) together. When a prominent leader of the New York mafia suddenly starts having panic attacks, he enlists the help of a New York psychiatrist for a fast cure. A psychiatrist has to marry his irritable fiancee Laura (Lisa Kudrow). The film also stars Chazz Palminteri, Joe Viterelli, and the young Kyle Sabihy.

		<fullReview>Robert De Niro has again managed to become the coolest guy on screen and mob boss Paul Viti who's life is falling apart around him and enlists in the help of a shrink (Billy Crystal). De Niro returns to his Goodfellas territory where no one messes with him. This film takes from old school gangster films and makes a complete parody out of them which is more often than not hilarious and highly entertaining. De Niro and Crystal have perfect chemistry on screen and put in excellent performances with the acception of De Niro's crying scenes, they seem rather forced and unbelieveable. Chazz Palminteri is also hilariously excellent as a mob boss who wants De Niro dead, but the true highlight is Joe Viterelli as Jelly, De Niro's body guard who is simply histarical in ever scene he is in. Whether you are a fan of ganster films of your just looking for a sophisticated, yet extremely funny comedy this one is sure to entertain. Note repeated viewings will probably be required to catch all the whitty dialoge due to histerical laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analyze This is a sporadically amusing mob comedy with Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Niro is a Mafia don in need of a little help. Seems he's lost his nerve, just as he is about to assume the family's top job. What a hard-working don doesn't need is an anxiety attack. Crystal plays a shrink who can't refuse the offer of his prospective patient. "You will help me," commands Paul Vitti. Paul, it seems, still has some unresolved issues surrounding the death of his own father, who was gunned down while dining out on clams in Little Italy. Dr. Ben Sobel, too, has some pressing competition issues with his father, who also happens to be a successful psychotherapist. Together they will explore their inner depths (not to mention their inner child) via Freud, Oedipus and Capone. As Jelly, an old-school bodyguard who is afraid that therapy may make his boss go gay, Joe Viterelli manages to steal some thunder from his mega-costars. Lisa Kudrow, unfortunately, was badly miscast in her role. Oddly enough, De Niro, one of our greatest living actors, is neither convincing nor funny in his crying scenes. He and Crystal, however, have achieved a nice balance with their performances and knowingly milk the material for all it's worth. The script (co-authored by director Harold Ramis), which pokes plenty of fun at The Godfather, could have used sharpening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much to analyze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any Robert De Niro flick looks good, because he's in it, but he didn't even shine in this movie. The first ten minutes were the best throughout the entire picture, and that is bad news. It's the last ten minutes that should be the best. Always. Do you understand? Anyways, other side problems were the lame buddies he had, like Joey. It's hard for me to buy that any member of the mafia would have the giggles like Joey did, or even be sympathetic when he was. Watching Robert De Niro cry was like watching a fly take a bath. What's wrong with these directors? Can't they get a stunt double or a better actor for the crying parts that De Niro must perform? The story was lame, Billy Crystal was lame, and so was Lisa Kudrow(what else is new). As for what I liked. I liked how De Niro kept his toughness at times. Seeing him tilt his head to the left and trash talk was always a thrill. I also enjoyed the fish in the big tank while they were in Miami. Oops, did I get off topic? Of course I did, because this movie doesn't have a topic, only the one I brought up about how bad it was. On the flip side, if your the biggest De Niro fan in the world you might give this movie an 8. I gave it a 6. (Rating: 6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a simple idea made worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Vitti, an infamous career criminal and fearsome mob boss, finds himself the victim of sudden, inexplicable panic attacks. Not wanting to tarnish his reputation, he coerces a reluctant psychiatrist (with his own personal problems) to try and help him resolve his issues, which eventually makes both of them the target of rival gangsters. The film's setup requires a leap of faith, as it's occasionally protracted and tiresome, but it has a lot of clever, amusing gags, a good cast, and is carried a long way by two sharp, enthusiastic performances from De Niro and Crystal. It's almost like watching a farcical version of The Godfather or other mobster films. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Very Good At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly. This is not a particularly smart or clever comedy - it's a one liner that goes on way too long. It begins mildly amusing, begins to get mildly boring, and ends too ridiculous to even care about. De Niro generates a couple smiles for his send-up of his most famous role - mob strongman - but he's a little too jokey, and even awkward at times. Billy Crystal is a pretty yawn-inducing straight-man, until the end where he slips into the old, SNL-era 'Billy Crystal: comedian' mode, whereby he simply gets lame. Sure, the limp script - which aims to get by on the concept alone - is mostly to blame, but nobody is trying too hard to bail it out. Far too superficial. This would make an passable short film, but it's not movie material. And of course later that year the Sopranos came around and showed us what actually could be done with the premise, both in comedy and dramatic senses, making it more than disappointing, but totally irrelevant. I doubt this same team will be able to pull off the planned sequel, Analyze That (no joking, it's in the works). There really is no need to, and I think they were lucky to coast by as moderately succesful the first time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ANALYSE THIS (1999) Rating: 7/10This popular gangster comedy is good, but I'll admit, it could've been better. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie and couldn't find too many flaws, but I thought the movie should've been more involving for its excellent premise. I mean, put the one and only Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal and Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis together and you should have brilliance. Analyze This at times just doesn't analyze itself too brilliantly. Still, I really liked the movie. The characters are fresh, intriguing and really original ? especially DeNiro's ? and are a delight to watch. Lisa Kudrow's character was an interesting one but I felt she was underused for her talent. Billy Crystal is an utter delight to watch. He has a cool, calm character and gives one of the best performances in the film. The movie is very original and the script is very well written. I appreciated Harold Ramis's effort, but a few more camera tricks or ? I repeat ? scenes with Lisa Kudrow could've improved the movie. Out of all this, however, I just couldn't go past the character of Jelly. I respected him the most out of all the characters in the movie and whenever he was on-screen; the movie was a delight. His character is one of the most involving ones in the movie and I just thought he was a really good man to take up screen space. Joe Viterelli plays him excellently. Well, through all this review I've mostly flawed Analyze This, but I really think it is worth your viewing time and it still worthy of a strong 7/10. I highly recommend this movie if you want a mob movie that blends comedy, drama and most importantly mayhem together in a really cool fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mafia films finally get an excellent spoof for the genre (forget the overrated MAFIA!) with this hilarious comedy surrounding the Italian mob. Robert DeNiro brilliantly mocks the genre that made him a star, portraying an insecure mobster named Paul. You see, Paul is exper- iencing personal difficulties as of late, and he has these panicattacks. So he consults the unwilling help of soon-to-be wed shrink Ben (Billy Crystal), much to the doctor's dismay. The conflict: ifPaul doesn't see help soon, his life is over, and Ben feels mortified at treating a violent mafiosi. DeNiro and Crystal make a fabulousteam (which makes me wonder why they hadn't worked together before), and the movie perfectly blends intelligent humor with action. Though a bit slow at times, and a slightly lifeless performance by supporting actress Lisa Kudrow, ANALYZE THIS overshadows the flaws with style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was clearly tailor written for Robert De Niro. Not only is he the finest character actor of his generation - perhaps even the finest since James Stewart - his Italian background which he has portrayed so well in films in the past such as his 2 Oscar winners, The Godfather Part 2 and Raging Bull, comes through excellently, and adds much credibility to the role.At the same time, Billy Crystal's natural sarcastic manner is a great anathema to De Niro, and even the role of the usually poor Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's wife is well cast.One of the most subtle and funniest [certainly for Hollywood] comedies of recent years, the digs at the stereotypical mafia image are both cutting and cynical, but damn funny at the same time.The whole concept of a psychiatrist for a mafia racketeer is funny enough as it is, and with the natural chemistry between Crystal and De Niro, this really is a rare, off-beat treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you combine Robert DeNiro--our greatest actor--and Billy Crystal--one of our greatest comedians--how can you go wrong? It was a joy to see the two greats on screen together. They were absolutely magnificent and had incredible chemistry. The way their personalities conflicted with one another was a riot. Another noteworthy member in the cast is Joe Viterelli, who's also a riot as DeNiro's henchman Jelly. Lisa Kudrow has some funny moments and Chazz Palminteri is...CHAZZ!!! He's such a cool actor that his mere appearance can make a film worthwhile. He only has a supporting role, but he's great as always.The film has some priceless gags. Some of the best lines I've ever heard were from this movie. One that really sticks out is when DeNiro consults Crystal in the middle of the night because he couldn't...get it up. Yes, it's what you're thinking. When Crystal advises him to take some sort of drugs to help his "problem," DeNiro replies "Drugs--I don't take drugs. A hard-on should be gotten legitimately or not be gotten at all." Crystal replies in a dry sarcastic tone, "I think Mark Twain said that." I also have to note the hilarious scene where the two guys come face to face for the first time, in Crystal's office. DeNiro asks the shrink:"Do you know me?" "Yes," he replies. "No you don't." "No, I don't." "Did you see my picture in the paper?" "Yes." "No you didn't!" "No, I didn't."And there's a great interaction in which Crystal explains a theory by Sigmund Freud about a child in Greece who killed his father because he wanted to marry his mother. DeNiro quickly replies:"Are you saying I wanna f**k my mother? Have you seen my mother?" "Well, Freud said--" "Well, Freud's a sick f**k!"There's so many memorable moments, but I don't want to give them all away to those who haven't seen the movie. Because these are some of the funniest gags in film history. One moment--and this will be the last one I'll mention--that also made me roll with laughter was the funeral sequence in which a family member got a little over-affectionate with Crystal. DeNiro replies, "Him I don't know."When I saw "AT" in theaters, the place was filled up and people would laugh out loud in unison--like a fifties sitcom audience--at every funny scene. That's a rare occurrence, and I feel great joy whenever it actually happens. The comedy is not done in blatant, screwball fashion. The actors let the laughs come to them, and play it straight. Crystal has a magic way of delivering sarcastic dialogue that only people like Albert Brooks and Woody Allen can surpass. DeNiro spoofs his gangster persona without being superficial about it. He lets the audience search for the inside jokes on their own. People say DeNiro is not suited for comedy. Sure, he's not the Jim Carrey-type of comic actor, but I think that's what makes it work. In films like this and "Meet the Parents" DeNiro doesn't try too hard and is never over-the-top. He expresses the comic dialogue with good timing and good delivery, without making it look like he's trying to be funny. And Joe Viterelli, who's been in other movies but I first discovered him on this one, is great at playing the bumbling henchman and I hope to see him more often. He has great talent. "Analyze This" is a hilarious, wildly original comedy that should have you rolling in the aisles. This is one comedy that won't make you leave with guilt. You're watching two great performers and the humor, though sometimes racy, is all in good taste. My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)What are the two most empty, tired, pass, pathetically dead clichs of twentieth century American cinema? (Duh, I don't know, boss.) How about the mafia and that old Freudian rag? (Huh? So?) So we SATIRIZE them. (Ah...) Together. (Sudden illumination: We make 'em clean?) Yo, stupido, SATIRIZE, not SANITIZE.Thus another in a long, very long string of 'sure-fire' Hollywood ideas is born. God knows where and God knows why, but a director of comedies, who has had some success (but it's been a while), Harold Ramis, Caddyshack (1980), Groundhog Day (1993) is gotten on board. Two past their prime, but not yet knowing it, marque stars are sucked in to play the leads. You'll have fun with this. It can't miss. You and De Niro together, you and Billy Crystal--wasn't he a gas at the Oscars, I mean a friggin' gas! You get to cry, you get to laugh, everybody has fun and we all make a lot of money. You don't even have to rehearse. You can do this stuff in your sleep.Some writers are hired. Producers are tripping over themselves to front the funds. Sure the mafia's been done to death, they're told, but people love it. Look at The Sopranos. They're Italian, aren't they? And hey, what's the greatest film every made, number one on everybody's top ten list? The Godfather, and you wanna know why? Because the mafia family is Everyone's family, every immigrant that ever had to go outside the system to make a living identifies, and we're all immigrants. Sure they're crude and fascist, and not always too bright, but when the chips are down they stick together like real family, and in their primitive way they love one another, and that's what warms our hearts. And yes Freud has been dead for sixty years and sure psychoanalysis is BS. But that's just the point. Look at Fraser on TV. How long has he been doing that gig? Since Cheers, and that goes back nineteen years. People love to laugh at shrinks.Okay, I admit that I thought this might be good, and I admit some resentment at getting sucked in along with Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro. I mean, it COULD have been good. I mean, a mafia boss with a shrink...that could play, couldn't it? And anyway a lot of people liked this movie. I only wish they could have gotten somebody beside Lisa Kudrow (who raised boredom to an art form here) to play the girl. How about Reese Witherspoon and give her some LATITUDE. Now THAT would be funny. I think Nicolas Cage could have played the shrink in goatee and pipe (yo! be creative!) and Eddie Murphy with slicked back, straight black hair, the mafia boss. I think a little electro shock treatment and a straight jacket or two could have enlivened the proceedings. How about people foaming at the mouth and various crazies climbing the walls with the D.T.'s? Kudrow and Crystal could get married lying on couches with the minister (Danny DeVito, say) reading from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) instead of the Bible. They could honeymoon in a padded cell. How about a lobotomy for Kudrow? Billy Crystal could have a multiple personality disorder and think he's little red riding hood and alternatively, Ronnie Reagan... Maybe Madonna as a mafia boss... The mind boggles... Bottom line, I am disappointed, VERY disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Textbook High Concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Refreshingly doesn't fall into the trap that most "high concept" comedies fall into: namely coasting on one good central idea and the star power of whomever gets cast in the lead role(s). This one takes a delightful, "wish I'd thought of that" premise and actually supports it with a smart, well-plotted story. Go figure. Sometimes Robert DeNiro has stretched himself too thin and hasn't come off well in comedies such as WE'RE NO ANGELS and MAD DOG GLORY, but here his timing is virtually flawless, and his comic rapport with Billy Crystal (also excellent, as he avoids making his hapless but still dignified shrink a buffoon) is wonderful. DeNiro seems to be most at home comedically when he is spoofing his own intense, inarticulate image.The script is very sharp and shrewdly sidesteps the predictable whenever possible (though there is always a certain level of welcome predictability in this sort of material). There is a pivotal juncture early on where it looks as if it is going to follow the same old plot line of Crystal's fiancee (nicely played by Lisa Kudrow) thinking that his sudden, unexplained disappearances to meet with the gangster must mean that he is having an affair with another woman. This movie is too intelligent for that and has too much respect for the intelligence of its characters - Crystal comes right out and explains his predicament and the rest of the film is funnier for his honesty. The viewer has more admiration for Crystal's character and more belief in the couple's sincere desire to be together.The director (and one of the writers) Harold Ramis has demonstrated once again that he is one of the best out there at light satire. This is easily one of the most consistently funny (at least a half dozen laugh out loud moments) and enjoyable comedies to come out in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crystal, De Niro, Ramis? Disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had expected much more from a film with Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro, directed by Harold Ramis. I'm sorry but I didn't find it that funny. De Niro had problems with spoofing his own image, he shouldn't do that any more. Billy Crystal was good as usual but not able to mislead me about the fact that the screenplay was poor and H. Ramis couldn't convert his idea (Mafioso visits psychiatrist) to a 100-minutes movie in a way that makes one laugh all the time, as he managed in many earlier movies.Don't get me wrong: There is really a handful of good gags in "Analyze This", but none of them is inventive enough to give you a reason to watch this film and not another one. Some ideas are stolen from "What About Bob?", a film also about a psychiatrist and his patient, which I can highly recommend to everyone who likes to laugh one evening through. "Analyze This" is rather something for children.</fullReview>

I watched it on the big screen, and had a few good laughs, then i purchased it on video, and after watching it 3-4 times, I find myself fast-forwarding to the funny moments each time I try to watch it. I suppose it's one of movies that are funny in the beginning, but seen repeatedly just fails to remain interesting. On average i'd give it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

Then there are some shoot outs and a betrayal subplot and somehow the comedy gets lost and you just have a Mafia movie that is not really that good.

This movie was even better the second and third time around. The dialogue is the key to the chemistry in this movie. A favorite scene of mine involves De Niro's character venting his feelings on a pillow! The culminating moment came in the end, it was a very satisfying conclusion that left me in the high spirits that the movie created. Here's to another De Niro/Crystal pairing in the future!

		<shortDescription>De Niro and Crystal make a great comedy team.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Analyze This" is a wickedly funny tale of where a tough, foul-mouthed New York mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) suddenly loses his mind and is persuaded by Jelly (Joe Viterelli), one of his two bodyguards to go see a shrink a few weeks before a big meeting. At first, Vitti doesn't like the idea, but goes ahead. The first time that Vitti and Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), a calm shrink meet face to face is okay, but the events that happen after that are serious and down-right funny. The dialogue that Crystal and De Niro are well-written and well-acted. Lisa Kudrow, Joe Viterelli, and Chazz Palminterri also give very solid supporting performances in this movie. Kyle Sahiby is good as Sobel's son who has fun nitpicking Sobel. Harold Ramis has made some good films in the past (Caddyshack) and his careful direction here pays off.  The best scene of the movie is the opening scene is masterfully written to perfection and it's just hilarous. One good example is Vitti's dad and a friend of his hijack a farmer who's on his John Deere tractor and drive through the corn field. Overall, De Niro and Crystal make a great comedy team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, but far too long...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching "Analyze This" on video (for the first time), I kept checking the clock, wondering why it seemed to be dragging so slowly. Not a terribly good sign when it comes to a movie. I thought this film was about a half hour too long, and could really have benefited from more cutting room time.Some of the scenes were really funny, but overall I didn't feel that either Billy Crystal or Robert Deniro were in top form here (nor did I sense much on-screen chemistry between the two actors). I don't usually expect much realism in a comedy, but the way Crystal's character reacted to many of the situations he found himself in seemed so unlikely that I was unable to suspend disbelief at many points throughout the film, and that usually kills a lot of the entertainment value of a movie for me.Overall, an amusing but flawed picture that could (and should) have been much shorter. The outtakes on the DVD version are funny (I would have liked to have seen more), and the DVD has commentaries by both the director and by Crystal/Deniro. 6/10 for the movie, 8/10 for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Analyze This" is not just a title but an invitation--it does indeed deserve some analysis. But none of our hard-earned money.It starts out hilarious and believable, but half-way through it rapidly degrades into caricature and silliness, and just plain runs out of gas. Even DeNiro sounds off his feed; I didn't buy those crying jags for even a second. Other than Lisa Kudrow the only consistent brightness is the juvenile-jolly wit of Kyle Sabihy (as Michael Sobol), but the chance of a rollicking train-wreck (or rollicking anything) between future step-mom and step-son is frittered away, alas. And Billy Crystal? Well, he does with it the best he can, no flies on him.Which is all just too bad. "Analyze This" has a terrific premise (a mobster who muscles up some therapy) and an acerbic, under-used and achingly luscious Kudrow, who not once sports anything briefer than skirt-and-blouse--oh, come on! Some of this takes place in Bal Harbour, so stuff that delicious babe in a bikini! (And some more-serious roles. She deserves them.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* * (2 out of 5)Analyze ThisDirected by: Harold Ramis, 1999Sometimes predictability is half the fun. In Analyze This ? a wise guy comedy directed by Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Caddyshack) ? it's all the fun. This concept is so standard Hollywood I have only to draw out the broad strokes from the trailer and then let your imagination walk down the beaten path. Billy Crystal is the psychiatrist; in a role that simply sees Crystal playing Crystal as he would be was he a psychiatrist by profession.Robert De Niro is the mobster. An over-the-top performance that makes you long for his former (and successful) trips into comedy (particularly Midnight Run), and serves as proof that not even De Niro can cry on cue (what an awful scene).The two men are obviously ying and yang, yet the movie spends much muscle on convincing us that there's sure to be a male bonding somewhere.Ramis' intentions are innocent and some snappy dialogue is occasionally funny (De Niro to Crystal on his thoughts on seeking professional help in the form of a psychiatrist: `I go fag, you die.'), but overall Analyze This simply seems tired, contrived and unfulfilling. Like squeezing a used orange to get more juice out of it. This one should have stayed in our minds and on the drawing board (suppose that was even needed?), as a one-off situation and joke concerning Crystal and DeNiro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good, old-fashioned comedy is hard to come by these days. Too often they're forced and unfunny, relying on stereotypes, potty humor, and generally unfunny topics to squeeze out some laughs. Mostly they fail, sometimes spectacularly. Not ANALYZE THIS. Harold Ramis does a masterful job in making a comedy that is a joy to watch. Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal, masters of comedy, don't hurt either. They're both great here. The laughs flow effortlessly from a rather routine story (a gangster needs an analyst, but nobody can find out...sound familiar?). This treatment is not routine, but fresh and fun. Compare this with MICKEY BLUE EYES, another recent gangster comedy. No comparison. When in the mood for laughs, ANALYZE THIS cannot miss.</fullReview>

No, not from HBO's `Sopranos' -- but from yet another film with the exact same (Mob-boss-sees-shrink) premise.Several months ago, to my unexpected delight, I caught a film on Showtime called, `The Don's Analyst' starring Kevin Pollak &amp; Robert Loggia.Pollak (as the pyschiatrist) was never funnier on film (much more likable than the smug, mugging Billy Crystal) and Loggia was vastly more believable as the depressed Don then DeNiro.His comic performance here was as memorable as his dance number with Tom Hanks in, `Big.' He nailed the nuances like Nicholson nailed them in "Prizzi's Honor."The film had that special magic ensemble quality with all the polish and panache of, `Moonstruck' (one of my all time favorites).The sexy Sherilyn Fenn lit up the screen and the always funny Joe Bologna was in rare form.Overall, I found, "The Don's Analyst" to be a funnier, smarter film with much more "heart." It resonated with me longer than these others who have mined the same comic vein.Was this a little known independent that's now running on cable -- or a original cable movie that I never heard of?Either way it speaks volumes about how sometimes big things come in small (hard-to-find) packages.Here's one for the all underdogs.

What I expected was a fair parody of Mafia movies, ala Naked Gun, and what I got was a legitimate movie with a serious plot centered around an absolutely hysterical premise. De Niro and Crystal both played their roles with the level of skill you would expect from veteran actors. What I did not expect was to be so totally drawn into the story line and care as much about the characters as I did. Excellent writing and acting all around. To be fair there was one point where the movie had seemed to bog a bit and felt like it should have ended, but it picked up again pretty quickly. This stumble, combined with only a marginal performance on the part of Lisa Kudrow (The script's fault, not hers) were the only things which kept me from voting higher than a 7.

		<shortDescription>The movie is fine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of this movie is funny. Robert De Niro (The Mission ) plays "Paul Vitti," a man who thinks that there is a stigma about going to a psychiatrist, and that he might potentially become homosexual by just going to one. He is obviously clueless about what therapy is all about. After having been involved in the mob, he starts having panic attacks; chest pains, can't breathe, and all the symptoms that psychiatrists look for to diagnose a patient. I guess the mobster has some feelings after all. The only thing I don't get is if a mobster is too macho to take drugs, why go to a psychiatrist? Paul has problems opening up to a psychiatrist because all he does is basically illegal. In such case the patient and doctor privileges do not apply, and the doctor should have called the cops. The situation is funny, besides that the role of "Paul Vitti" is a serious part. There is nothing funny about that guy. Billy Crystal (When Harry met Sally) plays "Ben Sobol" the psychiatrist. Billy Crystal is very much liked around our household and the movie is fine. I view this movie more as "noire comedy" than just a comedy. I like the names of the characters: Lisa Kudrow (Friends) "Laura MacNamara." You have to be the daughter of the ex-president of the World Bank or some other big stuff to be a journalist. That is not very far from the truth. "Ben Sobol" whose last name sounds like a psychotropic drug by itself!Favorite scenes: Ben Sobol's wedding full of mobsters. An entire group of those guys in black are there. The conversation between Sobol and his son. That is funny! One of the mobster's sitting at the doctors's office and picks up a medical device and starts analyzing his own reflex on his knees.Favorite Quotes: Ben Sobol says to his son": Don't analyze me. I can't be analyzed by someone that until a few years ago believed in Santa." Ben Sobel: "What is my goal here, to make you a happy, well-adjusted gangster?" Ben Sobol: " I am redefining weirdness on an hourly basis." The movie is a pleasant experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ANALYZE THIS is a treat for anyone who loves movies, especially De Niro fans and followers of Mafia-based stories. A film that can essentially poke fun at itself whilst maintaining the quality of the movies it spoofs has to be one of the cleverest achievements in film-making. Admittedly, Harold Ramis' film would not have a fraction of its appeal without the casting of Robert De Niro - all the best lines come from him, and they are the best lines simply because it is him saying them. A favourite scene of mine is when it dawns on Vitti what the Oedipus Complex actually refers to - the acting here is impeccable.Billy Crystal is more restrained than I expected him to be - he plays the part well but it doesn't seem to make full use of his main strength - in-your-face comedy. He seems to be one of the only characters in the film that the comedy revolves around, yet his reactions to the bizarre situations around him are hilarious in themselves. I am (as is probably clear) a massive Robert De Niro fan, and it's great fun to see him spoof the kind of character he has played for years. But if you are a follower or not, go and see this film - it will have you laughing long after the credits have finished rolling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing ANALYZE THIS for many reasons. One, Billy Crystal is one great and funny comedian. Two, Robert De Niro is the king of crime-action movies. I mean, ever saw THE UNTOUCHABLES? Three, the storyline did seem like a very good idea that had never been done before. And four, I love Lisa Kudrow. I was not disappointed with this movie. There could have been more, but it is surely worth seeing. There were only a few instances that I started to really laugh, but there were plenty of good and funny jokes, as well as some good touches of mobster-like crime.Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal) is a family psychiatrist who has a son and is engaged to the beautiful Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow). He gets into a car accident with a dim-witted man Jelly (Joe Viterelli), who happens to be the right-hand man to Paul Vitti, (Robert De Niro) the most powerful mobster in New York. This leads to Vitti seeking the help of Sobol. Vitti gets into very emotional moods and anxiety attacks. He refuses to admit it because he doesn't want to show weakness before a big meeting with the heads of the mob group. Sobol must help Vitti realize his problems with his father, as well as try to survive among the gangsters.The plot is very original and cool, but the unlikely mixture of crime and comedy might leave a stale taste in your mouth. The curse words in this movie can get a little out of hand for a comedy, but that's because of the crime added to it. They did not bother me at all, in fact I thought it was funny and pulled of very well, especially in scenes between Crystal and De Niro.Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro work great together. Both do very good jobs at their performances, even though De Niro's crying scenes seemed a little fake. The one at the end was getting better, but they still looked forced. The gorgeous Lisa Kudrow, although probably a bit under-played, did a good job too. I also think Joe Viterelli did a good job as the stupid, funny mobster. He certainly looks the part of a mobster, and I think the comic touch in his role was pulled off well.There were a few plot holes, however, such as the one with Billy Crystal's character having problems with his father. This is, arguably, used to further the plot between De Niro and his father, but it is never resolved for Crystal. There are also a few jokes that didn't work, but the jokes that do work completely make up for them. This movie is different from your average SNL-alumni comedy movie, but it's full of funny jokes and characters and is certainly worth a rent.</fullReview>

I was glad and somehow surprised to see that de Niro was so comfortable in that comical-sometimes hilarious part, although this is not the first time he plays in a comedy. Joe Viterelli was very good, like Lisa Kudrow too, although it was a bit strange to see her doing something different from Phoebe Buffay. I'm not a Billy Cristal fan but I liked him in this movie; it mustn't have been that easy to face de Niro but he's done it pretty well. So this is not a movie that makes you think or dream and as almost every comedy seems a little bit forced but just try not to analyse it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all....I loved it. This is one film that will definitely have you laughing for a long time. The image of the mafia has moved from the Godfather of the 70s to the Sopranos of the 90s. Here you have Robert DeNiro playing a very well-known and visible crime family head who seems to be having a stressful time in his chosen career. DeNiro chooses to seek assistance (probably from seeing so many of those Charter commercials) and tracks down Billy Crystal for help. For the next two hours you watch the client/doctor relationship grow and develop through some very comical scenes. Billy Crystal is outstanding in his role as a psychiatrist and DeNiro is tremendous as a member of the Mafia. If you are having a hard time imagining DeNiro in a comedic role, then this is a must see film, for you won't believe it unless you see it. Bottom line...if more Mafia members would be willing to seek help, then maybe we can have a kinder and gentler crime world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance despite Crystal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always considered Crystal to be the very definition of boring actors. He is ALWAYS the same character. If you would put his character from "When Harry Met Sally" in this otherwise amusing film, there would be no difference whatsoever. He plays the same role over and over, which is why he'll never really score big.To put DeNiro by his side is therefore like trying to match entrect with a hot dog: avoid it if you can. DeNiro's performance outweighs Crystals by some thousand pounds.However, this film is really amusing, and it's easy to overlook this fact. I just love the part where Crystal prompts DeNiro to "hit the pillow". What bugs me is why they put Lisa Kudrow in this film, she will always be Phoebe with me - and being Phoebe means being stupid, so....Anyway, this film is pretty good. DeNiro is lots of fun, he really sees the qualities in making fun of himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Gangster Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone that appreciates gangster films, this movie was a great relief. I can guarantee you won't get bored watching this film. The first time I watched this was on DVD when I was alone at my house. Even though I was alone, I still found myself laughing out load until it hurt so bad I couldn't laugh anymore. I also think Robert DeNiro's crying scenes were hilarious because it's just something you don't expect to see. Some people may complain that they looked forced, but I think that just adds to the humour of this picture. In fact, my only complaint is that there are a few lost sub plots throughout the picture. (where a storyline gets almost completely cut out of a movie, but there's still small evidence of it left behind) I would recommend this film to any comedy fan, but I think those who like gangster movies will find a lot of hidden comedy in it that only Robert DeNiro can bring to crime films. Happy viewing.</fullReview>

The exchanges between Crystal and De Niro are right on and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

What should have been the hilarious send-up BLAZING SADDLES did for westerns; ANALYZE THIS barely floats above average passed earlier lame lampoons of the subject. There are a few good laughs, but the rest seems merely pleasant. It's as if humoring a buddy who's telling you some old jokes. You smile, you might even wince...hoping they get the hint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid viewer of the gangster genre, I went into this one with high hopes...and wasn't disappointed. This film paints mobsters in the same sympathetic light that the original Godfather does (not the other ones, of course). DeNiro reenacts his famous heavy-handed mobster role with a whole new perspective in this very entertaining comedy. His off the wall character of a mob boss who breaks into tears at random intervals is priceless. Crystal works as the perfect dichotomy as the nervous psychologist who winds up over his head before he knows what has hit him. This film, although nothing past a simple comedy, is terrifically written and has more than it's fair share of laughs. Watch it. Have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy or Drama?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that "Analyze This" was marketed as a comedy but is a movie that makes fun of a man being thrown out of a seven story window really that funny?Robert DeNiro spoofs his gangster image (four letter words and all) as Paul Vitti the gangster who turns psychiatrist Ben Sobol's (Billy Crystal)life upside down when he turns up for therapy sessions. Director Ramis seems to have had trouble in drawing the line between a comedy spoof and a straight gangster drama. I mean there are brutal murders taking place all over this movie. The situation where Crystal walks into a gangster summit meeting unopposed is hard to believe. These are supposed to be the smartest criminal minds in the U.S. not dumb gangsters.There are some good comedic moments in the film, however one never knows when and where to take the plot elements seriously or lightly.You know the film is in trouble when the best comedic moments are in the trailer.The rest of the cast, with the exception of Joe Viterelli as "Jelly" DeNiro's henchman are largely wasted. Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's love interest hardly has more than a cameo and Chazz Palminteri has little to do as DeNiro's chief nemesis. If you blink you'll miss Bill Macy (of TV's Maude fame).Comedy or Drama? Only Harold Ramis knows for sure.</fullReview>

Amusing variations on father/son dynamics, actual and cultural, but unthinking acceptance of psychoanalysis kills it. Script not witty enough, while Crystal is completely out of his depth with the fundamental terror of Ramis' creation. Some very funny scenes,though, despite uncertainties of tone - the mixture of cosy comedy and unsettling Scorcese-like violence is unpleasant and reactionary.</fullReview>

The odd couple pairing goes as expected, with each one playing his part to a predictable if enjoyable extreme. Kudrow, Crystal's fiance, plays a somewhat testy woman, but her character is so sketchy and Phoebe-from-'Friends' that it doesn't make a difference. There are a lot of dropped balls in this movie: Crystal's relationship with his own therapist father, which is rocky, goes unresolved; Kudrow's relationship with Crystal's teenage son goes unresolved; etc. It's an okay picture with bad cutting. Still, there's some laugh out loud funny bits.</fullReview>

This is a good movie to sit down and laugh at, unfortunately it is compared to the Sopranos on HBO. They came out about the same time and have the same plot outline, a MOB boss seeks help from psychiatrist which results in a lot of laughs. Well, I enjoy both programs but they are very different believe it or not; while the Sopranos does have some clever jokes they concentrate more on the dramatic aspect.

		<fullReview>Well, I've just seen "Analyze This" at the cinema. This film seemed an amusing story judging from the trailer. Quite a good idea, Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal could make a great double act! Ben Sobol (Crystal) is a psychiatrist who lives a stable life with his teenage son and is soon to be married to retired TV news reporter Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow). However, after a brief and purely accidental encounter with a member of the mafia "Jelly" (Joe Viterelli, excellent), he is soon dragged into meeting the country's most renowned Mafia boss Paul Vitti (DeNiro), who is currently experiencing problems in his job. He begins to soften up a little, has frequent panic attacks and has difficulties in his profoundly immoral sex life. He needs help from a "head doctor," a psychiatrist, i.e. Mr Sobol. Ben Sobol soon has his life invaded by the mafia, even during his vacation, eventually his wedding is ruined by Vitti and his men after a little bit of violence. His relationship with the mafia boss is now colder than ever and after a few mishaps and a second unsuccessful attempt at his marriage, Sobol ends up being Vitti's "consigliere" at a very important and highly dangerous secret meeting between the country's leading mafia families, led by rival Primo Sindone (Chazz Palminteri).The film is very funny in parts but occasionally there are places in the film that become somewhat tedious. The idea is a very clever twist but not one that could easily be stretched out over a period of over 100 minutes adequately, and even the masterful skill of Harold Ramis (director of the hilariously funny "Groundhog Day") cannot hide the fact from us, resulting in an occasional sense of flatness in the film. The performances are reasonably good, the best of them being that of Billy Crystal, although some of his lines in the film's major final scene are a little similar to the film, "Mickey Blue Eyes," which was released not long before. Robert DeNiro is also quite enjoyable to watch, though some of his crying scenes seem a little awkward. Other performances from Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri are also done well, though neither of the latter two are featured as much as I thought they should have been.So, see this film expecting an enjoyable black comedy, though don't set your hopes too high, or you might just be a little disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mafia Meets the Head Shrinker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis and Co. are able to pull off a terrific comedy about organized crime with a great satire about psychotherapy thrown in. The movie centers around two very good performances. Robert De Niro is fantastic as the "panicky" gangster. He floats easily from his "Goodfellas" tough guy character to an over the top neurotic. His character compares well with Brando's performance in the Freshman. Billy Crystal (the psychiatrist) plays his best role since City Slickers. (Being in the counseling profession myself, I especially liked the give and take between Crystal and De Niro.) The supporting cast is filled with good tough looking actors from recent mob films.The story captures the collision of Hollywood style mobsters and psychiatry beautifully. Ramis' direction and the editing has just the right comic timing. In some moments Analyze This reminded me of another good film about psychiatry gone wrong, What About Bob? My only letdown watching the movie was with Lisa Kudrow who hasn't developed her acting chops to keep up with De Niro and Crystal. It's too bad Teri Garr wasn't given the role. Also, the freshness of the script begins to slow down toward the end of the movie before the big ending. To be fair, this happens in most comedies. In the end De Niro was still terrific and I had a very enjoyable time. </fullReview>

Sobol gets dragged into the inner circles of New York crime where Vitti sees Sobol as one of his employees. Director Harold Ramis who also did one of my all time favorite comedies Groundhog Day makes a sharp and witty comedy, well cast (especially the two leads) and good writing too. I recommend this comedy to all who liked Groundhog Day (this being of course slightly more realistic) and to all who like a good laugh. Don't take too seriously.

In fact this is probably his best film, certainly as good as the first City Slickers film.The problems with the film are to do with the violence which seems to be added at the last moment just to make the film appear as a gangster. It is not needed and does not mix with the context of the rest of the movie.Also some of the sub-plots are not developed for example the relationship between Billy Crystal's character and his future father in law.Lisa Kudrow also is not used enough, and we do not discover much about her character.Overall worth going to see.

		<fullReview>Analyze This is a lot of good laughs tucked in between some light-weight plot. The therapy scenes with Crystal and De Niro are wonderful and provide most of the film's comedy.This is by no means a great movie, but there have been so few decent comedies in the last decade, I tend to really embrace the good ones that come along.Also watch for the bang-on perfect Godfather parody and Crystal's outstanding performance at the mobster meeting in the final scene. When greeting the other gangsters, Jelly (Joe Viterelli) gives a Hi-how-are-ya in dialect Sicilian - Crystal's attempt to imitate him is the movie's single biggest laugh. (Viterelli is outstanding as the slow-witted, dutiful sidekick).I would recommend this to just about anyone, but it is a must-see for De Niro fans such as myself. Not perfect, but very enjoyable.*** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a great time watching Analyze This, it was great to see Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro having a good time on screen. The story in this film isn't too original, but the acting is something to behold. Now I know De Niro is one of the great dramatic and method actors of our time. In this film he just proves that he's a great actor all over again. The direction from Harold Ramis is very solid and Chazz Palminteri adds a nice dimension playing the "bad" mobster. It's the pairing of Crystal and De Niro that really makes this film work. Crystal is a great straight man to De Niro's neurotic mobster and later in the film the roles reverse. It probably won't win an Oscar, but it made me laugh and that's all I wanted. There is a parody of a scene from The Godfather that is worth watching just for the sheer fact of the Fruendian implications it brings forth. Crystal dreams himself to be Marlon Brando getting shot while buying fruit on the street. De Niro plays Fredo in Crystal's dream. The fact that De Niro basically witnesses a character die that he has played before and now plays one of his children is very interesting. Maybe that's too much thinking for this kinda film though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this movie no more than somewhat amusing. The plot is pretty funny and some jokes were quite all right but nothing more than that. If you plan on watching this movie do not expect too much of it because you might get very disappointed. Watching Phoebe from Friends (sorry...forgot her real name) play a different character was nice but I could not get over her not being Phoebe and it seemed to me that she had the exact same style as she does in friends.In my opinion much more could have been done with the plot, which in itself is good. I was hoping for more depth in the story throughout the movie but it never happened. Eventually I gave up and those last 15 minutes of Analyze This were therefore more of a waiting period for me than anything close to amusement. In conclusion I find this movie to be superfluous but watching it is still a painless way to kill some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely worth seeing. Who would have thought that De Niro and Crystal would have made such a great comedy team. I laughed all the way through the movie. I loved every moment of it. It was surprising to me how accurate and believable the movie was.I am a big fan of mobster movies and of Robert De Niro, so my review may be a bit bias. I have never let my emotions toward the crew get in the way of my critique of a film. I have to say that the movie was extremely funny and I laughed out loud several times. The best part of the movie was all of the godfather parallels, such as Crystal's dream and the way he speaks at the meeting. The movie made me laugh and that is good enough for me. I felt that it provided good entertainment, although, De Niro's fake crying was far from convincing. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge De Niro fan, but it got pretty damn annoying.This film was definitely worth seeing for me. I personally would give it a 7 out of 10. Put this movie on your `Watch This' list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting a deep comedy and didn't need to find it which admittedly worked out fine. There's nothing cerebral about the mob. But I still found the film to be downright hilarious! With the possible exception of the last 10 mins. or so which were just ok. However, Jelly was a big scene stealer throughout.And as for the the cussing: What-the-*@#%! did you expect?!? It's a Mafia themed *#$%!&amp; movie. If you've seen the Scorcese and Tarantino films of this genre, the language is more than expectable. It seemed appropriate enough most the time from this perspective. If copious use of "f***" and its derivatives tend to annoy you, then you may want to avoid this film.Try this: Give the movie a fair shot and see if the movie is funny for YOUR own reasons and not someone else's. You don't need to be a fan of any of the actors to see the humour in this satirical comedy: it's a joke. It's not meant to be profound. At least it's not slapstick.</fullReview>

He's a fabulous actor and to do crying scenes is just part of his wide repertoire of "emotions".Kudrow was "Phoebe" - nothing new. Sabihy (Crystal's screen son) was funny.

		<shortDescription>An OK film with lots of goofs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of comedies. There are a couple that are worth watching, but the genre itself is far from being one of my favorites. So why did I watch this movie? The plot grabbed my attention in the first place. And also because of DeNiro. He's one of coolest actors of all time and seeing him on the big screen is always an enjoyable experience. As I didn't expect too much from the film, I ended up enjoying it a little bit. I didn't laugh that much, but the whole thing (cast, jokes, etc.) didn't annoy me at all. DeNiro is superb (again!) as a mobster with emotional problems and Cristal is OK as the criminal's psychiatrist. Some of the most "serious" moments of the film made me want to watch again all the great mob-themed films starred by DeNiro (Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Casino...)! He's the ultimate wise guy! Nonetheless, my real motivation for reviewing this film is to talk about the real big goofs. Have anyone out there noticed how many time the microphones are visible during the 90+ minutes?? It's truly unbelievable that the director and producers (Cristal being one of them) didn't notice those goofs in the final cut!! The first time I saw a mic in the top of the screen I thought I was seeing too much. But then it happened over and over again!! Here's a good point to further discussion: how can a major movie company spend millions in casting, photography, marketing and put a film together with such primitive mistakes?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze This I think lives up to expectations, it is a very funny pairing of two stars you wouldn't necessarily think would go together. The premise (a shrink's life is turned upside down when he starts treating a mobster) was very fresh and interesting. Billy Crystal spends most of the movie as a somewhat subdued version of his frantic self (until the end of the movie) and leaves most of the laughs to Bobby DeNiro and his funny mafia crew (including a hilarious Joe Viterelli as JellY who reminded me of a hulking Lou Costello). Also getting some good laughs are Lisa Kudrow (she is really becoming one of my favorite actors) and Molly Shannon who has a brief part. It is essentially Bobby DeNiro acting like one of the many gangster characters he has played before except this time for some serious laughs. All in all a good movie, I just hope they don't try to push their luck with an "Analyze This Too" or some other sequel. But you never know.</fullReview>

Billy Crystal did a good job playing the straight man for a change; however, he never should have let them talking him into that shiny suit for the gangland meeting scene. Unfortunately, most of the good punch lines were already familiar from the trailer and commercials- usually the calling card of bad movies, but this one still had enough left over to keep me amused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The imdb average for this movie as I write this is 7.5. Ironic because I struggled from halfway through the movie until I decided to write a review 3 days later trying to decide if this was a 7 or an 8.I think the reason (unfair or not) that I went with a 7 was because I had seen a number of superior movies recently. If I had seen a lot of dogs, I probably would have erred on the side of an 8.This is a movie that is perfectly ok to watch. I didn't look at my watch. I didn't feel bored. I didn't dislike anything in particular. However, I also didn't ever one time think I was watching a very good movie - just a pretty respectable one.In order to justify an 8, it has to have some quality that is superior, that I want to remember. Analyze this had no such quality. It was a nice time watching De Niro and Crystal involved in intrigue and mayhem, but nice is a 7.I should say that there were quite a few cute lines, but no REALLY FUNNY lines and the usual violence and language that you would expect.</fullReview>

In the movie, they kept the scenes going way past the gags, just on and on and on. Maybe because, with De Niro and Crystal in the scene, they had nowhere else to go....

De Niro is the epitome of masculinity cleverly laced with traces of vulnerability which cast him as a likeable villain, easily the scene stealer. Crystal possesses an undeniable quirkly charm which makes him extremely likeable, despite his often annoyingly paranoid antics (but hey, we can all relate to them!) One criticism is the overacting of friend's star Kudrow who becomes exceedingly irritating with her nasal voice and the dependency of her pathetic character. Overall the only serious criticism I have for this sparkling, enjoyable show is the unresolved issue of the relationship between Crystal's character and his father. It would have been nice to see more of a reciprocal relationship in the main characters' journey of recuperation from self-denial.</fullReview>

For the most part, the film succeeds, and the viewing audience is left with some enjoyable moments, even though the storyline is a bit far-fetched.Robert De Niro portrays the Mafia leader and actually makes the audience take some sympathy for the past actions that made him what he has become. Billy Crystal, sporting a very psychological facial beard, plays the doctor who is forced by a unique accident to take on De Niro's therapy. The adventures, and misadventures, of the two ultimately wind up at a "meeting of the New York Families" and the Doc has to represent the Don. There are many laughable lines, some quick references to criminal actions, and the Feds do get involved. Joe Vitarelli, as Jelly, the Don's henchman, does manage to steal every scene he is in, and provides several comedic spots. One might wish that the language could have been turned down a bit, but the film is worthy of viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a pretty funny movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the Mafia is not a humorous topic by itself, this Mafia take-off is. DeNiro is excellent in his self-parody, and he has some truly funny lines ("I'm a fag, you die"), and Crystal (surprisingly) plays the straight role very well. His character does has a sense of humor, and he actually has some funny lines of his own. The other actors are okay to good, and the plot is not too finely drawn. There is also a somber undertone to the story dealing with changes in the American Mafia and the actual events on the screen that is food for thought, but all in this is a very funny movie. I haven't laughed this hard watching a movie in quite a while (and that includes "Austin Powers"). An "8" out of "10".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny Mob Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Analyze This", Robert DeNiro plays a gangster (as usual), who seems to be getting to a point where his work is making him fall apart. Is it possible for an important member of the mafia to develop a conscience? I don't know, but that really isn't the issue here. For some reason, before I saw this film I was led to the assumption that Robert DeNiro had developed a conscience, and could no longer act out the violet nature of his world. This isn't true, at least not for awhile. Paul Vitti (DeNiro) has developed what I make out to be a major depressive episode, marked by symptoms of anxiety. They don't really ever say in the movie. They go as far as saying that he has 'panic attacks'. I find it funny how the true nature of a mental illness is never depicted quite accurately in movies. Anyway, it is this that is inhibiting Paul from performing as a top notch gangster. Aside from all this, we have a movie that has many funny moments, some hilarious and some that just make you chuckle.Having a background in psychology, naturally I found the Freudian discussion between Ben (Billy Crystal) and Paul just downright hilarious. First of all I found it funny because it is so typical of therapists in movies to use Freudian psychodynamic therapy. In the real world, Freudian concepts are rarely used, even though they are the likely the best know. This is why films thrive on them. The scene was also funny when Ben tried to explain to Paul, the Oedipal Complex. Paul's reaction was priceless. "Have you seen my mother????", he exclaims.Also noteworthy, is a scene near the end where Ben has to go to a mafia meeting because Paul is having a breakdown. His impersonation of the 'Italian' gangster is very funny. I have heard that the whole scene improvised on the spot. I am not positive if that is true or not, but either way, thumbs up to Billy Crystal.Robert DeNiro's performance as Paul Vitti is great. He reprises his hard edged gangster persona that we are all so familiar with from films like Scorsese's "Goodfellas" and "Casino". Maybe that's why it is so funny, and almost unbelievable when we see him cry. To me, DeNiro seems like the kind of guy that you could never make cry.Overall, the film has many cliches that have been reproduced time and time again, and the ending is not much of a surprise, but I guess with a film like this, I found myself not really caring much about that. I laughed and had a good time; sometimes that's all you need. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why the rave reviews?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The laughs are few and far between. Analyze This is not subtle, it's not intelligent, it's _not even FUNNY_. I wasn't expecting a brilliant piece of work, but THIS is receiving rave reviews?Crystal needs his own personal director or else some sort of mental strait-jacket so that he learns that there is a point where less is more. He has a few good lines, but for the most part is merely obnoxious. The last scene with the mob bosses is one of the most embarrassing scenes I've ever watched. Why is it even in the film? It looks to me like it's simply a chance for Crystal to do a bit of stand-up on his own, but it's so bad that you want to take him out behind the barn and end his misery.I'm a huge DeNiro fan and I find even his performance disappointing. His popular crying scenes are really not that great. They look, dare I say it about the great Robert, poorly acted. I wanted to laugh but it just wasn't there. His "you, you" thing was old the first time he used it. With his track record a miss is allowable. With Crystal it's expected. He should stick to making kid's films about giant actors and such things.If you want to see a really good comedy in this vein, try Grosse Pointe Blank, about a hitman going to his 10-year high school reunion. It's witty, intelligent, and well-acted. But avoid Analyze This, even if you're a DeNiro fan. If you're a fan of Crystal, well, your expectations of intelligent life have probably been lowered to the paramecium level anyway. So enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Go see it. De Niro as the comic and Crystal as the straight guy!? Analyze THAT??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved it.. Seeing the relationship between Crystal and De Niro on screen was amazing. Reminded me of watching De Niro and Pacino in "Heat". In this case, I could only imagine the coaching Crystal did with De Niro between takes. The timing, wit, and charm of the humor was definitely Crystalized. It was wonderful. The lines, especially from the trailer, will probably become cultural cliches. Some of the best comedic dialog in a movie I've seen in years.The work from the supporting cast was wonderful. I particularly adored Joe Viterelli as Vitti's loyal and "nuturing" henchman, Jelly. Definitely the guy you'd want to have kill you, if it had to happen. The movie could have served as a PSA for La Cosa Nostra; sympathizing, even empathizing with mob characters. Lisa Kudrow did mostly a cameo performance of herself as Crystal's fiancee, but I'm beginning to enjoy her big screen persona vs. her long established small screen version. Chazz Palminteri as Primo was a classic wise guy and played off of Deniro as if they'd known and worked with each other for years, which ....yup!So that leaves me with my only dilemma. While I did thoroughly enjoy the movie, I didn't like the deja vu quality and felt somewhat cheated. I've been watching "The Soprano's" on HBO for over a month now and absolutely love it. THE best thing new on television since NYPD Blue. Nice that they're back to back. There are so many parallels, it's startling. The only major variation is that "The Soprano's" is more of a drama, while "Analyze This" is a comedy and a farce. Question is which inspired which??? And how come no one's saying anything and everyone seems to be attempting to deny any connection?Yes, let's analyze THAT. And to that, he said "Cliche'!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highlight: JOE VITERELLI steals this movie from DeNiro and Crystal. Lowlight: almost everyone else seems to be sleepwalking, especially the director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that the same director, Harold Ramis, who brought us GROUNDHOG DAY and CADDYSHACK could have served up this weakly executed comedy about a "shrink to the mob." The occasional flash of brilliant dialog is overwhelmed by the poor production values (e.g., a boom mike dangling over De Niro's head in one scene) and hammy performances by both Crystal and De Niro. The one bright spot is the wonderful performance of Joe Viterelli as "Jelly," De Niro's faithful sidekick. Viterelli's delivery and demeanor are absolutely perfect. A good word, too, for young Kyle Sabihy, who plays Crystal's son. Without these two supporting actors the movie would have been an unmitigated disaster.While others have commented on how the "shrink to the mob" idea has been done before, I was left with the feeling that this movie was more analagous to those horrible Dean Martin "rat pack" movies of years past. There seems to be an in-joke here somewhere, and I think the joke is on the moviegoer. The first sign of this occured in the opening credits when the movie was described as "a Harold Ramis film." At the time I thought it was satire and portended more humor to come. I was wrong; apparently, the credit was supposed to be taken seriously. The actors, on the other hand, could not possibly be taken seriously. They tossed off their lines as if they couldn't wait for the scene to be over so they could have a good yuk among themselves. I hope De Niro got a lot of money for this role, because it certainly did nothing to enhance his professional reputation. Crystal is now making a career of playing the New York, middle-class Jewish stereotype, a la Woody Allen. Lisa Kudrow, despite the pseudo-WASP name of her character, comes across as just another attractive Jewish American Princess and love interest for Crystal. Growing fat and lazy - at least mentally - is often a fact of life. Harold Ramis needs to look in the mirror and try to find the brilliant Chicagoan of years past. He's got to be in there somewhere .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragic Paradox of Funny Gangsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some might call it nitpicking, but I call it "Domestic Terrorism". I viewed this movie at a twilight showing, thus exposing myself to some of mankind's most devious forms of torture.Since this happened to be what I'd call a pretty funny movie, the woman seated behind me at some point during the hilarity; apparently plotzed. (The Yiddish code for an out-of-control laughing-extravaganza). By itself, it would merely have been another twilight-time torture, but my neck was directly in front of her spittle-spewing mouth which made for a continuously finely applied sheen to the back of my neck. The nature of plotzing is ongoing. I wouldn't change seats for some reason and it's really tough to tell someone to STOP having such a good time..Main characters: Robert De Niro as the BIGTIME mobster Paul Vitti, and Billy Crystal as the psychiatrist Dr. Ben Sobel. Both of them were excellent in their respective roles; Crystal as the unceasing nebbish and De Niro stretching a bit out of character as a powerful mobster suffering from Panic Disorder. What ensues is basically "therapy at gunpoint". Since therapy has become the clich of the 20th century, it IS terrifically funny to watch it enacted by these particular two characters. Lisa Kudrow has the part that can only be described as the thankfully small "Lisa Kudrow" part. Among the pool of so-called talent known as "Friends" (a weekly sitcom), Lisa is probably the top talent of this motley crew, but saying "huh?" and "Uh-uh" is probably not going to win her a best supporting actress role in this movie.I can't give too much more away because my biggest nit pick of all is that movie trailers of late have been far too comprehensive. There were so many good lines in this show that I was constantly irritated that I'd heard every one of them during the trailers I'd seen over the last month. If you're going to show the entire movie in the trailer, then let's just start charging for the trailers and stop wasting time and money on the movies.I'd go on but I really need - - to wash my neck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Analyze This" is a cute film that is good for a few laughs and for a nice turn by Robert De Niro as mob boss Paul Vitti. The main problem I had with the movie was that it seemed short and left many questions unanswered. Another problem was that some parts seemed out of place (especially near the end...Billy Crystal's scene with Chazz Palminteri and the rest of the mobsters is cute but when taken in conjunction with the rest of the film isn't really necessary) and other parts didn't seem to go anywhere. I also thought that Billy Crystal's answer to why Robert De Niro was having problems was a little simplistic. yet I liked this movie despite its faults. Robert De Niro has played so many gangsters and mobsters in film that it's something he can do in his sleep- This is his best comic performance. Billy Crystal is restrained and thus adds support to De Niro. Unlike a lot of Bill Crystal's films recently, this one doesn't rely on cheap sentiment to get a point across. It's cute and has some funny moments but it's not a movie where you die laughing. It's a pleasant film and was worth seeing but if you're expecting a movie that makes you laugh until you cry this is not it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A better movie that parodies the mob(or mob movies), is THE FRESHMAN, where Marlon Brando riffs on his role in THE GODFATHER, but this is still a pretty good movie. DeNiro is clearly having a blast sending up his mob roles, and avoids the temptation of mugging. Billy Crystal, who has only been good in other people's movies lately(HAMLET and DECONSTRUCTING HARRY), also avoids mugging for the most part, except for the sequence where he's supposed to pretend to be a mobster; this is one of those ideas that sounded better than it works(except when he slaps Joe Viterelli. That was funny). I didn't think Lisa Kudrow was bad, just wasted(though she gets off one of the film's better lines), and Viterelli and Chazz Palminteri are great in support. Director Harold Ramis plays things too broadly at times, but avoids getting overly mushy, and overall, it's a good laugh.</fullReview>

Crystal, in need of a hit, is also quite funny as the shrink who takes on DeNiro's mobster. Kudrow is fine in a very small role as Crystal's wife to be. The big joy of the film is Joe Vitterilli, as DeNiro's right hand man. His comic timing is perfect as is the characterization. Keep an eye on this gentlemen, there's more to him than small roles in films like "Eraser." Chazz Palmanterri co-stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "Analyze This" is far from perfect, it is still well worth your time. The performances of Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiro and the fact that it delivers on the laughs make this worthwhile.Billy Crystal, as usual, has impeccable comic timing. However, DeNiro is the standout performance as a Mafia don who is battling his inner demons along with the usual mobsters. He, like Marlon Brando in "The Freshman", gets a chance to poke fun at the heavies he has played in several other films, and does a great job with it.Director Harold Ramis keeps the pace lively and the laughs frequent, but "Analyze This" does not approach the depth and originality of his best comedy, "Groundhog Day".The characters are basically unrealistic stereotypes with no real defining traits, and the situation is not at all believable. Unfortunately, the talents of Lisa Kudrow are wasted in an insignificant role as Crystal's wife-to-be. However, the film delivers on the laughs, and as far as I am concerned, that is the most important factor in a comedy, and that is why "Analyze This" is worth recommending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time I saw a comedy in a movie theatre where I laughed so hard I cried. That alone is worth the price of admission. But I must say that I thought that whoever wrote this movie doesn't think too highly of women. Every single reference to a woman was a put down. If I was a woman living in New York I'd really have an ax to grind. New York women are not portrayed in a very positive light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest I've seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analyze This was one of the funniest movies I have seen in some time. The story is inventive and the teaming of Crystal and De Niro is excellent. Although I am not a big Billy Crystal fan I thought he was wonderful in this movie. Lisa Kudrow does a good job playing a somewhat extension of her tv character. The three characters blend well with the mafia men and Chaz Palmenterri does a great job in the role of the bad guy. Although there are holes in the movie, overall it is enjoyable. It won't win any Oscars, but I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

DeNiro plays his typical Italian tough guy role but with a completely new twist. I've never seen a man cry so much in a movie.. until now.This movie is really funny with lots of subtle humor. If you keep an eye on the video tapes DeNiro's character packs in his bags when he leaves the hotel you will understand what I mean.Funny.. funny.. funny...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd combination of comedy and violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enter the world of "Analyze This," a realistic gangster-comedy if there ever could be such a thing.Robert DeNiro, as his heavy-handed, self-consciously Italian self, plays Paul Vitti--the most powerful gangster in New York City, and Billy Crystal plays Dr. Ben Sobel--the gentle shrink who gets more than he bargained for when he daydreams of treating patients with bigger problems. Though they don't know it, both Paul and Ben are struggling with similar feelings of living up to their father's reputations.There have been comedies that deal with the mob underworld before, but in order to make the premise palatable, it was always made clear that you were watching a comedy: the actors either behaved in obvious ways designed for laughs and paused while the audience chuckled; or the actors played it straight, but the action itself was so absurd that the audience simply couldn't take the film seriously.But "Analyze This" is different-and more disturbing-because the violence, mannerisms, Mafia-movie plot, and explicit language are all brought to the screen intact-even to the point of adopting the dark lighting style associated with other famous Mafia films. "Analyze This" then simply vacillates between something funny and something disturbingly real: between scenes of light, psycho-analytical dialogue comedy about a weeping mobster getting in touch with his feelings, and scenes of bullet-ridden, signature-DeNiro scenes from "Goodfellas" or "The Godfather."The filmmakers realize it's an uneasy mix; it's no wonder they want some sneak previews to try and generate some excitement for a movie that reduces gang-land killings and powerful underworld cruelty to "just another lifestyle" to chuckle over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever been in a theater watching a comedy when there are long pauses after jokes where the audience is supposed to laugh? Usually, you notice them if the film is not working. I didn't hear a single pause during ANALYZE THIS, a screamer from start to finish. Robert De Niro owns this film as a gangster with a tendency to break down crying at the sight of anything sentimental. He takes it upon himself to enlist the aid of Billy Crystal to help him overcome his anxiety. This sounds like a great premise, and when I first heard they were making it, I was unsure if they could pull it off. They have. We see a mockery of the mob like never before.Crystal plays the straight man for once, and it pays off in laughs. De Niro displays a quick comic timing I never thought was possible. When Billy the Shrink explains Oedipus and what happens between him and his mother, De Niro replies, "Have you ever seen my mudder? She's 80 friggin' years old...I wouldn't do that to her...eccchh". This is the essence of the comedy between Psychoanalysis and the mob. De Niro's mobster, Paul Vitti, is still too proud and defensive to receive the proper therapy. He even beats up a medical doctor. "Do I look like I panic...Come ere!!" The comical dialogue is endless in this situation. It also makes the mobsters look hysterically stupid.Chazz Palminteri delivers the film's funniest moment, after a rousing verbal war with Vitti on the phone. A certain word throws him for a loop, but I wouldn't dream of telling you what he does next. Lisa Kudrow has a few fun moments, but she is there basically to complain and look on in shock at what is happening to her would-be husband's(Crystal) life. Another great scene is during the opening credits, when De Niro narrates a hilarious recreation of Appalachin, the infamous meeting of all the head honchos of the mob back in 1958.Crystal executive produced, while De Niro's production company, Tribeca, also chipped in. This was obviously a heart-felt project and both actors were in need of a hit. (especially Crystal) They will get it with this bona-fide laugh-ride that rarely steps wrong, and shows that a mix of crime mentality and psychiatry just doesn't pay. It only cracks you up beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last great comedy DeNiro was in was Midnight Run. Then he played in We're No Angels...a comedy that really stunk. Now there's Analyze This, a brilliantly funny movie starring Billy Crystal &amp; Robert DeNiro. I can't personally see why anybody would give this movie a bad review. Of course if they have, they really need a sense of humor. The story was about a mob boss, Paul Vitti, has some trouble coping with his duties &amp; continuously breaks down a lot. So he goes to Billy Crystal for help. Throughout the movie he gets help from Crystal. What's lacking? NOTHING! Everything was in this movie, if you think this lacked something, I suggest you go back &amp; see it, this time, DON'T FALL ASLEEP! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this would be one of those movies where all the jokes can be seen in the commercials, but I was way wrong. This movie actually leaves the funniest parts for the movie. What a novel idea. De Niro is hilarious as the mob boss, and Billy Crystal is incredibly funny as his psychiatrist. I do agree with many other commenters that Lisa Kudrow and Crystal's son are the weak links in the movie, but frankly, I just tuned them out.The best thing about "Analyze This" is that the humor is varied. Some parts are belly-laugh jokes from the characters, but like movies such as the "Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots" series, there are many gags in the background. This one-two punch of comedy had me rolling in the aisles. See this movie. (maybe save yourself five bucks and wait for the video though.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold Ramis' "Analyze This" is the funniest comedy to come along in couple of years. Of course, it helps if you are familiar with the "Godfather" films, as there are many references to scenes and lines in the classic Coppola epics. Billy Crystal portrays a psychiatrist hired to "analyze" gangster boss, Robert DeNiro, who is having panic attacks and pangs of guilt. The humor comes fast and furious as Crystal tries to avoid getting involved with DeNiro. DeNiro shines in this comic take on roles he has played seriously in the past. Crystal has his own moments to strut his comic stuff, especially coming to life in a hilarious routine at a meeting of Mafia bosses near the end of the film. Executive producer, Chris Brigham, explained that the scene was first filmed straight. Then, Ramis and Crystal thought it could be improved upon and it was refilmed and Crystal did what he does best and lit some sparks of comic genius.Supporting roles are peppered with excellent actors who add to the gangster milieu perfectly. Chazz Palminteri plays DeNiro's principal enemy. Joe Viterelli is ideal as DeNiro's bodyguard (you'll love him).Just check your troubles at the box office and be prepared to laugh until your sides ache.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following, as it does, such sensitive-mobster movies as Gross Pointe Blank and The Don's Analyst, Analyze This loses points for originality but makes up for it in laughs. Billy Crystal as the psychiatrist and Robert De Niro as the gangster have a great chemistry. It's fun to watch these veteran actors play off each other, to watch De Niro become a sensitive guy and Crystal try to act tough. Lisa Kudrow is also very good as Crystal's oft-rebuffed, neurotic bride, and look for a great cameo from Saturday Night Live's Molly Shannon.In all, a very funny movie. It suggests, very convincingly, that everyone is a little crazy. Crystal has issues with his father, his fiance has separation anxiety, and even the mafia bosses are suffering from inferiority complexes. The only flaw is that the movie never addresses any one issue for very long -- it fails to explore Crystal's relationship with his father, among other things, and non-crucial scenes get left by the wayside -- but I laughed all the way through it. Perhaps not a must-see, but a definite solid hit for a Friday or Saturday night.</fullReview>

In "Analyze This" he plays a mobster whose sudden panic attacks send him to shrink Billy Crystal. Crystal, divorced and ready to re-marry, reluctantly takes on the mobster and soon realizes that his life is never going to be the same again. When the mobster wants to see him he means right now!! Even if it is during his own wedding.Crystal is good playing the kind of part he was born to play. But it's De Niro who steals the show, hamming it up in every scene. It's a very funny film that should be enjoyed by all. Also, there are a couple of shots taken at "The Godfather" that are so funny they're worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

Timing, delivery, facial expressions, the whole 9 yards. Robert DeNiro shows that he can be extremely funny without taking away from the character. He deserves an Oscar nomination, but he won't get it because February movies don't make it to the Oscars, and also because comedic roles don't get oscar recognition.Who would've thought that Robert DeNiro would be funnier than Billy Crystal? It's true.Lisa Kudrow: what is going on? Her acting is far inferior to all members of the cast, even the character that plays Billy Crystal's kid. Why does she keep getting roles? It's ridiculous.

		<fullReview>Analyze This is a good night at the movies. Don't expect a lot of social commentary. Do expect to laugh right out loud, often.Diniro is masterful as the mobster in the starring role. He captures perfectly the stereotype "dems and dose" pseudo-Italian syntax. He exaggerates it wonderfully and is quite funny.Crystal is good too, although somewhat less so, as the mobster's shrink. He tries to capture a stiff New York upscale doc, but isn't really terribly believable. Fortunately, it doesn't really matter. Crystal's best work in this movie is behind the camera, not in front of it.The mobster's sidekicks (especially Joe Viterelli as Jelly) and other mob-related associates all do a swell job of adding to the overall campy gangster schtick. Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee is one of the few downers in the film. You just wanna slap her. Nice-looking gal, maybe a good actress, wrong role.Go see the movie. Maybe it's not great "art," but it sure is funny.</fullReview>

We could have done without the "Godfather" dream sequence (it was funnier to hear Crystal tell it with DeNiro responding, "I was Fredo? I don't think so."). Its inclusion would only serve to catagorize this film as a mob movie parody, when it was more of an original take on the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one analyzes the basic topic of this slick comedy, one realizes that it had a certain potential to charm Hollywood producers and to score well at the American box-office. Take a powerful but neurotic, bilious gangster named Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) who suffers from crises of anxiety and make him nag at a peaceful analyst (Billy Cristal) to cure him in a few days. As it was expected, it antagonizes his wife (Lisa Kudrow) and awakes suspicion from the police.The filmmaker Harold Ramis signed a shrewd, canonical film a few years before he began the shooting of this one: "Groundhog Day" (1993) in which subtlety was a winning weapon. Here in our work that is chiefly a present vehicle for the two main stars, subtlety is more sporadic and consequently "Analyze This" doesn't match the brilliance of the 1993 film.Even if it's a little impersonal work from Ramis, this work is watchable if not memorable. The methodology of this comedy is reliant on a formulaic master plan and a well-defined road: as soon as Vitti pesters his shrink and invades his life for poor Ben it's the end of serenity. It's all the more dismaying as he was to marry with his fiance (why has her father to be a cardboard character?) who has a grudge on him. Ramis and his scenarists toy with several types of comic processes and it gives way to subtle, verbal lines or irresistible comic situations but also ponderous ones which unbalances the film in its comic processes. But one stays to the end of this excursion which fulfills its pledges: to entertain thanks mainly to its stars and also to parody the ruthless world of the mafia.The winning team and the formula were to be hired again three years later for the underwhelming "Analyze That" (2002).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Analyze This" is exceptional example of a mediocrity. There is very little bad to say about this movie. The acting is good, the writing is fine, the production values are nice, et cetera, et cetera. There is, likewise, very little good to say about it. None of the actors gives an impressive performance. I never laughed out loud. I was never awed by the sets or the cinematography. "Analyze This" consequently belongs to that large group of utterly forgettable movies distinguished neither by their badness or their quality. As light entertainment, it's an enjoyable work, but since in a few years nobody will remember it's there, nobody will then be enjoying it as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analyze This: 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis has directed many of my favorite movies-Groundhog Day, Bedazzled, et cetera. (He also directed Caddyshack, but I can forgive him for that) His latest pic (besides the sequel) is Analyze This, a mobster comedy. Like there haven't been enough already.Billy Crystal is Dr. Ben Sobel, psychiatrist. He's rather popular. Robert De Niro is Paul Vitti, gangster. He's rather deadly. However, when his friend gets killed, he starts getting `conflicted' and can't kill anyone now. He also can't `perform' with his mistress in bed. So he goes to Sobel for help. Initially Sobel declines, but `something' makes his mind. Well, that's about it.To me, it seemed like everyone tried too hard. Crystal tried too hard to not act funny, but he's a comedian! He's supposed to be funny. About the only time he seemed to get into his groove was the funniest part-at the convention. That's the time I laughed most. Actually, that was the only prolonged and lingering laugh. The rest of the time, the script seemed to be self-conscious and wanted us to know that `we're trying to be funny! Laugh!' Now, I'm not saying that I didn't laugh at all, there were quite a few `ha!'s, but I think a lot of them were forced. I've read rave reviews about it, but I don't really understand why. De Niro obviously enjoys comedy, and he wasn't bad, but his crying fits seemed quite fake and I didn't believe them in a bit. For movies to work, you need to be able to believe what they're trying to produce. As I was watching this movie, I felt like I was watching another version of The Whole Nine Yards. Except that one had certain nebbish believability. I couldn't think that Crystal could successfully impersonate a gangster or that someone like Lisa Kudrow would marry him, which brings me to my next point.Too many thin characters. Kudrow was sadly wasted, with her being billed as the third one but about three scenes (Jennifer Aniston from Office Space, anyone?). It would seem like that she would be able to have a larger role. Crystal's son Michael (Kyle Sabihy) was OK, since we knew not to expect him later. But, with everyone in the crime families, I couldn't keep everyone straight. Except, of course, for Jelly. Jelly, played by Joe Viterelli, is easily the best character in this movie. Although not much depth, he is great to watch. Also thrown in there somewhere are Chazz Palminteri and Molly Shannon (?). Thanks for really letting me get to know the characters, guys!I do have something good to say about the script, though. It actually made me like the main characters, no matter how two-dimensional they may be. Well, maybe not when De Niro was crying, but all the other times, I was right with them. Lots of scripts nowadays can't do that, so they resort to tasteless jokes to try to win audiences over. Most of the jokes were nice and clean (though they snuck a few dirty ones under the radar).Analyze This is an occasionally funny movie with lots of down points but some uppers, also.My rating: 5/10Rated R for language, a scene of sexuality and some violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze This is a funny comedy because it puts a usually serious actor (Robert De Niro) in a situation where he has to do things he usually doesn't do (like crying for instance). Add this, along with a funny doctor (Billy Crystal) and a good supporting cast, and you've got a funny movie. It might not have a meaning or anything important, but it is a good comedy that shows that Harold Ramis director/co-writer can still conjure something as funny as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an eight-year slouch, Billy Crystal made a comeback as psychiatrist Ben Sobel, treating tense Mafia boss Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro). "Analyze This" is basically situation comedy, but very well done. We no doubt expect certain things from such a movie, and it delivers. An interrupted wedding? Check. An FBI investigation? Check. A final showdown? You better believe it.All in all, I think that this movie - along with "Meet the Parents" and "Meet the Fockers" - suggests that Robert DeNiro nowadays does best in zany comedy (although "Hide and Seek" was also worth seeing). But anyway, this is the sort of thing that could only come from Harold Ramis. A great movie. Also starring Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny man Harold Ramis directs a comedy that does not quite live up to its potential. Robert De Niro plays Paul Viti, a somewhat personable and respected mob boss, who is suffering from panic/anxiety attacks. He wants to be treated, but in a hush-hush manner that becomes public. Billy Crystal plays Dr. Ben Sobel, who is wanting some free time to get married. Reluctantly he is convinced to take on Viti as a patient.De Niro is one tough guy with a knack of pulling off comedy. It is so out of his normal character that this comedic roll is funny. Crystal always seems to be good at what he does. Chazz Palminteri and Lisa Kudrow are also featured.Somehow, somewhere this movie just kind of breaks down. I personally thought there was so much room to be funnier. I think it does stand up as a fair comedy; and at least it should not be looked over as being one of those 'silly and pointless' flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The preview for Analyze This was misleading. I expected a laugh a second riot, what I got was a more thoughtful, serious movie but not a more successful one. Analyze this possesses more dramatic than comedic scenes. It was advertised as a comedy but is more than that. However, myself and the other people at the cinema were unsure whether to laugh or not at some situations - especially when Robert De Niro's character starts to cry. Here is a fully grown man that has a reputation for being vicious and he is shedding tears like a baby - surely we must laugh. But we recognise this guy has serious psychological problems and we find it hard to. Not too long ago I saw Raging Bull. De Niro's crying in this movie is similar. It seems rather comic the way he blubbers but it's realistic.De Niro is the star of this movie. His acting is spot on. He is adept at both comedy and drama. We feel for him. He is in an awful tough situation. He is expected to be strong but he can't. De Niro never parodies the situation. His action and especially his language are as violent as most of his other gangster movies.Crystal fares well in his first good role in years. It is more than a supporting role but he is pushed back to that by the conviction of De Niro. He does have a number of laugh out loud moments especially when he is treating other patients or when he is parodying a gangster near the end.The direction by Ramis is less than successful. There are a number of throwaway plots and Lisa Kudrow is used too sparingly. The opening scenes are ineffective - the movie takes an age to get into - but the acting saves it. It's a good movie but unfortunately it's too easy to "forget about it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest sin of Analyze This is of not being funny. The few laughs you'll experience, you've experienced them in the previews already, so don't bother. The problem is that the ideas (the killer and the shrink) and the dialogues are great, no debate there, but are tied up together by an uneasy mix of violence and VERY realistic mafioso scenes: when DeNiro beats up the guy on the chair, is that supposed to make us laugh, or giggle? When he's about to shoot Crystal in the head, then gave up, crying about his father, shoots his way out of an ambush (body count: 2), we're supposed to laugh out head out with the comments that he would have shot the doctor, "but I was real conflicted 'bout it". The FBI scenes are artificial at best, his wife and his son could have been exploited (cinematically speaking) to the extreme, but not much here.DeNiro is his equal self, excellent, the rest of the cast go from good to competent, the direction is technically good for a mafia movie, not for a comedy about the mafia.</fullReview>

What was completed was of mediocre quality, but the final product is GARBAGE. I paid to see this in the theater and really wanted to ask for my money back. There's one scene in particular that is clearly improvised... but so badly. Don't watch this. I can't even imagine how bad the sequel was with such a disappointing start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Analyze This Too Close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the ultimate test of a great actor is how well he or she does comedy as well as drama, Robert DeNiro may not be as great as Dustin Hoffman or Gene Hackman. Those two do comedy very well and naturally. DeNiro struggles, works defensively, and fails more often than not. Want proof? Well, "Analyze This"!The only film where his presence helped a film comically, in my opinion, was "Midnight Run," a great comedy/thriller in the "Beverly Hills Cop" vein where DeNiro shined as a bounty hunter buddying up with Charles Grodin. In "Showtime" and "Meet The Parents" he comes on too heavy, while he's just lost in "The Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle.""Analyze This" uses DeNiro's rep as filmdom's most formidable gangster and turns it on its head in a Billy Crystal head-above-water caper that mixes "What About Bob" with "The Freshman," with middling results.Sometimes the problem is one of tone. The film can't decide whether it wants to be heavy, with scenes of realistic violence and tension, or farcical, like Crystal's scenes with his patients or his appearance at the big meeting near the end. Sometimes, the plot is at fault. There are two cold openings that are equally superfluous, one showing the infamous 1957 meeting of the New York mobs at Appalachin that took place more than 40 years before anything else in the film, then another showing an attempted hit on DeNiro that establishes nothing except he's a gangster, as if that wasn't already in the audience's mind from watching "Mean Streets," "Goodfellas," and all those other movies of his.There are some good comic moments that work in isolation, like what should have been the film's opening, when Crystal's Dr. Sobel listens to patient Molly Shannon whine about her ex until he nearly loses it in a hilarious dream sequence. He still manages to send her away crying despite himself. That scene is funny, as is the first meeting between Dr. Sobel and his goombah wanna-be client. "You don't hear the word 'No' a lot," Sobel asks. "Yeah, only it's more like 'no, no, please, no,' DeNiro's Paul Vitti replies.DeNiro delivers that line well, and some others. But for such a solid gold actor, he's inconsistent. He was funnier as Al Capone in "The Untouchables," where he could be outrageous and roll with it. Here he seems torn between letting it out and pulling it in, like with his crying scenes, which are lame. He doesn't seem to enjoy being in comedies too much, yet he keeps doing them. Why? I've seen his house. He doesn't need the work.There are good ideas, but then there are bits that go nowhere, like Lisa Kudrow's whiny fiance and that Samoan son with the wisecracks. Bill Macy (not William C. of "Boogie Nights" fame but the husband on TV's "Maude") has a brief bit as Sobel's father, which establishes there is some resentment. Then he goes away, and the tension is left unresolved.The ending is particularly contrived. That a mobster needs a shrink, sure it works, and can go in some interesting directions, as "The Sopranos" later showed. But then having Sobel thrust in the role of representing the family in the big meeting, and scoring points off Vitti's chief rival (Chazz Palminteri, who also plays his character too hard for the lightness of the surrounding material) in front of Gangland, USA, just beggars credibility. So does the swim in the shark tank.The problem keeps coming back to DeNiro. He has one or two great scenes, like his phone call to his rival after an attempted hit ('That was going great until the cut off your balls part' Dr. Sobel interjects.) Then he just grimaces and makes broad gestures for a while. He can't adjust because the tone of the script throws him, but a better comic actor would make adjustments. DeNiro's great at what he does, but it's like asking Pedro Martinez to throw knucklers.One great thing about the movie is the end credits. Forget what's on screen. There's Louis Prima on the soundtrack, playing "Angelina" and "Zooma Zooma" to a rapt audience. Now that's entertainment. What it has to do with the rest of the movie other than the guy was Italian, I don't know, but at least that's one incongruity in "Analyze This" I can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For solid acting and superb, fitting music, it's confusing to place why ANALYZE THIS is lacking. De Niro, while joking about his role, turns it into something unbearable, almost annoying, to listen to until the end of the movie. Crystal, was introduced perfectly as Ben, but then dragged around until, right at the end, had a nice ending. Many jokes hit as much as they miss and this critique needs as much therapy as the movie does.The 'Big Meeting' is coming up and after a friend gets murdered, mob boss Paul Vitti is getting anxiety attacks. A family psychiatrist, who was at the wrong place, wrong time scenario now has to help our mob boss out, while trying to sort out his own life problems.The true draw of ANALYZE THIS is the chemistry between De Niro and Crystal, which works out swell. But the character studies between both actors just drags on trying to level out the playing field between them. Ben and Paul spend the entire movie finding each other's faults basically. And sometimes that's funny, but plenty of other times it just does not work. I'm pretty sure the world would be a more sane place if we could all just hit a pillow like Paul does. It's your call!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I am normally a big fan of Robert Dinero and Billy Crystal separately, after watching this movie I don't think they should do another one together if it is going to be like this one. While I will admit I laughed frequently it was almost as frequently as I sighed with regret.The movie opens with the brief history of the last sixty or so years of the mob families and how they got to their current state of disunion. Next we are introduced to the current head of the New York branch of the "Family," Paul Vitti (Robert Dinero). Mr. Vitti seems fairly well adjusted until he is nearly killed in a drive-by shooting that claims the life of one of his close family friends and fellow mobster and sends Mr. Vitti into a series of panic attacks and anxiety driven mood disorders that continue through nearly the rest of the movie.The first we see of Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) is the portrayal or Dr. Sobel's fairly boring client?le in his run-from-home psychiatrist career. While he enjoys what he does, his practice is overshadowed by his fathers. As a much bigger name in the business, Ben Sobels father has published books and is a close friend of the Mayor and loves to rub it in his son's face.The two main characters meet after Dr. Sobel accidentally gets into a car accident with one of Mr. Vittis henchmen and is hurried away to keep him from seeing anything incriminating. So after being bullied and having his patients bribed out of his office Dr. Sobel agrees to try to treat Mr. Vitti (who thinks that every minor breakthrough is the life changing cure-all he needed). From that point on it just gets worse. From there on it just gets worse. Bad choice after bad choice ends up with Mr. Vitti ruining Dr. Sobels wedding, twice, getting him investigated by the FBI, and eventually attending a Mob Boss Meeting in his place.The portrayal of Mr. Vitti's issues was both funny and pretty accurate. From his random breakdowns brought on by TV commercials to his inability to concentrate while "spending quality time" with his Mistress there is a good picture of what a stress induced disorder would look like in my opinion.While I must admit that Mr. Vittis portrayal of his anxiety disorder, his mood swings, and his random panic attacks was believable and fairly accurate I have to say that I hope they were not attempting to accurately portray a psychiatrist. The uninterrupted series of unprofessional and unethical practices engaged in by Dr. Sobel eventually cause him to blunder to a semi-happy ending with a seemingly well-adjusted Mr. Vitti in jail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete mis-match of talent...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear.Billy Crystal and DeNiro skate around parody and seriousness with scant regard to realism. Not being a great Crystal lover but an ardent DeNiro fan, I mistakenly thought that Robert could out-act Billy's constantly dismal, panicky characters. But I was wrong; the parts where DeNiro cries are amazingly bad. The rest of the movie isn't much more believable, nor does it inspire one to suspend disbelief.Unnecessary drawn out scenes throughout the first two thirds of the movie are then replaced by short cuts to 'wrap things up'. As a comedy it didn't make me laugh, as a serious violent gangster film it didn't make me wince with pain, and as a movie it didn't keep me glued to my seat. All in all it seems as though Billy Crystal (one of the producers) is on a slippery downward slope to permanently being associated with awful movies, and he wasn't very far up the slope in the first place.Unfortunately, it now seems that he insists on taking great talent down with him.Please don't rent this movie... it only encourages him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analyze This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this gangster crime comedy (which there aren't many of that I know of), and I knew I wanted to try it, from director Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Bedazzled). Basically psychiatrist Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) has problems with his parents not wanting him to get married to Laura MacNamara (Friends' Lisa Kudrow), being under-looked because of his doctor father Isaac (Bill Macy), and his patients not giving him challenging problems. Manhattan mob boss Paul Vitti (Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro) suddenly has sudden anxiety attacks and is having some sort of nervous breakdown, crying for almost no reason and feeling like he's losing his mind. After coincidently crashing into his car and given his contact card, Paul turns up at Ben's office wanting his help to analyse him in two weeks, before a big mob meeting. Being in the company of the mob, and with his wedding to Laura coming up, Ben definitely feels challenged now, mainly for his and others safety, and called upon by Paul almost 24 hours. Ben, while at the same time trying to keep things under control, is trying to get through to Paul, but his mob ways and not great attitude to things "normal" are a big problem. Ben does eventually make a breakthrough when Paul confesses that he feels responsible for his father's death, and as thanks Paul makes Ben attend the big meeting while he is late. In the end, Paul and all the other mob bosses are arrested, but Ben manages to get married in his second wedding, very quickly, and keeps in contact with Paul. Also starring Joe Viterelli as Jelly, Chazz Palminteri as Primo Sidone, The Grinch's Molly Shannon as Caroline and Max Casella as Nicky Shivers. De Niro does really well with his regular GoodFellas gangster persona and comic one-liners, Crystal is great as the pressured shrink, and while it is mainly the dialogue that gets the laughs, it is good fun. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean it! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!Why is it so hard to make good comedies anymore? Maybe someone should clone Mel Brooks so we can have something to watch that's actually funny.While I like Robert DeNiro in some roles (Awakenings, Men of Honor, The Untouchables, more) he really should be more selective about what he signs up for. Be more like Robert Redford who is so selective he rarely makes a bad film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ANALYZE THIS (1999) ***1/2 Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, Joe Viterelli, Chazz Palminteri, Bill Macy, Molly Shannon, Pat Cooper. Hysterically funny high concept comedy with De Niro having a lot of fun as a John Gotti-like goodfella trying to get over his sudden mid-life crisis of anxiety by hooking up with put upon shrink Crystal (in arguably his funniest turn yet) whose upcoming nuptials only make things more complicated: think `What About Bob?' (come to think of it, very appropriate indeed) adapted by Scorsese only here it crackles in all the right places thanks to seriously funny funnyman Harold Ramis who directs with fine comic aplomb and co-wrote with Peter Tolan and Kenneth Lonergan. Viterelli, the homeliest man since Walter Matthau, steals every scene as long-time tutti Jelly who gives great deadpan. Fuhgeddaboudit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romping good, funny gangster movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this film when it came out, and now again when my neighbor, Ron, loaned it too me. Frankly I had forgotten how good it is. DiNero is the gangland boss who is having panic attacks because everything seems to be about to go wrong. Quite accidentally he hooks up with head doc, Billy Crystal, who just wants to be left alone while he gets married (Lisa Kudrow). Crystal and DiNero are great and funny throughout. My favorite, laugh-out-loud scene is near the end, Crystal pretending to be DiNero's "consigliari", and he turns to "Jelly" (Fr Pete look-alike), slaps him hard, and says, "Don't ever correct me in public." The look on Jelly's face is priceless.There's no message in this film. Just good fun of watching Crystal and DiNero with a funny script. I understand they are about to come out with the sequel, "Alanyze That." Anyone who rates this film less than "7" or "8" just has no sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psychiatrist Billy Crystal starts treating insecure crime boss Robert DeNiro in this hit-and-miss comedy that never does work near as well as it could have. The routine wears thin pretty fast and we are left we a movie that just never does entertain or interest the audience. Once again DeNiro does all that he can, but for some reason he just does not feel right in a film that goes strictly for laughs. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but they could have made such a better movie! Almost everything is disappointing in the movie from the scenario which could have been much better and funnier to the promising cast who seems to have been very lazy about their performance! Robert De Niro is not always very convincing when he `cries', Billy Crystal is less funny than he used to be, and Lisa Kudrow's character alternates between a `Friends' weird Phoebe' style and a normal and not interesting style! Nevertheless there are some few very good scenes? but a few ones because just one came to my mind! It's the parody of the scene of `Godfather' where the Don is shoot! Very good parody! What a shame that the movie is so irregular! (5/10)PS: I prefer the French title which is `Mafia Blues' (a little bit more original...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies about gangsters where the violence is watered down to pre-school level don't really convince me. This is not a side splitter - and it doesn't have the originality of the Director's famous and more successful effort, Groundhog Day.There's a few tolerable laughs - but when nearly every line is played for laughs it becomes like a stand-up comedian forced to keep going for 90 minutes. The cameo by Billy Crystal towards the end is a real treat though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When tired clichs combine with big egos the result is predictable. De Niro makes an attempt to mock his own roles in more serious movies and become a comedian, which he is not.Billy Crystal is trying to make an attempt to make a transition from a comedian to a serious actor, which he is not. Kudos to Kudrow for making a valiant attempt to energize the movie.The plot is initially interesting but the action gets bugged down by the slow rhythm and very predictable scenes. Analyze This is too boring for a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even Billy Crystal wasn't funny, and Robert DeNiro's best comedy lines seemed to be "I'm f---in' gonna kill him" or "You ain't f---in' gonna do that" or forty or fifty other phrases containing "f---in'". Of course, the masterful "Shove it up your -ss" and its variation (I paraphrase) "I'm gonna f---in' rip his arm off and stick it up his -ss" will make sure DeNiro's comic genius is not forgotten. Then there were the crying scenes. I still don't know whether he was that bad on purpose. There was one funny line by Lisa Kudrow as she asked, in front of her parents, if Billy Crystal would like a drink. Is that line worth recommending the movie for? No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Sobol is a successful New York psychiatrist. When he accidentally hits the car of mob boss Paul Vitti they exchange business cards for insurance purposes. Later when Vitti begins to suffer dizzy spells and suffer from anxiety attacks etc he decides to visit Sobol to get secret treatment ? however how can you treat someone who solves all his problems with muscle?It could have been so very, very good. The actors, the director the subject ? all seemed like it couldn't go wrong, and it didn't??it just didn't go right either. The pot is paper thin and pretty irrelevant really. The main thing here are the laughs. However much of the jokes are easy shots at De Niro sending himself up or Sobol being a typical Jew ? all the easy bases are covered and it doesn't do anything really funny or clever. That's not to say it's not funny, because it is, but you can't help feel that this didn't take a lot of writing to make it happen.Crystal can't help but be funny (although his Oscar's shows have been the best bit of his career recently), but here he has to stay within the limits of his stereotypical role. Likewise De Niro ? often a good touch at comedy ? is stuck with cliches and nothing else. Likewise Paminteri just seems happy to be opposite these two heavy weights. Lisa Kudrow just about shakes off the Phoebe air but doesn't have too much to do here.Overall this is amusing. It's not as funny as you'd expect from Ramis and Crystal but it has a few giggles. However the jokes and the characters are lazy and never get above clich to get anything clever or different out of it. Shortly after this movie, the Sopranos started on UK TV ? people assumed that the Sopranos was a copy of this film but really there is no comparison between the two ? one is clever and the other is formulaic.....simple as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally satisfying, but mediocre compared to what it could have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With two great comedic leads and a great director behind the camera, `Analyze This' is still a little lacking. It sounds to be a lot better than it actually is. It combines the familiar comedy talents of the delightful Billy Crystal with Robert De Niro who made his comic turn in `Meet the Parents' two years later. Harold Ramis, who is brilliant at all levels of comedy (Ghostbusters, Bedazzled, Groundhog Day), directed it.The result isn't bad, but could have been better. You can see that De Niro's getting tired of being a gangster in movies, even if he appears to be having fun in the role. Billy Crystal is rather convincing as the annoyed psychiatrist. But the pairing of the two doesn't gel as well as it should. As far as the acting goes, the worst part goes to Phoebe Buf? I mean Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's fiance. She was a bad choice for the role and tries to hard to avoid her more colourful `Phoebe' image. Basically, she plays the same role, only without the kooky ditzy qualities and loveable paranoia, which isn't as fun. I'll give credit where credit is due; there are some decent laughs that bring about a chuckle. But there's also some gratuitous and rather irrelevant material that gives it a muchly inappropriate R rating. While some good laughs are pleasant, there are simply not enough of them. A sequel has been made recently, the ably titled `Analyze That'. The ending doesn't leave room open for a follow-up but if it's slightly superior to this, then I'm not complaining. Overall, `Analyze This' is an OK gangster comedy, but the similarly themed `Mickey Blue Eyes' was far superior and giving the talent that was present, it could have been better. It ranks as being average at best. 5.4/10.</fullReview>

A half hour short maybe. The basic idea was presented and hit over the head again and again. It was all variations on the same joke! Second, I'm no prude, but did there have to be so much swearing? It was constant! It wasn't funny or realistic, just annoying. Third...acting. Crystal has always annoyed me and this doesn't change my mind. De Niro...he's a wonderful DRAMATIC actor...he's is horrible at comedy. The scenes where he had to cry were embarrassing. Lisa Kudrow was pathetic! I like her a lot (she was wonderful in "The Opposite of Sex"), but she was just shrill and annoying here. Also her performance was SOOOOO wooden! The only scene that worked was a parody from "The Godfather"...it wasn't funny but it did work! A dull, foul-mouthed, stupid comedy. Miss it at all costs!</fullReview>

The rest of the time he's more like a guest on the set (he's also the executive producer which may explain his damp demeanor). The writing on this is real corporate committee hackwork. You can almost hear the separate voices of the different contributors, none of whom had any feel for the milieu or subject. Is this the end of Rico? Ahnnn?</fullReview>
