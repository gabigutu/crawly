		<shortDescription>One of my top ten favorite movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm weird but this film really struck a chord with me. What a tender and moving little love story..definitely a woman's movie, romantic and sweet. Sandy Dennis is at her quirky best in the role of Sara Dever...and Anthony Newley at his most attractive and wonderful as charming Charlie Blake is a perfect casting match.There is terrific music by Leslie Bricusse, a fine performance by Theodore Bikel as a crusading vegetarian signmaker....but mostly there is this incredible growth of love between Sara and Charlie that is a delight to watch from the first frame to the last..and an incredible bittersweet ending that has me in tears EVERY time I see it. This movie SINGS to me.A lost and forgotten gem of a play made into a movie Sweet November is a must see for anyone who has ever been in love ...and lost. Don't miss this one!!!! It is a definite KEEPER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't tell you how thrilled I was to learn I have kindred spirits out there who love Sweet November as I do. I don't know a soul who's even heard of this movie, let alone counts it among their favorites. Thanks to divine providence, I caught this little treasure while channel surfing in the wee, small hours of the morning over 20 years ago. Everything about it was magical--the charming Greenwich Village-y coach house setting, Michel Legrand's lush background music, the unusual premise, but, of course, above all, the actors. Sandy Dennis is just right as the beguiling Sara Deever..."partly woman, but mostly child." The supporting cast was wonderful, especially Theodore Bikel. But it was Anthony Newley as the tender, oh-so- endearing "wisenheimer" Charlie Blake that stole my heart and made this movie unforgettable. When he lays "a thousand Novembers" at Sara's feet begging her to let him stay forever...well, the lump in my throat was the size of a goose egg. I was so saddened by Mr. Newley's untimely death, but just as Charlie whispers to Sara at the end, I, too,..."will always remember."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been over thirty years since I saw Sweet November, and the final scene is indelible in my mind. The utter sadness of that scene. But I don't remember Sweet November as a sad movie; it was uplifting, making you look at life with gleaming fresh eyes. The 1968 version, Sandy Dennis/Anthony Newley, is a favorite of mine.Watching the 2001 re-make made me long for my old friend, the original Sweet November.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never intended watching Sweet November. I'd never even heard of it. I was flicking through the channels and it just leaped out and grabbed me. I don't what it was, the wonderful, light, witty dialogue that reminded me of Noel Coward at his best, or the tangible chemistry between Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley. Whatever it was I just couldn't stop watching. It was like snuggling up with someone you love on a windswept winters night or shuffling through fallen autumn leaves. Watching this film filled me with a wonderful inner glow and I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>neglected masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Anthony Newley passed away in 1999 I was disappointed,to say the least,at the lack of television tributes that would normally accompany such an event.A brief note at the end of Eastenders was the best that the BBC could muster.The one exception,somewhat suprisingly,came from the fledgling Channel 5 and took the form of a showing of the film Sweet November.I must confess that at the time I had not heard of this film and it was only by chance that I happened to be over at My brother,s house at the moment of its broadcast.For the following two hours I sat mesmerised by a film that represents for me,the very best work that Newley ever did within the medium of film.The opening minutes of the film offer little indication of the true nature of what is to follow,as an unfashionably clad,and strangely uptight Anthony Newley has a chance encounter with a free spirited young lady,who epitomises all that the rigidly conventional Mr Newley would appear to despise.These opening scenes are possibly the most demanding on the viewer,as representing conventional characters came about as easily to Anthony Newley as it does now to Jack Nicholson,or Dennis Hopper.As the storyline unfolds however,the viewer is taken on board a magical rollercoaster of alternating pain and whimsy as the process of liberation,initiated by the promise of a transient love,brings both spiritual regeneration and inconsolable loss to Anthony Newley,s urban changeling.A storyline ,that would in less capable hands than the superlative ensemble cast and director,might descend into empty schmaltz,is carried to an unforgettable finale.I urge all those with a suitably open mind to take the opportunity to share in this neglected masterpiece.</fullReview>

The story was so powerful that it has lasted in my memory for 3 decades. Maybe it was because it was the kind of love that i longed for; one that is total and complete. Then ends never to be found again.</fullReview>

The characters are from a different world, a different time, one that a lot of us would like to find. For the time, giving someone a key to your house, or even leaving the doors unlocked was not unheard of. This is a true love story, and such a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartfelt romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has so much heart. Charlie Blake is transformed from inside out into a lovable man by the eccentric and kookie Sara Deever. He learns life isn't about boxes 4 sides and dull His habits are conquered as he learns not to race thru like "hurry, hurry ding, ding". Sara is the woman of the future taking on her projects (men) each month another. All to forget what might be her sadest secret. There is a beautiful poem to the film with the same title and it is the closing song as well. I found this little gem of a film on the telly one night several years ago when I could no longer sleep. It is rather simple, unique and quippy. If you have a chance to catch it, it will be worth your while!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful and charming film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandy Dennis stars as a kooky, but kind girl who takes a different man under her wing every month and works to resolve their problems. In doing so, she seeks to take her mind off her own troubles. This was a great vehicle for the supremely gifted Dennis who, by this time, had already won the Oscar for her supporting role in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? and took the starring role in UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE. As irresistable and memorable as she was in these two films, I think she leaves an even more indelible impression with SWEET NOVEMBER. Co-star Anthony Newley, who plays her conquest for November, indeed contributes some fine moments, but this is Dennis' film all the way. There is no way that the remake, scheduled for release next year, will be able to hold a candle to this gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet &amp; Tender Film Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Possible Spoilers*** OK, the overall plot does unfortunately suffer from a heavy dose of implausibility. However, if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and simply enjoy the ride from the outset, including the whole look and feel of the '60's (I was born in this decade, and always love living it vicariously through films), the clothes, her adorable apartment (I notice more of the interior design of her apartment with every viewing), and of course, above all else, their tender love story and the road on which Dennis' character leads Newley's, you'll be in for a very real treat. I can be a very harsh critic when films are set in "reality" but clearly have a very implausible storyline, but I make an exception with this film. It's unfortunate, but I have heard/read somewhere that Anthony Newley and Sandy Dennis did not get along at all during the making of this film. That fact alone is a testament to the strength of their performances, because their chemistry was so wonderful on screen. I was never much of an Anthony Newley fan prior to seeing this film, because I was too little during his heyday, and never really took to "children's films" during that time either, such as The Chocolate Factory and Dr. Doolittle. However, in this film, he was absolutely charming.***SPOILER COMING***The scene in her bedroom loft in which he professes his love for her is one of the most genuine and tender love scenes (conversation only) I've ever seen on film. Whenever I watch this scene, I feel as if I were truly eavesdropping on a very private conversation between two people. Newley's slight mockery of Dennis' knack for going wackily off-subject during this conversation was just a beautiful little dance of dialog. He is just SO English!...he's adorable. Also, it was sweet to notice his first having a very hard time climbing the "stairs" in her apartment, but, toward the end of his "month", he's mastering them with finesse, without even needing to clutch the side railings. Finally, the "1,000 Novembers" he wants to give her make you hope that she will take him up on his offer, once and for all.Beneath the storied romance of this movie, and Newley's beautiful, tender charm, there is an underlying message provided in large part by Sandy Dennis' character and brilliant performance. Though her character on surface appears to be very much of a free spirit, heavy on whimsy and light on logic, she is the one who makes the stronger impression on Newley than he on her, seemingly, at least, effecting more change in him than he in her. She slowly leads him to look at life as well as his role in it in a different manner, and his character is forever enriched as a result.If you haven't seen this film, find it (you can get it on Amazon on VHS....I wish they'd offer it on DVD), make yourself a cup of tea, curl up under the covers, listen to this story and watch these characters. "Sweet November" is very touching....tender, sad, romantic, and warmly moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with enduring themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friends of mine who have watched Sweet November (1968) have commented on its implausibility. Without revealing the plot, it can be said that certainly a little "willing suspension of disbelief" will be required to appreciate this film fully.And yet, ironically, the plot of Sweet November itself seems to be an exploration of the costs of "plausibility" and the benefits of creativity, of taking time to absorb meaning, and to appreciate the "implausible" wonders of everyday life. Without doubt this was a big theme of the 1960s (especially Hollywood of the 1960s) but it still seems pretty relevant and enduring today. There is a very rich layer of philosophy beneath this film's windswept, romantic exterior, strangely overlooked by the professional critics.Much of this philosophy is embodied in the film's brilliant lead, Sandy Dennis. Her character is a wonderful departure from the typical romantic heroine. Dennis' surface vulnerability conceals a wise and unforgettably strong character, a person who gets to the heart of things by indirection rather than through precision. Dennis' Sara Deever slowly leads Anthony Newley's Charlie Blake to a new way of seeing the world and his place in it, and he's forever changed from having known and loved her.Again, the details of the plot are best left to the film itself. Suffice it to say that intelligent acting, a distinctive and intriguing storyline, even poetry are all contained in "Sweet November". One couldn't ask for much more in a film than that.</fullReview>

I find it hard to believe that when I mention it is my favorite movie of all time, people I talk to do not even recognize the name of the movie. My second favorite movie is Dr. Zhivago; kind of gives one an idea of how much I enjoy this movie. As far as I'm concerned, they don't come any better than this one.

		<fullReview>Wow, I can't believe there are others out there that remember this film. I first saw about 20 yrs ago on a lazy Saturday afternoon on TV. It was one of those Saturday afternoon at the movies type deals back in 1980. I had never heard of it before, but when I saw who was staring in it, Sandy Dennis, it caught my attention as I have always liked her acting.I laughed, I cried - LOL all that good stuff that comes with a good flick. I have never seen it since that time and have always searched for it in video stores and clubs and have never been able to find it again, let alone find someone else who ever even heard of this movie!!And once I found it in a TV guide listing airing in the wee-hours of the morning, but I missed it because I read the listing the day after it aired. So I still search for it and hope to get to tape it when it plays again on TV.Does anyone know if it is available anywhere to purchase????I really wanna see this movie again!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look past the implausible storyline and you'll discover a romantic gem of a film that doesn't deserve its obscurity.Sandy Dennis stars as Sara, a woman who is described as "temporary," since she is suffering from an undisclosed terminal ailment (perhaps the same one that killed Ali MacGraw a couple of years later in "Love Story"). Sara takes in new man each month, part of her plan to help as many flawed males as she can during her limited time. Anthony Newley is her project for November. Newley also sings the haunting title song. If you're looking for a romance with a fresh angle, seek out "Sweet November"--but don't forget the tissues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge Sandy Dennis fan. Her acting was disparaged by unkind critics, but to me acting is less about doing than about being. Sandy was a great human being and she shines in the few films I have had a chance to see.This one I saw decades ago and remember only the basic outline, and I remember loving it utterly. It has the intimacy of chamber music. The unusual plot intrigued me very much. Why don't they show it more often? I also liked the fact that for a change, the main character is a woman who knows what she wants, and is not just a feather in a man's cap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always believed that a young man encounters a moment in his life wherein he has to make a decision with this thing called love. I saw this movie first when I was 13 years old. It was during the christmas holidays, and they were playing it at around 2 am in the morning. This movie had such a profound impact in this young man that I swore that if I ever loved, I would do my darndest to be so unique and memorable that I would capture the heart of that woman forever. Such was Sarah Deever's goal. To make herself be remembered by touching a man's life each month until her death. Unfortunately, she met someone so uncanny, that she fell in love with him, and he with her.Gosh, it's been so many years since I've seen this film, but I can never forget the last scene wherein she had her back turned towards the door, right behind her was the new man (December), and Sweet November (Anthony Newley) was standing by the door asking (pleading) with her to marry him and give her the love that she craved and deserved. It was such a beautiful, yet such a painful moment. Sarah wouldn't budge, and November walked out into the cold snowy night singing of his love for her that would never come to pass.I still vaguely remember the poem that November wrote:Sarah Partly young, Partly wild Mostly woman, No, Mostly child.Gosh, this movie still brings me to tears. So poignant. So passionate. Such a beautifully done movie, and the characters - you'd fall in love with them once you got to know them.Several years ago, I read that Sandy Dennis (Sarah in the movie) died at the early age of 53. I mourned her loss. However, I will always have the memory of her in this movie. How she impacted this young man for the rest of her life - and she never even met me! How ironic!YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE! I think that I have said enough!</fullReview>

Sadly more people probably know the remake and will be put off watching the original. Quite simply in a quiet, dignified way I think this is one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

As the other user comment on this site indicates, it is a tender, moving, love story and is probably primarily a "woman's movie." But I am a man and I have to say I loved and enjoyed it.

		<shortDescription>Whether it gives you goosebumps or hives will depend on your sweet tooth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As stuffed with fluff as any piece of taxidermy you're likely to encouter this side of Fiji, "Sweet November" is the quintessential teddy bear film. It wants to be all cute and cuddly and kind of squishy in the middle. Herman Rauscher's script-a document best handled at arm's length with a pair of forceps while wearing a gas mask-begins life as a screwball comedy. About halfway through it notices that it isn't very funny and decides to become "La Traviata" instead. Exactly when you're supposed to go all warm and fuzzy inside is announced in no uncertain tones by Michelle Legrand's score, which coagulates into syrup at the appropriate moments. It gives me heartburn.Until such time as prohibited by international law, the ferry scene, when shown repeatedly for a matter of hours to the forcibly restrained viewer, could prove an invaluable asset to our intelligence services as a means of extracting testimony from uncooperative witnesses. It opens with the two lovebirds cooing over the New York Times crossword puzzle on board the ferry. In Charlie's edition he has scrawled Sara's name everywhere he can squeeze it in. Making goo-goo eyes at her, he reveals his solution to the puzzle, twittering, "A four-letter word for wonderful...Sara. A four-letter word for magnificent...Sara. A four letter word for..."etc. Before the camera pans, Sara is choking back tears and flinging her arms around Charlie accompanied by a crescendo of mushy music. As you watch the scene progress, it grows increasingly more difficult to overcome the impression that you are sinking into a pit of lukewarm oatmeal. The complexion turns green, the eyes roll back in their sockets, and the teeth begin to chatter. At this stage, it is imprerative to keep reminding yourself that you are NOT going to swallow your tongue. It is only a matter of time before the convulsions subside, free breathing is restored, and you can scream again. Coprophilia, infanticide, matricide, high treason, the Kennedy assassination, even-God save us-enjoying "The Jerry Springer Show"-it really makes no difference. After two hours of the ferry scene you'll confess to anything.If it never soars on the wings of the dove, "Sweet November" never hits bottom either despite the soggy script. Buoyant performances by the cast, particularly the two lead actors, keep it afloat. Sandy Dennis (mostly teeth) redeems this strain of comedy as well as anyone and can produce two Tony awards won in similar roles as credentials. Her touch makes silly phrases like "hurry, hurry ding-ding" dance. Anthony Newley (mostly eyebrows) brings a gift for comedy and the ability to meld the pragmatic CEO and the mischievous imp with the sheepish grin into one character. At times Newley's eyebrows seem to be leading a life of their own. They rush up and down his forehead like two ferrets chasing a hare, occasionally leaping off his face altogether.As the credits roll whether the taste left in your mouth is one of vibrant emotionality or cheesy sentimentality will be determined by your sweet tooth and tolerance for banality. If you like Debbie Reynolds, crave chocolate ice cream smothered in chocolate syrup, and can blubber your way through three boxes of Kleenex watching "Love Story"--this is your ticket. Close your eyes, click your heels together, and repeat three times, "There's no place like the perfume department at Nordstrom's." However, to the more sensitive soul, who reacts to the kind of verse found in flowery greeting cards by breaking out in hives, extreme caution is advised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small but charming film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess that I did not know about this film, "Sweet November" released in 1968. It was Turner Classic Movies that introduced me to it. I was only aware of the remake with Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron. However, this film, with Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley, is far superior. The plot, as mentioned by others, is rather implausible: quirky woman Sarah (Dennis) has a different man living with her every month. For November, she chooses Charlie (Newley). He moves in with her with the agreement it will be for November only. The result is wonderful: her free spirit works on his uptight one, and this unexpected match seems to click. Sarah teaches Charlie to fulfill his dream of writing poetry and being a dreamer, and he teaches her to fall in love. I won't give away the very touching ending or why it is that Sarah has a different man every month and doesn't want to get emotionally involved. What really surprised me is how much I liked this film. The acting of the two main characters are what makes this odd little movie work. Some folks did not care for Sandy Dennis' somewhat neurotic acting style, but it works quite well for her character in this film. I was not aware much of Anthony Newley at all, but he is great here: charming and handsome, and yes, also somewhat neurotic. The film also shows us New York City, circa 1968, and Sarah's apartment is great and quirky, just like her. We lost both Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley much too young!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic tosh, incurable whimsy, but brightened by sunny handling...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "Sweet November" features Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley in the leads, the real stars of this picture turn out to be the talented art directors--and also that amazing New York City skyline, circa 1967. Plush romantic comedy is weighted with flibbertigibbet whimsy and sentiment, however it looks good enough to eat. The pathos are never too annoying because the look of the film (and also the music score by Michel Legrand) is so inviting. Opening with one of those fabulous aerial shots of the Big Apple which marked many a theatrical feature and TV series intro in the 1960s, we soon meet Newley as a British box manufacturer and Dennis playing a 23-year-old landlord (they have a meet-cute at the DMV!). After some 20 minutes of colorless exposition, Dennis discloses her romantic situation: she takes one lover a month into her cozy abode, helping to mold the man's character before sending him on his way. Newley quickly agrees to be Mr. November, yet we never learn what attracts him to Dennis. Yes, she's rather adorable in a flaky, distracted sort of way, though her noodle-headed ramblings--mixed with sure-handed chatter about minute things like hardware and pigeons--would surely send most bachelors in the opposite direction. The heart of the story seems to go missing, as screenwriter Herman Raucher introduces other kooky characters while inching us toward a romantic showdown between the protagonists (the film is preconceived to be a valentine without getting the ingredients right). Dennis and Newley (a curious yet effective screen match) approach the wafty material carefully, and both are attractive and likable, but Newley plays his lines for laughs while Dennis is perhaps too rigid or prim. Their performances improve in the second-half, but what exactly is the girl teaching this huffy businessman...to reconnect with his inner-child? Perhaps living 'free' makes for less inhibitions in the bedroom, but the movie is too coy and glossy to discuss sex in a grown-up manner. It's a valentine all right, and a little soft in the middle. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classically bold 1960's homage to individual self-determination, sensitive, introspective and provocative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film as a very young adult when it first came out. I have never forgotten it. Sandy Dennis was a fabulous character actress who appeared in several movies containing socially provocative subject matters not previously well-explored in "polite circles"; in other words, in general release. For sure, there were other films addressing titillating lifestyle choices, but the overriding end-message was that if you stray from the accepted societal path, bad things will happen to you (Butterfield 8, Suddenly Last Summer, come to mind.)For those of us growing up in the '60s, society began changing in profound ways that afforded opportunities for self-expression and self- determination previously smothered in veneers of inhibition. Today,there is no societal inhibition...there is literally no subject matter that hasn't been addressed in graphic and/or grotesque detail. I believe a certain handful of films in the relationship genre will have real staying power (Brokeback Mountain). Other films may only be historically significant to individuals uniquely affected by that film, or to film buffs and other super-serious film students/teachers.Rarely does a remake of the original film meet or exceed the goal set by the original, perhaps because the times have just changed too markedly. That was certainly the case here. For me, the Charlize Theron reprise of Sandy Dennis's original role was almost unwatchable, and I like Charlize Theron. I just didn't much care about her, how she lived, or what fate befell her in the remake. Society had moved on.Now, the Hilary Swank characters in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby...there were young woman you could care about, as much as I cared about Sandy Dennis's character back in the day. Predictably, however, when those characters eschewed inhibition and embraced self-expression and determination, bad things happened. In our collective societal consciences, then, have we really moved on all that far?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise November</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie because of Sandy Dennis. I don't know a lot about Dennis but I have been watching her movies to become more familiar. She has a quirky way about her that it wonderfully exploited in this film. She never fully reveals why she does what she does with her men in this movie. Whether it is truly to provide therapy for her guests or if it is a clever way of having intimacy without commitment is no made clear since she has an angle in just about every other enterprise she runs.What makes this movie good is how well Dennis play the character which fits her quirkiness. While the movie is a great comedy, it has a compelling ending. Of course if you've seen the 2001 version, then it has already spoiled it for you. But if you, like me, have not watched the 2001 version because....well because then this movie will be very enjoyable. There is no Keneau stardom stardom to get in the way and you will enjoy the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Always November, that bitter-sweet month ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This odd 1960s film stars Anthony Newley and Sandy Dennis and is a perfect memory of a talented twosome. The story is fairly unusual - Charlie Blake, the uptight English manufacturer of boxes of the six-sided variety, meets Sara, a free spirit who lets apartments and collects and cures men with problems.Sandy Dennis has the perfect nervy personality as Sara, while Newley has fun as Charlie, visiting Monty's Mod Emporium to buy horrible sweaters, writing poems, and falling for the girl. Light on story but high on sentiment, 'Sweet November' is a lovely piece of escapism.Remade in the 1990s with Keanu Reeves, badly, this original version may look dated but is still well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bittersweet love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sweet November is directed by Robert Ellis Miller, written by Herman Raucher and stars Sandy Dennis,Anthony Newley and Theodore Bikel.Sara Deever(Sandy Dennis)is a kooky, kind hearted woman who takes a different lover each month on the condition that the man will leave her once the month is over, no exceptions. Her lover in November is Charlie Blake(Anthony Newley)the month starts out as usual for her but soon both realise they are falling in love with each other.Sara keeps pushing him away and Charlie becomes desperate to find out why. When he learns the truth it about breaks his heart and he's even more desperate than before to get her to make an exception and let him stay longer than a month.Sandy Dennis gives the best performance of her career after Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf and captures the vulnerable and kooky aspects of Sara perfectly. Anthony Newly gives a fine performance as Charlie and it's a shame he didn't become a much bigger star after this or do more romance films, he was very talented and very handsome too.Sweet November is a beautiful love story it's funny, poignant and romantic. Well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandy Dennis and November....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandy Dennis turns in another mesmerizing and moving performance in Sweet November. Here she loves and helps one man per month, because a week was too short a term and a year is too long. A month is perfect. They move in and she begins to help them with what they think they need or what she thinks they need. But at the beginning of the film, October is throwing a fit. She meets Anthony Newley while renewing their driver's licenses and he eventually becomes November. "I think November is going to be a sweet month," Sandy says. He can't move in though, because it's late October and to be fair, he has to wait until the first of November. He puts his job on hold. (His company makes boxes, you know those 6-sided ones.) "But why don't they ever make a 7-sided box?" Sandy asks. Sandy Dennis has never been as vulnerable and complex since her performance in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" And the film is expert at showing and handling the realities of love, loneliness, and dependency. But what's his problem? What does she do for him? Does he make such a impression on her life that she forgoes the routine of a new man a month? Do they live happily ever after? Watch "Sweet November." You may never see the month of November the same again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>November, think turkey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cloying whimsy with Sandy Dennis as Sarah an incurably ill woman who runs some unspecified "legitimate repair service" that apparently includes the men she takes in to her life and bed each month;she's lover, muse and mother. Sarah makes odd sounds when she sleeps, takes lots of medication, feels tired and cold on occasion, but spends most of her considerable energy, and apparently limited lifetime, prattling. That the men in the film or anyone would tolerate her or find her appealing is beyond me. 2 minutes with Sarah and you'll want to bolt. The script resembles a sitcom without laughs. The NYC locations circa 1968 are the only interesting thing in the film. Sweet November is a dud, the title song is awful and the remake is a terrible reworking of a bad idea. Dennis played an even drearier kook in Robert Altman's That Cold Day in the Park(69)in which she holds a young man against his will. Sweet November opened at Radio City Music Hall and pretty much disappeared. Watch it and you'll know why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Beautiful as Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tuned in late to a TCM broadcast and saw only the last 75 minutes of this captivating and genuine film. Rarely, rarely am I spontaneously moved to tears, not by tired devices, but by totally engaging believability. Even without the first 45 minutes (which I will now be sure to watch), my ears instantly warmed to the beautifully original writing, never distracted by the skillful and seamless direction. The dialogue rings true. It is original and whimsical, never squeezed into start and finish. Ms. Dennis and Mr. Newly are not Hollywood handsome and beautiful; they are real people, not packaged stars. The film resonates with humanity and heart; suspension of disbelief gladly given. Beautiful writing; sensitive direction. THIS is romance, like life itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whoa dude realllly deep man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine this my friends, Sandy Dennis in a quirky, mad capped, pseudo intellectual gab fast with strangers. Always maintaining a stuttering, breathless, staccato with bizarre non-sequitur observational quips, I already had my fill since viewing "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"!!After watching the less quirky version with Reeves and Theron, I read the reviews that claimed this older incarnation was a much more truthful and honest version and I succumbed. What a stupid dolt!The icing on the cake was both the 7 sided box and Mr. December who had his coat sleeve attack him. Now that's pure comedy for like 1927? Who wrote this script, I loathe your crackpot efforts to define an era.Anyone with a serious fatal chronic illness would not just have a bit of a chill OUTSIDE in the winter, or have a few medications to hide. What a disservice to those who truly suffer from complications of an incurable disease and wanting to have close connections to those they love. This film is a complete bore and has absolutely no redeeming values. I even discount the NYC scapes.This woman cheats men, her landlords, and most of all herself. I guess that everyone deals with their mortality in different ways. I am very impressed with this young girls escapism and manipulation of others for her own agenda. Wonderful impact and role model for future generations. I mean the author has you feeling sorry for this sub-human. Absolutely no recommend for super tripe. blech</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good deal of the film appeared to be inane with Sandy Dennis, a free-spirit and eccentric, helping men out of their problems on a month basis.The story becomes gripping, but unfortunately all too familiar with final illnesses the main culprit.Dennis is appealing as the emotionally balanced woman, eccentric at times, but justified once it comes out why she is doing what she is doing.Anthony Newley is very good as her November mate. His love for her comes fast and furiously.As the understanding vegetarian, Theodore Bikel shows understanding and wonderful emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this movie only because i was trying to find something on tv and i saw the title online. So i watched it and it was great. It was a little slow in the beginning, but the storyline of the movie makes it well worth the wait. I had no idea what this movie was about, the only thing i knew was the little premise i saw under the title and i glad i didnt know because the secret of the movie is what makes the whole thing great. I like the way they were able to show a quirky girl and why she acts so strange. The whole thing seems odd, but once you learn the truth you think, "i understand now". The ending of the movie is what is pretty sad. While watching the movie, i thought to myself, i cant believe hollywood hasnt done a remake, well they are doing a remake. I am sorry to say that keanu "no acting" reeves and charlize theron are cast as the leads. This sucks. Keanu is handsome,but i dont think he could do the part justice. As for charlize, i cant see her as sara no way. Oh well. I dont think the remake will be able to stand up to this good film. Now i have to wait until god knows when to tape the movie, if i would have known it was hard to locate, i would have taped it. anyway, if you cant see it, try to see the remake. i am not really sure who i think would be a good charlie, but i think a good sara would be calista flockhart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In scenic New York City, quirky apartment manager Sandy Dennis (as Sara Deever) meets English box manufacturer Anthony Newley (as Charles "Charlie" Blake) when she asks him to cheat during their driver's examinations. Feeling grateful and possibly guilty, Ms. Dennis meets Mr. Newley after the test to buy him a hot dog. Dennis quickly persuades Newley to look at a Brooklyn Heights apartment she is leasing. He moves in, but there are complications. The casting of Dennis and Newley as the irresistible young woman and her lovelorn paramour may be the real tragedy here; the situation, by Herman Raucher, is intriguing.***** Sweet November (2/8/68) Robert Ellis Miller ~ Sandy Dennis, Anthony Newley, Theodore Bikel, Burr DeBenning</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still cringe when I even think about this movie. I saw it on TV a couple years after it came out. I know that almost all movies are contrived in some ways, but the contrivances in this movie were too many, and too much to bear.Having said that, I take exception to the review by stmarseille14-1, in which he savages the movie on apparently political terms, as if it somehow single-handedly caused the destruction of (conservative) Western Civilization as we - or more accurately, HE/SHE and his/her ilk, know it. Or THINK they do.What a load of BS. This movie made nary a blip on the minds and consciousness of the "hippy dippy free love, free sex" people this person seems to loathe. One has to be simple-minded to even attempt to make such a connection. How many people at that time does this writer suppose actually even saw this movie, let alone were influenced by it? Sheesh. I found this movie to be a corny, syrupy confection on the order of Love Story. I recall having watched it to the end, but not because it was suspenseful or drew me in, or because the characters were spectacular, thought-provoking or charming. I think I was just too bored to turn it off or change the channel, or may I'd had a few drinks.If you actually liked Love Story, there is a very good chance that you will like Sweet November. Everyone else should avoid it like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet November epitomizes the 1960s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sweet November was one of those 1960s movies that aspired to be great. The conversations between the characters were incredibly talky like most 1960s Broadway plays and not like real people talk but hey it's a movie, why not? I was ready to buy into the fantasy. It's also fun to see New York as it was collapsing into Mayor Lindsay chaos. The sad thing is Sweet November ended up being propaganda to push a still somewhat uptight country into a complete breakdown of marriage. Infatuation is presented as "true love", perhaps the most destructive concept Hollywood ever foisted on an gullible public and the especially vulnerable Baby Boomers who were coming of age in Sacred '68. My god, one wouldn't even know how a woman behaved during her full menstrual cycle before your month of sexual access was over. How incredibly naive. Anthony Newley is quite compelling and gets you to root for him. How sad his career was about to implode. He was such a talent that he couldn't focus in one direction and go with it. We have nobody like him today. Too bad he wasted his talents promoting such a cancerous message to America.Now we have the fruit of Sweet November: an almost 50% illegitimacy rate and children growing up without fathers. Sweet November defies science that tells us women bond to the men they sleep with thanks to the wonder hormone "oxytocin". But the radical feminism so in vogue in those heady days of the 1960s of radicals like Germaine Greer was expressed in the plot that women must be sluts to destroy their dog-like devotion to men and be free of enslaving patriarchy. Sweet November is an interesting historical piece that someday will be exhumed to show why America collapsed from within.</fullReview>
