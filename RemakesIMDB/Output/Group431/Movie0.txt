		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on line. I wanted more information and came across this site. I then read the review about how bad this movie is... What a load of crap.. This is not just a movie. This is a story about life and relationships. There is a saying that goes. "The meaning of life, is to give life meaning." I think that is the message of this movie. Too many times people get wrapped up in stuff and glitz and all technology and everything else we have in this life that we forget that in the end... all we have is each other.The comments that the acting was not the best is crap too... it is harder to play the rolls these two actors portrayed than to play a bus-drivin super cop.GREAT MOVIE... SEE IT FIRST CHANCE YOU CAN...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Keanu a Break!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read several reviews for this movie, and I am very upset by them. All they have to say is how Keanu Reeves is such a bad actor. Frankly I am sick of everyone jumping on that bad wagon. A few people say that he's a bad actor, then everyone has to jump in and say it too. Sure, he could have done a few lines of this movie with more feeling, but that doesn't mean he deserves such awful critiques. When I was in the theater, several people around me were complaining of how it was the worst movie they ever saw. Here I was, still sitting there, trying to let my face return to normal color (I had cried a little). I was outraged. The viewers should have enjoyed it for what the movie was, a light romance, nothing more, nothing less. It wasn't supposed to be Oscar-winning, it was simply supposed to be romantic. Movies aren't always believeable, but that doesn't mean that it will automatically get bad reviews. It is really disappointing, because this movie was really good (and really sad).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really fail to see in "Sweet November" the faults that the previous reviewer saw. His cynical review does not do the movie, its story or its message justice.The acting is excellent, no doubt, but "annoying" is a comment from someone with his emotions firmly implanted where the sun does not shine, and communicates more about the reviewer than it does about the film.Also, it is not a fault per se, that the ending of a film is predictable and I tire of this being used as negative criticism. The message is in the story, and a surprise ending is the last thing this charming story needs, or thankfully, has.Oh, and since I used to be someone exactly like the Reeves character is the start of the movie, I can relate to what it is to discover that there is more to life. His character is real alright, but in the surreal sort of way that only those who have actually been there and escaped, truly understand. Now, if only I had had someone as charming as Ms. Theron to show me :-) Anyway, this is not an "epic" film or even a "great" film - its just a film with a story a few messages and some excellent performances that will tug on your emotions - not altogether a bad thing in a cynical age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a fan of love movies, but this one hurt me so bad! Keanu and amazing Charlize gave their best and created one of the best love stories ever. I couldn't believe that Keanu can play like that and convince me that Nelson fell in love for just one month.I like Sara's story and the way she chooses to live. Charlize, as beautiful as always, made Sara strong and weak at the same time.The great supporting role of drag queen Chaz Watley by Jason Isaacs. I never imagined he'd play something like this!This is the only movie that made me cry and that's why I ranked him with the highest mark. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(10 out of 10) I just saw "Sweet November" on TV by chance. I had no idea what it was about beforehand, and I have not seen the original. The result was a thoroughly moving experience. It's amazing how the same movie can hit people so differently. It's also incredible how one's mood can affect a person's reaction to a film. In my case, the movie caught me in the right mood and at the right stage of life. Thus, it completely hit the spot. I judge a movie based on how it makes me feel, and to what degree. I was falling asleep just before the movie came on, but once it started it woke me up immediately. I then felt slight anger, then some healthy laughter, and at one point I actually cried, which for me (as a 28-year-old macho guy) is a rarity. Was it the script, the plot, the actors' convincing performances, or just my own state of mind which allowed this film to speak to me? I don't know. All I do know is that I can now go to sleep, feeling utterly peaceful and fulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie because it is just real. Real people have things they are dealing with and are not always making their best choices--Nelson decides to come back a couple times. I really enjoy the effort of Sara to shine a light so Nelson can see simple pleasures in life, pleasures looked over when someone is so focused on getting an account and working long hours.I love this movie, own it, and have watched it several times. I find it rather coincidental that my refusal to watch, turning off the movie right before the end (on the morning of December 1) to remember the beauty of the movie--is the same action that Sara takes to remember the change in Nelson and the beauty of their loving relationship, right before the end.Sweet November is a fabulous movie. I hope the film reminds you to slow down and take a look at the important things in your life when you view it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps those who've written all the bad commentary about this movie need to sit back and just enjoy things every once in a while. This movie is a good example of a slightly sweet and cheesy plot being centered around some average actors, but it was a really good screenplay and EXCELLENT cinematography. Cinema students would do well to watch this movie and notice how the director used sets colors and music to set the scenes and mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film deserves a good review...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Especially since I am not really a fan of romantic comedies/drama. This is not really a comedy per se, as there is a dramatic element to it, and the performances should not be so easily dismissed.Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves look good together; Keanu is not playing a superficial action role, so the focus is not on him. This is a good thing, especially as we can then appreciate Charlize Theron's performance as Sara Deaver, a quirky girl who Nelson (Keanu) meets at the DMV in San Francisco. San Francisco is an interesting backdrop- the positive aspects of it are emphasized, and it becomes another character in the film.Jason Isaccs plays Chaz Cherry, the local cross-dresser who is Theron's friend and confidante. He does well in this, and last night I actually saw him in "Friends With Money", wherein his talent was literally wasted. Liam Aiken portrays Abner, who is quasi-adopted by Theron and Reeves, as their relationship develops.There are some funny scenes, like where Greg Germann (Reeves' co-worker at an ad agency) orders cappuccino and is told off by the waitress. Also where Reeves is presenting an ad campaign for hot dogs, and he eventually flips out.The film works because it is not a gushing romance film; I am not a big fan of Reeves but he was very good in this film. Theron was excellent, as always, and there are some beautiful shots of the Bay in San Francisco, a nice backdrop for a bittersweet romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron give good performances in Sweet November</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Sweet November was an above average romance movie. A few qualifiers are in order here. First, I never saw the original, second, I normally do not care for romantic movies, and third, I am a big fan of Keanu Reeves. The reviews are quick to call Nelson Moss a self absorbed work-aholic. The movie does bring out a little of Nelson's past explaining how he feared he would end up like his father and the rest of the neighbors on his block. Combine that with the high pressure in today's society to get ahead, and you can understand why Nelson is obsessed with work. Sara is very original and entertaining and makes you wonder if she's all there or what is she up to. After almost 90 minutes into the film, you will see why Sara is the way she is and maybe enjoy the movie. Keanu does a good performance with Nelson, creating a believable image of a single focused Ad Executive. One can see many women saying "typical male," and many men thinking of Nelson as a typical best buddy. As is true with many things in life, Nelson goes from one extreme to the other. In the end, Sara becomes his single focus in life. Trying to find the middle road is a central theme in many of Keanu's movie roles. I liked the acting in this film. It wasn't too dramatic nor was it bland. It was right down the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts on a sour note, but sweetens up as it goes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** "Sweet November" gets off to a bumpy start. Charlize Theron's character is first established as sort of a...well...borderline psychopath. Theron bumps into Keanu Reeves during a DMV exam. The two of them have a weird encounter in the parking lot. Later on, that night, she shows up at his apartment. He doesn't know how the hell she got his address. Since she failed the DMV exam, she asks him for a ride. Now, at this point, he should be terrified at this woman! He barely knows her and suddenly she asks him for a favor? After a long period of arguing, he finally succumbs to this favor. Then she breaks into this building and steals a dog. At this point Keanu should be even more terrified! But he keeps driving her. She invites him up to her place for cocoa. Again a conflict he finally succumbs to. She explains the whole "Spend a Month With Me and I'll Change Your Life" deal. Of course, at first he says no. He's a workaholic with no time for this crap. He makes a bad presentation for his advertising firm, he loses his temper and his job. Then he thinks, "What the hell. I'll go to this crazy b*tch's place and see what this is all about." He obviously can't stand her at first. The way she lives such a simple life, totally contradictory to his. Night falls, things heat up and the two of them are already in the sack! Now that's just a cheap attempt to have two hot actors heat up the screen. Keanu's character can't even stand being near her, yet he's suddenly ripping her clothes off and tackling her to the couch? Another one of those only-in-the-movies moments.Luckily, the film's appeal increases as it goes along. The performances by the two leads are strong, though I can't help but feel Charlize was a little miscast. For some reason, I don't picture her nebbish character as a beautiful woman with no facial blemishes. I mean, even Gwyneth Paltrow was convincing in "Bounce," because they didn't try to make her look beautiful. Half of the film she's wearing hardly any makeup. But that's a flaw I was able to look over. The point is the two characters are so likable and the two actors have such a cute chemistry that I couldn't hate this movie (past the 30-minute mark). The moments they share are genuine, and though I don't think Keanu's character arc would've been generated quite so successfully I was willing to look that over as well. Yes, this is moderately standard Hollywood fluff, but it works. And I was oddly captivated.I also wish I could've been given a better explanation about Charlize's whole "Spend a Month With Me" deal. It's a pretty strange concept, and something that should've been explained with more detail. You mean EVERY month she can actually get a guy to live with her, no strings attached? As if she's a guardian angel and she just patrols the streets of San Francisco looking for her next customer, who seemingly needs help? And I'm sure, out of all those guys, Keanu is not the first one she had actual feelings for. Women are more libidinous than you think. I also wanted a better explanation of the Jason Isaacs character. Was he gay or what? Maybe I misinterpreted, but did him and Charlize use to go out? Is he bisexual? And what was that whole family crisis that Charlize had to deal with? There's a good deal of loose ends in this story that were either not clearly explained or not explained at all. And this is not a Hitchcock thriller, so you can't tell me the characters and plotlines were meant to be enigmatic.I have to say, I did appreciate the ending. It wasn't overly sentimental, and I still found it sad and touching. And it sort of left things open-ended. One of those "Where Do I Go From Here?" conclusions. But someone did point out something interesting--the trailers almost ruined the film! You see, in the ads, Charlize lying in hospital bed with her face completely pale. Geez, I wonder what to expect? I assumed the plot was Charlize was dying and she wanted to spend the last days of her life with Keanu. It's times like this I wish they stuck with the teaser trailers."Sweet November" is not a great movie, but it's sad, touching, sometimes funny and contains two fine performances. It has an odd appeal to it. One of those films you want to keep on watching for no explicit reason. You don't know why you're into it, you just are. Maybe it's a guilty pleasure, maybe not. Who knows? But I'd be a lying, pretentious snob if I were to say I didn't like it. This is just my take.My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Autumn in New York in November</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when my best friend and I wanted to see a movie, this is strangely enough the first movie we ever saw together, sad start as this was just a pretty bad movie. Sweet November is another predictable pointless romantic movie that is trying too hard on the saps. Now I love Chalize Theron and Keanu Reeves, Charlize is an academy award winning actress with an awesome career, Keanu? well, woah. Their chemistry was on in The Devil's Advocate, so I guess they were looking for a similar chemistry in a more sappy movie. The problem is that we had the movie Autumn in New York that same year Sweet November was released, also A Walk to Remember, Love Story, they're all the same exact scripts with different characters.Nelson Moss is a typical businessman who devotes his life to his career. He meets Sarah, a woman very different from anyone else he has ever met. His arrogance and ignorance leads to her failing her DMV test and she decides to track him down to make him pay for what he did. She continually asks him to spend a month with her, to be her "November", on the promise that she will change his life. That night she sleeps with him and the next day another man arrives in the apartment, a friend of Sarah's, who is able to identify Nelson as Sarah's "November". Nelson believes, quite rightly, that something strange is going on and leaves. Sarah then runs after Nelson and finally convinces him to stay with her for as long as he can. Throughout the course of November the two experience very happy times together and some breakups. But there's more that Sarah is hiding from Nelson then he realizes other than just being her "November".I don't mean to bash the movie so much, just these movies do tick me off where like I said it just seems like they're insulting our intelligence and taking old scripts, using a red crayon and scratching out the names and changing them just to pass by. Charlize was very adorable as Sarah, but these characters really don't have many redeemable qualities as they're very self absorbed and selfish. No matter what the motivation was, I wasn't feeling the romance and I wasn't feeling sorry for any of these jerks. I wouldn't really recommend this movie, I promise if you've seen any of the other movies I mentioned, then you've already seen Sweet November.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script was two dimensional not the acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was shown over the free channel last Sunday. I read up on the reviews for preparation to be unbiased and fair to it.I think the problem with this movie is a tired plot and a terribly two dimensional script. Keanu's and Charlize's performance was what helped to lift it out of a 4/10 rating for me. Jason Issac as a cross dressing flatmate was a heartwarming portrayal of how friendship does not always come in neat little packages hemmed in by our expectations. His loyalty and support for Charlize's Sara was the real cruncher in this movie for me. Nelson's initial shock and reaction on seeing Jason's Chaz in a loud dress was hilarious only because it does mirror the general population's.The other part of the movie that I find strangely revealing and therefore very endearing, was when Nelson decides Christmas should come a month early for Sara. He pops into her house via the window while everyone is having Thanksgiving and proceeds to give her twelve gifts for Christmas. Each gift and especially the last one, was obviously well thought out in relation to his feelings for her and their relationship throughout that November.I have read snippets of how Keanu is very fiercely protective, private, very loving and giving as a person to those he cares deeply about and that entire scene made me realize this is less acting the part but more a lingering snapshot of a small part of who he really is.I have so far watched "Speed", "A Walk in the Clouds" and the "Matrix" Trilogy, all of which showcases Keanu as a leading man. I must say that I do catch glimpses of what looks like the real Keanu popping up every now and then. So it's no wonder that Sandra Bullock should say that she was very taken by the way Keanu looked at her just before he kissed her at the end of "Speed".I think that many people are quick to rubbish Keanu's acting as wooden because they fail to notice that bit of his soul, often very obviously displayed on the screen, just because it usually isn't displayed on his face.Enjoy the movie for what it is, a simple love story with a bittersweet ending and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you´re going to San Francisco...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilersSan Francisco. Nelson (Keanu Reeves) is a successful and arrogant PR-manager. One day he meets Sara (Charlize Theron), who prevents animals. She chooses him to be her "Mr. November". In one month she wants to make him a better man. To my own shame I must admit that I never watched the original movie from 1964, so I can´t comment it. But it´s an unwritten law that remakes are never better. Besides the non-happy ending, it bristles with stereotypes - of course, Sara has got cancer and her best friend is gay - just to mention two of them. Nevertheless I still found it worth watching. Why does everybody scoff about Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron? It´s THEIR chemistry that carries the movie and gives it the warmth that it needs.Very "kitschy", but beautiful to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having recently watched Sweet November I would like to say it is definitely interesting. Though it only touched the surface of several story lines in the movie it was none the less a good watch. It was like another review said a lesson of life. Another said that Sara, in the real world would be selfish and bitter, but maybe she just wanted to be remembered like she said at the end of the movie.As far as the clichés in the movie it was a good movie. Of course, the lame ass business guy, the gay best friend, and the dying girl. The way it was portrayed was awesome.Personally I thought the acting was wonderful. Reeves was wonderful as was Theron. Jason Isaacs did a marvelous job as Chaz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, SWEET November is a re-make from a movie originally made in 1968. I still haven't seen the original, and when I recently went into this 2001 version, I expected a rather superficial romantic comedy about a girl who changes boyfriends every month. Unsuspectedly, I got much more out of it (even on a personal level). The movie begins fairly light-hearted, but near the end you'll have to endure some pretty heavy-weight drama. The good thing is: None of it all ever becomes cheap. But if you're an emotional human being, it's almost a 100% sure that at one point or another you will feel the urge to shed a tear. Although the ending itself is the most obvious part that will cause viewers to swallow or make their eyes go all watery, my moment of feebleness was when Keanu Reeves brought back the little puppy to Charlize Thereon as a surprise gift.I'd describe this film as a moving romantic drama with touches of comedy. The screenplay itself is like a softly rippling stream that takes you on a gentle ride. And it never changes its ways... No storm will take you by surprise... No whirlpool will suddenly drag you down... But slowly, dark and ominous clouds will darken the sky above you. So, indeed, Nelson Moss inevitably discovers the real reason why Sara Deever wanted him to be her November boyfriend. My idea is that most people will see this coming from miles away (for one thing because of several subtle hints, both in the screenplay and visuals, are being given). And I also believe that the movie intended it that way. But what probably wasn't the intention, was me figuring out at the 36 minutes mark exactly what was wrong with Sara Deever, even down to the exact nature of her condition. It was in the scene where Sara was making eggs for breakfast, after their first night together, it suddenly hit me. So, that was sort of a little bummer there, me knowing it from then on. Instead of fully enjoying all the romantic stuff between them, and witnessing how they grew towards each other, a part of me was constantly waiting for the 'signs' to reveal themselves.Still, it didn't spoil too much. However, there was one big 'party-pooper'-scene. I won't go into it, but... how the hell did Nelson manage to walk out of a hospital unseen, carrying a terminally ill patient (who was on a heart-monitoring machine) in his arms without one single person of the medical staff noticing him? It was the one and only moment that I 'went out of the movie' and just shook my head going "Yeah, right...". But gladly, I quickly got over it and enjoyed the rest of the movie. The ending is just damn good. Even though some part of me didn't want it to end that way, it still was the only way I wanted it to end. And I'm aware that saying this might make me sound like as if I'm a barrel full of contradictions, but just see the movie and you'll understand it.I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the performances of the whole cast. Charlize Theron especially shone in this one and even Keanu Reeves was enjoyable in every way (from the go-getter he was in the beginning of the movie to the likable and caring person he became at the end). As far as the comedy aspects go in SWEET November, that scene where he explained his new "hot dog campaign" during the meeting was simply hilarious. I even re-watched that one scene the next day and was grinning all the way through it.So yep, I think this is a very good movie and it sure was a pleasant surprise for me. I'd probably be rating it even higher if it wasn't for those one or two little fun-spoilers I mentioned earlier... Hmmm... and maybe I also missed one truly hot and steamy sex-scene between Keanu and Charlize there. But still, SWEET November is a movie for all to enjoy, except maybe for those of you who have this way too cynical look on life and love. To them I can only say: Lighten up, you're deteriorating the quality of your life and the lives of people close to you.Have a nice day!*** Thanx to this special person (who wanders around on this site often) for recommending this movie to me. She knows who she is and I dedicate this review to her.***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is not that bad as some reviews suggest. Yes, Reeves is not playing a role that comes natural to him and is thus not performing as might be expected of him. Casting is an issue here. Theron on the other hand is excellent and makes up for the under performance of Reeves. Her character really comes to live.The script should have been better thought through. It sometimes gave me the feeling that corners had been cut (time constraints?) and in other cases just wondering why certain decisions were made.A love story yes but also a story how one wants to be remembered. This for me was what the movie was about. Certainly worth watching on DVD.</fullReview>

After a small eternity of banter between these two losers: "Let me help you!"/"Get away from me!", Nelson gives in and wastes time with Sarah for 4 weeks he will never get back while the audience sits through this grueling torture for 2 solid hours which they will never get back.Somewhere along the way, Nelson has (surprise!) fallen in love with Sarah. He professes his devotion by climbing up the fire escape and crashing Sarah's dinner party to deliver 12(!) clumsy presents including live birds and lit candles and the film still doesn't have a happy ending.Incredulous storyline isn't bad for laughs if you've got enough Bacardi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keanu Reeves is what every man dreams of being: successful, good-looking, in good health, in shape, with money, with a good job, with a nice apartment. This movie then tries to make viewers believe--as ridiculous as this may sound--that this is not enough. That Reeves' character is somehow not only NOT what he seems to be (a successful man) but that he is somehow lonely. Dissatisfied. That he suffers from the pathology of being too "normal."The solution?This stable guy is just so sick of his good job and good life (boohoo, he's so normal and boring) that, when he meets some weirdo chick whose life is completely out of control and who offers him random sex (for personal, heart-tugging reasons we are to discover later), he gets sucked into her world. And what a world it is!Chaos, instability, insanity, sexual deviants, homosexuals, cross dressers (who can also run successful companies too, didn't you know), and eventually they just, you know, like...touch his heart and make him a not so uptight guy, but an enlightened '90s skirtboy; the kind of superior man who has dinner with his insane girlfriend and her pervert neighbours and doesn't even bat an eyelash at the freakishness surrounding him.Without meaning to give away the plot, the reason for the woman offering him random sex is a clever plot device to make the mentally ill liberal world she represents immune to reproach. It tricks gullible viewers into feeling that putting down sick left-wing extremist liberal TRASH makes the viewer himself morally suspect. Nice touch.This movie is a pathetic piece of turd scrap. Cultural Marxist propaganda of the most revolting sort.</fullReview>

I have about 300 channels, Kindle Video etc. The only reason it probably was off my radar was that my son was only six months old at the time. I am a sucker for love stories, and believe me I've seen my share of rotten eggs masquerading as a love story, and paid for expensive theater tickets because critics said it was a good movie, and then got disappointed. I saw this as a suggestion on my kindle and it intrigued me so I watched it. I can't understand WHY THE CRITICS DISLIKED THIS MOVIE. Chaz (Keaneau), acted the part exactly as it was supposed to be. An insensitive workaholic who never got a mirror shoved in his face. The Character Sara, (Charleze), Showed just as much compassion as desperation, to make a change in someone's life as well as trying to live her life to the fullest. I don't think I'd blame her because I think a lot of people would do the same, knowing the percentage of the cure of her diagnosis. Her choice was to stay in a hospital bed and hope for a miracle or try to live her life without remorse right up to the end. I worked in a nursing home once and saw people being kept alive much longer then their quality of life, which was drug induced pain induced machine extended time machine, as they waited for their lives to end. I wept like a baby at the end. I think the critics hated it because it didn't have a Disney ending like most love stories do, (ie: The Notebook, the Time Traveler, You've got mail "which I thought the premise of that plot to be entirely ridiculous", etc). There was some awkwardness in a couple of scenes but in the entirety of the movie I really didn't consider it important. I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND BOUGHT IT THE DAY AFTER I RENTED IT. If you like love stories like "Somewhere in Time". You'll love Sweet November.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After some time, I just got few tears on a movie. I am a guy and I am not ashamed of it. Its a beautiful romantic story.The movie looked very real for me and acting of the lead character's Nelson and Sara was very perfect.Nelson is a smart workaholic guy working for an advertising company,who doesn't know how life is really aside of work. But Sara is straight opposite to him and what happens when these two cross their roads forms the crux of the story.Don't have any prejudice and watch the movie for how ever it is, you'll love it for sure. It is indeed a 'sweet' NovemberPS: Love is what life is all about. With little tears ~ Sweet November</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not That Good Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The act of Keanu (Nelson) was good, not great . But, I think Charlize Theron really made the character of Sara alive in this movie. The cinematography was nicely done. But i really quite disagree with the story itself. How come you appreciate life if you don't fight for it as Sara did? I think what she's done is a submission to her disease. Then, the way Nelson change his own character is debatable. For a guy who considered that his job is his life, it was so illogical for him to turned down the biggest job offer at his life. C'mon, He only met Sara for less than a month. No one can change so rapidly like that.Nevertheless, don't watch this movie if you are a good-ending movies lovers. But, if you like a love story that don't have usual plot, have a taste of real life, please feel free to enjoy this movie :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully acted. A Superb Love Story. Definitely for the hard hearted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the reviews and agree with most. But there is something missing here regarding negative reviewers.There are people today who frown on sentimentality, because to some people, sentimental people are weak, and / or soft people.And the added truth is that behind every person who hates the average love story, is a person who cries inside when they are moved to tears by movies packing an emotional punch, just like this one did.Some people are afraid to show emotion because they feel it too much, because some people are emotional people.So when these type of people watch an emotional film they are forced to be critical, when what these people are really doing is being critical of themselves.Sweet November was very sad, very moving, and acted with absolute sincerity.It really would serve the world better if men particularly, were not afraid to show emotion for fear of being labelled soft, and weak.I think if we were not such a macho hard nosed capitalistic world, sentimentality would be accepted much more.Because Sweet November was superb on all those levels where human emotion cannot, not, be aroused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whimsy of Sara is something to covet. This is NOT an "epic" film, yet it contains a 'value' about connecting face to face, of being unplugged from cell phones, TV, and the indoor traps that distract from relationships. Excellent scenes that tugged me to 'feel' now - as opposed to later. Emotions of disgust, pure joy, and compassion were struck. The script, the acting, combined with recent family health scares allowed this film to personally speak to me. It is a testimony to how brief encounters can impact one's direction in life. Consider striking up a conversation with someone at DMV ~ Was it a divine appointment taken seriously? Did it take courage to LIVE every day as if it were your last? Sara's character BOLDLY chose to LIVE in the NOW rather than take life extending drugs. Each of us may face this choice, fate has a way of always surprising us and the people we touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nelson (Keenu Reeves) encounters Sara (Charlize Theron), a lunatic freak but generous and full life-living woman who surprisingly proposes him to help to improve his life by coaching him during a whole month ! Nelson eventually accepts the proposal and happens to feel love. But Sara has predictably got a secret ... Believe me, the end is sad, sad but beautiful, the kind of ending that can make you burst into tears !The scenario has got some imperfections. For example Keanu Reeves acts a closed-minded advertising manager, while this profession needs openmindness and creativity. I also want to be explained why Sara running from Protero Hill suddenly appears to Dolores Park in seconds ! :-) Also the ropes of the regular romance are all present (the public declaration, the perfect and minority-member friend, the little pet, the missing-father child, etc ..). So we could have feared something rebarbative. Happily this film must not be watched as a simple romance. Despite those weird elements, the film has value. The very purpose of the film is about the life value. And the film treats it well.Sara seems to be a freak, but she's not. And we learn from her. As she has only few moments left to live, she focuses on the most important things : savouring truly each moment of life. It's that simple. Sara's way to live, her choices, her complete devotion to others, even selfish jerks like Nelson, her truth, her rejection of money, ego, and work-devotion, make us realise that most part of our life is time-wasting and that relationships are about trusting, about making a free of charge step forward.We also learn from the relation with time : Nelson had not enough time for love, no time for family in law, no time to spare if a career opportunity occurs... while Sara spares time for making love, for playing with dogs, for the coaching, and think about the right time for making up with family (so do her friends). The film reveals us that doing plenty of things is not living fully and that the most precious gift we can share is no money but time. Sharing time with others, this is the point.And I like Sara's choice at the end. The need of Sara to be loved forever. This gives all the power to the film. As she says, memories are all we have. Don't we ? After all, isn't it the one thing even naked we carry everywhere ?Regarding the acting, Charlize Theron is really touching in the whole movie. And despite Keanu Reeves has a incoherent task as I said, he manages well to pass gradually from a controled and selfish behaviour to a receiving and open one. The soundtracks well follow the storyboard and we can enjoy some good views of the San Francisco bay (a fantastic city by the way).Just for those reasons the film would be worth a watch. I watched this film many times, and I definitely do not understand the general misloving of this film. I hope my review will makes you give it a try !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie, although not a great success at the box office and not very appreciated by the critics, is in fact very touching and profound. Love, the strongest of human emotions is in fact powerless in the face of Death. Sara Deever, suffering from an incurable disease decides to live her last months of life to the full, adopting a kind of 60's hippie life style and choosing for each month a different boyfriend/lover. Nelson Moss, a very down to earth upper-class business is Sara's November "date", and her last.Keanu Reeves' natural acting talent and Charlize Theron's untainted beauty make a perfect combination in a movie that changes the way you see life and will undoubtedly touch in more than one way. I give it a well deserved 8.</fullReview>

The story is so funny, kooky, sweet and so desperately sad at the end, that I just watch it every time it is on television. We have formed a "sweet November" watch....when we know it is on, several of my friends and I will call each other so we don't miss it. It is wonderful when you just need that "good" cry. I guess it might be considered a "chick flick", but I do know men that loved it too. It is so touching, so real in the validity of her need to control the situation, ANY situation, to feel alive while dying. you cannot help but feel her pain, her love and her fear of loving him. Even though you root for him to win her in the end - there is no other way this movie could have ended. He WILL have her forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess that I DO like "nice" films, films that don't cause me to have nightmares or worry too much (having said that, I enjoyed "Black Hawk Down tremendously, so go figure). O.k., so this may have been a bit of brain candy, but I REALLY enjoyed it. The film was entertaining, full of characters I could care about, and Jason Isaacs as Chaz was worth the price of the DVD. He is (in my biased opinion) always magnificent. This was the first film I've seen Charlize Theron in where I appreciated her as more than just a pretty face, and Keanu is always pretty to look at even when he isn't giving his best; I thought he was quite good here (not meaning to sound patronising there!), btw. Michael Rosenbaum as Brandon/Brandy was unrecognisable from his Lex Luthor in "Smallville" - how versatile is he? SPOILER-ish All in all, the 8 I gave this film is probably rather stingy, but I DO so like happy, tidy endings (don't tend to go for "weepies") (-; It was great fun and I will watch it, and show it to others, many times.</fullReview>

It is a moving story of two people with vastly different definitions of what life is all about. If you looking for a story about glitz and glitter, this one isn't for you. The power of this movie rests in its down to earth reality.

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely one of my favorites. Not only because the girl is a bit like me (hehe) but because the story really makes you just want to run around like an animal and just HAVE SOME FUN! Enjoy life. The movie is about a feeling-less workaholic named Nelson (Keanu Reeves) who meets a weird (in a good way), different, fun type of lady named Sara (Charlize Theron). Sara has this thing where she takes men into her home and life, and helps them with things. But, just for ONE month. Nothing more. Nothing less. With Nelson, she helps him realize the meaning of life, the feeling of love, and that work and money is not everything. After sometime, Nelson falls in love with her, and asks her to marry him. But, Sarah has a secret. A secret that she doesn't want Nelson to know about. And she doesn't want to marry him because of it. The secret has something to do with why she loves helping people. Why she loves life so much, and why she wants to enjoy life to the fullest as long as she possibly can. I will tell you no more. Go see the movie. It's definitely well worth your time. So drop the cell phone, throw away the neck tie, and get ready to enjoy life! (Note: Bring tissues, the end is a bit sad)</fullReview>

Watching his failure to carry the role was almost laughable. Other than that, it was a pretty dreary thing.

		<fullReview>Yes the movie discusses somewhat 'normal' story-line. But the presentation made it different. Kudos to the director, editor and the actors. It shares situations like a fairy tale.surely romance is the only thing that you can make you unreal. eyes talk a lot. even the pets have a role to prove the existence of love. illogical world of love is there always. at some point the character has to ask "have you been in sales?". what a dodging which is normally cannot be fit in romancing movies. but factually it is always there in real romance. power of eyes. what else.Being a pro, those 'professional values' to 'life values' made me to think. Time, dollar all have been touched nicely. even the way things are being presented in career are nicely portrayed. And how badly a professional confidence is disproved. there comes the different dimensions of pro and love. Love which is not mixed with $ or time can have a lot of confidence There are points which will make your eyes wet. its okay. life values are worth for a cry. there could have more connects with his childhood stories. may be then he can find himself in more natural way. also the obvious skin tone changes must have made more gradual. am i missed it? is that really great? !! anyway I think the dark circles could have lighten. slow means more natural.So briefly, good romance. good ending. good course for 'professionals' from 'life'.

		<fullReview>After browsing through critic reviews, and seeing the low 6.6/10 stars at first glance, I was starting to think this movie would be a failure and that Keanu Reeves might disappoint me for the first time after all the amazing movies I've seen of his.This movie is one I watched along with many other heartfelt romance movies (you know, the kind that ties your heart into knots and all you can do is cry and suck your thumb), them being A Walk to Remember (2002), The Lake House (2006), The Fault in Our Stars (2014), and of course, Sweet November (2001), with Sweet November topping the list.I've got to admit, the beginning was a little funky and not exactly promising, but it gets warmer and warmer just like the colors of the leaves in November. Keanu once again gets together with Charlize after their previous project Devil's Advocate (1997) and play a lovely couple. The smooth transition, yet maintaining its' eccentric, staccato, little surprises of the main character Nelson, a fatherly, manly, and full of potential character, teaches the valuable lesson also taught in other romance films. The lesson and art of being able to wait, and being able to let go. Every type of romance film in this area expresses it differently, this was a full on bittersweet tale with two lovers, both with great character and very diverse personalities (hey, opposites attract)I was drowning in tears like I've never drowned before (well I haven't, but... yeah) because Keanu is born with the natural gift of portraying a loving gentleman, with many different variations of course, but this film is when he uses his gift to its extremity.The beauty and romance of this film is truly unbearable. Be sure to have a mountain of tissues... maybe an 5 inches smaller than Mt. Everest height. It ties your heart into knots, and teaches you lessons that have never occurred to you before, and shows you how much you really care about things you never thought of as cared for before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True a film like this of a love story developing between two polar opposite lifestyles may not be your cup of tea, but yet I for one liked "Sweet November" as it can give any hopeless romantic hope as it proves people with opposite lifestyles can share some love and happiness. Set in the ultra liberal city of San Franciso, California you have Nelson Moss(Keanu Reeves)as a clockwork go getting timed hard working plugged advertising executive who runs thru life yet he's successful his job is working. Also Nelson has a very attractive girlfriend in the proper and prissy Angelica(Lauren Graham). Yet is he really happy so by fate and chance meeting as is so common yet unexpected in life he meets a spur of the moment and bubbly Sara Deever(Charlize Theron). And this little lady has a knack for loving and changing the ways of new guys she meets! A feel good loving journey begins, as the on screen chemistry between Reeves and Theron sparkles. Also a nice eye candy scene at the films opening is a very sexy scene of Lauren Graham wearing a black bra and panties that certainly added some sugar and spice. Overall "Sweet November" is a decent romantic drama that proves anyone can love and obtain happy memories.</fullReview>

I was proved wrong when i finally saw it.It is much more than a love story, it is a movie that actually challenges you on an emotional and psychological level. It makes you think about the phrase "Not being dead doesn't mean you are alive". Even though the acting is not at it's peak, Keanu and Charlize manage to impress by the pure emotion they seem to feel throughout the film."Sweet November" actually made me, at least for a while, to try and be more alive than usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie killed by a horrible ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a few of the comments, I would first like to touch on those comments that lacked in intelligence. Someone made a comment about Abner going to father son day with Nelson Moss saying that it was creepy. Saying that Abner a very shy kid was an easy target for a pedophile. An intelligent viewer would of realized hey Nelson has been with Sarah for about 17 days (if I remember right) and what's funny is the writer made it very clear that Sarah had a strong relationship with Abner. Meaning that most likely Nelson and Abner have a pretty strong relationship as well. But if that isn't enough then what about how after the boat scene Sarah made a point of Nelson being a strong father figure for young Abner. That's why it wasn't creepy!There was another Comment about how the movie was dishonest and how it lead you to believe it was about love but in reality it was about Sarah having control over Nelson. To a point this might be true but it's not completely true because Sarah wouldn't of admitted ever loving him if it was only about control. The person also commented on how Sarah made him fall in love with her (you can't make someone fall in love with you duh...) and then just left him. Just throwing this out there is this the first romance movie this person has every watched? Because I'm pretty sure after the headache scene I realized that she was going to leave him because that's what would be the best ending. Watching her die would of just killed it. It would of caused the movie to drag out to a point no one wants! Seriously no one would want to watch her die, unless that's how the movie started with her dying!My personal view point.This movie was maybe one of the best romance movies I've seen in a long time (I just watched 27 Dresses last night as well). The acting was excellent, I thought that Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron did a wonderful job. They showed a lot of passion and a lot of love. Keanu Reeves from the very start did great being that money driven jerk thinking that his is the "Big Dog." (COME ON that's great stuff, they made a theme out of dogs). Charlize was beautiful on the screen and her crazy life loving personality made you want to fall in love with her yourself.This movie also did a great job in the other departments that make a movie great. The music flowed very well with the emotion of the movie. Music is what makes a love movie great and the music in this movie had a lot of it. Not only did the music flow well with this movie but also the lighting. Two key moments, when the movie just starts Nelson's apartment the lighting and the theme was gray and boring. Another key point when he first walked into Sarah apartment, the lighting was Bright and full of life! It screamed life is here! Yet another example of this would be when he first finds her vomiting in the bathroom, the lighting made you feel worried and sad, much like it need to be. Or what about the ending, If it wasn't such a horrible ending it would of made me cry because it had all the emotional lighting you could ask for. That grayish blue lighting that make you know that hey I should be crying right now, what might of made it perfect was if it was raining but they already did that so it would of been a bad idea!What made this great movie a piece of crap that it really is, was it's one fault, the downfall of it all was the ending. That last scene when she runs away and he catches her. Making a good movie drag out TOO MUCH! Personally I feel it would of been much better if he would of woke up and all that he found was a note explaining what she explained at the end. Although the Blindfold thing should of been a nice touch really it made is worse! If she was going to put that blindfold on him then he should of found her. BUT if he found her it would make it even WORSE! For this reason I truly believe that this movie would of been great if and only if the ending wouldn't of been so bad! Before that ending I was ready to say that it was one of my favorite romance movies but then the ending just killed it. Personally I feel that they could of ended when he confess his love for her and tell her that we can stay in November forever! Then it would be a happy ending but we would still understand that she'll die, but at least we would of left with the feeling of a happily ever after feeling!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is too much under rated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its seems very eccentric that even after having a strong "no no" feeling for romantic movies I think this movie deserves much more that mere 5.5. This movie is far above the characters &amp; their lives. It is about the true essence of life itself. Though till almost 75% of the movie it is just a fun ride with Sara's way of life &amp; the changes that Nelson goes through but boy once you understand the truth about Sara thats where you are compelled to think about Sara &amp; thats when you think this movie is a beautiful feeling that you'll love to have. I have watched it many times &amp; its only got better much like wine. Though none of the characters seem really strong with any out-of-the-world one liners or 2 much polished each character is finely crafted &amp; presented. The end is interpreted by different ppl differently but Ill just request each one to go through the movie a few more times &amp; that when you understand what makes Sara such a special character, a character worth remembering.At least 9/10 for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical with a slight twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie contains a typical performance by Keanu Reeves and a really good performance by Charlize Theron. The story it depicts seems at first like the run-of-the mill romantic comedy, but an air of mystery and a cloud of charm hover around Theron's character, keeping you intrigued. You quickly realize that this is not ordinary. Sara (Theron)loses an opportunity to renew her driver's license and Nelson (Reeves) is to blame. How she collects on the debt he owes is only the beginning of the fun. You will want to see how Nelson and Sara change each other during one "Sweet November." The movie wants you to know that life doesn't have to be perfect in order for us to be alive. I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mushy and Predictable, but tells a story. Check out Charlize Theron.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot Outline: Nelson (Keanu Reeves) high-flying, cold blooded ad-exec bumps into free spirit Sara (Charlize Theron) in a DMV test. Sara spots Nelson as an overworked jerk who needs to learn more about life and offers him to stay with her for a month as her 'November'. Although reluctant initially, Nelson allows himself in after losing a campaign and his job in a fit of rage. Nelson sure comes to Sara's ways and falls for her, but against her expectations, she too ends up falling for him. Other characters include Sara's neighbor Chaz, a happier guy from Nelson's Industry, Abner, the neighborhood kid, a couple of transvestites, and Nelson's parasitical colleague Vince.Comment: I'd never heard of this movie till in late-2003 when a friend actually recommended this one as a must see. The story with its typical characters like an overworked-ambitious workaholic, a terminally ill carefree female who doesn't need to work, a cool headed and successful competitor from the same industry, a couple of weird people like the transvestites and a kid to whom Nelson plays surrogate father make the story quite predictable similar to the staple ones of Bollywood. What makes it different is a character like Sara who spots 'troubled' people and offers them to live with her for a month and change them. Well, if not in a movie, Nelson wouldn't have probably agreed to move in with a complete stranger, that too a clumsy weirdo like her.Although the movie is professed as a love story, I am yet to understand the Director's perspective of love in the movie. Nelson could have fallen for Sara just because he was in deep trouble in his life with career and relationship failures that he found an opening in a care free Sara who on the other hand dated people to feel the need for control. Should love be either circumstantial like for Nelson or the woman on top approach of Sara? By saying this, I'm sure the folks who would rather love a tear-jerker would be offended. The lead Reeves, with his usual confused look seems more like Neo than Nelson. Charlize Theron is the best thing about this movie who although clumsy is yet likable.Putting aside shortcomings in narrative and character development, the film makes some points. (i) Work, but do it for a living and don't live in it, (ii) Stop by to see life from another's perspective, (iii) Weird friends could be better than the parasitic ones, (iv) Stronger decisions need innate conviction like the way Nelson turns down Edgar Price and (v) finally, that life with all its limitations is much better than we usually think. One needs to watch this movie at home on video with the least possible disturbance if one has to try appreciating this movie from the characters' point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was such a tear jerker after 1 hour into the movie! Being a sensitive soul I like when men stand by their strong women but it could have used more of a dynamic script. I have been seriously ill and deserted by the man in my life so the movie is sweet. Keanu, who happens to be a friend of mine from way back, is almost type cast as an action hero. His fans were disappointed. I think most of his Neo fans found the movie "corny". Too bad. The Matrix Reloaded NEO is the 300 hundred pound gorilla of his career. People will always compare any of his work with that. I have spoken to him about that. Theron, won an Oscar for a completely different type of female lead. Freudian slip? The movie is really okay on DVD or VHS on a rainy romantic night!</fullReview>

I didn't really get it then but thought it was very interesting though, so i decided to buy it one day. i don't think i made a mistake by doing so. The movie is actually great, i think Charlize Theron's acting is really good and Keanus is not bad either. In the middle it sometimes gets really boring and just too long but all together the story is really cute and romantic, but not that realistic, it all just happened much too fast. What made me cry so much was the end, i couldn't stop, even after the movie was over and it also made me think about life. That you shouldn't waste time with unimportant or less important stuff and concentrate on the really important things in life, and that is not the money !!I can really recommend this movie, but don't forget a pack of tissues ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Addendum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***This is an addendum to the unemployed critic's comment. First of all this movie shouldn't be compared to real life. Of course both characters are at the extremes, neither could be fully implemented in real life (including attitude, gestures, etc). I think it was meant to be a fairy tale, a peek at some aspects of life from outside life ... and it failed. Why? The reasons are well-explained in the unemployed critic's post. The director's lack of interest, poor script, poor writing. The dialogs are plain even though there's a bit of insight from time to time. All the potential subplots that are left hanging prevent the viewer from bonding with the characters. Reeves is bad, Charlize is good and even though there's a little chemistry there, as a couple they fail to deliver. Deprived of details about Charlize's character, the ending isn't as powerful as it should have been.Overall, it's not bad, enjoyable especially with your loved one at your side. Still, it could've been much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read all the reviews and some forums regarding this film. After seeing it I was impressed throughout the film. Although others say its a typical love story, you have to understand that its from a screenplay and thats how the director Pat O'Connor interpreted the film as. Give credit to where its do. The remake remains the 1960's style of the French New Wave. It uses bright rich colors that Chinese cinema used, the music and light alongside with the decor of the apartment all made this movie great. It a great film to kick back and analyze yourself on all the things that occur in life. If helps one realize how pre-occupied people can be with other things and miss life's finer moments. We all work to make a better life; but, who really has time to enjoy it? Great film Pat O'Connor!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keanu Reaves portrays the handsome, driven and hot-headed ad-exec Nelson Moss very well. His performance falls apart in how he changes from this workaholic so quickly. Perhaps that has something to do with how time is portrayed in this film but the only problem he seemed to have is using his cell phone and looking at his watch, this seemed totally unbelievable to me. I would have expected to see a lot more resistance to the change and/or anger about Sara wanting to change him. Charlize Theron as Sara Deever is an unconventional young woman who has set out to change peoples' lives one-person one-month at a time. Theron is excellent is this movie. The movie is also slightly unbelievable in that these two very different young people got "together" so quickly in the first place. Not a classic to be watched over-and-over but it is a nice movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so with all the many, many comments already here, why bother to write? I just got done watching it for the first time, and remembering the 1968 original with Sandy Dennis, I thought I would check out some things on the IMDb. I am very mixed in my reaction to the remake. I actually thought that Reeves did one of his better jobs here. I like to watch him in the movies. I don't think he is the greatest actor around, but I think that he improved by miles after being directed by Al Pacino in DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (also opposite Theron, by the way). But I can not review this version without comparison to the original film version. In 1968 a lot of the general population was just trying to get used to people openly living together at all. So this lifestyle of Sara's really did put a different spin on an otherwise, sort of, normalish, kind of woman. But for her to be taking in a different man for every month made her definitely not "normal". The word used most often by the commenters of the '68 film was "quirky". That simply does not apply to the Sara of Charlize Theron's era. Live together, don't live together, come and go, and especially in a liberal neighborhood of San Francisco, and OK, so who is going to notice besides the little boy across the street. So, did Charlie('68)/Nelson('01') need some changing in their "boring" unfulfilled lives? Well, according to many, "yes", but according to the way our society works these days, if that kind of work and business is your choice, than it IS necessary or you don't have a job. But, OK, we will accept that premise, and on we go. My question is this: Does the perspective that Sara lives under really hold up in true life? Is it a valid and honest thing to do with the end of your days, to show people with holes in their characters, that life is full and wonderful and everyone should "stop to smell the roses". Make it sound altruistic as a better way to live up to the end, than continuing with chemos that she has already been through, and likely would not work at all this time around. But then to push those that do love you away? And she loved her family and Charlie/Nelson too, but just wanted to be remembered as full of life! Is this not egotistical in the extreme?!? Is this not major fear of that inescapably absolute part of life, which is death?? Does this attitude and behavior in either film not belie every single thing she has chosen to do and live by, every time she takes and takes and takes again, love from strangers for the REAL purpose of being remembered? I think that the very fabric and premise of the whole story is that of a woman NOT quirky, NOT brave and strong, NOT just wanting to live simply and give of herself. THAT is what I think is the major flaw of this story both times around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This movie was a deep reflection on the daily things and activities of life and the things we take for granted for in our lives right in front of us. Past the romance between the two lovers, Sarah and Nelson, the the writer wanted to portray the busyness, the greed, the power, and the life-sucking power of the lives that we live here. This movie was not merely about romance. This movie was about a lesson in life. This may be why so many hopeless romantics out there find this movie to be a bore and unrealistic. Every scene in the movie was devised to reflect the lesson that Sarah was trying to teach Nelson -- To live life!(*** Please do not continue to read if you have not seen the movie. ***) (*** The following paragraphs contain spoilers. ***)Sarah, a supposedly eccentric woman, brings this overworked Advertising agent into her home. Sarah had a real intention to change a person's life and show Nelson what life is about, not about working, making money, doing things, buying things, and consuming things, but about appreciating life and living life completely.In the coffee shop, when Nelson's friend, Chaz, catches Nelson, Sarah, and the boy sitting down in a coffee table appreciating a quiet cup of coffee, two worlds clash -- one of the busy, go-go-go world of Nelson's life before the month of November and his new life guided by his lovely "guru", Sarah. So, Chaz finally meets the "mystery woman". Right before Chaz entered the coffee shop, his girlfriend says the movie is going to start in 10 mintues. Go, go, go. When his girlfriend comes in, Chaz doesn't remember her name when he tries to introduce her to them. Then, notice after they leave, Sarah asks if Nelson could really trust Chaz, like in a dangerous situation. Could he really?On November 17, the day that Nelson will meet Price Waterhouse with Chaz, Nelson gives up the major deal just because he didn't like the CEO. Was this romance? Was this for Sarah? No. He was a changed man. He had different values. He appreciated and respected people, not money, money, money. Not anymore. (Screw the CEO! What a jerk. Screw the money! There's more to life than that.)If you looked carefully enough, every instance of what Sarah showed Nelson reflected this very idea of living life to the full . She wanted to offer him a chance to live, not to be swayed and moved by the large force powered by our society to become rich, famous, and powerful. Sarah's life was one of simplicity and looking at life for what it was, a short one (that is, we all have short lives). Let's appreciate people. Love people. And respect the people around us. For what will become of the power, the money, and the fame after we die? Nothing. A chasing after the wind. I hope we don't die finding that our lives was just a "resounding gong or a clanging cymbal", just a bunch of doing this and that and going here and there and finding that we had not really lived.</fullReview>

Time is ticking away - The length of your life is not important, the contents matters. This movie is an example of it. It takes only time, when you have finally realized what the meaning of your life is. This movie is also an example of the beauty of life (love, happiness, friendship, ..) but also of the ugliness (disease, dead, bad luck, dishonesty, ..). You can live life in two ways : your own way or the way of the society. The choice is up to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was floating through the web and landed as usually here, at the Internet Movie Database. I had seen this movie with Jason Isaacs(note-with Jason Isaacs not with Keanu Reeves) and I wanted to know the English name...and, why not, the user rating. To my surprise, this last one was much, much lower than I had expected in my wildest dreams. I don't like to refer to the imdb user ratings, but I can't really remember a time when the difference between what I imagined and what is was bigger. Oh well...let's jump to it.SPOILERSI can't say it's a terribly original story, but it ain't bad either. I have not seen any movies too similar to it, so I guess it does carry its share of originality...until a certain point. That's actually a big issue, something that really troubles me. The idea that people can't live their life unless they're dying or anywhere near. I mean, that's just plain stupid. Life can be beautiful if you ain't dying too! But I guess that's too plain to be worth showing...better show this melodramatic thing. To the story...well, it was written to please the majority of people. This was most obvious, not only as a whole, but at a certain scene: the meeting with Price. It's the "inhuman" character Price represents and its that big share of humanity in Nelson. The idea is that we should love Nelson so we get him take the side of feelings...well, predictable is the word for it.The acting is good...I don't see why I should complain. I especially liked Jason Isaacs. I am quite a fan of his, so it's not really a surprise, but I just couldn't believe my eyes and I kept saying: That's not him! I don't know why, but I didn't trust my instincts until the credits.Keanu was...Keanu. I like the fact that he can play as different type of characters and I think it fit him very well. It is strange if you think of all the things reality brings with it...but what we are presented is not reality...not our reality.Charlize Theron was amazing! She just had that charm with her that made her "loveable". This is a quality many stars lack...especially female ones. There's always a difference between "hot" and "beautiful". It's kind of nice when "she's" got both.About the negative parts...I think I'll stick with the predictability. But as a whole the movie is good. I especially liked the music which made you feel quite fuzzy. It was beautiful. I also saw some images which said more than a thousand words. Superbly shot. It's hard to express that much in a picture and I haven't seen it too often lately. Get to see this film...I think it will make you feel good. It's never good to be a constant critic. Kind of takes the charm away from the movies. Just relax and watch. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather uninvolving, but OK if you don't look too deeply</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original 1968 film a few years ago, and remember almost nothing about it. Watching the remake, I had a no more than a vague idea that I had seen a previous version. The 2001 movie has left no greater impression.This is a watchable film, but not the great romantic story that some see; the characters are just not likeable enough. The main premise of the story is also a problem. It is this that gives the film its very reason for being, but at the same time it is the cause of a somewhat disturbing undercurrent.WARNING - SPOILERS TO FOLLOW!The story centres around a woman suffering from a fatal condition. In the time left to her she sets out to be the focus of a different man's life each month, ostensibly for their benefit. As presented in the film this is a seemingly noble cause.And yet... Seen from another perspective, this woman becomes deeply and intimately involved with each man, sleeping with them, entangling them emotionally, becoming their dream woman - and then she drops them completely. Why? Because they are of no further use to her, their role in her life complete. Her only intent is to leave an indelible influence on their lives, and an unforgettable memory. All in the cause of creating her own selfish version of immortality.Personally I couldn't get past these concerns. She was breaking the hearts of each of these men. They fall completely in love with her, ask her to marry them. Then she dumps them and takes up with next month's man, remaining emotionally unmoved herself. Of course, the film focuses on the one relationship that does (much against her plans) leave an emotional impact. But even then, her selfish cause is too important - she dumps him too. In the original film she does so in the course of her normal monthly turnover. For the remake they tried to make her a more sympathetic character by bringing her to the point of death at the film's conclusion - there will be no more monthly men after she says goodbye to Mr. November. It works to a degree - the ending is quite sad and bitter-sweet. Still, it can't compensate for the undercurrents in the plotline. And the politically correct insertion of homosexual transvestites into the film can only detract further from the story. Like putting an elephant in "Titanic", their presence is an incongruous distraction.Still, many people will quite enjoy the film - and some will love it. Despite my negative comments, I found it acceptable, perhaps slightly better than average - but only VERY slightly. So by all means give it a try. Indeed, if you particularly enjoy tragic romances you should definitely take a look. You might love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ye Gods! To all those who lauded over this film: where is there even a modicum of merit in this cliche-ridden, saccharine-laced dross? Keanu Reeves has all the charisma (and evinces about as much emotion) of a riverbed rock; he somehow reminds me of Sylvester Stallone, but with a marginally higher IQ -- maybe another 10 points or so -- which doesn't say much. Charlize Theron deserves better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I will admit that Keanu Reeves is a favorite person of mine. My friends joke that such a big movie fan that I am should have such better taste than Keanu. I even joke back that he can't act his way out of a paper bag but he is pretty to look at. That changed when I saw Sweet November.I have read all the comments on here that Charlize was overly dramatic and Keanu was as exciting as a cardboard cutout. And that Jason Issacs would be better served somewhere else. I don't think so. Sara was a woman with a cause. She wanted to show one man a month that there was more to life than the bottom line. That they could be a member of the human race and not just a rat running a race. Her eccentric behavior was fitting to her character.Sara is a woman that left her own rat race when she discovered that she had Hodgkin's, a form of cancer. I wonder how those that criticized the acting would act if their own doctor told them that they didn't have long to live due to incurable disease. Would they start all the treatments that would only weaken them over time? Or would they embrace the life that they had left? I know that I would, and have since finding out that I myself would never be cured of a disease.The gay neighbor that is a transvestite. Yes, it is so overdone. But it was showing that Chaz/Cherry could also let his hair down. Some of the best emotion that Keanu Reeves has ever shown was the scene after the meeting with "God". You could see that he was happy being what he had become.The ending...So many of you have hated it. Does a movie have to end in a neat little package? No, I don't think so. This movie showed that it didn't. As there is no cure for Hodgkin's, there would be no happy ending for Sara and Nelson. Nelson's life was changed when he met Sara. Nelson would in turn change those he happened to encounter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally hated this movie, only reason I picked it up from Blockbuster shalves in the first place was the fact that Jason Isaacs plays in it. It's one of those romance movies that makes you cry, that I generally try to stay away from.It's worth watching because it carries some basic values of love of the life and life the life to it's fullest, but I just believe that there are far more sophisticated ways to send out that message to people, other than a cheap romance flick. Overall acting in the movie is okay. No specific flaws, but nothing to commemorate Charlize and Keanu on.So, if you like these kinds of movies, then you should definitely see it. It may be even funny to you. If you are looking for something with more depth then skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've been moved like this by a film. I had to pause the TV and just sit for a while, letting the feelings hum inside me. It's not just the obvious romantic twist of having the resistant guy fall in love with the woman who seems so opposite him, it's that the film has a deep spiritual message about living in the present. Sara manipulates Nelson into spending a month with her. He is a typical type A workaholic who is completely driven by ambition. And Sara is like a sexy zen seductress who teaches him simply to be, to be in the moment, to be playful. If you can suspend judgement of the whole hollywood thing and just watch Nelson gradually let go it's really beautiful. I guess it moves me so much because it's so strongly what we all seem to need--to stop and let go a little and be more in the moment--we're zooming so fast doing so many things that life and joy can so quickly slip by is and this film shows how precious life really is.</fullReview>

Keanu Reeves eerie, euro-asian stare works when he is the callous advertising executive yet falls short when he (is supposed) to transform into a man of the heart. Theron is always pushing him off the screen; she is a gifted actress that happens to be beautiful, too. You get the sense that she's familiar with her characters way of living at least. The plot is certainly not dramaturgy, yet even as it drags on there are some fulfilling moments. A more successful handling of this concept would be A Warm December (1973) with Sidney Poitier (for a similar story from a culturally specific POV).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely romantic and enchanting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I read a short review of this movie on the magazine, I wanted to see this movie. Because the plot is unlike any story I've seen these days, it's unique, it's interesting and it's risky. The plot is very unique and mysterious. Why does this girl want to help people, divide them into months, what's her story? And why do I say it's risky? Coz these romantic movies can drown my heart and crush it with a sad ending. I've always evaded such movies but I decided to take the risk for this one.Reeves and Theron were marvellous and incredible, and the story moves quite well for most of the part. It really tells the complete change of Nelson because of Sara and how he became such a good person is really nice and rewarding. And the movie slowly reveals on the mystery of Sara and why she's doing all these things.I feel the movie is really romantic and enchanting, I was completely intoxicated for days and it is as if it left me what Sara was trying to give Nelson. It was very beautiful.But the movie had some shortcomings, first I think it didn't explain and build up on Sara's character enough, Sara's the main mystery of this story, Sara's the main character. There were some events which were odd and we don't even know what was happening and why. Second, the ending was really not my type. It made me really sad in the end, and I think it's partly because this movie is meant for the adults. I wanted hope, and the ending I prefer is one which makes you feel good, one which leaves no loose ends. If the ending had been nice, I would give this movie a 10/10 Excellent. It was that close...Nevertheless, this movie was made this way I guess, to make Sara a mystery, her masterplan and her rules, her strive for immortality. Hence the ending... but for me I think it doesn't fit for the big part, I disagree because I have clashing beliefs. But then I loved the movie for the romanticism and for the incredible beauty in it's characters.And for that, I count this as something really worth it and do love it very much despite the 'terrible' ending.</fullReview>

I watch it whenever I want to cleanse my tear ducts, or remember what Real Love Is, I adore this movie. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ THIS IS THE TYPE MOVIE I CAN ENTER for 2 hours and Feel as I'm the character's neighbor across the street or their vegatable vendor. Some films, you just watch from a Peripheral standpoint. Even if you like some of those movies you stand apart from, you just can't enter the scene or the feelings. ~~~~~~~~ BUT "SWEET NOVEMBER" is the opposite. It can be a Learning experience without going through the direct pain involved in growing as these people did. ~~~~~~~~ Anyone who does NOT like this movie, could be a very nice person BUT a Person who JUST DOESN'T want a chewable storyline. These who do not like Sweet November, may just want strained pablem in their watching. ~~~~~~~~~ Now, additionally, I have 70% more comedies in my collection than I do these DEPTH of feeling films.... But When I want DEPTH of FEELING, This Movie is at the top of my list. ~~~~~~~~~ Thank You for Reading my comment. I do appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally did not expect this to be worth my dollar. I expected it to be a sappy love story with a tragic ending. I also thought Keanu Reeves would not be believable as the romantic or that Charlize Theron would get on my nerves. I was wrong about all of the above. Keanu is very believable as the advertising career man with no time to fall in love, and then also believable when he does fall in love-his whole face lights up. Charlize Theron is not one of my favorite actresses but if I see a few more of her movies and she lives up to her performance in this, its likely she will be.Sappy its not-I was wrong there as well. Its not too cheesy but enough romance to make me get misty-eyed. The ending (*not really a spoiler*) does NOT leave you feeling empty. I wouldn't even call it tragic. Another great thing about this film is the supporting characters.If you liked Keanu and Charlize in Devil's Advocate, I cant say whether or not you will like them in this movie. Its completely different. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful movie with some charming moments.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is the moment when Nelson is stood in the street, watching life around him and suddenly realizing that this is what he wants out of life, there is the moment when Charlene is playing with the poodles, there is the moment when Nelson is walking around (to the beautiful music of Enya) figuring stuff out, the brilliant moment when Nelson realizes that the cross-dressing freak next to him is actually his biggest rival in the advertising business "you're that Chas?" and of course there is the moment when Nelson pays the kid to sabotage every other kids boat in the regatta. Other than that the movie is pretty dire. It makes no sense and it is a shame because without the obvious STUPID plot holes it would have been good. Why does Sara take her groceries into the DMV exam when she has a perfectly good van sat in the parking lot? Why does Nelson go the house of (and ultimately have sex with) the crazy woman who in most cases he would have had arrested for stalking? Why does Charlene's character give up a hugely successful business to live such a bohemian life (it is never explained other than it "got too complicated") Why does the gay friend have to automatically be a cross dresser? There are lots of nice things in the movie, there are lots of good messages in the movie (I particularly like the scene when Nelson is in the restaurant with "advertising exec from hell" (Frank Langella) and he sees the way the guy treats people and decides he doesn't want to work for him.) This could have been such a good movie and it wasn't the fault of the actors...., Charlene and Keanu were great with the limited material they were given... Chas (I wish I could remember the actor) fresh from his role in "The Patriot" was utterly brilliant, and Frank Langella in his tiny role gave us the right amount of evil so that we hated him. We shall forget the totally implausible pieces of Nelson dragging a DISHWASHER up the fire escape and the fact that a man lives with a woman and doesn't notice that she is taking approximately 200 pills a day. This movie could have been far more than it turned out to be and I am guessing that in the hands of a more skillful director it would have been. Shame, because the premise is actually fascinating and could have shown us so much more. Kudos to Charlene and Keanu for making the most of a bad attempt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the number of comments that complain about the ending, I'm convinced my point is proven -- Americans want nothing more from a film than raw entertainment with happy endings -- breaks from reality though they may be.Hey, it's ok for a move to be nothing more tha mindless entertainment, and it's ok to want to watch a movie that leaves you happy at the end. But not all films are meant to be that way -- and not all should.When I was a kid I thought the best ending to a movie I ever saw was from 1982's "Last American Virgin" where believe it or not, the guy DIDN'T get the girl. Ya know what folks? It happens in life sometimes.**SPOILER AHEAD** The ending of this movie worked perfectly for me -- a bittersweet end to a tear jerker of a film. Gripe about Keanu's acting if you want or the plot in general, but if you're rating this movie poorly simply 'cause the ending wasn't a happy one, then you're handing out less credit than you should be. I mean, what are you people looking for? I know, you wanted them to find some miracle cure so that Charlize and Keanu could live "happily ever after", right? Now THAT would have been a poor ending.Sad stories can work beautifully. This isn't the top notch sad story movie of all time, but given the movie's nature, this one works.</fullReview>

I did not think it was bad at all, in fact I enjoyed it.Ok so the plot has been run through the mill once to many times, but as long as it's good-I don't care. The whole concept I got from the movie was this: Life is to short, enjoy it while you have the time. She gave him 1 month to loosen up and enjoy his life, no pressure, no work no anything. Look how much he changed because of her, there was a big change in the character.I kind of saw the end coming, as I've seen my share of flicks like this. Yes I think the ending could have been different-But I was not the writer-lol.Overall, It's a sappy yet romantic movie that was well filmed and written. I even enjoyed the actors and I'm not much of a fan of Keanu or Charlize for that matter-but they worked well together.</fullReview>

"Another chick flick?"Yes, I suppose it could be classified as a chick flick...and maybe it doesn't have the best plot, looking at my summary above...but its execution is admirable for one. A woman who is hiding a secret behind her apparent love for life and cheerfulness takes in a workaholic man as her "November". She says that a month is long enough to be meaningful, but not so long as to cause a breakup to be hard.Eventually, though, the man finds out her secret...but what will happen?Personally, I liked this movie, for a chick flick, even though the ending is rather sad. I wouldn't recommend shelling out the $7 to see it in theaters, but it's a good rental.</fullReview>

It seemed to play a little better this time on TV, but there was a feeling I had that was beyond the obvious umpteenth remake of Love Story feeling.This one to me played a lot better than the previous copy, Autumn in New York, with Gere and Ryder that was bottom of the barrel. I could not put my finger on it until I got to the closing credits and saw that the writer was Herman Raucher who wrote Summer of '42.It was then that I realized that at the end of the movie I had the same pleasantly bittersweet "things happen but life goes on" feeling that I had at the end of '42. The difference was that the rest of the movie did not even remotely compare to '42 which is on my personal list of all time favorites.I was a youngster in '42. I have been to both Nantucket and many times to San Francisco. Whereas '42 captured the spirit and feeling of an age, place and an era very faithfully, November is a sham of portraying SF, the characters, or anything else. I will be glad when the current spate of "girl dies or gets the shaft in the end" flicks recycles to something resembling a meaningful ending, but that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know what most of you are thinking (this girl is crazy) but I'm not, OK maybe they could have acted better, maybe the movie was BASED on another one, and maybe it was selfish or something, but it made you realize you have to deal with death, to valorize life, to appreciate small things, and the most important that you cant control everything, like getting in love.It was my favorite movie because it was the first one to make me cry, and this was because knowing you will never see someone again (specially the person who you love) is the hardest thing in the world, not being with the person you love can make you want to die.I had never realized death is sad, but at the same time it is not so bad, you are sad and everything but if somebody dies it is because it was his or her place and time to die. Also us humans don't know what there is after death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I have to admit this movie is nothing new. We've seen this storyline again and again. But what makes this one so good, what makes it different, is the character of Sara Deever. She is true, she is different, but most of all lovable. Just can't help but like her. It's not an action movie so if you're looking for plenty of twists, forget it. If you're looking for a movie intelligent and inspiring, rent this one. It's really worth a look. Keanu is as usual, not the best actor in the world. But he does his job and let the place in the sun to Charlize, which is for the best. Nice chemestry between the two of them.</fullReview>

About the film: Nelson (Keanu) is a workaholic with not much of a life. Sara (Not sure of her name!) loves life and lives it to the fullest. She tells Nelson that she can change his life in a month if he lives with her through out November. Eventually he agrees and they begin to live together. As they are so different they eventually fall in love, and this great romance begins to show and to develop. There is a unexpected ending at the end, which i wont write in case you haven't seen it yet. GO SEE IT!!</fullReview>

After he gets fired and looses his girl-friend he moves in with here. She normally stays with guys for no more than a month, and she tells him that upfront.

Does it always have to be? So Keanu and Charlize didn't have a lot of "chemistry" and "spark." Are they a real-life couple? No. Therefore, the realistic part of the audience doesn't expect them to be perfect. This movie was thought-provoking, dramatic, loving and cute. If you expected more, you are a complete idiot, because it's obvious you didn't really watch the preview. I thought it was perfect for the movie it was supposed to be.</fullReview>

They did the ending a way I had never seen and that was very interesting, although my friend didn't like it. Makes you have sympathy for the characters but also makes you see they were lucky. Not everybody finds love. The song in the previews gave me butterflies, half the reason I wanted to see the movie.

		<fullReview>This movie, like most movies, is written to evoke emotions within movie goers. Myself, I was moved by quite a few scenes in this film, because the scenes reminded me of my life, and what happened to me...In particular: the scene with Nelson going back to the home he was raised in with Sarah... that took me back to my own place when I was young... Sarah's illness, once it becomes clear she's ill, that is very well acted, and it flooded me with memories of when my mother fell ill, not that all the circumstances in my life are identical, but that the acting was good enough to trigger these moments in my life...The part where Abner, the child across the street from Sarah, asks Nelson if he can adopt him... Well, I adopted 3 children 11 years ago, and that scene was very powerful for me, being fully aware of how that child really depicted what would happen in real life..powerful stuff.Also, I found the music to be right on with the moods..!!!There are many parts that are touching, and every movigoer will react differently according to their personal experiences but the part that I found to be most effective is:After Nelson drops off Abner, and he looks up at Sarah's house, he leaves to begin a few days of thinking. The music, and the scenes that follow will either move you beyond words or leave you indifferent... this will depend on if you have related to the movie, or if you've been sitting there trying to critique it, or find flaws with it. Also, the movie is best enjoyed if you go along for the ride. Ever heard of the concept, if you don't want to be hypnotized, you won't be...hehe... enjoy.. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never listen to critic's reviews, they are never on the mark. Some critics have seen way too many movies and they think everything is a rehash of some old movie. I personally found this movie to be charming, if but a little sad. The ending really stunk but that is the realm of the script writer, and not the actors. Overall Keanu played this part perfectly. He often times came on as a emotioness jerk who's only care in the world is his work. It took all he had to express his love for her. Granted when it was time to show the real emotions keanu came short. But Theron had all the emotions left over to spare. The movie was all her. He simply provided the backdrop scenery. I would recomend this movie to anyone who is in a relationship and feels they are just in a relationship for sex. This movie really makes you think what life is about and it gradually takes you over to its way of thinking. If you stop to smell the roses, maybe every day can be a sweet november.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland, but not as bad as "Autumn in New York"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen both Keanu and Charlize over the past few years in quite a lot of films. This one was bland and predictable.There are spoilers ahead:Nelson is a driven man who lives for his job, pretty much. After he is partially responsible for helping a woman (Sarah - played by Charlize Theron) not get her driver's license renewed, she stalks him and virtually forces Nelson to drive to some place in which she "heroically" torches the place and rescues the cute little animals. I could tell right away that this was going to be a set up for a bunch of cute "dog" scenes. Every time the dog showed up in the scene, the people sitting behind me said "awwww".I found it unbelievable that so suddenly he would do an about-face from wanting this crazy stalker to go away, to hopping in the sack really quickly. Oh, a walk on the beach, running barefoot in the sand, and suddenly he realizes that he needs to take more time to stop and smell the flowers. Yeah, life is so beautiful, get to have a girlfriend but only for a month. The redeeming factors in this movie is unlike Autumn, the "impending death" scenes were saved for the last few minutes of the movie, whereas in 'Autumn in New York" you were waiting and waiting and waiting for her to kick the bucket already.In many of the scenes, where everyone else was weepy and sentimental and saying "Oooooh!" (the gift scene at Thanksgiving). I kept thinking to myself - ok here is the part where I am supposed to cry now, but I just could not get into the spirit of it, because the characters were just too unbelievable for me.</fullReview>

There were the few moments where he managed to get through a scene without seeming to wooden, but most of the time he struggled! I guess I haven't seen too many of his movies--the ones that pop to mind are "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" and "Parenthood"--and I think he did a fine job in those. I also saw "A Walk in the Clouds" and in that he had me mesmerized, he was so believable!! I don't why, but he just didn't convince me in "Sweet November"! Charlize Theron was pretty good. I loved the dinner scene with her downstairs neighbors--WAY funny! (Who was Chaz's date? He looked so familiar, but I can't remember the character's name to look it up--HELP)I came to IMDB right after the movie to see what others were saying, wish I'd come here before! You bet I will in the future! (I'm also looking for a rental of the 1968 version--leads anyone?)This movie reminded me a lot of "Dying Young," which I'd watch over and over--"Sweet November," once is enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Sweet November is hardly a genre classic, it is a well made and sincerely intentioned tearjerker. Sure, the basic premise is rather outlandish, but so are the plots of Star Wars, Dirty Harry etc. What I'm saying is that despite the poor reviews from major the critics this film is filled with effective moments of both pathos and drama. I saw the original once many years ago and if memory serves, the producers should have re-created that films ending instead of the not quite satisfying finale in the remake. Also, directly explaining why the Sara character chooses such a lifestyle would also have been an improvement. From the sniffles coming from the audience the movie does make a connection with the viewer and any movie that does that is no failure. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bittersweet romance. Sara knows she is dying, but instead of giving up, she wants to have as many experiences she can. She wants to be loved for her vivacity and livliness. She does not want to be remembered as the hollow, week skeleton of someone who was once full of life. She doesn't want to be anyone's sad story.When she falls in love with Nelson, she is forced to choose between the world she has built for herself and the one she has always feared. She chooses to do what is best for her. She lives life on her own terms. She refuses to let her impending death rule whatever life she has left. As much as you want her to let Nelson take care of her, you know that she can't let him. Sara has to let Nelson go in order to focus on life. Once he found out she was dying, he was too protective of her, always worrying about what might happen instead of just loving her and enjoying the present.</fullReview>

Of course, the romance aspect was well, romantic, but the story was a little far fetched.

		<fullReview>Okay, I just saw this movie, and I have lots of stuff to comment on. Usually, I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves, but I must say that the move in choosing to make this film was a big mistake. I felt that this film was poorly written. The parts that were evidently jokes, were not funny at all. The character that Charlize Theron played was incredibly unstable. This is a known fact, but it got to the point where it was annoying. The whole plot is unbelievable. Think about it. If you were asked by an almost complete stranger to live with you for a month, you wouldn't do it...it's just too risky. I thought that lots of things in it were badly approached, such as a controversial dinner scene with Charlize's neighbors. It was meant to be funny, but it just wasn't well done at all. I have nothing against the cast, I happen to like Keanu and Charlize, but I did not like them in this. I know that it was not entirely their fault. The director has a lot of say in what happens on stage, and movies are generally the director's work, not the actors. I don't think very much about the director (I don't know the name.) I hope he/she tries again, and corrects the mistakes made and redeems him/herself. I've seen the original version which is almost completely different from this version. In my opinion, it would have done the film more justice to stay closer on track to the original script.If ever there were a case of trying too hard on a film, this is it. (sorry)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I went to see a sneak preview of "Sweet November". When it was over, my boyfriend asked me, "Well, what did you think?" I was in such a mood over this movie and exasperated over its ending, I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. My emotions were totally wacked out. I found myself asking, "Was it good or not"? I was okay with it at the beginning and in the middle, but the ending left me hanging and frustrated.I don't know (for all you diehard movie goers out there)if you noticed the recent trend of movie endings and their weak story lines. They either tear your heart out at the ending, i.e. "Pay it Forward", "Requiem for a Dream"..., or leave it up to you to end it; (Cast Away and Family Man). Come on...what a rip. Why don't writers take a chance and give most audiences what we all want and crave for, a happy ending. On the other hand, if they don't want to go for your "A-typical" happy ending, the least they could do is NOT give away the plot of the movie in the trailer - for God's sake!As for "Sweet November", unless you're a real Keanu Reeves fan (which I am) or a Charlize Theron fan (which I am), just see the trailer, and yes, you will know how it ends. Just like you thought, buuuuuuut it also leaves you in limbo saying, "Why couldn't they just have given us more to work with at the end instead of being left to wonder"? Are they truly trying to be creatively clever or JUST PLAIN LAZY?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fall asleep twice before I finish this movie. It took big effort for me to finish just because I like Charlize Theron. Already Keanu Reeves gave his worst performance in this movie. Here is list why this movie suck according to me....1. Lack chemistry between characters from the beginning. 2. Both are great actors but their performance wasn't at their best. 3. Plot was not very convincing and looked very much forced to give sad ending. 4. Even being 2 hr movie somehow it failed to get into character which was quite painful. 5. Concealed life of heroin was not appealing to be mysterious as it should have been. 6. Keanu can't do out of skin character. 7............................even my points stated boring me. Everything about this movie is boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great romantic drama, completely underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Nelson, a man in the fast lane, highly talented advertising consultant and workaholic to boot. Time is money, and success is everything. Anything else is second to that, even his girlfriend. Even his own personal life. She gets sick of it and leaves, but not before an overstressed Nelson manages to get fired. But then he has just met Sara. Sara is a down to earth, seemingly crazy girl with an odd set of rules. She just wants one month, to wake him up. To save him. But time is the one thing that is most difficult to give.Comments: This is a movie that really leapt on me. Or mostly it was Theron's character Sara that enthralled me. Such warmth, such joy de vivre is rarely seen and even more seldom actually felt coming across the screen. And, like Nelson, I find her totally captivating. She really is this movie.Keanu Reeves are more limited with emotions and do not come across the screen as well as Theron do. But for one he and his character is not supposed to, not until the end at least and he does warm up considerably. He also does provide a nice and almost needed contrast to Sara, as another character like her would be too much.Also well worth mentioning is Jason Isaacs that are really impressive in an odd but interesting supporting character.I find it surprising that this movie wasn't considered for any more awards than the Razzie. Especially Theron's acting was impressive, and she certainly didn't deserve a Worst Actress Nomination.If you haven't figured it out already I really like this movie. It was a movie that managed to captivate me. It was so full of emotion it was hard to resist. Also there is something mysterious and secret behind Sara's façade, and it is almost impossible not to come to care for this woman. In addition to finding out how the relation between Sara and Nelson developed (but that almost came to be secondary), I really wanted to know her secret.I think this is a movie that should be seen with a certain someone. With all the emotions flowing, some really nice scenes and a really fitting soundtrack it is almost perfect for a nice evening at home, just the two of you.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet November It Was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who saw this movie and thought is was boring or corny, simply don't get the wonderful subtle elements within it. It was made to show how someone, completely devoid of sentiment can learn to love and appreciate the smaller and sweeter things of life. Everyone falls in love with Sara Deever (Theron) because all of us have some Nelson (Reeves) in us. We all wish and hope to be as youthful and loving as Sara. This movie is sad, but also a feel-good movie. It leaves wanting to appreciate life a little more. To quote the film, "It doesn't get much sweeter than this". This movie had all the elements of a great film. Great actors, message, and story. Just give it a chance and maybe you will get a second chance at life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...I recommend this movie to everyone young and old...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, just wanna warn you that English isn't my native language, so sorry in advance. To put it baldly, this movie intrigued me only because of its "starting lineup" KEANU REEVES and CHARLIZE THERON, although in past few years Keanu seems to be taken over T. Cruise's egocentric ways, but lets better stick to the movie. Before watching I had no idea what this movie was like, the only thing I knew it was romantic drama and to be honest how many possible plots there can be for this kind of movie?! Despite this fact I had no prejudice, I simply was hopping to enjoy this movie as it seemed "nice", I mean entertaining and easy listening in a movie way. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 and I can clarify why, the beginning of this movie disappointed me a bit, as it was too precipitant (how could I know the reason for this in the start), but it definitely gave this movie a shallow look, plus some lapse did not saved the "day" (I mean the episode with submarine). As the movie went on it get a bit better, but all in all it was average impression. Only when everything became obvious, there's where it started to sting. The final scene really did gave me trouble breathing, no doubt the best episode and everyone should come up with his/her own thoughts about it, so I won't impose mine. I had never happen to go through something like this, so I can only imagine how hard (more like impossible) it is. The reason I wrote this is to help (I honestly hope it will) the ones, who base there choices on the IMDb rates, numbers are not the best advisers here. I simply judge by the way it affects me, leaving out all the movie standards and cannons, so take it into consideration. I recommend this movie to everyone young and old, fat and bold (no exceptions). You might not like it, but it will certainly leave an imprint. Thanks for your time, hope it helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment contains spoilers!I saw this movie last night and didn't like anything about it. The whole plot and the characters are totally unrealistic. At the beginning of the movie, Sara seems to be a complete lunatic. A workaholic like Keanu's Character would just have called the police if she was bothering him, and wouldn't have wasted time on her. In fact, in the beginning of the movie, he seems to realize that she acts like a crazy women. But all of a sudden, because he lost his job and his girlfriend left him, he seems to think: 'oh well, free sex', and decides to stay with her??? So he gives her a day. They take a walk at the beach, help a kid win a boatrace, and all of a sudden he realizes that this was the most spectacular day of his life?? Come on. This must have been the most boring way I saw two people falling in love spend a day together in a movie.So he decides to stay with her (although i have no idea why), and falls in love with her. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two, so I couldn't understand why the hell a workaholic like him would fall for a crazy person like her. And it all happens too fast. One minute, he thinks she is a lunatic, and the next minute he would leave everything behind for her. Damn, this guy is easy to convince.Keanu acts like a piece of cardboard, like always. Charlize tries hard to create some chemistry between them, but it must be an impossible job with an actor like Keanu.The part of the kid in the movie adds to the surrealism. At first I thought: 'where does this kid live??', until he ran off to tell his mother that Keanu's character will join him on father's day to his school. She must be an alcoholic or a drug addict to agree with that.Sara is dying of cancer. However, she invites an unknown man to stay with her for a month, knowing that he is falling in love with her. But when she gets really ill, she kicks him out. Nice personality.And in the end, Keanu even performs a Mary Poppins act, when he magically gets a dishwasher out of his Christmas bag.Bad story, bad characters, bad acting: bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, awful, and... yes, awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I didn't see the original movie. Based on this one, I think I never will.Here's the plot. Keanu is a hot-shot marketing agent. You know the type, working 24-7, mistreats his hot girlfriend, watches roughly seventeen TVs while doing his morning exercise. In other words, a regular prick.Charlize on the other hand is not. She's a free spirit, finds joy in small unimportant fuzzy little things, like walking 10 poodles by the beach or playing hide and seek. She also doesn't care about her appearance, she does her hair with a vacuum cleaner and dresses what she finds on the floor. Of course, that doesn't prevent her from looking spectacular and having perfect hair and make-up in every scene but let's not nitpick here. Oh, except when she gets sick which is indicated by her not wearing makeup.So anyway, Charlize starts to harass Keanu because he was responsible for getting her kicked out from driving exam. Hey, this looks like a perfect setup for some great romantic comedy, right? He'll hate her, she'll hate him, they will put practical jokes on each other and finally fall in love, right? Wrong. This plot goes right out of the window, and is changed with Charlize insisting of "helping" Keanu, which consists of moving in with her, doing fun things (including having hot sex with aforementioned) and generally getting more relaxed and being less, well, a prick.Now here we come to the basis of my intense hatred for this movie. I really hate this Hollywood "free spirit" characters who spread joy and happiness and try to tell me how to Really Enjoy Life. Well, listen up, miss Charlize or Sara or whatever her name in the movie was, I'd really like to play silly games all day and have long warm baths, and throw away my cell-phone and forget about my daily job but, get this, I NEED TO EARN FOR THE LIVING. Like I need some overpaid Hollywood actor to tell me that regular every-day routine is boring. Sure, give me ten million dollars, I'll walk the dogs all day and relax and have fun. Geez. Back to the movie. Keanu puts up a small fight, but since Charlize is kinda hot instead of calling the police or at least psychiatric hospital he falls for her and eventually accepts her ways. And, lo and behold, he becomes A Better Person. Wee. Thanks Charlize, your psycho promiscuous ways really DO help.But of course, all is not well in Happy Fantasy Land where you can goof around and run willy-nilly all day and still manage to pay your rent and bills and eat food in nice restaurants. There is a dark reason why Charlize lives like she does and has a one-month dating policy. And oh no, say it ain't so, this "comedy" turns into a sappy soap-opera. Like I cared, since I hated both of the protagonists anyway.There is absolutely no need to see this movie. It's not funny, it's not moving, it's basically a big nothing. I even skipped over some things and characters in this crap that are not just totally pointless but actually manage to takes this movie further down a notch . Take that kid for example. Or the utterly clichéd drag/gay neighbour. Look, that men is wearing a dress. Some prime comedic material there. Or what about.. but I'll stop here. Watch the movie and make your own I-hated-this list afterwards, so we can compare.2/10 P.S. Oh I almost forgot. If you need to move furniture around the house, please call Keanu Reeves. This guy can lift a dishwasher (together with bunch of other things) with one hand while climbing through a first-story window. And he can sing, too. He really is The One.</fullReview>

The MOVIE was GREAT GREAT GREAT! Thumbs up!I suddenly bought this movie out of my curiosity. Seldom did I cried when I was watching any movie and Sweet November made me(exaggeratively speaking) dehydrated. The last scene and the flashback of what they've done in that month was SO TOUCHING!! Most importantly...the movie made us reflect on balance we have to take between Human Relationships and Work. There is no point to have all the money, wealth, physical enjoyments but losing all the relationships that a human ought to possess.I was moved by Charlize and I actually wonder why she's always in movies with sad endings.I am looking forward to North Country hoping that the Hong Kong cinema owners would buy it and show us in theatres.The storyline is simple, plot is not difficult to get but the sensation that it has given to me was a "Waoh!".Go and watch it and ignore the crap negative reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sweet November" isn't any more ridiculous with a slutty compromised lead woman than "Pretty Woman." But I assume this is not a date movie, judging by the constant, loud, annoying, derisive comments from the men in the audience who I assume were convinced to come by the presence of co-star Charlize Theron but were probably peeved that this is her first film with no breast-bearing as the producers chickened out of a "R" rating at the last minute. The toned-down practically Hays Commission sex we do see does hurt the slight plot, as the only reason we're really given that Keanu Reeves's character stays around at first must be due to this great invisible sex. That Theron is suddenly revealed to have a beautiful bout of non-AIDS Movie Star Disease has a long tradition, going back at least to the most gorgeous consumptive in history, Garbo in "Camille." Though the presumption that the gay couple down the hall (who in practically a first in movies have gainful employment) was better suited to take care of her than her lover was a bit odd -- why, because they have experience with chronically ill friends or something?The Mom in "Gilmore Girls" has a couple of lines where she manages to turn The Girlfriend role into a tart commentator.The soundtrack songs are a complete mish-mash from pop to Enya that make no selection sense, cohesion or commentary.Regardless, I'm someone who stayed through "A Walk in the Clouds" twice so I guess I just enjoy watching Keanu in romantic movies. Well, maybe in any movies. (originally written 2/25/2001)</fullReview>

These 3 movies almost have the same story line. I don't know how long would they cont' making the same story into a lot of movies. The guy hates a girl, they somehow fell in love with each other later, and at last he found out that the girl is dying and the girl is dead. That is all. Oh yeah even though in Sweet November, the girl is not dead but she move away. So that is as good as dead, right? So if you like this type of movie so go ahead. But if you have seen the other movie of this type, I would recommend you to skip it. It would be Boring!!!!. Any way I would gave like Maximum of 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad movie, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sweet November' starts as a predictable romantic comedy where you feel something will change and then it turns into a predictable romantic drama. The movie starts with a 50-minute introduction before the plot, well, "plot", really begins. In this first 50 minutes we see what kind of workaholic Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves) is. We also see how he makes Sara Deever (Charlize Theron) fail a drivers license-test because of his cheating. He has to pay her back by driving her somewhere and after that he has to drink coffee with her. She discovers he is a not very happy workaholic and that he never does anything fun. She offers him to make his life fun, no work, for one month (November of course) but he has to live with her. Sure he declines but fortunately he is fired and he loses his girlfriend Angelica (played by the lovely Lauren Graham) on the same day. So he becomes Sara's November.Here we are almost halfway the movie and we feel that things are not as they seem. I will not reveal too much about the things that follow but it is all pretty predictable so you can guess it right anyway. There is also a silly little subplot involving a boy without a father (it must be very easy to guess this right) and a subplot involving two transvestite neighbors. You understand that the story is not that great, may be even a little stupid. So what about other things you might enjoy in a movie? The chemistry between Reeves and Theron is alright but I liked them better in 'The Devil's Advocate' and that movie didn't even require them to have much chemistry. There is a funny supporting role by Greg Germann, who is known from Ally McBeal, but he is pretty much the character he portrays there.I didn't like the ending as well but when you really think about it no ending would be satisfying in a movie like this. May be this was the best thing to do although you have to notice the setting for the closing scene. It is one of those quite beautiful places this kind of things never happen. Why not just any corner of any street? After reading all this you must think I really hated the movie but that is not true. I have a strange thing with romantic comedies, or just romantic movies, and for some reason I enjoy watching almost all of them. I can see how bad they sometimes are but I like them anyway. I definitely can't recommend this movie but if you can have the same feeling I have with this genre you might enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice idea crashes into cliche mountain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This started out as an interesting movie idea. Charlize Theron plays Sara, your standard eccentric stalker type out to save the world (and apparently independently wealthy). Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a computer hacker pretending to be an advertising executive named Nelson. It was not one of his better roles. Anyway, Nelson meets Sara, Sara proceeds to play the lovable stalker and Nelson falls in love. The fascinating theme they could have played with was the idea of a woman who has this habit of inviting a man into her life for one month, to help them and then to move on. Had that been the theme of the movie this could have been an interesting character study. But, they instead proceed to move into the greatest movie cliche of them all: (spoilers here, so watch out) she's dying of a non-disfiguring disease. Actually, I figured it out pretty quickly, so I'm sure you will as well. From there the coincidences, cliches, and plot holes begin to pile up so high you can't see the screen anymore. This is a remake of a previous version in 1968. Never heard of it, you say? Neither had I. So, why remake it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "bandwagon effect" - professional critics give bad reviews, then IMDb users give bad reviews because they want to agree with the critics. Well, not this user. I didn't see the 1968 version of this film, I like everything Charlize Theron is in, I think Keanu Reeves is fun to watch, even though he will never be recognized as one of our great actors. My wife and I enjoyed "Sweet November." Sure, the premise is far-fetched, and the storyline is manipulated to get them together, but tell me which fictional movie doesn't rely on these very same things. Not too long ago "American Beauty" won best picture. A far-fetched premise? You bet. A manipulated storyline? No doubt.Charlize Theron is beautiful to look at, and she is one of our fine young actresses, in the same league as Angelina Jolie. The only flaw is that her character probably should have been a bit more ordinary-looking. Reeves is perfectly cast as the driven advertising executive who has no time for anything else, even a caring relationship. Lauren Graham of Gilmore Girls TV series plays his girlfriend who moves out as the story unfolds. Overall the actors and their characters blend well and the film is thought-provoking, even the way it ends.SPOILERS AHEAD - Set in S.F., Sara (Theron) is dying of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, looks for a different guy each month to move into her place, no strings, one month only, she helps him become a better person, but does not tell them of her affliction. Meets Reeves at DMV, taking license tests, she is kicked out because he askes her a question, she makes him drive her places, he goes ballistic during a hot dog ad presentation, gets fired, girlfriend moves out, he has nothing to lose, moves in with Sara in November, gradually he becomes less driven, befriends a fatherless boy, rigs sailboat race, falls in love with Sara, she is hospitalized, he carries her out, gay friends take care of her, she tells him goodbye, doesn't want him to remember her as a dying person, he has a new perspective on what is important in life. Somewhat silly premise and story, but fun to watch.Saw it on DVD, one of the best video transfers, sound mainly from front, moderately interesting making-of featurette. Rate "7" of 10, an entertaining 2 hours but little lasting impressions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason that the machine keeps spitting out movies like this is because little delicate woman flock in herds to go see them. There is a cute little puppy and the couple somehow gets split up and they feel sympathy for fictional characters put into unimaginative situations and their unbelievable love stories.Nelson Moss (Reeves) is a business (the only thing that I can see Keanu selling is pizzas) man who lives in a pretty apartment and wears nice clothes. You already know that he's miserable because no businessman in a love story can be happy. So he thinks his life is great because he has a pretty car, but really his life is meaningless and empty.Sarah is like a prostitute who does her work for free. The only thing that she wants in exchange for her sex (with complete strangers) is for them to come out of it happy. We know that Sarah herself is free spirited because she likes to run on the beach and save cute little puppies.To top off the terrible script and direction, they decided to cast Keanu Reeves in a leading role. Watching Keanu try to act is like watching a car crash in slow motion. You have to hand it to Keanu though. Never have a seen an actor so closely resemble a deer in headlights. He appears to be trying very hard, but the poor thing will never get past the image that he has been provided, no matter how hard he tries. I was actually waiting for him to say `Surf's up dude!' Charlize Theron is a perfect example of Hollywood not looking for talent. But who needs to be able to act if they have a pretty face. Lucky for her she was `acting' Keanu, who made her look like an Academy Award winning actress. Theron was completely miscast in her role because she comes off as being so inhibited, but she's playing a free spirit.The ONLY thing that I enjoyed about this movie was Jason Issac's performance. He was so incredibly cute and funny as Chaz that I instantly fell in love with him. I would much rather have watched Jason standing in front of a white screen with his hands in his pockets. When he said `aye' to Keanu while standing in the doorway I just kind of melted onto the floor. The only problem that I had with his character was the fact that they pointlessly made him a transvestite. I would have no problem with this if it served a purpose other prying some cheap laughs out of ignorant people. It made it look like just because you're gay?you also have to cross dress. That's not right.The funniest moment in the movie came when Norman and Sara are having passionate sex and Norman is really into it. Close up on Sara's face and she is looking bored staring at the camera.`SPOILERS' AHEADI figured out the end just by watching the commercials. As soon as we discover that Sara has cancer, she has to be without makeup, looking really sick (all of the sudden), and crying in just about every single scene. I had a bet going with my sister that she was going to end up with cancer and then she would die at the end. Instead we got her walking away to go make up with her family (gag) and a blindfolded Keanu walking around aimlessly (looking the same as he does when he can see). I think the reason that she didn't die at the end was so that Keanu wouldn't have to try to cry in the movie. We all know that he wouldn't be able to pull that one off.If you've seen one love story, you've seen them all. The original `Sweet November' had to have been better than this. The two actors and the original writer must be turning in their graves right now. Do yourself a favor and buy `Love Story' or `An Affair to Remember'. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>...this film IS as bad as the naysayers make out. Not because of the acting, however. The first eighty or so minutes work quite well, and even the insipid Greg Germann, whom I note nobody gives flak to for his terrible acting (he makes Keanu look like Kenneth Branagh for art's sake!), hasn't got much to work with.The problem is that while the first two acts of the film give the characters plenty to do, and hides their lack of depth well by keeping them eccentric and mysterious, the lack of development shines through when it comes time to reveal something more deep and meaningful about them. Keanu Reeves does a very good job of playing an egomaniac devoid of normal reason, and Charlize Theron plays an excellent nut, but when they become "normalised", the whole thing comes crashing down in a heap.(This next comment will spoil the film for you, but I think that if you watched it, you'd pick the cliched ending coming a mile off, anyway.)The motives of our characters are a little screwed, too. Having a terminal illness that keeps coming back doesn't drive people to do things like what goes on here, and it is totally unnecessary to the film's purposes, anyway. I know people who invite strangers into their homes and train them in music, literature, or whatever, just for the sake of making them a better person and/or making the world a better place to live in. Which seems to me like a far more noble purpose than simply doing it to fill in time before your body gives up and dies. Why not have the couple simply live happily ever after?Actually, one previous comment about this film answers that question with the average female's hypocrisy about film choices - it's because their films need a body count, too. The difference is that while men cheer when people get killed on camera because they deserve it (check out Alan Ford in Snatch sometime for an example), women seem to take joy in weeping over the death of an individual in the film. But like a bad action film, Sweet November's heroine is so poorly developed that we just don't care enough.I tell you what though, the spiels in this film were almost enough to give me a craving for hot dogs. How's that for sick?</fullReview>

I think someday I would call up the airline I took from Singapore to Taipei, whatever the airline was, and complain about their in-flight so-called "entertainment" that do nothing but bore."Sweet November" is boring to the extent that I was tempted to do my school holiday homework. I would have completed my entire Maths assignment if I knew how to do any of them, that's how boring "Sweet November" is, even Maths is more appealing than it! Firstly, Keanu Reeves can't act. He sucked in "Chain(ed) Reaction", he sucked in "The Matrix" (okay, he looked cool, but that does not equal great acting), and he sucked, absolutely sucked, in this movie. I almost feel sorry for Charlize Theron for being stuck with such a boring leading man, because she, unlike Mr. Keanu Reeves, can act. But Not Quite, because she chose to be in this junk. The two of them had no chemistry, and due to Reeves' flat acting, the romance didn't seem at all possible. Right, a free-spirited, *interesting* woman falls in love with this boring man who has like one facial expression that never changes ever, and why did she fall in love with him? Was there any explanation for it? Okay, perhaps there was, but due to the forgettable-ness of "Sweet November", I forget.Now let's move on to the plot. It is not even slightly interesting. I could care less if Charlize falls for Keanu, or if Keanu would go back to Charlize, or if Charlize would turn lesbian and abandon Keanu forever. So Charlize falls in love with Keanu, and they have sex! Hurray! Bring on the marching band! Not only a plot like this is done before (girl meets guy, they fall in love, they have sex, they find reasons to separate, they discover they can't live without each other, they want each other back, but oops, one of them has some dark, forbidden secret that he/she has been keeping from the other party, and so on and so forth), the film-makers did nothing to spice it up. I think the most interesting characters were the dogs Charlize took out to walk.I was going to see this in the cinema, but thank god, I had some school-related crap that I couldn't get out of. If only I had watched some *useful* documentary on the Discovery Channel or whatever while I was on the plane.PS. There is nothing about this movie to "get". If the film-makers want to explore some deep and meaningful philosophy about the imperfection of life, maybe they should start with improving the script, and then move on to portraying real people, and finally get an "actor" who can "act".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People, believe me when I tell you that this movie really stinks. I've changed diapers that were more entertaining than this. This is the kind of movie that you're forced to watch because you made your ladyfriend watch that high-octane action movie the week before. Watching this, I could only grit my teeth and try to keep the anticipation of the upcoming Matrix sequels at bay. I almost sobbed watching this because it didn't end after ten minutes. Also, if you really need to see Keanu and Charlize work together, watch Devil's Advocate. It's a much better movie unless oversugared crap is your bag. Now don't get me wrong: I can watch a romance movie and yeah I've seen some sugar sweet stuff that I've actually liked. I can watch movies other than "Movies for Guys Who Like Movies". But this movie is about as sweet as a regular sized cappuccino with twenty sugars and yet rancid as a bag of rotten clementines. Avoid at all costs. And I do mean..... all. God this movie sucks!

		<fullReview>Charlize Theron is the only reason to sit through this epic of sentimentality.Charlize meets Keanu, the yuppie ad exec and insists that he give her a month - November - to change his lifestyle. All well and good. Story is interesting. But, it is so difficult to get around Keanu's inability to act. He always acts sincere. It is like watching a two hour audition tape. Fortunutely, he has Charlize to prop him up.I harbor great hope that Keanu will drift into character and supporting roles where he can learn more of his craft. However, he is no longer the Hollywood pretty boy and needs to lose some weight. Reeves is not Brando.While the story is sentimental - it is to the point and the ending was interesting and moving.5/10 for story, art direction, supporting cast and Charlize Theron. I can only imagine a Matt Damon, or a Charlie Sheen might have done with Keanu's part.</fullReview>

It seems that some people in here didn't get the bottom line of the movie at all. There's no such thing as perfect! some people even posted their comments without even spelling the actors names right so how can these people criticize the actors and the movie...That's why i laughed when i saw the comments in this page come on people as Ken said maybe if you see the movie again you will have a better understanding of it......That's all i have to say Another thing how many times have you seen a movie and it didn't make sense the first time i have seen plenty so far...like Pulp FictionSweet November was great and very touching i haven't seen such a great movie before.

		<fullReview>....so people in the movie production companies must think they make a good couple....I can't stand it when people say a movie 'sucks','reeks', or is 'awful' just because they didn't like it. When you think about it, it's all just a matter of opinion, even with the movie critics. That's why I never base a decision on whether to go see a movie or not, on what the critics have to say about it. If it looks good to me, I'll go see it. I really enjoyed 'Sweet November' because I love Keanu and I love Charlize. It was obvious to me that the reason she does her monthly ritual is so that she can have romance and companionship in her life but not get too attached because it will not only hurt her when she gets sick, but it will be hard on the guy also. Mr. /Ms. Hotoil...you got things a little mixed up...it seemed like she wanted him to go but he didn't want to leave...of course she didn't want him to leave but she didn't want him to be there to see her die.... "Sweet November" was a sweet romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual, the same old goes without saying, I see the Keanu Reeves bashers everywhere I go. I have seen this movie, it was wonderful! I truly wished sometimes that folks would put Keanu Reeves in a different light outside of "whoa!" People, everyone has to start somewhere, and that happens to be where this young man started. However that is not apparently where this fine specimen of a man will end up! This movie delivered and I loved him and Charlize Theron. They have grown a little since The Devils Advocate, and it truly shows admirably with them both! I thought they blended well together, and as always Keanu was just sweet and romantic (bashful) in this role.(I saw the original, and I thought this movie was a close 2nd to the original. The Gift(Keanu had his heart in this one),The Watcher(Keanu truly delivered) was truly magnificent in his roles in both of these films, and again, he came through with Sweet November. Sorry folks, I am an avid Keanu fan all the way and through his charismatic stature and exotic looks I see a fine film star. He is Keanu, and through it all he is developing into a fine performer. Loved him in Bram Stokers Dracula. I just see so much more to this gentlemen than most. Too Bad for all that don't. This movie rates a 10 in my book. A good love story, as it was intended to be. Loved every moment of it. Bravo Keanu and Charlize!Peace Sandy</fullReview>

Theron makes a strong showing despite a weak script, but even she can't turn this one around. With wooden delivery like "it's a HOT dog...a HOT hot dog...", Reeves embarrasses not only himself but the people unlucky enough to have spent hard earned money to pay for a ticket for this lousy film. Enya lends another song to a film, this time "Only Time", played twice in the movie. At one point, it's not really appropriate to what's happening, and the second time, you don't care enough about the movie to bother to make a connection. Avoid this film at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I tried to like it, honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** SPOILERS TO FOLLOW, NOT THAT THEY'LL BE A SURPRISE IF YOU'VE SEEN A COMMERCIAL OR TRAILER **I know there are people who swear by the notion of the chick flick. They claim that some movies, by virtue of their subject matter, can only be liked by women. I imagine, by that same reckoning, there are movies that can hypothetically only be liked by men. I've never really subscribed to either notion, though, choosing instead to believe that there are just good stories and bad stories, and good stories transcend gender lines to entertain us all. So when I heard people describing "Sweet November" as a chick flick before it had even been released, I went to see it with the firm intention of ignoring which gender it might appeal to more. How refreshing it was to walk out of the theater realizing that this is a movie that might not appeal to anyone.In all honesty, like my little subject line says above, I tried to like this movie. I made the effort because I believed from the very beginning that the filmmakers' hearts were in the right place. I think they genuinely wanted to touch the audience emotionally, to give them characters and a situation they could relate to and empathize with. This wasn't crass, manipulative silliness like "Pay it Forward"; I feel like they made an effort to produce a nice movie, and for that I thank them. Unfortunately, their nice little movie was hijacked by cliche and the wet rag of melodrama, which came courtesy of not one, but two big emotional set pieces meant to leave the audience in tears, but instead just made me wonder, "Now how did Keanu get that dishwasher up the fire escape?"But I get ahead of myself. Keanu Reeves plays Nelson Moss, a cutthroat ad exec who's embroiled in a campaign to add edge to a hot dog company's advertisements. Charlize Theron plays Sara Deever, a quasi-bohemian who rescues animals and strives to "help" a different man each month by having them live with her for that same period of time. The two of them meet in that hotbed of passion, the Department of Motor Vehicles, when Sara drops her bag of groceries, and Nelson chivalrously hands her an escaped sausage. As a side note, I'm sure Freud would have a field day with the abundance of hot dog / sausage imagery, but I'll refrain from such enterprises, choosing instead to believe, in this case, that a sausage is just a sausage. Following this precipitous meeting, Sara invites Nelson to become Mr. November. Nelson declines, but once he's fired and his girlfriend leaves him, he reconsiders and moves in with Sara pronto. At first Nelson wrestles with how wise an idea it is to move in with a woman who freely admits to sleeping with a different man each month in the name of personal assistance. I wrestled with it for a while, too, but then I had to admit that when Charlize Theron is offering herself to you, it would take a far better man than myself to say no.And thus begins the long, slow slide into ugliness. To give the actors their due, part of my waffling on this film is due to their likability. Reeves has become such a running punchline that it came as a genuine surprise to see him attempting real emotional depth here. And Theron, despite her unfortunate choice of acting gigs ("The Astronaut's Wife" or "Mighty Joe Young," anyone?), remains one of the most underrated young female actors out there. And yes, as much as I almost hate to admit it, I wanted to see this couple work out, even though I knew where the movie was heading.And where, pray tell, was it heading? As anyone who's seen the ad campaign knows, Theron is sick. Deathly sick. Movie sick. You know the kind I mean: pale, sweaty, circles under the eyes, crying, too weak to walk one minute, yet strong enough to sprint down the street the next wearing nothing but a camisole and a pair of boots. We see this progress throughout the film, first manifesting itself at a dinner party hosted by her gay friend Chas (Jason Isaacs, in a truly thankless role). As her illness worsens, we begin to understand her rationale for the "one man a month" sweepstakes: she wants to make the most of the time she has left by helping people. And again, I restate the fact that I wanted very much to like a movie that has as its central tenet, It's Important and Virtuous To Help Others.But, in the end, what we have here is a movie that's just plain silly. The crowning moment comes in the first of the two big set pieces, when Nelson climbs through the window of Sara's upstairs apartment at Thanksgiving dinner, wearing a Santa Claus hat and toting a big bag of presents, all for Sara, and all based on things that have Major Significance in their relationship: dance lessons, trolley tokens, the previously mentioned dishwasher, and -- no kidding -- a bullwhip, to name but four. And then, the penultimate gift, Nelson in a white tuxedo, crooning a love song to Sara as she looks on adoringly. At which point I began praying for the quiet dignity of Reeves' performance in "Johnny Mnemonic."It's all in here: Nelson's touching relationship with a neighborhood boy, his big league epiphany when he turns down a lucrative job offer with a prestigious ad firm, Reeves and Theron in the bathtub, Isaacs in a mint-green sequined dress. The everything and the kitchen sink approach isn't the movie's sole undoing (there is, of course, the utter unbelievability of the main concept to deal with), but it didn't help. By the end, with Reeves reaching out into nothingness, the lump in my throat was only due to the fact that I couldn't possibly swallow any more of what the film wanted me to eat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Betraying a deep-seated disrespect for its audience and all the emotional authenticity of a cat food commercial, Sweet November is the kind of movie which piles up cliché after cliché in an obvious attempt to please people craving for a facile feel-good romantic comedy.- Young, beautiful, rich people falling in love and fooling around all day? Check.- He is a pompous jerk, she is a fun-loving gal who teaches him apparently-simple-but-really-quite-deep life lessons? Check.- Cute dog? Check.- Cute kid? Check.- Gay confidante? Check.- Romantic dusk? Check.- Romantic dawn? Check.- Cheap plot twist involving a deadly illness (Charlize Theron is supposed to look like a terminal cancer patient because, in the last act, she starts to cry a lot) in an ending which pretends to be bittersweet but only comes across as syrupy? Check.However, Keanu Reeves is the usual genius of unintentional comedy. There is something hilarious about his performance - he has the mechanic, artificial body language of a puppet, even the way he moves his eyelids and mouth. Also funny is the way he talks: words come out in a staccato pattern which gives the impression of someone periodically pulling a string behind his back.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about the unlikely romance between a career oriented man and an unconventionally carefree girl.I guess the characters are developed outstandingly, because I absolutely hated Sara Deever right from the beginning. I find myself criticising her all the time, arguing back at every line she says. She is so annoying. I think Charlize Theron is a miscast because she has this angelic and noble quality which is the complete opposite of what her character is. Nelson, on the other hand, is slightly more convincing, but I still have trouble in believing that he would react to Sara the stalker so positively. If I were Nelson, I would have called the police right from the beginning. The plot is so cliché and predictable. I mean, the girl even have her gay best friend? Can a film be less original than that? This movie is not enjoyable, for guys anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster romantic tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This lackluster romantic tragedy is a weak treatment of a threadbare storyline, further diminished by spotty acting. The story is shamelessly familiar. Boy falls in love with girl whom he learns is dying, and he becomes transformed by his love for her as she wastes away. Kleenex stock rises.Anyone who saw `Autumn In New York' with Winona Ryder and Richard Gere, released earlier the same year, probably had an overwhelming sense of déj? vu watching this film, right down to the season. This film could very well have been titled `Autumn in San Francisco'. It was basically the same film with different topography and local color. However, while the first was well acted with sensitive and insightful character development, this is just a schmaltzy bouillabaisse of sappiness that is spread broadly but thinly.Keanu Reeves, who should have been perfect for the part, wasn't. In the beginning of the film, he plays a high powered advertising executive with a presentation that is so forced it can only be described as robotic. Once he wades back into more familiar waters and settles into the romantic role, he seems to be more comfortable and natural, but he still presents a character that is far to stoic to be endearing. In contrast, Charlize Theron gives a charming and emotionally compelling performance and single-handedly keeps the film from foundering. Theron gives her character great range and endows her with a kookiness that belies her depth. Unfortunately, Reeves is so inert in this film that the romantic chemistry between them is as exciting as last night's dishwater.Director Pat O'Connor (`Inventing the Abbots') did what he could to enliven the film with some nice location shots around San Francisco and some well assembled romantic montages (that might have crossed the line into the overkill zone). However, his handling of Reeves was poorly done. I have seen Reeves give numerous performances that were far better than this. When an accomplished actor comes off this uninspired, I put the blame squarely at the feet of the director. Also, I feel that the character development was sorely lacking, with O'Connor content to present superficial skits rather than delve into anyone's psyche.Though not awful, this film requires a strong cup of coffee or an incredibly sentimental viewer. I rated it a 5/10. Anyone who liked Keanu Reeves in films like `The Matrix' and `Speed' should prepare to deduct a point or two. Worth a try for romance junkies.</fullReview>

Keanu Reeves plays a recently-fired advertising executive who moves in with quirky Charlize Theron, a free spirit who takes one lover a month. In truth, the original film (which starred Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley) relied more on the actors' personalities than on credibility or logic; revamped and updated, that lack of believability makes the whole enterprise look like a house of cards.

The kid is obviously an easy victim for pedophiles. hahah...Anyway, this is one of my top five worst movies of all time. She had WAY too many drugs in that cabinet. No matter what kind of illness you'd never have 50+ prescription bottles! Also, the santa scene - he carried a DISHWASHER in a BAG up multiple floors.Absolutely ridiculous...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew that movie but I hadn't seen it until my friend suggested me to watch it. It effected her. The topic may be very common but I agree with her, it effects the watcher. For me, especially the decision they agreed at the end of the movie is very effective and teaches everybody to take consider into value of life. We mustn't waste time for any reason. Yes, we have to work, even we can turn into a machine, doing all routine. But why we are working, just for earning money for what? Better life, health, success, ego,... But time is passing!!! Watch it, LEARN SOME before u r late. If you have already known it, it means u r one of the luckiest... ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god... Keanu Reeves can't act. It's really horrible to see. I've never seen him in a non-action movie before now, and it's really bad. I'm watching "Sweet November" for the first time on TBS. Wait, I've actually seen this before and forgot about it. I only forget movies when they are unremarkable. But seriously, Keanu's acting... Oh my god... I remember really bad movies. Why the hell did I forget about this one? Wanna know the all time worst movie of all time? The Faculty, with Elijah Wood. I won't forget "Sweet November" again either.Charlize Theron is extremely attractive as always (probably the only good thing about the film) and fairly well acted. The general logic of action is completely, well, illogical and the dialog is corny as hell. I think I'm just watching for Charlize! But also... Ya know when there's an accident or train wreck, and you can't help but look? It's like that. I can't help but continue watching...The acting of many actors is just unnatural in general. Emotions and feelings are communicated verbally, rather than through body language, and it seems so fake and unrehearsed! Did they shoot this thing in a week or something? There are too many characters, not enough depth or development for any of them, way too many events, and the pace is just too fast for a drama. And Enya singing on the soundtrack? Nice touch of the dramatic, but it seems out of place on this film. The slow music just clashes with the fast story. This director tried to squeeze way too much into a small duration of time and did a horrible job instructing the actors! It's kinda sad to see professional actors doing work that is just so below their abilities. The flow and progression of events is disconnected and haphazard. And then Keanu singing? They really should have done a voice over...OK, I didn't plan to write a review for this movie, but it was just so bad, that I had to complain in some way. I couldn't help but notice that the director of this movie, Pat O'Connor, has not had a directing job since this movie, and that he used to direct TV. Coincidence that he hasn't made a movie or worked since? Yeah, that's a tough call...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story really sucks. Had it all figured out after just 5 minutes. This IS in fact the sorriest movie I've seen to date and Sarah is probably the meanest b*tch on this earth. Keanu? - why didn't you just leave after the first night with her. Any decent guy with just a little bit of self respect would have done that. Wanna see Keanu perform? Go watch Speed or something. I hope this sorry movie will continue to be the worst I've seen. If I ever experience a movie similar to this I promise I will start watching Indian made movies over American. I mean it. Don't watch it and in case you do. When you feel the urge to press STOP on your remote - after 5 - 10 minutes. Do.. I didn't. And I'm sorry! - If you can find "The Wraith" - watch that instead.

		<shortDescription>A Bitter Pill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could have forgiven a lot about this film. I always try to respect a movie's genre. This was a romantic comedy/fantasy so I wasn't expecting Kramer vs. Kramer. I could accept the melodramatic premise (beautiful dying girl falls in love with/tries to "save" handsome self-involved young man from himself) but most of the movie just didn't sit well with me. When trying to gather my overall impression, my mind can't help but "bring up" the scene where Sara is vomiting on the floor of her bedroom.I really don't think I was asking for much. Instead, I think the movie demanded too much. Suspending my disbelief was a fair requirement. I actually consider it part of the fun. However all the fun began to vanish when the movie decided to take itself more seriously than it had the right to. At this point, its demands became disturbing and somewhat devious.(As noted by other reviewers) The movie shamelessly plugged every cliché ever recorded on celluloid: rain-soaked confrontations, public declarations, cute animals, needy children, convenient diseases, gay/minority best friends with a heart of gold - but no real life of their own, and BAD SINGING! Yet the movie still felt that it could (and SHOULD) present itself as a somber tribute to the pain of life and love. The repeated and ridiculously heavy-handed diatribes about Sara's trying to, "control her uncontrollable circumstances" and, "die with dignity" seemed as if they were beamed in to give all the preceding romantic fluffiness weight. I have no problem with those arguments, but they belonged in another movie and appeared extremely contrived. Dying young is perhaps the ultimate example of life's unfairness, but to try to make a movie that is both eye candy and reality tale is almost as unfair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't have much to say that hasn't already been said. I will only take a moment to mention that people who like this film must fall into one of a select number of categories: - never seen a "romantic comedy" before this one. - is incurably sappy and thus willing to overlook the cliches that define this "movie." - enjoys it on a meta-level; out of some categorization interest or (alternatively) its satirical nature.I'm not a big "romantic comedy" person, but I feel confident in saying that if you're moved by this movie, you'll be moved by ANYTHING. Sleepless in Seattle this isn't. It isn't even Jerry Maguire.Pause this film at any of the 'plot points' and you can easily and accurately predict what will come next (I first noticed this when SPOILER Keanu got fired. I thought "now his girlfriend will dump him." and voila! she did END SPOILER).On top of that, this film relies on contrivance. Tell me, if you were Keanu's character in this movie, wouldn't you have called the cops at some point? I know if I were a high powered, well-to-do businessperson with the kind of drive that they (vaguely) assign the character, any person who does what Charlie's character does would arouse suspicion (and a call to the cops for stalking, felonious theft, or any of a miriad of other things).Those of you with common sense... avoid this movie unless you're looking for another reason to get depressed at our national gullibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying but the acting is well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waiting for the earlier showing of SWEET NOVEMBER to end, many people walked out of the theater washing away the tears from their eyes and big smiles on their faces. Nevertheless, my girlfriend and I walked in preparing for a tremendous tear jerking movie. After all, there was not really anything special about the movie except that it solely was driven by acting. It also had mixed to terrible reviews. SWEET NOVEMBER was sweet for my girlfriend and did leave many people with tears while their friends laughed at them. But SWEET NOVEMBER was a bit more sillier upon a second glance.Reeves plays Nelson, an intense, sometimes obsessed worker who one day takes his driving test. Asking for help, he apparently gets Sara disqualified once she responds that "She is not there yet." Sara although unhappy, catches up to Nelson and offers him to spend a month with her at her home to fix up his obsessed working ways and look for a bit of joy in his tough characters. After his girlfriend leaves and he is now newly fired, Nelson reluctantly takes up the offer for one day. And gets all the sex that every man dreams about.SWEET NOVEMBER seems a little bit too strange sometimes. Nothing was more surprising than seeing Sara's male friend's little get together. Also seeing Sara turn from a hippie-like confident yet bumbling woman into a whining miserable upset mess was also a little weird. Kind of strange considering every girl in the theater seemed to identify with her (does that include all the sex and all the pills?) The acting stood out strong though this mess of a movie thankfully. My guess is because both main actors seemed to play characters closely resembling their former ones in THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. One pleasant moment was seeing the interaction between the young Abner and Nelson who played out a quick and too short father-son relationship in the movie. As a matter of fact, the earlier jerk version of Nelson was by far the most appealing character in the movie since he was more realistic than all the other characters. An ending that was too obvious for anyone to want to believe, SWEET NOVEMBER had a sour taste with it throughout the moment Nelson woke up in Sara's apartment the first day. Something I would have rather enjoyed cuddling up to with my angel at home on a boring day.</fullReview>

Overworked, cell phone junkie, ad exec meets free spirited, animal loving girl who promises she can change his life. Sounds okay, right? Oh, if only that were it.Here's what the trailer didn't tell you. She's dying. Of a treatable disease (come on, we all watched Party of Five). Why? Because she's so much of a free spirit that she'd rather "enjoy the time she has." It's no wonder ad boy Keanu never saw it coming. Just days earlier Charlize was doing cartwheels on the beach. All of a sudden, she's got a medicine cabinet to rival any hospital's.I like romantic movies. But nothing could make me sit through this one again. It's only slightly not as bad as Autumn in New York...if that tells you anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know, it's sappy and all that. I watched it on Valentinesday and if I could rewind time and do it all over again.. I'd rather cut my cats claws with my teeth. With Mr.Stoneface not faced by anything and the obnoxious bohemian chick is never a match made i heaven.Let me list the things that are just so unbelievable in this movie and what really would have happened. ¤ At the DMV, Sara coming in with her bags spilling stuff all over the floor: result: She would be asked to leave. ¤ Nelson asking her for the answer to no 9. result: She would not answer him, instead she would focus on her own test. ¤ Sara get called to the desk and they rip up her paper. result: She points a finger at Nelson saying HE CHEATED! Possably telling the entire class the answer to no. 9, giving the desk-guy the finger and then walk out. ¤ Sara sitting on Nelsons car. result: He'd have hissyfit and tell her to get off it. ¤ Nelson offering Sara a month pay. result: She'd take it! ¤ Sara showing up at his house. result: He'd call the police. (before or after talking to her) ¤ Sara asking him for a ride. result: He would give her cab money. ¤ Sara breaking in stealing dogs. result: He'd call the police.¤ Sara inviting him up/threatening him to come back. result: He'd tell her to f-off and drive away. (and possibly have to call the police the next morning) ¤ Sara asking him to move in. result: He'd tell her to f-off and drive away. ¤ Sara sending him a dog and a key. result: He sends the dog back (possibly alive) and call the cops.Now even if all this STILL would lead up to him ending up at her place for a night of sex... ¤ Sara giving away his clothes. result: He slaps her across the face and leave. ¤ Sara trying to introduce him to everyone on the block. result: "Sara, I just don't give at sh*t." ¤ Nelson leaving Saras place and going home, and get bored. result: He would download porn, watch some and go to sleep.Now, if all of these things still would result in him returning to her to live... ¤ Living together... result: No one have a job = no one pay rent.. And besides from sex, what do they have in common?? ¤ Sara telling him about all the guys she had. result: He'd leave. Make a doctors appointment and check for STDs. ¤ Sara taking him to the boat-race. result: He'd be on the phone. ¤ He pay the guy to help out, and having Sara telling him it was wrong. result: "Fine, you stuck up b*itch. Is there anything I do that is 'good enough' for you? Who died and made you queen of everything?" ¤ Sara being selfrightious about everything. result: He'd pack up and leave. ¤ Abner telling him to come to fathers day while Sara is just released from the hospital. result: He'd tell the kid to ask his mum who his real daddy is and go bother him. ¤ Nelson getting an interview with the Price. result: Price-less! He would never turn it down!When Sara finally tell him about the illness, he would pay the hospital bills out of guilt and when she tells him to leave he would. There is no chance in hell that these two people would have a future together even if she wasn't sick. They have nothing in common and the fact that he give up his life to marry her is just not possible. I feel sorry for Angelica wasting her time on him, and for his pet goldfish that no one fed for a month and died wondering what he did wrong.. in his aquarium with one lousy plant and no sand.This is by far one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. It get two stars because of the soundtrack and ... There was a cute pet in it. The rest just plain sucks.</fullReview>

Believe me, if you are in that situation, there are other things you have in mind then stalking behind arrogant business men, trying to lead them to be a "better", more enjoying person and, by the way, having sex with them. Everybody who lost a close person due to an illness eg, will probably agree. And even more unrealistic, the person dying wants to be alone in her final days or weeks, she wants to be remembered "smiling and beautiful". Even if this is a thought i kind of sympathize with, all i know is that when it comes to the last month and weeks, you are happy and thankful for every close person beeing by at your side! This is why i cannot declare this as a "just romantic" movie. It tries to touch a very serious situation and in my opinion totally fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the original 1968 version of "Sweet November", but I have a hunch it was better than this. It had to be. The 2001 update starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron is downright awful! It is about a woman who invites a new man to live with her every month and introduces them to a radical new style of living (don't worry, it's not too radical that mainstream audiences won't find it 'cute'). All of a sudden, one November she welcomes in Keanu and, surprise, she falls in love with him and doesn't want to let him go! Now a twist in the story develops but you probably already know if from the television trailers that made it a point to advertise only the end of the film.Even if you find the set-up interesting, it's hard to find the execution of it all more than contrived. The performances are less than convincing and Charlize doesn't exactly sizzle with Reeves. Definitely one of the more forgettable films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie in along time but I do remember most of it.The film stars Keanu Reeves who meets a young woman named Sara(played by Charlize Theron) who is working on a project about men where she would date them and then break up with them. So Sara ends up falling for Nelson(Reeves)and they live together all through the month of November. But Sara of course is hiding a terrible secret....and like in almost every Nicholas Sparks movies(seriously this film should have been created by him)as get this Sara is dying of cancer and that is why she breaks up with men as Keanu's charcther spots her taking pills and he had no idea that she was dying of cancer. So will Nelson help Sara with her illness.Bottom line like I have said I haven't seen this movie in years and I just thought I write a short review on it. I always like Keanu Reeves since Speed so it was nice to see him star in a tearjerker like this. Whenever its on TV again I will check it out if its on a early time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sweet November (2001): Dir: Pat O'Connor / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron, Jason Isaacs, Liam Aiken, Lauren Graham: Dreary depressing pill romance about that faithful day in November when workaholic Keanu Reeves is forced to live with Charlize Theron for an entire month so that she may change his outlook on life. Soon her illness surfaces leading to a depraved ending. Directed by Pat O'Connor who also made the miserable Inventing the Abbotts. Who did he wrong in order to be stuck with those two awful titles on his resume? The ending is totally predictable so feel free to beat yourself over the head with a bag of rocks. The film also asks an age old question. What is Theron attempting here anyway? She could lug in Jack the Ripper for all she knows. Why doesn't she do a crossword puzzle on the back of a cereal box instead. She plays the biggest stupidest idiot of any romantic film while Reeves plays a complete moron who will predictably come to love this woman rather than pass time by firing darts at pictures of her. Jason Isaacs plays Theron's cross-dressing friend who is there for support. One might say she would need it after starring in trash such as this. This becomes an example as to why males often hate going to date movies because junk like this reduces one's intelligence. Great locations cannot save this pathetic and manipulative snot rag story.

		<shortDescription>The filthiest love-story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood with some special perverted love savors the snotty and tearful melodramatic plots, where the suffering an incurable illness hero/heroine is given the place of honor for. Directors in the different ways, with the most compassionate and touching paints present us the sufferings and uncontrollable regrets of fateful luckless persons, spice a plot with romanticism of all shades of pink, for more tragedy. We sincerely empathize and sympathize with their disasters, we rejoice and inspired with their will to live and we condemn, when they enervated obey the fate, reveling in their misery.But the heroine of «Sweet November» - an extraordinary and eccentric personality. Cultivation the victim of fate's injustice in herself ? is not her inheritance. She invented her original way to paint with all the colors of the rainbow her remaining days. Sara Deever ? is a daffy, wild young woman, prone to every kind of eccentricities. Beautiful, young, kind and energetic. But, alas, Sara has an incurable disease, and her days are inexorably beginning to wane. So why not to arrange the dying fairy show for herself? And Sara decides to have some fun in the end. She chooses fancy males virtually from the crowd, swoops on them, like a shattering tornado, knocks the poor guys down with one kick of her charm and sudden onslaught, after that she takes root into their life with imperturbable and pushy impudence, overturning upside down the usual orders and already existing vital ways. Sara sees exceptionally noble altruism and sincerely desire to fill a life of her next chosen with new, true significance in her action. Having tightly locked a door in the habitual life, Sara's chosen gets her as a kind of a gift. The deal is valid for a month. After the lapse of which brazen altruist Sara coolly turns her confused and love with her boyfriend out of the door, because the next candidate who dreams to quit his adjusted life for the sake of shady and ambiguous adventure, looms over the threshold. Such fate was prepared also to Nelson Moss, the character of Keanu Reeves. Nelson - the young and ambitious careerist living only by work. Discouraged by Sara's so gusty and extravagant impudence, Nelson all the forces resists to her invasion into his adjusted and vigorous life. Her delusional conditions, doubtful and alluring promises are not laid into the head of a pragmatic and self-assured young man by no means. Gradually, still continuing to go reflexively obstinate, Nelson does not notice as falls in love with this foolish, but such charming eccentric woman. Sara's plan, well developed by months, fails: Nelson casually discovers her illness. The tragic and romantic ending approaches. Sara can hypocrite to herself and others as much as necessary long, sincerely considering, that her lifestyle is a saving mission. Justifying her brazen interference in life of other people with desire to open them eyes on all its delights, to teach to enjoy all its displays, having removed from monotony and idleness routine, Sara, like a complete egoist, simply treacherously breaks in others lives, destroying the colorless and steady rhythm. Having been satiated properly with the next boyfriend, irrevocably making the poor guy to love yourself, she ruthlessly throws him out as the used discarded material. And she wanted to spit on the following sufferings and distress of her guinea-pigs. According to Sara, disease provides her with undeniable advantage, that gives her the right to play with human feelings and lives, to using any opportunities and circumstances to catch convulsively up for the missed pleasures of life.The nasty story. Even the considerable quantity of various romantic "pieces" and casting of my favorite Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron couldn't sweeten the sickening sediment. That's a distorted understanding of love and romance.</fullReview>

Charlize Theron is incredibly beautiful woman and startling actress, just to look at her it's already great delectation. "Sweet September" is prettily story about love, about life and cost of its every moment. Someone will think this film too sad, someone too sweet, but for me it's very life-asserting and inspiring story after which you just ready to fall in love to any stranger on the street and it's inexpressible feeling. I have seen a lot of similar films, such as "Autumn in New York", "Griffin &amp; Phoenix", "The Notebook" and others, but in my opinion "Sweet September" is the best.

Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron shared a wonderful on screen chemistry in this Dramatic Love story and the ending was a totally unexpected one. It was like a candy-floss love story but i am quite surprised by the ending and i am still sleepless thinking about it. Such an impact it creates in its viewers which proves to be a success for the director. I can't believe this movie released 71/2 years before and how i missed it.

Otherwise, it's a pretty bad, rather clichéd sort of a film. I like Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves but this isn't really their shining moment in film. It's a bit of a soap opera. It has some other good actors in it, like Greg Germann and the gal from Gilmore Girls but they're pretty much wasted. If you like romantic soapy movies it's probably worth renting but otherwise I wouldn't bother. It IS interesting to see Reeves in something other than an action film. And Theron shows her talent; she's definitely more than a pretty face, as "Monster" proved. Anyway, give it a shot only if you like this type of film, otherwise, don't bother.</fullReview>

He neglects his lovely girlfriend, Angelica (Lauren Graham) and has few other close friends and no hobbies but more work, work, and more work. One day, he is forced to leave the office and go to the DMV to renew his license. It is there that he meets the beautiful, bohemian Sarah (Charlize Theron). Unhappily for Sarah, however, Nelson causes her to lose her license for 30 days, due to his own selfish actions. She is miffed and "follows him home" to demand that he taxi her around for awhile. Although he is very upset about the situation, there is nothing for him to do but adhere to Sarah's wishes. Sarah is an astute student of human nature, to say the least, and she sees at once that his life is totally out of balance. Therefore, she proposes that Nelson move in with her "for a month" and she will help him make time to smell the roses. Nelson is horrified, at first, for he likes his life just fine. But, after he is suddenly fired from his job and his girlfriend, too, says adios, he reaches out to Sarah for help. Can this very pretty, unusual lady help Nelson? More importantly, does she have a secret agenda as well? This is a lovely film for those who adore tales of romance and drama. Reeves, one of the most beautiful people on the planet, gives a touching performance in his own, quiet way. Theron, also an attractive performer, lifts the soul as the free-spirited, great-hearted Sarah. Frank Langella appears briefly but admirably as a loathsome businessman. The rest of the cast, although not well known, performs well, too. With a setting in San Francisco, the scenery is most lovely while the costumes, including Sarah's quirky clothes, are lively and fun. Production values, too, are of the finest. As for the script, it is polished and virtually guaranteed to give one big lumps in the throat. Do you long for tales of undying love, with plentiful doses of warmth and weeping? You should get this one now, even if November is months away from today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caught me by surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was on TV last night and it took me off guard. It's a brilliant roller-coaster of emotions. It made me think about life in a different way.Charlize Theron, although not the main character, steals the show. Her talent is prevalent but this makes Reeve's acting look even blander than usual. He is clearly out-classed as a thespian. They do look incredibly good together though and share an extraordinary on-screen chemistry. They haven't aged a bit since Devil's Advocate.This movie will leave you thinking about what really matters in life. You will cry but you will also laugh a lot. Everything that makes a film worth watching! Rent this movie if you're together with your partner or on a date. Don't rent it if you're in the mood for a comedy.</fullReview>

This movie was just great, It touched me,ha ha.Sweet November It was very sad for Keane that he was left alone, at that moment I was Thinking 'You can't do that to people, Horrible'. It was a great movie, have fun everyone seeing it. Sweet November had also a sad song in it, en ya - only time, you should listen to that song. Well I have to go now. Bye and everyone should see that movie. bye, I don't know what to say anymore. you know another movie is also great, like, The Da Vinci Code.

		<fullReview>This is a very sweet Romantic/Comedy, that I quite enjoyed, with top notch performances and a really charming story!. All the characters are cool, and extremely likable, and I found the 2nd half to be great and very emotional, plus Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are simply amazing in this!. I have not seen the original, but I must say I really liked this one, and it may take a while for you to warm up To Reeves's character Nelson because he's an arrogant jackass at 1st, plus he and Charlize had fantastic chemistry together!. I thought the ending was very well done, even though I wished it didn't end that way, and I feel this should be higher then 5.5, plus it's very well made and written as well!. It really took a sudden turn in the second half, but that's OK because I still enjoyed it and you will find Charlize to be utterly irresistible in this! plus I loved the music score as well, and found it to be very beautiful. The character development is pretty good, and you will feel for the 2 leads, plus I loved Keanu's Santa thing he did in the 2nd half. This is a very sweet romantic/Comedy,that I quite enjoyed, with top notch performances, and a really charming story, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Pat O'Connor does a great! job here with good camera work, and keeping the film at a fast pace. The Acting is top notch!. Keanu Reeves is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is jackass in the 1st half, but really turns out to be a likable guy once he falls in love with Sara, he also had fantastic chemistry with Charlize, brought charisma, and is a surprisingly good singer! (Reeves Rules!!!!!!!). Charlize Theron is also amazing as always, she is incredibly gorgeous, wonderfully perky, had a brilliant character, was perfectly charming, full of life, and was just amazing overall I loved her! (Charlize Rules!!!!). Jason Isaacs is funny as Chaz, he had a weird character but was likable and caring, I dug him!. Frank Langella is good as the ass I liked him. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

A girl which is seriously ill falls in love with a guy but she doesn't want their story to last because of her condition, blablablabla.... So sad! Poor girl.What to say about Keanu Reeves, the man without expression... and Miss Theron, well, she's a very beautiful woman. Hehehe... I don't know what else to say about this s**t! I think it is quite advisable for those devotes of the romantic genre (or those who love Keanu). Why did I watch it? It is so embarrassing... my girl made me watch it!

I think that is was a very nice thing for Sara to do those things for Nelson, even though, yes i do know it is only a movie, but i just like the story to it, except i didn't like the ending, I mean what happens to Nelson after he leaves? What happens to Sara? What happens to Abner? Oh and by the way i thought Lliam Aiken did a phenomenal job in this movie, he was so adorable as a 10-year-old and such a great actor!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like a lot of people didn't like this movie very much. I, on the other hand, absolutely adored it. I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan, so that didn't hurt. Some of the concepts in the movie may be unbelievable, but I think it is romantic, sweet and very sad. See this movie if you like romance, but with sadness added in. The only thing I didn't understand was why she didn't want to get treatment for her Lymphoma. My mother had that type of cancer and it was very treatable. My mother was in Stage IV of the disease, too and that's the final stage. Oh well, it still is a great movie! Break out your Kleenexes and get ready to sob the night away! On the Slick scale of 1-5, I'll give this move 3 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. Why? Because it has a message that you only get to live once so make your time worthwhile. The ending disappointed me too because I wanted Sara and Nelson to be together, but I understand why Sara left. She wanted Nelson to remember only the good times they had together. I mean, who wants to remember bad times? I don't.Sara also told Nelson that he is her immortality. That if Nelson can remember Sara as strong and full of life, then she knows she can face anything. I think that was the sweetest part of the movie.This movie may not have an original plot but the actors were great, specially Charlize, which makes it interesting and something that really gets to you. If you don't like it because of all the unrealism, then maybe you should find someone like Sara. Life ain't perfect, but it's good. 8/10</fullReview>

It was a simple story but the two stars made it memorable. It is one of my favorite movies. As for Keanu Reeves, it made me a big fan of his. Now, I look to see what movies he is appearing in. He has star quality and is one of the best around today. I have never heard him being interviewed or seen him on Actors Studio. I would like to know more about him. As for Charlene, she is beautiful and delightful to watch. I have seen Sweet November years ago, with Sandra Dennis, but didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did with Keanu playing the part.Also enjoyed Charlene much more in the role then I did Sandra Dennis. The actor sure makes the difference in the story. I hope to see Keanu Reeves in a lot more films.</fullReview>

I was really impressed at charlize theron's performance and i only say that because she i a great actress and one of the most beautiful people ever and i also like this movie more than the movie (the devils advocate) which stared that same two people charlize theron and keano reevs. Now I'm not really into these kinda movies but this one is just terrific and i cant see why it got the rating it did. I did feel that the ending was a slightly too sad.I thought that he should have gotten to marry her because he showed his love and all his emotion to her and she said "no." Now i also say that she had a good reason to say no, because she wanted him to remember her the away he loved her. so i just wanted to say that this movie is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time, and that charlize theron is extremely hot (except in monster which they did an awesome job turning her into that kinda person)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Other months are a cinch but November is lovingly clingy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sweet-bitter and myth-truth story could only happen in AIDS-free, civilized, humane and understanding societies where people trust, love and care about one another, or the human relationship is less complicated, or in smaller towns. Apologies, Hong Kong is 100% out of the question. If a woman approaches a Hong Kong guy asking him to live together for a month, without listening to her completely, the 'accosted' will surely suspect that she is a con-man and police siren will ring. Sara's abrasive style has shaken up Nelson's normally pressing but staid living. I guess most people living in big cities would take the same act. To a certain extent, San Francisco is not a convincing candidate, the city is too big. The potential locale is a sparsely populated small city in southern Europe: France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece etc. Yet, seeing that it takes place within the confines of the SF, audience should give their nods.It is clever to disclose the truth of Sara's illness much later, otherwise it would turn out to be a stale story. Hurry and haste she is in as she is counting down her days. That particular November is both sweet and bitter to Sara and Nelson when the secret and her weird behaviour are demystified. Sara's goodbye, on the surface is of kind intention however it is the cruelest because though Nelson continues his life with much more humanity, he will never forget her and also the subsequent pain. In actuality the ending is quite a symbolic one to Reeves himself, not the screen character Nelson. In Reeves' true life, he is ringed by deaths: a stillborn girl, ex-girlfriend killed in a traffic accident, leukemia-afflicted sister Kim is suffering a relapse. Thank God in the movie, Sara's death-bed episode has been so kindly skipped. It is not easy to bear the sight of a dying girlfriend or sister, it is atrocity.A lovely small film on living life, on unexpected and uncontrollable love of two strangers, just Theron overacts a little at times. The sequined outfits of Jason Isaacs and his screen partner are just gorgeously tailored, ah, I want one too. About the music score, Enya's song is too European, what a mismatch to the carefree Californian city and Sara's carefree spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was so incredibly sad, but so beautiful all at the same time. I have never been to a more romantic movie, or cried so hard at a fictional story. I think everyone should see this movie. I know I called the movie sad, but its not depressing. It's so lovely, and so romantic, that the sadness just adds to the movie, instead of taking away from it. I really loved it. Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron have such great on screen chemistry, and it shows through. Even without the touching storyline, this movie is artistically fantastic. Watching this movie, I felt like I was a part of it. It was this wonderful sadness. It was inexplicably sad, but the love between the characters showed through, making the sadness seem somehow worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of listing all the flaws and errors in this movie, let me just say that nothing about it makes any sense. The only reason to see it would be because Charlize Theron is in it, but on the other hand you get to see a lot more of that little goddess in "The Devil's Advocate" (if you catch my drift;-) So go see that one instead or, if you're in to the whole gooey sentimental stuff that is "Sweet November", try a quality alternative like "Jerry Maguire". Sweet November is a 2/10, at best.Herr Richelieu (who's not very fond of the whole 10 lines minimum commenting rule btw).</fullReview>

Not the type of character that Keanu would traditionally play but let me tell you, he did a remarkable job! Charlize was once again a total hit in this movie, what a talented actress! Charlize's character was so full of life, so bubbly and fun-loving. Sarah (Charlize) had such a zest for life that you couldn't help but smile. I would recommend this amazing movie to anybody with a soft spot for romance! If I were to compare this movie to another movie of the likes I would say its very similar to A walk to remember, but I couldn't pick one over the other, I give them both a 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sweet November was on TV tonight, so I, having not seen it yet decided to check it out.First off, let me say that it's not a horrible movie. it's actually in some aspects quite good. but others.. it's a bit disjointed, the ending was less than good, etc.Alright, cancer? it just doesn't "work" that well for this movie in my opinion. it would have been a more convincing storyline to have [Sarah] as the drug addict (it would better explain her unusual ardent behaviour patterns) and the ending, even though some might think me to be "a horrible person" for saying this, but she SHOULD have jumped off that ledge when she said goodbye to [Nelson]. she did, after all, tell him that "she was going home". it would have been a (though aberrant, and "tragic", I suppose) 'suitable ending' to such a film.In all fairness, it was a pretty good movie. sweet, but nothing spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just talking to my friend recently, we were talking about romantic movies and she mention Sweet November. She thought it was "such a good movie" I just can't believe how fooled people are. I mean come on, how can people be moved by this non romantic contrived movie? How is this movie romantic? I mean there is no beautiful relationship here. To me, a romantic movie is about 2 people meeting on a somewhat normal level. It doesn't even have to be that normal, but a little more stable then a women stalking a man, having sex with him, and inviting him to live with her for a month. I am not all for those quick romances in movies where the characters fall in love within a few weeks, but I can handle some. The situation in this one was almost insulting to our intelligence though. Keanu Reeves although very nice to look at, doesn't give a great performance. In my opinion I found Charlize performance to be not up to par at all. Although she is beautiful, I don't find her performances very convincing(The Legend of Bagger Vance comes to mind) I just found her character in Sweet November very annoying to say the least. I can't stand female characters in movies that have a "cute" and witty comeback for everything. It just isn't realistic. Another thing that bothered me(and I am nitpicking here)are all those scenes where she was cutely eating while delivering her nauseating witty lines. This movie tried to manipulate us to tears but it didn't work for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just boring, but depressing too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manic advertising executive Keanu Reeves meets up with touchy-feely new age gal Charlize Theron under somewhat unlikely circumstances, and she insists on him spending a month with her (the November of the title) so that she can convince him of the benefits of the hippie lifestyle. Since his increasingly frantic behaviour has just caused him to lose his job, he agrees readily enough. Only later does he realize that she hides a deadly secret.Now I'm a huge fan of Charlize Theron, and will watch just about anything that she's in, but even I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this. Not only is the story totally unbelievable, but parts of the 'drama' are unintentionally funny, e.g. Reeves' disastrous hot-dog advertising campaign, and an awful pastiche of the model boat race that was done far better in "Stuart Little". Even worse, the 'romantic day out' for our young lovers reminded me of a similar sequence from "The Naked Gun".I was getting fidgety well before the tone of the film started to darken, and if I'd been more convinced by the characters I may have started blubbing, however as it was I found the film's relentless sentimentality merely annoying.Any film this heavy-handed and pretentious should at least leave you feeling inspired, but I just thought I'd been cheated out of 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light, Sound and Color Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are already sufficient comments about the plot, so no need to rehash. What I liked was the way they used light, color, and sound to enhance the story's effectiveness. Nelson's life pre-Sara is pristine, clinical, harsh. Lighting is neon greens, dark: his apartment, office, even the DMV. The shapes in his windowless apartment are a series of cubes, circles, squares and rectangles with those same harsh neon and dark shades, coming from only the computer and multiple TV screens. His brunette girlfriend is wearing black--her skin even appears gray. His company car is gray, and the nondescript people around him wear dark shades of gray, black, and tan. Even the hot dog seems out of place, because it, along with its subsequent advertising plug by Nelson, simply connotes the harsh realities of death, carnality and inability to control animal lust and anger. This symbolic brusqueness and harshness of modern life probably worked better during the hippie movement of the late 60s, when the first version of the movie came out; however, it works moderately well in this 21st-century setting.The first hint of color and life come to Nelson when bohemian, blond-haired Sara comes into the bleak DMV, wearing vibrant shades of orange and green, carrying (of all things) symbolic "sustenance" in the form of an overflowing bag of groceries. Notice the subtle change in the scene with Sara on Nelson's car: they are standing underneath a huge orange billboard which reads "Choose Your Mate." Then when Nelson has to choose, his link to Sara (and, thus, life) comes in the form of Ernie, the cuddly dog wearing an adorable clown hat and carrying a "key." Cute, but hardly subtle! Life begins for Nelson anew: Sara's apartment, though hardly pristine, is awash in color and in abundance--of foods, of fabrics, of scents (the hazelnut coffee, spilled pumpkin, apples, even dog "pee") of her vibrancy--of Sara herself. Nelson accepts into his life all the things he's refused thus far--happy, sloppy fun, animals, even a child (in the form of Abner). The message is clear: life is messy, but it is to be lived. Anya's beautiful, ethereal "Only Time" is part of the story now. So is Nelson's singing, his gift to Sara. Water is no longer part of a clinical routine, i.e. Nelson's ritual a.m. shower--now there is rain to cleanse, to languidly lounge in together, to run on the beach, for Abner to win his race.***SPOILER WARNING***The only moments of darkness coming back into Nelson's life are when he goes to see the drab, cold, gray-suited "God," when they are in the (neon-lit and blue-toned) hospital room, and when (in an ironic twist) he goes back to tell Sara of his choice: she is wearing earth-tones with a gray scarf (evidence of, for one thing, her fear), and Nelson is now in the yellow cab carrying flowers of all color. He is home, and, no matter what else happens, he will never accept that bleakness again.***SPOILER WARNING*** So many wonderful symbols, phallic and otherwise, work together with these elements to make this story complete. At the end, even though he lingers momentarily in the darkness (walking across the symbolic white bridge of life and death--where now he cannot follow), he emerges into quietness. Yet he also emerges into life, into the plush, colorful scenery of San Francisco, linked to her forever by her scarf, her scent, the intimacy he shared with life-affirming Sarah. That life he now not only carries within himself, but is also able to share (evidenced by his "12 Gifts of Christmas" to Sara when she badly needs them). These are but a few of the many elements that work well in this very sweet story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a so-so remake of the 1968 Sandy Dennis vehicle and possibly more interesting...and that is not saying a whole lot. A romantic comedy about an eccentric(Charlize Theron)who coerces a busy advertising executive(Keanu Reeves)to move in with her so she can show him how to enjoy life more. The bathtub scene is cute. Nothing redeeming, but if you love Theron as I do, you will tolerate this whimsical pile of fluff. Reeves manages to be putty in her hands and still manage to keep his macho dignity. In support are Greg Germann, Jason Isaacs and Lauren Graham.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I read all 161 comments before I entered this. I have watched the movie three times. Initially, after the first two movies, my wife and I thought this movie was garbage (2.5 out of 10). Now, after watching it a third time and listening to your comments, I have revised my rating to a whopping 6 out of 10. I will not repeat much here but did anyone else notice that when Reeves drove up to Sara's digs in the Mercedes and turned the ignition off and doused the lights that one fog light remained lit -- very weird!Basically, I love Theron -- like someone else said, I would have a hard time saying no to any request she made but then again, I am not Nelson, the hard driven ad exec - come on, this movie is out in left field. Reeves is bad, but I thought he was not terrible - he did try hard. The plot was just too much Hollywood crap for me but I did like the originality, I loved sound track, and since I live near SF, I loved the location. The ending was made on MARS, I think. Anyways, all summed, that is why I gave it the 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sweet November is just another sappy "chick flick" romance. I happen to like that genre, but this one is just average. The situation is implausible, but aren't most movies? Keanu Reeves was very flat -some of the worst acting I have seen him do (not that is saying much). He should stay far away from romances and drama and stick to action/comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this was panned by the critics, I dont know why. They had to know what they were going to see, especially since its a remake. I happen to think its a pretty well made flick, for its genre. But for F sake, don't criticize the genre. People have paid to see this type of entertainment since Ancient Greece. Is Keanu a bad actor, I cant decide that. I've always sort of liked him, and always pull for him to put on a good show. Its his voice or accent I think, that crushes him. So saying, I suppose he puts in a typical Keanu effort here. The one thing that just never ever rings true is when a Charlize Theron comes on strong and the actor, Keanu, wants nothing to do with her. I dont care whats going on in his life, or who his girlfriend at the time might be, a fella would in the very least be, shall we say curious? Like many movies, this is a formula work. So you can go to the fridge and not miss anything. They are all the same. Its a question of execution, and this film did a pretty good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh brother. I can't say 'Don't watch this movie'. There are a couple of situations where this movie has a purpose. Background noise. Or there just, flat-out, isn't anything else to watch. In other words, I can think of many other movies that were worse than this one. And this is another of those that will help you more appreciate the good movies out there and hate some of the bad ones less.Direction: Okay with what they had to work with.Acting: Theron - good acting and cute. Reeves - Um, no. He was like a cardboard cut out. The superior laugh he emitted was annoying, and the romance was like Cmdr. Data on Star Trek: TNG trying to make it with Tasha Yar. Very little emotion. I know Charliz can light up the screen with love sparks and Reeves just didn't give her much to connect with.Story/plot: Story was the only reason I gave any points (1) for being different. The other two were for Charliz's on-screen hugability. The plot was just not relatable.Overall: 3/10 pts. thank you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keanu, what is wrong with you? Since "The Matrix", you've made nothing but garbage. First "The Watcher", this and "Hardball". While the point of the movie did make a little sense, the way it was carried out was poorly done. Do guys really jump out of bed and flip on 13 televisions while forgetting the name of the woman he just slept with? (the sad thing is, there are probably a few of them out there.) The whole gay friend thing didn't really work, Theron's acting was a little over eccentric to be realistic and e-gad, what a horrible dresser. I truly hope the second Matrix is a better movie for Keanu because if he makes any more stinkers like this, he'll be looking for a new line of work soon.</fullReview>

Later I found out I was wrong, revealing that she was sick towards the end made you change your perspective about things. Althoe she was not dressed up like in her other movies, there was something about her that pulled you into her character. The only part I was unhappy with was the Santa Claus part, it didnt go well with Keano Reaves. Other than that, it was an excellent movie.</fullReview>

It was yet another "beautiful girl trying to look gritty" type of pic..Cherlize Theron stars as a free spirited beatnik type who for no apparent reason dates and dumps a different guy every month. Somewhere along the way we find out she is stricken with cancer...(real original)..and straight from the the Acting 101 school she starts coughing and drinking water..as if that will make it all better. Keanu Reeves gives a wooden performance as a stuck ad exec...who the in the world would hire this guy? He is in sales and he couldn't sell matches to a pyromaniac. All of his lines are delivered in the same deadpan, non emotional, monotone he uses in all his movies..He and Kevin Costner could be in a movie and bore each other to death.anywhoo...Cherlize decides that he absolutely can't live without her so she has him move in with her.... We are then blessed with 40 minutes of fish out of water antics from robot actor Keanu. I have had more excitement clipping my toenails. The ending is so predictable I almost puked...save your money...and wait for it on HBO....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say up front I missed maybe the first fifteen minutes of the movie so take my opinion for what it's worth. I mention this because my wife assured me that knowing what happened in that time colors what follows. Somehow I still doubt it.The problem with the movie as I saw it was not so much the characters and their respective journies but the actors inhabiting the characters. Keanu Reeves gets a lot of flack for his thespian skills. I don't think that he's as incompetent as most people like to believe. His problem is that he only excels in movies where it is not a requirement for him to be interesting. Unfortunately the blandness of the this movie doesn't help him very much.Sweet November follows chick flick rule#1: Someone has to die. Women say that men only like movies that have a body count. What they fail to realize is that they do too. In guy movies, a whole lot of nameless people fall down dead as a result of the hero's actions and are quickly forgotten. In chick flicks we're supposed to cry as result of someone's death, most often someone close to the main character or one of the main characters themselves. I guess Sweet November has to be praised for giving us a terminal illness without showing us its ultimate conclusion. Nevertheless the sentiment is there. The movie's lovebirds are still separated as a result of said illness.The lesson I learned after seeing the much superior Bridget Jones' Diary is that genre cliches are less obvious in those movies that are more interested in being as smart and genuinely funny as it can without worrying about reaching the broadest possible audience. Any edges and tatters that might have made this film more interesting and identifiable have been neatly smoothed over, so much so that almost no scene is completely credible. Nowhere was this more apparent to me than the final scene where Charlize Theron, who although being in love with Keanu Reeves, wants to part ways with him so he won't be subjected to her deteriorating condition. What happens onscreen is not the interaction of two people, but actors spewing a lot of overwritten dialogue about preserving the memory of what they had and a lot of other nonsense that no two real life people would ever say to each other, not with the same level of eloquence.</fullReview>

This movie was a very entertaining throughout. It was a welcome change from some of the latest "love stories" i have seen(Save the Last Dance). I absolutely loved this film, it shows us that we need to appreciate life and that we should not put to much importance on trivial things. Reeves acting leaves something to be desired, but he has come a long way since Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and the story more than makes up for him. Theron gives a great performance and being still in her mid 20's the best is yet to come. This movie gets a 7 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's nothing sweet about NOVEMBER...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SWEET NOVEMBER: DSWEET NOVEMBER is a tired, sappy love story full of stupid characters and annoying subplots. It's a sad soap opera with character that we aren't even brough to like.Keanu Reeves stars a Nelson Moss, an ad executive. He is a mean person who wouldn't stop to give you the time of day. His girlfriend has just left him when he meets the free-spirited Sara Deever (Charlize Theron). She's like a prostitute you have to live with for a month. No complaints there. Sara wants to take Nelson in for the month of November (so why did it open in February?) But Nelson isn't so sure. He's not sure if he can just drop things. But he does. They throw out of his nice clothes and his cell phone. Nelson is introduced to Sara's world. Something the audience is suppose to find cute, but is obnoxious. She has a friend named Chaz (Jason Isaacs) and he turns out to be a transvestite. Now what does that have to do with anything in this movie?I'm not sure how someone can make a romance movie with two characters as stupid as this. I'm not sure which one is worse. You can't make a love story and have two characters that no one likes. And why are we suppose to feel bad for Nelson? It's his fault he's so mean. Sara is an annoying character with all her "drop everything" rules in life. There's also a little boy named Abner (Liam Aiken). He wants Sara and Nelson to adopt him. This, also, has nothing to do with the movie.NOVEMBER also has a soap opera feel to it. If I wanted to see a soap opera, I'd turn on ABC. There is nothing here that we didn't already see in "One Life to Live" or "Genreal Hospital." I think that Kurt Voelker (the writer of the screenplay) sat at home for a week and watched soap operas, took notes, and whipped up this. And maybe ROCKY HORROR got mixed up in there because there is no excuse for having a transvestite friend in this movie. It has nothing to do with anything. It would have been okay if it was part of the overall outcome of the movie, but it isn't. That really angered me.I've said it before and I'll say it again, Keanu Reeves can't act. I don't like him one bit. In this movie he's even worse. At least in action movies, he doesn't have to act that much, but taking a movie that is all acting and no action. I don't know, Keanu. I do like Charlize Theron but, she is weak in this movie playing a character with no morals. But I should say it's not Reeves and Theron's fault. It's the fault of the writer who never gave these characters anywhere to go or develop.SWEET NOVEMBER is a giant trainwreck. There's nothing sweet about this movie, it's completely sour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad at All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say first of all, that there are elements of this movie that are predictable and cliche, but this is true of 95% of movies - especially romantic comedies.The concept alone is certainly novel. Theron's character was daring, someone who knew what she believed in and stuck by it. Even if her plans were somewhat selfish, isn't everything we do a little selfish?To me, true characters are the ones we believe. I believed in her character just because of her strong beliefs. Keanu's character was a bit two dimensional, but I think we got the idea. I thought their chemistry was good.I'm afraid that the true reason a lot of people didn't like this movie is because it's a "feel good" or positive type of film. I hate for that type of judgement to happen, because our planet needs films that inspire and educate as well as entertain.This film examines several essential truths in our society.Script-wise a lot of people have bashed this movie. While the script is not the greatest ever penned, it's definitely good. Sure, there are elements of the story that are predictable, but they WORK. Also, there are a few scenes and speeches that are nothing short of literary.Performance-wise Theron was on the mark. Keanu has been better, but had good moments.</fullReview>

I read somewhere that she declined Kate Beckinsale's role in "Pearl Harbor" so she could accept this role.After watching this movie all I could ask myself is why did either one of these people agree to make this? And why was this movie made in the first place? Poor character development. You really don't know why Sara takes strangers in her house. The movie just goes from scene to scene, throwing in all these additional characters involved in Sara's life somehow with again no explanation. I do not think the romance between the 2 main characters was played out well or developed strongly enough.Towards the end of the movie we learn she has been terminally ill then abruptly puts and end to their romance. Her actions after this are confusing. Why she does anything in this movie is questionable.Big waste of time. Disappointing movie. 4/10 and only because Keanu is cute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't a terrible movie, but not heartbreaking either as I'm sure the producers were hoping it would be. But Charlize Theron really does "light up the screen" -- I'll watch anything she's in. But even she can't save herself from some of the ham-fisted dialogue and machinations of the script. Instead of listing complaints, I'll give three reasons to see this: 1. Charlize Theron 2. Great photography of San Francisco -- the location scouts really did their job (I lived in SF for four years). You really get a feel of everyday life in the Protero Hill and Inner Richmond neighborhoods, in addition to the usual SF movie sites like the Marina, Golden Gate Bridge, and the financial district 3. The Enya song "One Time" was used to nice effect.As for Reeves? I tend to find him wooden -- he's okay for action films or roles that only require him to be iconic (like LITTLE BUDDHA), but here he's merely bearable.If you like romances (or if you want to travel to SF without buying a plane ticket) this one's worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Makes You Think....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****SPOILERS*****Sweet November is one of those movies, that really makes you think. It's a great film which is very meaningful and quite sad too. Keanu Reeves stars as Nelson Moss. Nelson is one of those guys that works 24 hours a day and just doesn't have any fun. When stranger- Sara Deever offers him a chance to spend a whole month with her, he obviously refuses. I mean, it's crazy, a woman asking him something like that, but when his girlfriend dumps him and he loses his job, he decides to take up the offer and get's more then he bargained for when they both fall in love with each-other. Usually, Hollywood movies like this have happy endings but Sweet November sadly didn't. Still, the movie was great and Keanu Reeves was brilliant as usual. I've never really been to keen on Charlize Theron. She usually seems so boring, but I guess she did quite a good job here and you could see she enjoys working with Keanu. (Especially, since they've worked together before on The Devil's Adcovate.) Anyway, Sweet November is a great movie with lovely music and I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read the bad reviews before I went and saw it, but of course, a female friend of mine thought it would be "so good." I still said I would not see it, but she even paid. Any ladies reading this, I know that sounds low, but even after seeing this film for free, I still wish I had those two awful hours of my life back. Everybody complains about Keanu Reeves, and honestly, I have never thought he was THAT bad, but after seeing this film, I would have to agree with all the negativity. Also, I usually love Charlize Theron. I think she is one of the most beautiful women alive today and I also think she is an excellent actress, but even with her in this film, it was not redeemed. From beginning to end, the film feels so contrived it hurts. Not once is there apparent reason for her taking him in as a "pet project." And also, once again, it shows how Hollywood elevates sex as some wonderful and emotionally enlightening thing, when it is anything but the case. Even that does not matter though, whoever was in charge of okaying this project should be fired and never hired again, not even at Nike sweat shop, because obviously they are too stupid to go on living. I know these words sound completely harsh, but wait until you see this film. Oh, and the girl that thought it would be "so good" fell asleep, leaving only me to the torture of viewing this god awful movie. Even the twelve year-old girls that came out of this film were bored and thought it was bad and they are usually entertained by anything. Usually I give a fair review of films, looking at both the good and the bad, but this film, as I am sure you have already received the point, has absolutely nothing good in it. Truly, like my title said, I would have rather begged, "beat me with a stick and put me out of my misery!!!" Maybe I would have regretted that afterwards, walking around sore for a while, but at least I wouldn't have to remember this film in my nightmares for the rest of my life. If you don't believe me, or if you're masochistic, please, be my guest and subject yourself to this pain known as "Sweet November."</fullReview>

He did a great job at being the selfish jerk, but the sensitive side seemed to fall a little short. It was the end, pretty predictable, which is not necessarily a bad thing, that sort of lost me. I am a big time crier, I should have cried buckets over this film, but didn't. I think Keanu should have worked a little harder to make this film, maybe he has too much Matrix in him. His Walk in the Clouds performance was much better. Overall I liked it, but Sweet November could have been a great touching film.

		<fullReview>First, we have to discuss the movies male lead, our friend Keanu. I'm sorry, maybe this is a little harsh-- I mean who can forget this lovable pal from such hits Bill and Ted and Dangerous Liaisons, or a little more mainstream perhaps? Speed and Matrix. But in this film, he was completely out of place, looked years beyond his age, and had this look on his face that made me believe he was either attempting complex algebraic equations or was trying really, really hard to remember his lines. No matter the case, I could not get past the fact that he did not fit in either of his roles, an aggressive ad exec or romantic lead and any chemistry he had with Theron in the Devil's Advocate has long since gone to . . . well, anyway.Otherwise the film was a nice sweet chick-flick, ideal for those girl's nights out. Theron fit naturally into her role and the character of Chez and his friend where well acted and Abner and Ernie were way too cute for words.Though this move may be pH-balanced for a man, The plot is only strong enough for a woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment is going to contain some SPOILERS, so if you wish to see this movie you might want to go to another comment. However, I could save you the pain of having to go see this poor excuse for a plot.Before I go into tearing this movie apart, I will say that the acting was good. Charlize Theron was convincing in her part and Keanu Reeves was not bad. But let's face it, the best actors in the world could not save this demented plot. The ending leaves you wondering, did she die? But in reality, no one really cares because the plot died 45 minutes before the ending.Let's start at the beginning. Here we have Keanu Reeves who is a successful advertiser. He meets a very attractive woman who is nuts and, basically, stalks him. He loses his job and his girlfriend and then with very little prompting (maybe a little bit of tantrum throwing), he is spending the night with her and in bed. Now, I'm all for movies that are fairytales, but the reality is that the normal person would not have slept with this woman, because he would be violating his own restraining order, that he would have obtained the day prior.Okay, let's get past this. Let's say that for some unknown, however stupid reason, he does stay with this nut. Now the plot tries to lead you into believing that she is just a selfless person. She is a woman trying to help a man who is lost in the perversion of an every day boring life. She convinces him to stay with her and have sex, and look at the pretty sky and the world around them and then have more sex. Now this is supposed to help him, How?But wait!!! It gets better!!! We find out that she is such a selfless person that she not only is doing this for Keanu, she has done this on a monthly basis for numerous men. Keanu is just the month of November. Now, this should make him feel just great, to know that this caring woman names her men by the month and then just dumps them. Oh, I can just feel the love! By doing this, all of these men must have walked away saying, "Gee, I'm so glad she deceived me and made me a better person for it." "Now, I will go lead a life with no job, smell flowers, pet dogs, look at the sky and thank that wonderful woman for jumping off the high rope and crushing my heart."What this movie really shows, was a woman who used men in a selfish way, to better her own loneliness, without committing to them. she knew that their time was finished when the month was gone. Time, to move onto the next sucker, until I die. It showed someone who was out only for herself, not for any sacrifice for someone else, but solely and only for her.I kept waiting for this movie to redeem itself. I watched it to the ending credits. I have never watched a movie that was supposed to be about a woman (or man) dying and left with not a single feeling of sorrow for that person, until now. The only one I felt sorry for, was the character that Keanu played, because he was such a dupe. When he pulled that scarf down, I was happy to see that she was gone. Now, maybe he would still have time to go get that restraining order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What saved this movie, barely, is that the leading actors are good looking and pleasant to look at (although Charlize's hippie-style wardrobe detracted somewhat from her natural beauty). Else, this attempt at making a movie fails. The plot line is difficult to believe, and the chemistry between Charlize and Keanu never develops to the degree that it should have. 4.75 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the trouble of registering on this site just so I could write this review to save you some time and money by encouraging you to wait for this film to come out on video! Although I'm a big Keanu fan, this film was not worth the effort to watch. Keanu does a pretty good job in the "mushy" romantic parts of the movie, but he's totally unbelieveable as a gung-ho ad exec. In the scene where he's presenting a new marketing approach to a hot dog company, it was all I could do not to laugh. The heavy product placement for one particular Internet dating site was so prevalent it was distracting. The movie's saving graces are (1) Charlize Theron (who looks great even when deathly ill); (2) Keanu's relationship with the little neighbor boy; (3) the setting (San Francisco); (4) the dog; and (5) the soundtrack. Do yourself and your wallet a favor, wait for video on this one and RENT it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as cheese movies are concerned-this one has Velveeta written all over it. The story couldn't be more contrived and boring, yet I found myself enjoying parts of it nontheless. The parts I found the most entertaining, even if they were the most far fetched, were the scenes in which Charlize Theron tried to persuade Keanu Reeves into living with her. Of course the entire scenario is totally off the wall and insane, but we're not talking real life here, its just a movie. I liked watching Reeves and Theron on screen together and having seen 'The Devil's Advocate' knew that there would be a good screen chemistry between them even before I saw the movie. If you like cheese films than you will most certainly like this one because it contains all the elements a good cheese film entails; unrealistic situations, pretty people playing ugly, someone dying, stereotypical gay friends, cheap laughs, and of course, a good cry at the end. What more could we ask for in a movie??? Surely a little substance now and then wouldn't hurt...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Actors Bad Beginnings...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't feel Keanu is a bad actor. I felt the actors and actresses in the movie did a good job for what they were given. I do feel the story was poorly done. The way he is "convinced" to stay with a crazy acting woman who he doesn't know in the beginning just didn't work. I shook my head every time he agreed. It was extremely awkward and unreasonable. She constantly claimed it was to help him but there was no reasoning given. He wasn't really fired (called boss the next day and continued). His life wasn't spiraling out of control. There just wasn't a good enough reason to stay with a crazy stranger for a month. They needed to make Nelson's like a little more shaken.It especially got bad when they added the "guy from downstairs" the night after she sleeps with Nelson. She treats the neighbor like a boyfriend in front of Nelson (stupid) then is surprised (more stupid) when he runs off like any sane person would.If they had worked what I have explained above I would have given it a higher rating but the other half of the movie had it's own problems...She gets this guy into her home after much harassing, begging and prodding that he do so for a MONTH. She sleeps with him and gets involved with him knowing full well she is terminally ill. Yet she freaks out him, beating him up and throwing medications like a rabid monkey when he finds out. This makes absolutely no sense at all. Even if she felt that he would leave her before he found out, SHE HAS CANCER. They shouldn't have given her something so drastic. Terminal cancer is way too big to be hidden.So the guy finds out the woman who forced herself into his life has been lying and will die. Yet she refuses to treat him like a human being EVEN WHEN HE PROVES HE WANTS TO STICK AROUND AFTER FINDING OUT SHE IS SICK. This again is stupid.I think the story line had good points to it but there was too many unrealistic and bad things that ruined it. Usually when someone dies at the end of a movie I cry no matter how powerful the story had been. I didn't this time.Again I think the actors and actresses did a good job with the story they were given. The acting is the only reason it got a rating at all. The story was bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie with a group of friends ranging from ages 21 to 32 and i must say it was interesting to hear what they had to say about it. Firstly, the romantic's enjoyed it and agreed that a valuable life lesson was learned when it pertained to the importance of our jobs and the relationships we loose when focusing on the "self- want- need" aspect of life however the non romantics where more interested in Charlize Theron's body and beauty, suffice to say the acting was not up for debate...Personally i thought that the Character that Keanu Reeves portrayed was in line with his acting . People who are in advertising aren't exactly the silent type and show emotions through looks and certain gesture s. They are in you face and very verbal i might add. So for the individual that so candidly suggested that the romance of the movie was not in the undertone or made by certain subtle gestures, here's food for thought when ever has love been and romance been subtle , it's loud and in you face, and is world wind experience.This is not Keanu's first romantic movie, "a walk in the clouds" as very popular and so was his performance. For my part, action movie's only detract from Keanu's ability because special effects is the worldsfocus, in the entertainment industry. Drama will be an actors turning point in whether or not they can act...</fullReview>

Yes he's able to put together a ridiculous ad campaign...as opposed to just quiting his job and doing something he likes better.There's no real story here. It's just not very interesting. The guy is rich and good looking and he's a work-a-holic so his personal life sucks. Gee, there's an original plot.

The ending ruins an other wise passable movie. Terrible I say! It's like they wanted Independent film cred and didn't know how to get it. Admittedly, both keanu and Charlize deliver reasonable believable performances, however, they are killed by directors or writers or what-have-you that insist on this absolutely stupid ending. A stupid brainless movie that went from there to absolute crap. And why does every movie that is based in San Francisco feature someone who lives in Pot Hill? Who knows? Ick.

		<fullReview>Charlize Theron improves with each movie and has a certain charm that almost saves this from insipid mediocrity. However Keanu, no matter how much a chick magnet he may be, needs flicks like Speed or The Matrix to cover for his cardboard acting. I am sure he actually worked as a dentist in some previous life and no doubt will do so again in the next one. There was a chance to make a fine and quirky film here rather than a hollow reminder of the superior 1968 version. If the remake had been done in Britain by the people who did Bridget Jones Diary or Four Weddings then we may have found ourselves sighing wistfully at the end rather than falling asleep at the halfway point; it was a 45 minute film wasn't it!!!</fullReview>

What I liked about it was that it wasn't your average romantic comedy especially with the ending. They didn't end up together...shows you that life doesn't always end the way we want it to end.What I didn't like was the choice of people to act in this movie. Charlize was pretty good as the girl but Reeves wasn't that good. Maybe for me I just couldn't see him in a romantic comedy. The chemistry between these two people was there but it didn't do much for me. I wasn't blown away by their love and I could almost see them not ending up together. She seemed like she couldn't stay with one man for long.7/10 stars</fullReview>

I cannot think of one good part of this film (and I use that term loosely). Keanu Reeves delivers one of his worst performances ever, and that is saying a lot considering his past work (although "The Matrix" proved he is capable of something close to acting). Charlize Theron was cute and delightful for the first 15 minutes, but she went way downhill after that. If anyone actually pays to see this movie, either through rental or purchase, may God have mercy on his or her soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to sit through this film on a flight from Tokyo to Minneapolis. Several times during the film I wanted to open the cabin door and jump out of the airplane. The movie was that bad. Keanu Reeves is proof that so long as you are attractive, you don't need to be able to act in today's Hollywood. He had the same expression on his face and the same tone in his voice at the beginning of the film, when he was a high-powered advertising executive, as he did at the end, when he turned into a wimpy unemployed puppy waving "bye" at the disappearing Charlize Theron. Why is it in every movie like this, where a women is dying, there has to be a gay friend in her life who takes care of all her hygenic needs? I guess this is something that women fantasize about. Here it was Jason Isaacs as the cross-dresser with a heart of gold. This was truly a wretched movie. I was curious to see if anyone could actually like this film and of course there were a few who did. I guess it just goes to show that there is no accounting for taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this on satellite and had to see what others' impressions were and was very surprised indeed. Looking at some of the other User Comments one cannot help but wonder if some folks out there are in need of a reality check! Yes the film is full of schmaltzy, sugary sentiment (spiced with a tiny amount of sex). Yes the premise is unrealistic. Yes the characters are not totally credible. This is entertainment - IT'S A MOVIE NOT A DOCUMENTARY!! It's typical romantic escapism. It's one of "those movies" like "Four Weddings &amp; A Funeral" or "Notting Hill" where you either leave the theatre with a silly smile on your face or a tear in your eye. What do some of these amateur reviewers watch movies for? Obviously not enjoyment. Maybe the producers of such films should be a tad more specific when it comes to identifying the genre of movies as it is obvious that a few reviewers here were expecting to see something much more serious. Suspend belief for 2 hours and enjoy the story - or stop watching movies of this type altogether and try other forms of escapism. I liked this film.By the way, apropos of nothing at all, has anyone else noticed the resemblance between Greg Germann (Vince) and British Prime Minister Tony Blair? (If any Hollywood producers read this review please DON'T make a film around British politicians - there is a limit as to how far one can suspend belief!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen or heard of the 1968 version of this movie, I went in blind and full of expectations. However, very quickly, I realized I was watching a real stinker, albeit a stinker with two of my favorite Hollywood names (can't say actors, as they're not). A chemistry that worked pretty well in the Devil's Advocate is totally absent from Theron-Reeves here. And here there is no Al Pacino to play off.This movie has no sense of direction, no real story, no characters you care about, and fails to explore anything with interest potential. It cannot decide whether it is a comedy, a tragedy, a catharsis, or who knows what.The two attractive stars give perhaps their worst performances. Neither character is believable or even likable. Even the score pirates snippets of other pieces and does not see them to their musical maturity.Paths not taken: 1)The neighbor kid Abner is not explored or exploited and you wonder why the kid even remembers Nelson, 2)The wise gay neighbor is a powerful ad exec, but we hear no more about it, even though he is a direct competitor of Nelson's, 3)The dysfunction in Theron's family is manifest only by half a phone conversation, 4)It is never clear why Reeves relents and goes to stay with Theron for the title month.This is a real loser!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sweet November can be summarized easily, quickly. There's Keanu, the business man, straight, cruel, cold-blooded, very successful in what he's doing but -of course- very bad in enjoying a "real life". Very bad at developing senses. Then, there's Charlize, who's the exact opposite. She knows everything about how to enjoy life, seize the day, 100% all the time. And -also of course- she's able to read Keanu's mind in no time, knows about his miserable "back-stage" life. Charlize meets Keanu and offers him to live with him! Why? Because she wants to help him. Keanu accepts and -surprise- the two fall in love. Don't worry, movie lover, I won't reveal the entire storyline although it is very predictable anyway.Concisely, -I think you could already feel the sarcastic touch- it's a bad movie and IMDb's average 5.6 really surprised me. I voted 4 out of ten. Only because Charlize manages again to deliver a solid performance as Sarah. She's a fine actress but has to fight the battle on her own since the storyline of "Sweet November" and especially Keanu Reeves as Nelson are far away from being convincing.</fullReview>

But here, they are bad, and are less intruiging than they were in the last film they teamed up in- The Devil's Advocate (partly also because this isn't helped by Pacino). The film is about to very disturbed people (in more ways than you'd think) who join together so the woman can help the man be a better person, and it is painful to watch it, even as a chick flick. Overall, I don't reccomend it to anyone, unless you guys think that by being dragged by your lady you'll get lovin afterward (I'm sure you deserve it anyway after seeing this drek). D-</fullReview>

The movie is all about her character, Sarah Deever, and she really lives up to it with acting that blows away all else, even Keanu Reeves' efforts. And who expected Jason Isaac to fit in a his role so well? All in all, this is a must-watch. The soundtracks are added bonus, with 'wherever you are' and 'only time' requiring special mention.

		<shortDescription>Theron next to 'carry' Keanu in a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it just me??? Keanu RUINS EVERY flick he's in. He must have the best agent in the business, because he keeps getting lead roles. I don't understand it! If you put his performance in this movie (man falling in love) along side his role in last year's `The Watcher' (serial killer), you could not tell any difference! Yeah, this movie was a chick flick, Charlize Theron was VERY GOOD, in sort of a Phoebe-from-Friends-type role. It's a shame she had nothing to work with! Theron gets this grade by herself.

		<shortDescription>$1 too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the original SN so when I saw the remake in the $1 bin I was a bit shocked and so I bought it. That was the worst mistake of my life, I can't believe the store had the gall to think that this piece of trash was worth $1!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irritating, but with one lovely scene.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not like this film. I am mainly irritated by two things. First, Keanu R. always sounds so inept, so wooden. I've seen amateur theatre that has better acting. I don't understand how he's gotten so far in the movie business. Plus he has some lines in this film that had me writhing because they are so trite. Second, I was not convinced by Sara's unwillingness to try to get better. I did not understand it and I did not get any insight into her motivations.Now, having said the foregoing, the last scene is a beauty. It has tension and suspense. But it is not enough to give this film weight. It is just a gesture or flourish.</fullReview>
