		<fullReview>Set during an unspecified future era, Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker who longs for a trip to Mars. His wife, Lori (Sharon Stone) isn't so keen on it--she'd prefer a trip to Saturn, or a space cruise. Riding on the subway one day, Quaid notices a television advertisement for a company named Rekall, which specializes in memory implants of vacations. Quaid checks into it as an alternate means of having a "Mars vacation". While at Rekall, he chooses an alternate personality upgrade of a secret agent. However, while undergoing the procedure, something goes wrong. He learns that his Quaid identity was a memory implant and he really _is_ a secret agent. Now that he has his real memory back, he's on the run and he escapes to Mars. But why is everyone after him? Total Recall, based on "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale", a short story from 1974 by Philip K. Dick (and novelized in conjunction with the film production by Piers Anthony), had a laborious history getting to the silver screen. Tens of drafts were written. Production companies were attached then went out of business. Many directors and stars were attached who either changed their minds or who were dropped. Luckily, Arnold Schwarzenegger talked Carolco into picking up the project for him, with Paul Verhoeven--who'd already proved his mettle on the similarly toned RoboCop (1987)--on board as director, because this is an excellent film.While Total Recall certainly has influences, including "The Martian Chronicles" (1980), Dune (1984) and the first major film based on a Philip K. Dick work, Blade Runner (1982), it's more notable for the films that it has influenced in subsequent years, including The Fifth Element (1997) and many of the "rubber reality" films such as Abre los ojos (1997)/Vanilla Sky (2001) and The Thirteenth Floor (1999). It's also yet another film on the very long list that have had various elements "adapted" into part of The Matrix (1999)--most explicitly here, the "bug" that Quaid has to remove from his body with a high-tech machine and the possibility of "waking up" from a particular reality by taking "the red pill".Although it's easy to interpret Total Recall in a very straightforward manner, so that the bulk of what we're seeing at any particular moment and the bulk of the dialogue are the literal reality, very convincing arguments can be made that the majority of the film is a depiction of Quaid's memory implant while in the "patient's chair" at Rekall. And those certainly aren't the only two interpretations possible.What matters more than thinking one has a "right answer", though, is the deeply captivating story that provokes our interpretations and the amount of fun we have getting there. Verhoeven and the scriptwriting team, which included Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, the writing team behind the Alien films (beginning with Alien, 1979), never let us go very long without another plot twist, most of which force a reinterpretation of the material that went before. The twists occur about once per every ten minutes, if not more frequently.The film is notable for its special effects by Rob Bottin, which were far ahead of their time, and its fantastic production and art design, which manage to make us feel both that we're experiencing a vicarious trip to a "future grunge" Mars and an almost "Doctor Who" (1963)-ish absurdly artificial reality, complete with supersaturated red skies, ala Frank R. Paul's illustrated covers for the Amazing Stories fiction magazine.Some locations in Mexico were used for the film, including some subway shots on Mars, and actual commercial sign age was incorporated into the film. There's a lot of fun to be had noticing all of the cultural differences and similarities that the future era of the film will bring. Verhoeven delights in subtle glimpses of various symbols and accoutrement's. His view of the future is one full of corruption, commercialism and decadence. He doesn't have much confidence in a "bright new world" as humans spread out to new territory.Verhoeven is basically extending the way things are now to the future; it's as if he sees our state as indicative of human nature, so that as long as we're humans, people are going to be taking advantage of one another, trying to control one another, engaging in behavior that's a conflict between desires and societal mores, but also helping out each other when the going gets tough. In these respects, Total Recall has culture-satirical similarities to later films such as Starship Troopers (1997), which isn't surprising given that Verhoeven directed both films. It's notable that Total Recall's future is not quite as bleak as Starship Trooper's.But the film is hardly less violent. Verhoeven's initial cut was given an X by the MPAA for violence. A number of scenes had to have small edits, most of which have thankfully been restored on at least one special edition DVD. The violence here is a lot more small scale and personal than Starship Troopers. In terms of the visceral, Total Recall often rides a gray area somewhere between action and horror. While the action isn't as explosive as many Schwarzenegger films, the suspense never resolves until the end. This is an amazing thrill ride of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly One Of Arnie's Best Ever Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen TOTAL RECALL many times over the years and I'm never failed to be impressed with it . Some people dislike it and I feel I must defend the movie " Confused plot " - Sorry but I managed to understand the complex plot first time I saw the movie and was impressed that Hollywood had merged a high concept plot with a FX laden extravaganza , such a pity this didn't lead to more thoughtful action adventures . If you want to see a confused plot try watching a James Bond movie from the 1980s " The violence " - Yeah this is a violent movie for sure but I do wish people would educate themselves to the work of directors before they criticize . Paul Verhoeven had previously made FLESH AND BLOOD and ROBOCOP so a futuristic adventure by Verhoeven that was awarded an 18 certificate isn't going to be confused with an episode of the teletubbiesWhat I liked from Verhoeven's directing is that he's made everything so recognizable , nothing is ridiculously futuristic looking and we see the characters wearing clothes that wouldn't look out of place in the 1980s . Verhoeven also brings little satirical stabs to the proceedings as he did with ROBOCOP and it's a great shame we see less and less of this European director working for Hollywood Verhoeven even gets a good performance from Big Arnie , okay this body builder was never in danger of winning an Oscar but Arnie doesn't send himself up and nor do his wise cracks like in his other blockbusters but he does make for an affable - Though violent - hero . Michael Ironside gives the most memorable performance which considering he spends most of the movie running around with a gun is no small achievement . One interesting thing I noticed about TOTAL RECALL after seeing it again last night is that it's unapologetic on being on the side of the rebels who are waging a war against the greedy Mars company . Anyone believe that if it was made today the rebels/terrorists would be the bad guys ? Anyway this is along with the original TERMINATOR the best movie starring Arnie though most of the credit for this movie belongs to the screenwriters and director and it's a great pity Hollywood is reluctant to mix a high concept SF plot with a crowd pleasing action adventure</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action sci-fi at it's best..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is without doubt Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie since The Terminator. Arnold fits perfectly in the role of Doug Quaid (definitely his best acting in a movie to date) the confused construction worker and Ronny Cox provides his usual evil plotting arch bad-guy. The impressive visual effects are worth the movie's $100million price tag, and Paul Verhoeven proved that, as with Robocop and Starship Troopers, sci-fi is where he does his best work.What does spoil films like these, however, are people who cannot grasp the concept of Science FICTION, and refuse to suspend their belief for 2 hours(a vital part of enjoying these movies). Movies like this don't work without the overplayed violence, cheesy one-liners and stunning effects. Take away any of these elements and you no longer have a sci-fi action movie.Chill out, check out and enjoy...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worker Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) dreams on Mars for many consecutive nights. He invites his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) to spend vacation on Mars, but she does not agree, since the planet ruled by the tyrant Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who sells oxygen for the population, is facing resistance movement and terrorist acts leaded by the mutant Kuato. Douglas decides to go to the Rekall Company to implant virtual vacation memories of Mars for his own satisfaction, using a special program with the identity of a secret agent. While in the process, something goes wrong and Douglas becomes aggressive, and the process is interrupted. While returning home, the life of Douglas turns upside down, and he travels to the red planet trying to disclose who he is.Today I have watched "Total Recall" at least for the tenth time, now on DVD. Again, I found it an excellent sci-fi film with non-stop action. The story has many twists, and the screenplay has no flaws, being very attractive. This was the first movie that the beauty of the unknown Sharon Stone (in 1990) called my attention. Arnold Schwarzenegger is great performing a dubious hero, and Michael Ironside is the perfect villain. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "O Vingador do Futuro" ("The Avenger of the Future")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOTAL ACTION! TOTAL SCI-FI! TOTAL SCHWARZENEGGER!That's right, 12 years after its release this movie stands the test of time. Maybe not quite as good as Schwarzenegger's other blockbuster Terminator 2, but pretty close.Some people say the effects are dated, but I disagree. Dated is super intelligent talking computers with monochrome, low resolution monitors. The effects here aren't revolutionary by today's standards, but they certainly aren't cheap or tacky looking. Except maybe the plasticine faces, but they are good for a laugh!I've seen this movie over 100 times and I will continue to enjoy it for years to come. It's got the perfect blend of science fiction, action, mystery and special effects. It's actually a thinking man's action movie, not just mindless carnage. You still wonder till this day, was it a dream or reality? Every time you watch it you'll notice a different nuance or clue hinting one way or the other.For the memory of a lifetime, Recall Recall Recall!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best mind trips ever, I could only wish this movies was made ten years later. Even for 1990, this film had some of the most imaginative make-up I've ever seen in a movie. While it had Paul Verhoeven's classic shallowness, the film really touched new ground not only with science fiction but also with special effects. Talk a good few years for a director, he not only changed sci-fi with Robocop, he did it again with Total Recall. Verhoeven will never, ever win an Oscar for best director, but his movies will at least be entertaining in most respects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Darn Good Futuristic Thriller...Much Better Than "Minority Report"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total RecallArnold Schwarzenegger stars in an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story 'We'll Remember It For You Wholesale' in the Hollywood makeover 'Total Recall.' And a darn good makeover it is.Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, who is having a serious identity crisis. He lives in the future. In the future, people have the ability to live on Mars. Well, guess who wants to go to Mars? Unfortunately, Douglas' wife (Sharon Stone) is not too happy about that idea, and wants to stay on Earth. So, what's a guy to do if his wife doesn't want to move? Get a memory implant, of course! Using the latest technology, memories can be implanted in your brain in a matter of moments. You choose the destination, identity (spy, civilian, etc.) and Total Rekall (yes, Total Rekall) will install it for you.Warned by his friends not to get the implant, Quaid does so anyway. But something goes terribly wrong. Soon, his wife, friends and co-workers are all trying to kill him.but why? The answer may kill him.Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role of Quaid. People can argue all they want about how bad an actor he is, but you can't say that after seeing this movie. He pulls the film's acting and stunts off with ease, all the while spitting out his catchy one-liners ('Consider this a divorce!').Sharon Stone is probably at her best here, seeing that her career went mainly down-the-drain from here on (okay, she won - or was nominated - for an Oscar for 'Casino.' This movie made her).Paul Verhoven directs this film, and there are no arguments that this is his finest work - by far. He was the director who went on to make such 'critically acclaimed' (*guffaw*) films such as 'Showgirls' and 'Hollow Man.' His only other film that was remotely good was 'Basic Instinct,' but this is still ten times better (Sharon Stone would not have starred in that film if not for 'Total Recall' - Verhoven said so himself.).The special effects in this movie are excellent; supposedly, they spent millions and millions on the fake Mars sets, and I bet they're glad it paid off.I recently bought the 'Total Recall' Limited Edition DVD with a newly remastered digital makeover, Dolby Digital 5.1, behind-the-scenes documentary(s), a commentary by Verhoven and Schwarzenegger, and much, much more. If you can find one now (it was limited edition so it might be off the market, now) I would recommend picking a copy up. It was fourteen dollars, and it definitely packed a punch for that much (no, I'm not a salesman!)'Total Recall' stands as Arnold's most 'thought-provoking' film and best conspiracy-type thriller. In fact, it is one of the best sci-fi/futuristic thrillers ever.Many people do not realize that 'Minority Report' with Tom Cruise is actually a sequel to this film, and Verhoven and Schwarzenegger had talked about making it for a long time, but now, it looks like the deal is off. There is still a sequel in talks, however, not based on a story by Dick. Supposedly, the company (Miramax, was it?) wants Arnold, Stone and Verhoven back. Oh well. I, for one, am looking forward to it (though I don't understand how Stone is coming back.prequel?)Anyway, I'm getting off the subject. 'Total Recall' is a good movie, and a darn good one at that. It provides everything we want - and more - in a movie.4.5/5 stars - maybe I'm overrating it. However, I feel it deserves that many stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the most enjoyable of the Arnold action vehicles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall has little, if any,by way of passing itself as being 'art'. It is, but more in the sense of it being pop-art, of the director Paul Verhoven paying tribute in visuals to the story by Phillip K. Dick. And it's also one of the more exciting and quotable of those shameless examples of how to do an action film. In this case, however, because it is a P.K. Dick-based story there are some good social bits made in the process. If it isn't as astute or consistent as Blade Runner or Minority Report, it's probably more due to it having to be a vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger than it being a full-on thought-provoking work of science fiction on film. But this does rank up high with the other works of the star, as he is in a complex situation in the film- his mind is scrambled, at first, and everything he thought was right as dickens is not. So he's told by 'himself' on a screen he happened to save for himself that he has to get to mars to find out the truth.There is plenty of good action sequences, but it is more about Verhoven's knack at getting this popularized view of Mars just a little subverted, a little stranger. Some of my favorite scenes involved Scwarzenegger's mishaps and turns of fate as the story and his character took turns. For example, in the scene when Arnold's character wants to get his memory wiped off to Mars and then he flips out in the chair, this is a very entertaining scene in being very ridiculous (try to listen to what he says, or don't as its near unintelligible) as well as following a darker trek in the story. In fact, much of the film works on the strengths of both director and star by having it not too over the top to have some belief in what is going on, but that expectations aren't limited to what might happen as Arnold's character in on Mars uncovering the conspiracy around his messed-up memory.Featuring a sultry Sharon Stone in a great supporting role (another memorable scene comes with her demise, as usual quotable to the bone), as well as a memorable climax involving the arid Mars air and a certain outrageous reaction to it, I recommend Total Recall for genre fans and even those who might be wary of it being a 'Hollywood' take on Dick. It's not great, and per usual PKD fans might scoff at the faithfulness to the source, but it's better than some of the lesser adaptations of the author. Just go in for a good time and it stands up over time (err, 16 years).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Arnie's best ? an action movie with a very good core plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2020, Douglas feels he needs a break from the day to day life and goes to Total Recall ? where memories are planted in your head to make you think you are someone else for a while ? a holiday in your head if you will. However before he can be injected he begins to have flashbacks and suddenly finds that people are trying to kill him and that somehow he must get to Mars to uncover the reasons. However what is truth and what is fake and is the whole thing really happening or not?Based on a Phillip K. Dick story this was always going to be intelligent ? however it's surprising that Verhoeven manages to keep that core well. The plot allows his excessive violence but is also a great story that more than holds the interest with twists and turns and neither Douglas or us fully knowing what's going on. The action is great ? even 10 or so years on, and the tension just stays solid throughout.Schwarzenegger does his usual invincible muscles stuff and looks happy blasting crowds, but he is also OK in other areas too. Tictin is good but never repeated this success for herself. The baddies (or maybe not?) are the best roles ? solid baddies like Ironside and Cox are just as good as they were in other similar roles and Sharon Stone is good as Douglas' wife.Overall this continues Verhoeven's trend of making ultra-violence and clever plots and satire work well together (Robocop, Starship Troopers and this) as opposed to his trend of making trash! Everything about this film works well ? whether it be the action or the acting or the plot ? a surprisingly nice package for a violent action movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold Schwarzenegger's most thoughtful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall works for most of it's length as a convoluted Hitchcockian science fiction thriller. It's only at the denouement that things become...despite an indulgence in sadism that would offend delicate sensibilities...cartoonish and unrealistic (e.g., exposure to the Martian environment would in truth be a swift race between suffocation and freezing to death). While as a whole the film has flaws--things that tend to ruin the suspension of disbelief--that aren't easy to overlook, there are a number of individual scenes that I particularly cherish, rewarding repeat viewings. There is, for instance, Doug (Schwarzenegger) Quaid's visit to Rekall, Inc., and the salesman's pitch that slyly reveals the entire plot of the movie beforehand. Another is the encounter in the Martian hotel room where the possibility Doug is unwittingly undergoing a dream--in the form of synthesized memories--is brought up, and another set of predictions particularly covering the third act is expounded. Lastly, the scene in which the villainous mastermind (Ronny Cox) reveals his stunning machinations qualifies as a mindbender. One more note: it's appears that almost every significant character in the film is not who he seems to be at first glance. Some other items in the movie's favor is the musical soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and spectacular special effects. Again, Total Recall is not greater than the sum of its parts, has patent absurdities that insult intelligence, and bloody violence. Still, it remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's strongest...and most thoughtful...film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Verhoeven bonkers adaptation of a P. K. Dick story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doug Quaid keeps getting recurring dreams about a visit to Mars. In spite of his friends warnings, he decides to have a memory implanted Mars holiday. But during the implantation he remembers being a secret agent who is fighting evil Mars boss Vilos Cohaagen. Things are about to go very intergalactic bonkers indeed.Total Recall finds director Paul Verhoeven on particularly OTT form, with the often maligned director cranking up the action and violence to the max. So then, who better to play out the carnage than the big Austrian oak himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger? It was actually Schwarzenegger who brought Verhoeven into the picture. The idea for the film had been kicking around for years, a number of director's came and went, David Cronenberg famously worked on a screenplay for a year only to have it jettisoned for being too close to the P. K. Dick short story "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale". The makers wanted a high energy sci-fi blockbuster, a star vehicle for Schwarzenegger, and Verhoeven was only too happy to oblige. Total Recall is a fascinating concept as we find ourselves wondering what in fact is reality? Quaid himself is never quite sure as the film takes a delicious twist at the midpoint to further compound the confusion, but in true Verhoeven style, it all comes crashing together in a giant ball of bangs, crashes and explosions. It should be noted that the film is far removed from the cerebral essence of Dick's story, and really when one saw that Schwarzenegger was to star in a Verhoeven directed adaptation, one really should be prepared for the high octane brain dumb down that Total Recall is. Something which was beyond some highbrow critics who are still baffled by the gargantuan financial success of the film (it made over $260 million worldwide).Fleshing out the cast are a stoic reliable bunch. Rachael Ticotin, Ronny Cox, Sharon Stone &amp; Michael Ironside deliver the expected tongue in cheek professionalism. While the effects prove to be a mixture of the poor and the decent; tho it's nice to see the often lost art of model work being of a pretty high standard. All of which leaves me personally with a film that I find to be a hugely enjoyable piece of uber violent popcorn fodder. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat dated but it still holds up (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call Total Recall an intellectual action film would be going too far. After all, this is a film with a three-titted whore, a midget hooker and a body count only Harold Shipman could dream of. Plus it has Arnie one-liners and tons and tons of blood. But despite all this, buried underneath the sleazy, bloodstained exterior there's a smart film trying to get out. Issues of reality and identity are all dealt with. But they're never dealt with at the expense of someone getting their head blown off.Watching it back, it's quite pleasing to remember just how violent action films used to be. Here you have men getting spiked in the neck, people getting axed and a man getting a pole of some sort shoved through his face. And that's just in one scene! The violence here is bloody and over the top, and in my opinion, much better for it. I mean, action films these days have become rather sanitised. There's just a feeling that you've seen it all before. But how many times do you get to see a man have his arms ripped off as he dangles from a lift? And how many times do you get to see that and have Arnie toss the arms away while delivering a quip? Only once.And then there's the bit where Michael Ironside shoots the three-titted whore in the back. Beautiful! I mean, this is meant to be a bad, bad man. And what better way to generate loathing (and secret admiration) than have him shoot a mutant hooker while her back is turned.But one of the most delightful bits of insane violence is when the midget whore stabs Ironside's lackey. You have to ask yourself whether you're shrooming your tits off. But no, it happens and then the midget stands on top of the bar and opens fire with a machine gun. Verhoeven is clearly a twisted man mental, but I can't help but admire him.Also worthy of praise is the shootout on the subway. Arnie is fleeing from the bad guys and tries to haul ass up the escalators. But more bad guys appear at the top. As everyone starts shooting, an innocent person gets killed in the crossfire. Arnie then uses the bloke as a human shield ? he gets penetrated more times than a pretty boy in a prison shower ? and tosses the piece of meat into the path of the bad guys below. I can't help but salute the complete utter lack of sentiment.I also salute the fight between Arnie and Sharon Stone. I mean, usually fights between women and men in action films are death ? yeah, I can believe than an anorexic model can hurt a man double her size ? but it at least keeps things relatively believable by having Stone hit Arnie a couple of times in his brain (his testicles). But what makes it a joy is that after the fight, Stone tries to buy some time by offering to tie herself up and let Arnie have his way with her. You know, for old times sake. It's something of a surprise that Der Gropenfuhrer doesn't take her up on her generous offer, but Arnie does knock her out?which is even better.And there's another bit of violence that cracks me up. The evil mutant Benny, in some sort of digging machine, is attacking Arnie. Arnie then grabs a huge drill and rams it through the side of the vehicle while screaming "Screw you!" at the top of his lungs. It's one of the few bits of possible homoeroticism in a film that is remarkably ungay for an Arnie flick.But there is another little bit of possible gayness in the film. Just take the relationship between Hauser (Arnie's evil alter-ego) and Cohaagen (Ronny Cox). They hug enthusiastically in a video message and then Cohaagen has a big strop when he finally realises that Hauser isn't coming back ? he kicks a tank of goldfish over. It seems like he's lost more than a friend.But Ronny Cox is excellent in the film. Sure he's basically playing the same character he played in RoboCop, but he always makes an excellent villain. And I love the scene where he's going to have Quaid turned back into Hauser and have Melina 'fixed'. His dialogue with Arnie is wonderful. "You get to f*** her every night, that's right. She's going to be Hauser's babe." And then when asked what to do with all the people that are suffocating because he's cut off the air, he replies, "F*** 'em." That's a proper movie villain.However, I don't think the film is in the same class as RoboCop. For one, Total Recall now looks rather dated (look at the 'futuristic' cars) while RoboCop seems pretty timeless, and plus the balance between smarts and action is a bit more even in RoboCop.But that's not to say that Total Recall is a dumb film. One of the obvious pleasures is trying to work out whether the whole thing is a dream or not. After all, when Quaid goes to Rekall to have his 'ego trip' everything the salesman says in his pitch actually happens ? the whole plot is given away in one scene. And then at the end you have a white out rather than a fade to black. This could suggest that Quaid is waking up or even being lobotomised. But although it's something that's pleasing to think about, the film is more concerned about action than ideas. And so that makes the film a minor success rather an overwhelming success like RoboCop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satirical Technological Commentary, While Still Being An Enjoyable Sci-Fi Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danish director, Paul Verhoeven, released his first American film in 1987; this was RoboCop, an action film which has since become situated in a league of its own. Not only was it a hit in the Western world, but a global box-office bragger and a critically acclaimed triumph. Subsequent to the success, Verhoeven was chosen to direct a film adapted from a novella by Philip K. Dick ("We Can Remember It for you Wholesale") and turned it into the 1990 action classic, Total Recall. Two surprisingly intelligent action films made in succession allowed Verhoeven to become an established film-maker, who was at liberty to take the content of mainstream films distinctly further.Arnold Schwarzenegger took leading-man once again for Total Recall, just like the majority of films he starred in during the '80s and '90s. As with The Terminator, Predator and even Commando; his artificial and easy-to-mock acting went centre stage once again. Even though Schwarzenegger is far from being named a great actor, he is certainly situated as one of the most likable and satisfying (from a Blockbuster standpoint). His deadened approach is what makes his roles so true their form, and he is nearly always playing characters with seemingly robotic personalities. Growing up watching "Arnie actioners" is something I have always treasured, which is why his films are cherished memories and also the reason for making re-watches such an electrifying event.Fusing reality with delusion (in what is essentially a case of identity crisis) is the core theme of Total Recall. Recurring -the now too-close-to-home- ideas of technological corruption reluctantly controlling a man's livelihood is hardly a topic which lacks the option of philosophical debate. In fact, for the action/science-fiction genre Verhoeven works wonders in making what seems to be a relatively stable, easy-going mainstream archetype into something which speaks out on politics and technology. Indeed, with the rapid increase and reliability on technology there is no doubt that us consumers will eventually resort to purchasing faulty, radioactive brain implants. Sadly, I am not joking, as I do believe that the foreseeable future of technology's control over our lives is inevitable.Total Recall worked wonders for special-effects and make-up during the beginning of the '90s. Lifelike mutants and grand set-pieces, including architecture resembling art-deco and prefabricated design drove the film's ambiance. As with most action films the average shot length (ASL) is visibly short, but is acceptable for a film of its kind and works adequately when put in conjunction with the ultra-violent fight scenes. Villains are stereotypical, heroes sprout graciously eccentric one-liners ("Consider it a divorce!") and the array of characters are befuddling, but these are mere reasons why Total Recall is a cinematic product of its time, which still foreshadowed future possibilities.If you are a person who takes everything far too seriously, then Total Recall is not appropriate viewing. However, if you are prepared to have an open-mind and realise that action films can still be clever (in this case due to a fantastically wrapped screenplay) you are likely to acquire a barrel of rip-roaring violence and furtive intellect. All too regularly is the film misconstrued as a meaningless American blockbuster, something it actually refrains from potentially becoming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Wreck-All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When TOTAL RECALL was released back in 1990, it signaled the end of an era: the end of intelligent science fiction films made in Hollywood. No more ANDROMEDA STRAIN, no more BLADE RUNNER, no more DUNE. The science fiction genre was dumbed down considerably by this Paul "subtle as a sledgehammer" Verhoeven directed project based on a story by Philip K Dick. It's well reported how the script was changed considerably to suit Ah-nuld's limitations as an actor. What a good actor could have done with the original story's intriguing plot points were quickly re-written once Ah-nuld was attached to the project. I read the article in CINEFANTASTIQUE about the tumultuous life of the screenplay and the many changes they made to the storyline. The article was disheartening. Plot points and fascinating ideas found in the original screenplay were eliminated and replaced by gore, gore, gore and stupid one liners, and a very mean-spirited tone. The repetitious use of gratuitous violence was exploited brilliantly by Verhoeven to prompt the story with some "life" because he was aware Ah-nuld could not act. In fact, almost every actor in TOTAL RECALL cannot act. I've never seen such a collection of bad acting from so many actors in a single film, with Rachel Ticotin winning the award for worst pseudo-action female star ever.Things are made worse by the complete lack of vision from the director: the papier-mâché look of the sets and the Mars environment, with the uber cheesy mutants living there made the film look like a $80 million TROMA film. But the thing that killed this film was the complete lack of logic which clashed with the science fiction aspects of the story: because this is an action film, made for people who believe Ah-nuld can kill 100 bad guys with one bullet, the action goes on as if everything took place on earth, in your average city. Everyone starts shooting all over the enclosed Mars environment with ordinary guns and bullets. The bad guys shoot bullets into (breakable) windows and there goes the carefully controlled environment. Brilliant work, guys. You're jeopardizing your own life. This movie is so dumb, it's unbelievable. Verhoeven pandered to the lowest common denominator just to please action film fans and, IMO, he permanently lost his "author" tag with the ugly TOTAL WRECK-ALL.The only good thing in this film is Jerry Goldsmith's score. It's powerful and evocative. I just wish this excellent score was attached to a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall is a fast paced sci-fi action movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way from beginning to end. For a movie released in the early 1990's, it has some very spectacular make-up effects, visual effects and special effects. This movie is sort of similar to Paul Verhoeven's other films. It is violent, bloody, it has some sexuality/nudity and some profanity. This movie has dark humour. Paul Verhoeven really knows how to use visual and special effects and dark humour whenever he is shooting a scene in his movies. This is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films, along with Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Predator. Total Recall is also one Verhoeven's best movies to date. This movie is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Total Recall" - 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to make a confession that I have a serious lack of knowledge concerning the workings of revered science fiction author, Philip K. Dick. However, I do know that three of his workings have been turned into some of the greatest science fiction action set-pieces of the last 21 years. The first was Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner," which was released in 1982 and is the obvious best Philip K. Dick adaptation ever. The most recent was last year's "Minority Report," which starred Tom Cruise and was directed by Steven Spielberg. Somewhere in between there, was Arnold Schwarzenegger's action epic, "Total Recall," which was released in 1990 and was directed by Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven (RoboCop, Starship Troopers)."Recall" (adapted from Dick's short story "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale") starred Schwarzenegger in the role of Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who goes to a place that sells you fake memories and Quaid opts for an implant of the planet Mars. However, a mishap occurs during the implantation and it is discovered that Quaid is actually a secret agent. Quaid's journey then concerns him having to leave Earth and returning to Mars to find his true identity.If "Total Recall" is the least successful of the "Big Three" ("Recall," "Minority Report," "Blade Runner"), then it is at least the most inventive. The movie has such a wondrous vision of future Earth and a production design that no one can beat. Paul Verhoeven injects his usual gratuitous bloodshed here (a number of scenes were edited to remove excessive violence), while also carefully planting little bits of social satire. The Oscar-winning special effects are another one of the great highlights of this film, too. Though dated, they still look pretty convincing, even today 13 years later after this films release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Sci-Fi movie with an entertaining intrigue full of thrills , twists and turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 2084 , it is the future , technology has flourished, and humans have successfully colonized on the planet Mars . A factory worker (Arnold Schwarzenegger though Christopher Reeve was offered, but turned down ,Jeff Bridges, Matthew Broderick and Richard Dreyfuss were each considered and role posteriorly interpreted by Colin Farrell in recent remake) happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone , subsequently acted by Kate Beckinsale in remake directed by his husband Len Wiseman) , begins to suspect that he is a spy after visiting Rekall - a company that provides its clients with implanted fake memories of a life they would like to have led - goes wrong and he finds himself on the run . When Douglas Quaid goes for virtual vacation memories of the planet Mars, an unexpected and harrowing series of events forces him to go to the planet for real, or does he? . They stole his mind, now he wants it back . Quaid finds himself thrust into the midst of a global conspiracy to find it out , as he goes to Mars where is helped by Melina (Rachel Ticotin , ulteriorly played by Jessica Biel) .This exciting picture is based on a short story titled "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale" by Philip K. Dick that was inspiration to screen story by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon , but director Verhooven replaced the satirical humor with extreme violence , in the original screenplay, dark humor was much more prevalent. The flick packs thrills , chills , plot twists and noisy action from start to finish . It's a roller-coaster ride until the massive final of the picture . It also displays lots of strong scenes , blood , gore and violence , the original cut of the movie was given an X-rating by the MPAA for excessive violence , some was trimmed and different camera angles were used in some of the more over the top scenes and the movie was then re-rated R . Acceptable acting by Schwarzenegger , he said that he felt this helped the story even more, giving a much stronger contrast to it by turning a character who is otherwise powerful physically into a character that becomes vulnerable after having his mind stolen . Good support cast such as Ronny Cox as Vilos Cohaagen , Michael Ironside as Richter , Marshall Bell as George/Kuato and Mel Johnson Jr. as Benny . Impressive production design , the subway scenes were filmed in the Mexico City subway system , the miniatures used for shots showing Martian geography were based on Martian photographs . Excellent special effects , it was one of the last major Hollywood blockbusters to make large-scale use of miniature effects as opposed to CGI, and at the same time, it was also one of the first major Hollywood blockbusters to use CGI , mainly for the scenes involving the X-Ray scanner , and have it look "photo-real". Paul Verhoeven and special effects supervisor Rob Bottin had had constant disagreements during the making of RoboCop, so it seemed unlikely that the two men would ever cooperate again. However, when they saw how good Robocop had turned out, they changed their minds, and Verhoeven gave Bottin full freedom to make his own Martian creature designs . Furthermore , rousing and thrilling musical score by the great composer Jerry Goldsmith , today become a classic soundtrack. However he had said that he had received some criticism about the movie's score that "the movie had no theme", to which he strongly disagreed, stating that the movie did in fact have a theme, but it wasn't the kind of theme that "people left the theaters whistling after". The motion picture was compellingly directed by Verhoeven , though seven filmmakers were considered for and even hired to direct the movie, including Richard Rush, Bruce Beresford , Lewis Teague was also under consideration to direct around this time and David Cronenberg who had even written a few drafts of the script before Paul took over the project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERSIf I had to rank the ten best science-fiction movies made in the nineties, Total Recall would appear. Not only, is it one of the best science-fiction movies of the last decade but it's also one of the most original movies ever made. The film-maker, Paul Verhoeven made a masterstroke. His movie is a studied mix of science-fiction, horror, and detective film. It's of course based on a rich but complicated screenplay. Indeed, during the movie it's nearly impossible to distinguish dream from reality and to define Schwarzenegger's state of mind. The screenplay is also skilled because it aims at getting the spectator lost by leading him towards wrong tracks. Moreover, Verhoeven made of Mars, a dangerous and dreadful planet where you have to mistrust everyone and where everything can happen, especially the unexpected.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays with conviction his role of a worker in search of his real identity. Little by little, we're quite sure that he puts himself in the place of an hero who must release Mars in the grip of the dictator Cohaagen.The movie is also worth seeing for its outstanding special effects and its fantastic sceneries. It's also a well-regulated movie between the (bloody) action sequences and moments that encourage reflection.At last, Verhoeven showed feats because he succeeds in sustaining the interest of the spectator during all the movie in spite of its difficult story. Besides, you follow the movie with a great interest hoping that Verhoeven will give us a rational explanation about Scwarzenegger's state of mind. But it's not really the case. In spite of an "happy end", the film-maker is careful not to reveal the truth. So, doubt about dream or reality remains.At the end, this is indisputably Verhoeven's best movie and Schwarzenegger's best performance to date</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Verhoeven's best movies, no doubt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnie is Doug Quaid, a simple construction worker who is bored with his uneventful life and wishes to be more and to do something meaningful. He's fascinated with going to Mars and meeting the mysterious woman of his dreams (that would be Melina) despite the civil war brewing withing the colonies. His wife Lori (Sharon Stone, looking gorgeous) is appalled with all things Martian and quickly nixes that idea. The only way Quaid is going to come close to the red planet is if he takes a Rekall vacation, a company that literally offers you a 'dream' vacation memory implant. Quaid wishes to go as a secret agent and all seems well until they send him to sleep.As soon as he's unconscious Quaid seems to wake up in a rage, claiming his name is not Quaid but Hauser. And it's not just the dream going wrong since the Rekall technicians have not even implanted the dream yet. Blacking out again and waking up in a cab, Quaid has totally no recollection of anything that has happened and is confused to find his life turned upside down. His wife and colleagues are trying to kill him, dozens of armed henchmen are after him, he seems to have acquired lethal killing skills from nowhere and he apparently has some unfinished business back on Mars, despite the fact that he's never been there. Or has he?Once on Mars for real (or is it?) he finds himself involved with the beautiful Melina (Rachel Ticotin, even prettier than Sharon Stone), the underground resistance and battling their arch-nemesis Vilos Cohaagen, a bureaucrat who has the entire planet under his control. It seems that Hauser was Cohaagen's right hand man and left clues for the fabricated Quaid persona to topple Cohaagen's regime.Total Recall is certainly one of Arnie's and Verhoeven's most imaginative and creative movies. The Mars town of Venusville is basically Amsterdam's Red Light District with booze, drugs and sex everywhere, the violence is so ridiculously over-the-top that one cannot help but laugh at it (despite a lot of the gorier bits being censored by the evil MPAA), the vision of the future is incongruously bleak but colorful and fanciful yet primitive. The contrasts between Earth and Mars are similar to Western and Third World comparisons.The visual effects, if slightly dated, are simply amazing. Jerry Goldsmith's awesome score is, at once, atmospheric and action-packed. The set-pieces, especially Quaids vision of the alien furnaces, are just ludicrously entertaining and the 'is it a dream or is it real' premise puts such a wonderfully surreal twist on the whole thing. Sci-Fi has never been so outrageous. What do you expect with mad genius Dutchman directing? And I do believe that it IS real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tyrrany of the "One Truth"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never met Phil Dick, but I did correspond with him 40 years ago. This was well after he not only believed in parallel realities and truths as he had all his crazy life. He had chosen to simultaneously live in as many of them as he could reach. From these folded places, he wrote stories with woven realities.It was important to him that Deckard could be a replicant, and be more real than those not born immaculately. And with the story on which this was based, it was essential that there be three possibilities, each as likely and "truthful" as the others. Indeed, the possibility that they ALL are is what made this writer important.But alas, there are three people involved, among the dimmest in their respective trades. Piers Antony adapted the story. A well known science fiction writer of the time, he wrote stories for kids. Fantasy things that "made sense," instead of what is required here: real things that do not make sense, or rather make quantum sense.No one needs to say much about how Arnie turns a picture into animated furniture. Mildly more interesting is the shape of the trainwreck that is Paul Verhoeven. He may be a charming man, and seems charming in person. He surely seems to sell tickets. But he seems obsessed with making sense of a story. Here, there is one truth; Arnie's character discovers it and triumphs as a result. Gone is the scintillating ambiguity of Dick's creation.Verhoeven, if you don't know, at this time somehow inveigled himself into the Jesus Seminar as full, voting member! The Jesus Seminar was a response to the mess that the New Testament presents, having contradictory theology added over time to serve various agendas. The seminar attempted to use best scholarship to discover in this battleground the truth of the historical Jesus, a laudable goal. The method was to collect scholars ? real scholars ? and vote.Verhoeven somehow became a voting member, his presence as a "scholar" allowing ammunition for all sorts of critics. Just take the part of the story where this man was so obsessed with finding the single truth amidst ambiguities that he pulled strings to participate, even at the cost of jeopardizing the enterprise.He did that here as well.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit dated 20 years later, but an exciting action thriller with a strong core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Total Recall" might not be timeless as far as filmmaking goes, but it's certainly a hard movie to forget. "RoboCop" director Paul Verhoeven's take on the Phillip K. Dick story "We Can Remember it For You Wholesale" serves as the perfect snapshot of what late '80s America thought the future would look like -- a "Mad Max" society on Mars and lots of communicating video screens. Part of this memorability comes from cheap methods such as gross-out visual effects and three-breasted prostitutes, but credit also belongs to a story full of roller coaster twists.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Douglas Quaid, a man with a seemingly loving wife (Sharon Stone), who has vivid dreams about Mars, a planet that has been colonized by America and is at the center of a military controversy. Quaid becomes intrigued by a service that offers the implantation of vacation memories so that one can recall having been somewhere and experienced something without having to take the time to go through it. But instead of getting a nice vacation, the process goes wrong for Quaid and suddenly his friend at work and his wife are not who he thought they were -- and neither is he.Turns out Quaid was a skilled operative who had his memory tampered with previously and his "former self" sent him a message to go back to Mars because he has memories that hold the key to the undoing of the evil General Cohaagen who is oppressing those living on Mars.Mars is a circus sideshow in Las Vegas in this film. There's prostitution and horrendously scarred individuals. Oh, and dwarfs. Needless to say, the vision Verhoeven has for the future is not a very politically correct one and a bit excessive on vice and strangeness only for the sake of being just so. The meat of "Total Recall" lies not in the sci-fi future world the story takes place in, but more in the mystery of who Quaid (or Hauser) actually is.Schwarzenegger is still best suited for playing a machine or straight-up action hero not to be taken seriously, so "Total Recall" might not be the best fit, but he's probably better than most would give him credit for. He doesn't really hurt the film in any way.It seems like "Total Recall" was Verhoeven's attempt to make a visual effects spectacle because he simply had the money thanks to Arnold's star power. Although the story intrigues beyond a doubt, this is not the sci-fi thinker that "Blade Runner' was. Why else would there be so many special effects shots of people's faces puffing up in the vacuum of space? "Total Recall" would easily land on my list of decent films that could be remade and done better, particularly in terms of themes and social relevancy. In the late '80s, these effects were all the rage. Now that cinema has grown up and the average filmmaker with a bit of cash could make the effects of the film happen, it could actually survive as more than a thriller. Hard to blame a film 20 years outside of its context for doing something like that, so I think it just shows the potential for Dick's story to endure as a film.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Thrilling SCI-FI/Action Classic. Arnold Schwarznegger And Paul Verhoeven At Their Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is an excellent,thrilling SCI-FI/Action classic that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,intense Action,great special make-up and visual effects and a memorable score. All of those elements make Total Recall an unforgettable film that is Arnold Schwarnegger and Paul Verhoeven at their best.Based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick and set on Earth and Mars,Total Recall tells the story of Douglas Quaid(Arnold Scwarzenegger),a construction worker who goes to a place called Rekall that sells made up vacations in a machine. When things go wrong at Rekall,Quaid is sent on a Adventure that takes him from Earth to Mars.Total Recall is a brilliant and thrilling SCI-FI/Action film that teamed up Action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and Director Paul Verhoeven together and with the star power of Schwarzenegger and amazing over the the top Comic Book style of Verhoeven not only created a Box Office hit,but also created one of the most entertaining,memorable and unforgettable SCI-FI/Action movies ever made that re-watchable to this very day. For 113 minutes,Total Recall is an absolute blast and an Action packed thrill and roller coaster ride from start to finish,a movie that when the Action and Adventure starts it never ends and you as a viewer are going to have a ball. Total Recall is also futuristic film told in a big and large scale that is fast paced and never slows down going from Earth to Mars on a journey that is violent and bizarre,intense and mind blowing as well as awe-inspiring and at times darkly Humorous. We also have good guys,bad guys,deformed mutants and discussions of Alien civilization on Mars and everything in between. The movie is done in a style and way that only Vehoeven can do it. You can almost say that the style in Total Recall is pretty much an extension of Paul Verhoeven's early SCI-FI/Action classic Robocop(1987)which can make a great double bill with this film as both movies are dark and satirical visions of the future. I also love how the movie deals with themes such as identity,technology and dreams and also how the movie is questioning whether all of the events in Total Recall are really happening or are they in Quaid's mind. So while Total Recall is a Schwarzenegger film with a lot of Action it is much closer to other Phillip K. Dick adaptations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Steven Spielberg's Minority Report than one might think. The Action scenes in Total Recall are amazing,fast and done with an energy that keeps going whether it's gunfights,fist fights,explosions foot or car chases every Action scene grabs you by the throat. The Action and violence is classic Verhoeven with plenty of blood and gore that comes off of the screen and you will be thrilled or horrified at what you see. The main character Douglas Quaid is very a character in the Schwarzenegger mold: a Hero that is a man of Action,puns and one-liners. But in Total Recall Quaid is a character with some depth because when things start to go wrong he's questioning who he really is and wants to find out about his past and his possible future. While the Douglas Quaid character is similar to other Schwarzenegger characters it's a little different with this film. The ending of Total Recall is fantastic and dazzling with great visuals and has you asking questions wanting more. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent and at his best as Douglas Quaid,with Schwarzenegger bringing depth and charisma to the role. Rachel Ticotin is wonderful as Melina,a woman that helps Quaid. Sharon Stone is terrific as Lori,Doug's wife. Ronny Cox is delightful as Cohaagan,the ruler of Mars. Michael Ironside is fantastic as Ricther,a henchmen for Cohaagan. Marshall Bell(George/Kuato),Mel Johnson Jr.(Benny),Michael Champion(Helm),Dean Norris(Tony),Roy Brocksmith(Dr. Edgemar),Ray Baker(Bob McClane),Rosemary Dunsmore(Dr. Lull),David Knell(Ernie),Alexa Robinson(Tiffany),Robert Costanzo(Harry),Debbie Lee Carrington(Thumbelina),Lycia Naff(Mary),Marc Alamo(Everett)and Pricilla Allan(Fat Lady)give good performances as well.The direction by Paul Verhoeven is terrific,with Verhoeven moving the camera and keeping the film flowing with energy. Outstanding direction,Verhoeven. THThe score by Jerry Goldsmith is sensational,epic and powerful,with Goldsmith's score going with the Action perfectly. Amazing score,Goldsmith.The Special and Practical Make-up Effects by Rob Bottin are stunning,well-done and is among his best work. Terrific make-up effects,Bottin. The Visual Effects are also incredible and truly adds to the film.In final word,if you love Arnold Schwarzenegger,Paul Verhoeven,Action or SCI-FI,I highly suggest you see Total Recall,an excellent and thrilling SCI-FI/Action classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Recall is one Arnold's best films and Paul Verhooven a cult Science Fiction action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is a 1990 American science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, and Sharon Stone. The film is loosely based on the Philip K. Dick story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale". and is definitely one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films from the early 90's. His acting performance is great and superb. Their is plenty of gore action and bloody violence in it.There may be people who overlook the Arnold Schwarzenegger performance in "Total Recall" - who think he isn't really acting. But the performance is one of the reasons the movie works so well. He isn't a superman this time, although he fights like one. He's a confused and frightened innocent, a man betrayed by the structure of reality itself. And in his vulnerability, he opens the way for "Total Recall" to be more than simply an action, violence and special effects extravaganza.There is a lot of action and violence in the movie, and almost every shot seems to embody some sort of special effect. This is one of the most complex and visually interesting science fiction movies in a long time. But the plot, based on a story by the great science fiction writer Phillip K. Dick, centers on an intriguing idea: What would happen if you could be supplied with memories? If your entire "past," right up until this moment, could be plugged into your brain, replacing the experiences you had really lived through? That's what seems to happen to Quaid, the Schwarzenegger character in "Total Recall," although at times neither he nor we can be quite sure. We meet him in a future world where he lives in a comfortable apartment with his loving blond wife, and goes off to work every day at a construction job. He life seems idyllic, but he keeps having these dreams about Mars - dreams that finally inspire him to sign up with a strange kind of travel agency that provides you with the memory of a vacation instead of a real one.What they do is, they strap you into a machine and beam the memories into your mind, so that it seems utterly convincing to you that you've been to Mars and done some dangerous spying there, and fallen in love with the brunet of your specifications (Quaid specifies she be "athletic, sleazy and demure"). Before long, sure enough, Quaid seems to be on Mars, involved in some secret-spy stuff, and in the arms of his custom-ordered brunet (Rachel Ticotin).Douglas Quaid is haunted by a recurring dream about a journey to Mars. He hopes to find out more about this dream and buys a holiday at Rekall Inc. where they sell implanted memories. But something goes wrong with the memory implantation and he remembers being a secret agent fighting against the evil Mars administrator Cohaagen. Now the story really begins and it's a roller-coaster ride until the massive end of the movie. Douglas Quaid is another solid memorable character played from Arnold Schwarzenegger he played the character like he was written on his skin. Beside playing Terminator James Cameron masterpiece The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) he gave us another best performance of his acting! This film is awesome and is my childhood favorite action Science Fiction flick about Mars and been double agent! They shouldn't make a remake and ruin it. There is the only one Total Recall that is from Total Recall (1990) and is Paul Verhoeven astonish masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>The Trilogy Needs Total Recall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) goes for virtual vacation memories of the planet Mars, an unexpected and harrowing series of events forces him to go to the planet for real, or does he?One could consider "Total Recall" part of a Philip K. Dick trilogy: Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report. With A Scanner Darkly and Paycheck (among others) creating an extended trilogy (you know, like Douglas Adams did). Total Recall is easily worthy of standing beside Blade Runner. And even as a stand-alone sci-fi film, it ranks as one of the better ones of the 1990s, if not all time.One of the great things about Total Recall is the ambiguous nature of the story. Is it a dream? A brain embolism? Reality? Any of these has evidence to support it and also to contradict it. And this is a strength for the movie.There is a certain absurdity with the special effects -- eyes bulging and whatnot when the people lose oxygen. In real life you would simply die in space, not explode. But at the same time this was somewhat amusing and a bit comical so it can be overlooked. Besides, coming from Rob Bottin ("The Thing"), the focus should be on the strengths of the makeup and effects and not the possible shortfalls.The casting was great. Arnold was a great choice, and no one else could be Quaid. Kurt Russell, Stallone, Swayze... these guys are great but not right for this part. And Sharon Stone was looking her best for this movie, and since her role seemed to be the sexpot wife who does little more than exercise and seduce her husband, that is a big endorsement.Clearly the best character was Benny the Cab Driver, played by Mel Johnson, Jr in his only notable role. He stole the scenes he was in with great comic timing and an interesting back-story. I was quite interested by how he went from being what could have been a minor background role to a primary figure in the overall plot. Exquisite.I guess I simply must recommend you see this movie. If you have not seen Blade Runner, watch that first. If you have not seen Minority Report, watch this first. But either way, be sure that you put this movie somewhere high on your to-do list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TOTAL RECALL is a Favorite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I love TOTAL RECALL. I read the short story by Phillip K. Dick (We Can Remember It For You Wholesale) 'way before the movie.I was in an OSHA HAZWOPER training class that used clips from the movie to illustrate numerous life-threatening hazards. COOL.TOTAL RECALL is a movie with two BIG stars (Arnold and Sharon) before they were BIG, Paul Vanhoevan as director, and story inspired by Phillip K. Dick.The production has a lot more "look" to it than you would expect from the period, pre-computer graphics. TOTAL RECALL continue to echo today. I just watched a SOUTH PARK with a reference: "Quaid, start the generators."Philip K. Dick also inspired BLADE RUNNER, again one of my 5 favorite SF movies.Of course, I own a copy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the ideology of total recall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is of course, one of arnold's best typical kind of films, contains lots of violence, lots of good one liners, beautiful women, and arnold saves the day.at another level, it presents an interesting hollywood narrative that is rare as most hollywood films simply go on to say the system works or that the system is fine but individuals mess it up. the film presents rebels who are of course labelled as 'terrorists' by the media and the state (reminds me slightly of the situation in Chechnya and Central America in the 80's). However, through the course of the film we learn that the corporate presumably american interests are corrupt and evil and that the rebels are actually fighting for something meaningful. Bringing the atmosphere of Mars back so that the people can have freedom from Coohagen. In the end, the rebels suffer some defeat but achieve their victory, uncomprimised.This narrative is quite radical for hollywood and I found it to be quite impressive. Much more than the conclusion of the Matrix Trilogy which basically concluded that social forces cannot achieve ultimate victory, and that the system eventually remains in place and that comprimise can only be achieved. This film is perhaps saying that dissent and rebellion can achieve something and make the world better. Something that is rarely a meaning in Hollywood films.However, on another level, as someone else commented earlier, this could be all a dream as small hints were dropped throughout the film. In the end such ideas are just fantasies and unattainable, perhaps some recuperation could be existing there. Meaning that the film remains fail-safe in that the status-quo is maintained. In that case, quite sad.Even in that case, it presents an interesting point of view that is not always present in Hollywood films. Perhaps critical thought can occur from watching these films, about, say corporate power? I'm definitely looking for the next film by Paul Verhoeven to see what social commentary is contained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold really excels in this sci-fi thriller. director Paul Verhoeven spent $100 million on this i believe, but it was worth it. the film did ok in the box office i think, and has been praised thoroughly since.Doug Quaid goes to a memory journey type place, where he is able to go on a holiday in his mind, virtual reality. anyway events conspire to reveal to him that the life he is living and believes is true, and his memories, are nothing more then a cover. He decides to go and find out why, and what the truth is and regain his memories. His search takes him to Mars!the special effects make the world seem plastic but are also very good, and mars is great. the music is very apt for this film. It even adds to the fun. the one liners are great, the fighting scenes are fast paced and enjoyable, and the plot is interesting and keeps you guessing. the acting is good and the whole film is a classic. Verhoevens plastic world reappeared in Starship troopers, but that film, this and Robocop are three of the best action movies of all time. and this film really packs a punch! suspend your belief for 2 hours and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly entertaining but still cliche sci-fi shootfest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall was a huge hit back in the summer of 1990 and it still is one of my favorite Arnold movies. I remember talking about it at school after everybody saw it. The directing is very ordinary but is also over-the-top and comical at times. That comes as no surprise since it is the same director who helmed "Robocop" and "Starship Troopers". If you're an Arnold fan then Total Recall will definitely keep you glued to the TV. I consider this movie as one of the last good action flicks that was made prior to 1990 (since it was filmed in 1989). It does not have good acting, but give it a break, hardly any action movies ever do. The music is very good and composed by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The story is average and unbelievably sloppy. I give 'Recall' a 5 for the directing. A 6 for the script. A 5 for the acting. An 8 for the visuals and set designs. And a 9 for the music and sound. Overall, it is a gets a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the science-fiction novelists of the 20th century, few have been as prolific or influential on modern fiction and film as Philip K. Dick. The author of 44 novels and 121 short stories, Dick explored the possibility of reality being a vast illusion subjective to man's perceptions. Dick, heavily influenced by Carl Jung, utilized his concepts of collective unconscious and group projection frequently. Plans to bring Dick's 1966 short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale" surfaced when Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett (the writers of Alien) bought the rights to the story. The project languished in development hell until legendary producer Dino De Laurentiis took interest in it in the mid-1980s, though it was similarly shelved when another De Laurentiis science-fiction picture, "Dune," flopped spectacularly. The project's potential was finally realized when, after the collapse of De Laurentiis's company, action star Arnold Schwarzenegger prompted Carolco Pictures to purchase the film rights for $3 million. Schwarzenegger immediately recruited director Paul Verhoeven, whose film Robocop Schwarzenegger greatly admired, to head the project. A partnership between Paul Verhoeven and Arnold Schwarzenegger is hardly a recipe for sophistication and wit, but could they produce something beyond the "big, dumb action movie" that Schwarzenegger built his reputation on? Surprisingly, yes. And they did so by bringing the themes built into Dick's work to the forefront. In some undisclosed future, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger) is an average Joe with a beautiful wife (Sharon Stone) and a job as a construction worker who dreams of visiting Mars. Unable to afford the trip, he visits the Rekall company, which implants a vivid memory of a vacation into clients' heads for a modest fee. Things become complicated when Quaid's dream vacation, which involves him working as a secret agent on Mars, turns out to already be real, buried deep inside his mind. Turns out that Douglas Quaid is a completely fictionalized identity implanted into the brain of secret agent "Hauser." His wife Lori is not even his real wife: she is actually the lover of Richter (Michael Ironside), the man who is leading the team that is now trying to exterminate him. Left with a suitcase full of money, a few gadgets, and a video message from Hauser telling him to "get his ass to Mars," Quaid sets out to bring down his former boss Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) and figure out just who the hell he is. The most troubling aspect of the story is the casting of Schwarzenegger as an "average" man. Take Die Hard: the film was originally conceived as a vehicle for Schwarzenegger. By casting Bruce Willis as John McClane instead, the film gained a whole new dynamic, and Die Hard became a story of an average man foiling a terrorist plot, rather than joining the ranks of other mediocre superhero action star flicks. With Total Recall, the reverse is true: the story was originally conceived with the intent of having a more "ordinary" everyday man in the lead. It makes a hell of a lot more sense than having the Herculean Schwarzenegger in the part. It's a testament to Schwarzenegger, however, that the film didn't devolve into another action flick: having unsuccessfully vied for the role when the project was still being headed by De Laurentiis, he was determined to make the film something special. He exercised a great deal of creative control during the entire production, persuading the studio to adhere to Verhoeven's vision when necessary. To his credit, Schwarzenegger does try his best to flesh out a new type of character for himself; it's simply unfortunate that his thick Austrian accent and incredible physique prevent him from flexing any sort of acting chops.Schwarzenegger's presence does not ruin the film, thanks to the slick direction of Verhoeven and a screenplay that makes use of the themes of Dick's work. In fact, Total Recall may be the best expression of Dick's work I've ever seen put to celluloid. The best example of this takes place during one of the film's most memorable scenes. Quaid is visited by Dr. Edgemar, the inventor of Rekall, and Lori at his hideout on Mars. Edgemar tells Quaid that everything he has been experiencing so far is a part of the "trip" that he paid for, and that he isn't even on Mars at all: he is really just back at Rekall headquarters. The "vacation" Quaid paid for, Edgemar says, has gone wrong, and Quaid's experiences are all a part of paranoid delusions taking place within his mind. When Quaid dismisses this, Edgemar responds with what is possibly the most amazing example of meta ever committed to film:"What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid? That you're having a paranoid episode triggered by acute neurochemical trauma? Or that you're really an invincible secret agent from Mars who's the victim of an interplanetary conspiracy to make him think he's a lowly construction worker?"The audience is forced to question the truth as well: despite the fact that we are not part of the events on screen, we are still susceptible to the same illusions that any of the characters are.This represents one of the reasons I love Paul Verhoeven as a director: despite the fact that his films come across on the surface as pointless exercises in extreme violence, there is substance behind it all. In Starship Troopers limbs came off left and right, but the message that "war makes fascists of us all" was clear throughout. In Robocop, the violence never superseded the various critiques of capitalism and corruption. With Total Recall, the concept of the very nature of reality as subject to question exists even as a midget prostitute stabs a man in the groin. With this film I am allowed to revel in the extreme violence and action that puts it in the category of "big, dumb action movie" while, at the same time, I can appreciate the deeper psychological questions inspired by Dick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Schwarzenegger film with a brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of Phillip K. Dick's stories have been adapted into films and a number of them been turned into excellent films. One of them is the 1990 version of Total Recall, a gruesome violent, entertaining sci-fi action flick with plenty of substance.In the future Dennis Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is construction worker on Earth, longing for more and having recurring dreams of being on Mars with a brunette woman. When he watches an advert for Rekall, a company that can implant memories into people. But the worst happens when during the Rekall process Quaid freaks out and it is discovered his memory has been wiped. Even worst many people are out to kill Quaid, including his wife, Lori (Sharon Stone), his co-worker (Robert Costanzo) and a man called Ritchter (Michael Ironside). Quaid has to go to Mars to discover the truth about his identity as Mars is in the middle of a violence Civil War.Total Recall was directed by Paul Verhoeven and he is a man with a reputation for making action films with substance. That is certainly the cast with Total Recall and it worked on a number of levels: it is a mystery about who Quaid really is and as a futuristic spy flick, a bleak sci-fi film which acts as a criticism of big corporations and exploiting native people or the underclass and the health effects on them to simply being a gore-fest. Verhoeven is great the world building, showing the political situation of Mars.Total Recall is brutally violent and it is a shame that this type of film is no longer made. There are great action sequences that are bloody, with people getting shot to pieces and has excellent gun battles and fight scenes. There is a great use of practical effects during the film whilst also using some early CGI which surprisingly holds up today.Schwarzenegger is not the best actor but he has screen presence and he can deliver a one-line. When the material is there to back Schwarzenegger up there is no stopping him. Schwarzenegger was also supported by a fine cast, including Ronny Cox and Ironside in villainous roles, Stone in one of her best roles and Rachel Ticotin was very good as both the love interest and a woman of action.Jerry Goldsmith supplied an iconic score for the film with a memorial theme.Total Recall is a classic sci-fi that has aged very well. It is successful both on an action level and on a more thematic and intelligent level. It is to me the best Arnie film outside the Terminator series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total recall came out in 1990 and was another hit for it's leading man Arnold Schwarzenegger. Again Schwarzenegger choose to enter the world of science fiction coupled with action as he had previous success with The Terminator, The Running Man, and Predator. Arnold sort out the services of the impressive Dutch Director Paul Verhoeven whom had success with 1987's Robocop. Verhoeven was not a science fiction director, however his greatest films have all been set in the science fiction genre.The great thing about Verhoeven as a director is he always asks questions of his audience, and makes them think about the message he is putting across in all his films. His films do use excessive graphic content and nudity, so he is not for everyone. It is almost like comic book violence at times. The 80s action films audience expected graphic violence, as we entered the 90s action films would steadily use less graphic violence Total Recall is set in the future and is about the character Douglas Quiad (Schwarzenegger) or is it? Quaid is a construction worker who keeps dreaming of mars. He can not convince his wife, played by the very sexy Sharon Stone to go on holiday to mars. So Quiad takes matters into his own hands and goes for a implanted memory of a holiday to mars. As Quiad awakes he thinks that people are coming to kill him, but is he just living his implanted memory or not? Does he really have a previous life and his identity as Douglas Quaid is just a set up. As like most of the science fiction films around at this time for example Terminator 2, it is filled with original ideas and makes it a intelligent plot line and can be thought of as deeply as the viewer feels necessary or just enjoyed as a action film. Action films these days seem to have lost the plot when it comes to over use of cgi at the expense of a good story. Total Recall is good thinking man's science fiction film and is highly recommended, kudos to the film makers and Arnold Schwarzenegger for making this film possible as a large budgeted film with star backing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Sci-Fi: Certifiably Crazy, with a Thoughtful Undercurrent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, this is really one of the strangest films out there, in my opinion. On one hand, it is obviously a Schwarzenegger star vehicle, directed by the characteristically over-the-top Paul Verhoeven, a ludicrous gore-fest featuring no shortage of cheap thrills. On the other hand, it is a seriously conceptual science fiction trip, and however much it may depart from the Phillip K. Dick source material on which it is based, it still is a genuinely good, thoughtful story at its heart.It opens with a beautiful, mysterious scene on Mars, but soon finds itself back on Earth, with Arnold and his crazy reptilian facial expressions, going 21st-century schizoid man on any number of enemies that he finds coming out of the woodwork to get him. Along the way, there is a lot of (obviously fake) blood, a lot of people dying dramatically, a lot of product placement, and plenty of shameless exploitation of all sorts of things.But somehow, it never becomes disposable. From the word go, Schwarzenegger's title character is one worth caring about, and as the overall plot gradually reveals itself, one can easily become quite engrossed in it. This is not a film without real emotion. There is plenty of drama, a truly big, epic climax and a surprisingly artistic final frame.There are two specific elements in TOTAL RECALL that I think bear mentioning. First, the excellent visual depictions of the planet Mars. I am referring to the *exteriors* where, whatever the filmmaking techniques used, a very evocative picture is painted of another world, both romantic and bleak at the same time.The second thing is the performance of Rachel Ticotin. Her depiction of the character Melina makes this film far better and more watchable that it would have been otherwise. I cannot overstate that. I found myself looking her up to see what else she had acted in. In a film full of performances that are effective but most of them laughable nonetheless, Ticotin is really, seriously believable. For me, she is the heart. (Not Sharon Stone.)I do not know how much I actually like this film. But it is an undeniably entertaining watch, with some interesting ideas about the future and no lack of visual craziness. It is far more violent than I had anticipated, so definitely not for everyone. Also, it is a bit dated when viewed in the present (2013), but not nearly so much as many other films from its era. I give it 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, Violent, Mind-Twisting Martian Espionage Science-Fiction Action Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doug Quaid is having vivid dreams about Mars. He goes to Rekall, a company that sells fake memory implants, but has a psychotic reaction to the treatment. Suddenly, he is being attacked and assisted on all sides by secret-agents, his wife turns out to be an imposter and he seems to hold the key to some great secret buried in an ancient Martian mine. Is he really a spy, or is he suffering from a massive paranoid fantasy delusion ?Reportedly the most expensive film ever made at the time, Total Recall is a mind-bending, bone-crunching action thriller set in some vague future, with a great script by Dan O'Bannon and producer Ronald Shusett. In some ways it's a formulaic picture, with the predictable car-chases, fights and impossible escapes every ten minutes, but in others it's a wildly disorienting alternate reality, as Doug is forced to question his own existence. In one of the best scenes, the villains attempt (and almost succeed) to convince Doug he's living in an elaborate hallucination, before resorting to more traditional methods. Even the familiar elements are terrific, due to the futuristic setting (infuriating computerised minicabs, a tricky hologram, a fabulous Martian colony base) and Rob Bottin's gleefully twisted comic-book mutations, which include a fake head within another fake head and a pivotal character who lives in the stomach of another. Big Arnie does his usual likable bluster in the lead, but the best performances are the husband and wife of Stone as a sharp-suited villainess and Ironside as an implacable but uninformed henchman, with Cox managing to be even more vicious than he was in Verhoeven's preceding Robocop. Also noteworthy are Eric Brevig's marvellous visual effects, with some pioneering digital work (the nail-painter, the swooping shots through the huge secret generator), and a top-notch rousing score by Jerry Goldsmith that blasts everything along with booming brass and cracking percussion. Following the success of The Terminator, Schwarzenegger made six big-budget science-fiction films, all of which are good but none of which are quite as good, but this one is topper excessive entertainment and probably the best of the runners-up. Based on the short story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, by the highly influential science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This motion picture was surely, in my opinion, inspired by short story "Total recall" by Phillip K. Dick. I have read it and I can tell that the movie has only caught up the general idea from there. There is the retold short story:Douglas Quaid is a simple worker (his wife is his wife, not an undercover agent, as in movie) who is obsessed about going on Mars (because this some time after his wife leaves him for good). Knowing he is a poor man and trying to do something about it, he goes to "Total Recall" , a company for artificial voyages. There he talks with Mc.... (as in movie, appears that names have been taken literally); before he talks to receptionist (we are told she is blonde =&gt; white , not black , as in movie). Things goes wrong; he is discovered, under narcosis, as past agent of Interplan (as he wished to be in the dream voyage to be implanted in his memory) and the guys at Total Recall put him in a taxi. He wakes in cab , finds half of money owed for imaginary voyage in his pocket and soon begin to remember what happened at Total Recall; then he asks and get all the money he has payed (of course is angry and frustrated). On way home he starts to remember that he was a real agent; at home 2 armed officers (one of them has a ear device that let him hear Quaid's thoughts; the Interplan had implanted a living creature in Quaid's brain who can transmit thoughts). Douglas Quaid soon increasingly remembers all that happened on Mars and his past training and abilities, officer want to kill him, does not succeed (Quaid already knew how to fight) and Quaid escapes outside. After some conversation in his mind with someone from Interplan (through that living device in his brain), he (catching at his last chance of survival) decides to go to an Interplan facility and let their specialists study him to see if a false memory could be implanted over his yearning wish to go to Mars (if none could be found, he agrees that must be killed); a fantasy dating from his child times is found and they choose that. He is taken to Total Recall to proceed (receptionist is described as having her naked big bosoms dyed in orange) and here , examining his memory , they found that the fantasy (in childhood he saw an alien spaceship landing in front of him, the only who could see them; that ship had beings as big as mice, but bound to conquer Earth; that ship was only first, more thousand will follow; after a discussion with alien beings, they were touched and decided not to invade Earth as long as he lives) was real and Quaid, as he says proudly, is the most important human being on Earth. The short story ends with the advice to the Interplan not to kill him; otherwise the alien invasion would begin, bringing destruction to all Earth civilization.</fullReview>

After doing a good job setting up Quaid's motivation to go to Mars and getting the characters together; the movie does a great job of throwing in a killer plot twist. However it is as this plot twist is being resolved that the movie loses it creditability. Once the Alien air-making machine is put into action realism would dictate that every structure on the planet would be leveled. Just imagine the effect of taking a structure built to handle the near vacuum of the Martian atmosphere and suddenly hitting it with 15 lbs per square inch of weight. The Alien machine, to work properly in the movie would take several weeks to create a Martian atmosphere. And that means that Quaid dies after being sucked out of the airshaft. Even if we look at that scene, think of the incredible damage that would have been done to Quaid's body. He would never be the same. What saddens me is these are small plot points that could have been dealt with properly had the director and screenwriter taken some time to do so. Had they done so, this would be an undeniable instant Sci-Fi classic, instead of a good movie with a hoaky ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie's seeing red.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time the 90's rolled around, action films just didn't get any better than Arnold Schwarzenegger. And when it came to sci-fi and action directors, Paul Verhoeven was certainly at the top of his game. Naturally, the two came together for "Total Recall," a unique sci-fi/action-hero story that finds everybody's favorite Austrian on the red planet, battling mutants, struggling with his identity and crusading on behalf of those in need of some clean, breathable and ? most importantly ? free air.Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (whose work has made it to the big screen also in the form of "Minority Report" and "Blade Runner," to name a few), "Total Recall" is a landmark both for its stunning visual effects as well as its non-stop pace and over-the-top action. Arnie is in top form as the everyday man who exchanges routine and security for confusion and paranoia when a vacation company toys with his mind. Rekall, the company in question, will implant a memory ? for a price ? that will make you think you had an incredible vacation (or in this case, an action-packed adventure that will satisfy all your wildest cravings) when it was all just a pricey dream. Unfortunately, things go very wrong very quickly for our hero. His wife (Sharon Stone) turns against him, as it turns out she is a secret agent who has been spying on him throughout their marriage. In turn, he finds himself being chased by a gang of cronies -- led by Michael Ironside -- to what appears to be his home planet, where he hooks up with an ex-lover (Rachel Ticotin) and makes acquaintances with a three-breasted prostitute, a cab-driver with bad teeth and a really grotesque and unappealing mutant (who can also be seen in the "Aspen" episode of "South Park"). Is it real, is it a dream? What makes this film truly genius and leaves room for many a repeat viewing is that, in the end, it's totally up to the viewer.Verhoeven throws everything AND the kitchen sink at his film. "Total Recall" is as chock-full of mind-games as it is action, and is possibly the man's finest film to date. Even today, 19 years (!) later, it still holds up, both in its story and in its visuals. Those seeking some escapism but with a film that carries as much brain as it does brawn, can do no wrong with "Total Recall." One of the finest from one of the greatest action heroes of our time and one of the most under-rated directors in his time. Spawned from the film was a short-lived TV series as well as a classic musical parody, titled "Total Recallin'" ? set to the tune of Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" -- which can be found on any video-viewing website.</fullReview>

With more story to chew on than a lot of Arnie flicks, this film is a lot more than your average action movie.Quaid (Schwarzenegger) takes a trip to Recall, where you can have a holiday implanted in your mind, and take a vacation from yourself too. When Quaid asks for holiday on Mars as a Secret agent, he begins a psychotic episode before the trip is implanted, and it turns out he really is a secret agent and he is involved in a major conspiracy and has had his memory erased. Or at least that's how it appears?The great thing about the film is it lets you decide for yourself if it really was a dream, or was Quaid really there?8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" See you at the party Richter".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think Hollywood has ever made a movie with a more confusing plot. How come nuclear weapons haven't destroyed Earth in this on-going World War 3? Why is Richter trying to kill Quaid? Why does Cohagen care so much about "air" when he's making shed-loads of money from exporting Trabidium? Who governs "the northern block"? Is the film real, or is Quaid simply on his ego-trip? That and many more. But none of this matters. The film is hugely entertaining and the enthusiasm of the cast + the black humour cover over all the plot holes. I'd say that next to T2 and Kindergarten Cop this is Arnie's third best movie, he was excellent in the role of a man who doesn't know what the hell's going on, except that he has to keep moving. Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside were delicious as the lead villains &amp; I'm STILL whistling the tune whistled by the JohnnyCab robot taxi driver. Ray Baker is also great in a minor role as Bob McClane, a high-pressure holiday salesman. My only real criticism is Sharon Stone. Her acting in this film is frankly not very good. That aside, it's wonderful. "See you at the party Richter" is my favourite of ALL Schwarzenegger's movie lines, but you'll have to watch Total Recall almost to the end to see why. 8 out of 10,I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I was about 12 years old I used to watch this movie a lot and it had a strange effect on me because it is so bizarre and so violent, but I couldn't tear my eyes away. Also, that woman with three boobs was enough for me to sit through the rest of the movie just to see again!It takes place in a dismal future where colonies have long since arisen and decayed on other planets and mutations are as rampant as corruption. Schwarzenegger plays a construction worker named Douglas Quaid who has recurring dreams about a trip to Mars and a mysterious brunette there. His hottie wife (Sharon Stone) is unimpressed by this brunette who keeps turning up in her husband's dreams, but mostly he just can't get over this strange need to go to Mars. I have to say, however, that based on his dream, which we see at the beginning of the movie in which he falls down a hill and breaks his face mask and then his eyes pop out of his head, doesn't exactly seem like the kind of thing that would make me want to go to that place, but no matter. The movie really gets going as soon as Quaid goes to a company called Rekall that sells implanted memories, so basically you can travel anywhere you want to go in the world and be anyone you want. There's no danger because you never leave the Rekall offices, but there's always the chance of an accidental lobotomy. Almost immediately after hooking him up to their machines, he wakes up a completely different person, convinced that he is no longer a happily married construction worker but a secret agent on the run from an evil dictator of Mars named Cohaagen. At this point all hell breaks loose and the movie gets really good. It's a little confusing, but for the thickness of the plot it's amazing how well presented it is. Quaid is suddenly unsure who he really is, and when at one point he is receiving instructions from his other self, the self on the other side of the Rekall implantation, about how to remove a tracking device from his nose (in one of the movie's most memorable moments), it doesn't make things any easier for him to understand. There are tons of great characters, impressive sets, amazing special effects and brilliant performances despite the occasional cheese moment (such as that bizarre mutant at the end chanting "Open your miiiiiind?.." over and over). Read Volume 2 of my 50 Amazing Movie Facts on Hollywire and you'll know what I really mean. The movie has the same brutal feeling as RoboCop, and director Paul Verhoeven has really shown that he knows how to do action sci-fi. This is definitely one of the genre's best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall is set in the future where interplanetary space travel is a reality, on Earth lowly construction worker Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has strange dreams involving Mars &amp; decides to go to a company called Rekall who implant virtual memories of holidays in peoples minds. Doug ask's for a complete set of memories for a trip to Mars, the implant goes wrong &amp; Doug has a violent reaction. The guy's at Rekall put him in a cab &amp; send him away, then Doug's day goes from bad to worse when his friend from work tries to kill him, his wife (Sharon Stone) tries to kill him too &amp; he learns that the evil ruler of Mars Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) has wiped his memory &amp; dumped him on Earth. As Doug struggles to discover his own identity he is thrown into a war between Cohaagen &amp; rebel terrorists on Mars as people try to kill him left, right &amp; center, but which side is he working for &amp; why...Directed by Paul Verhoeven I'll get straight to the point &amp; say that I think Total Recall is a brilliant sci-fi actioner &amp; easily one of Schwarzenegger's best films. The script by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon &amp; Gary Goldman was based on the short story 'We Can Remember it For You Wholesale' by famed sci-fi writer Philip K.Dick is a surprisingly intelligent &amp; thoughtful sci-fi story with all the bangs, shoot-outs &amp; violence associated with director Verhoeven &amp; star Schwarzenegger which complement each other better than one might expect. The film moves along at a nice pace, it's never boring &amp; the story is intricate &amp; complex enough to keep you alert &amp; concentrating, this is far from the by-the-numbers one man army action flick that Schwarzenegger is known for. The film manages to keep you guessing, it's well written enough to have several potential outcomes &amp; it manages to make yourself doubt whether what's happening is real or just a complete dream. Of course this being an action flick there's plenty of it &amp; Total Recall is also a very violent film, this is the type of 90's flick where it is necessary to use excessive force &amp; gory violence at all times. The character's are interesting, the dialogue is good with some typical Schwarzenegger one liners like saying 'consider that a divorce' after shooting his wife in the head! I don't know what else to say really, Total Recall is just a great film with loads of violence, nudity, fights, memorable villains &amp; a surprisingly good sci-fi plot that you need to see for yourself.Apparently David Cronenberg was originally set to direct but eventual director Verhoeven does a fine job here, he is his usual uncompromising self as Total Recall is packed full of gore, mutant freak hookers, midget hookers, nudity &amp; general excess. He doesn't know the meaning of the word subtle &amp; that's just another reason why I love Total Recall so much. The special effects are very impressive, from expansive shots of the Martian landscape to huge reactors under the surface of Mars this looks good even now. The Jonnycab scenes are hilarious, the futuristic vision created here seems plausible &amp; as such the film hasn't dated at all although if I was being picky why weren't the glass used for domes on Mars bullet proof &amp; where were the security services as Quaid &amp; Victor shoot at each other in the subway? What happened to the guy's behind the desk watching the X-ray machine? They had guns, where did they go? In the mid 80's the story which Total Recall was based upon was brought by Italian hack producer Dino de Laurentiis, he tried to make the film starring Patrick Swayze &amp; directed by Bruce Beresford &amp; sets were actually built in Australia but the shoot was cancelled when de Laurentiis' company went bankrupt &amp; that's when Schwarzenegger stepped in &amp; convinced the brass at Carolco to buy the script &amp; let him star.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Total Recall looks the business, it's sets, special effects, production design, rousing music by Jerry Goldsmith are all top notch although Rob Bottin's special make-up effects are strangely average &amp; don't bear close scrutiny. Shot in Mexico all of the cast &amp; crew went down with food poisoning expect Schwarzenegger who had his food specially flown in from the US... The acting is pretty good, Schwarzenegger is OK, Sharon Stone looks nice while Ronny Cox &amp; Michael Ironside play their bad guy roles with relish.Total Recall is just a totally fantastic film, it's more than just an Arnie shoot-em-up, it has neat sci-fi ideas behind it, plenty of excess violence &amp; is just a great film. Definitely recommended. Followed by the TV series Total Recall 2070 (1999) which ran for 22 episodes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is on TV in the UK on some sort of cycle, and I end up seeing parts of it every two months or so, and every time you see it you pick out new things. I think this was the third time I'd seen the start; they really didn't want him to go to Mars, did they? Fifteen years on the effects don't really look that dated, which is a bit of surprise. In honesty it doesn't use too many bar the mutant freakshow and the comic head-expanding at the end, but it's hard to recall other sci-fi's from the early nineties that haven't aged terribly. The storyline doesn't have a lot of depth and isn't going to inspire a new generation of science fiction writers, and the acting isn't particularly subtle, but it's great. After all, it's Arnie. He beats people up, some things explode, drops in a few hammed up one liners, and he keeps us entertained. What more can you ask for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Recall (1990)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven has spawned an entire genre of his own: movies that take themselves seriously but don't expect their audience to take them seriously (we hope). Some might find this concept amusing (which would explain why a piece of garbage like Showgirls has such a big cult following ... although I'm sure that all the gratuitous sex and nudity helped out, as well), but I simply see no point to it. However, I'm willing to set my personal dislike of Verhoeven aside for a second and attempt to give an objective review of his 1990 sci-fi action thriller, Total Recall. And objectively speaking, this movie stinks. It's just not a good movie. And what's worse is that it's an especially bad movie. While at times I suppose the ludicrousness of the entire thing is mildly funny, most of the time it's just, well, ludicrous. Bad acting, bad script, bad filming, bad effects. Bad, bad, bad. It's really the only word that can adequately describe this joke of a film. Based upon "We Can Remember it For You Wholesale," yet another brilliant Philip K. Dick short story is turned into mush when in the wrong hands. And in this case, those hands belong to Verhoeven (Starship Troopers, Hollow Man), a man known for distributing such words of wisdom as "I love nudity and violence." I mean, why would this NOT be the perfect guy to make a movie out of a concept by the same man who gave Ridley Scott (and us) the brilliantly existential Blade Runner? Well, if I need to answer that question for you, I'd recommend you stop reading this review right now. As for what exactly is so bad about Total Recall, where does one begin? I suppose it would be easy to take potshots at Schwarzenegger for yet another monosyllabic performance, but he's really the least of the bad things in it (after all, it's not HIS fault he's the way he is; and it worked to his advantage in the first two Terminator movies). However, the rest of the cast has no excuse for delivering a terrible performance. The script -- which, having had SIX screenwriters, leaves me to wonder which one thought Schwarzenegger would look good in a turban, and whether he was the same genius that came up with Ronny Cox's brilliant line, "I'll blow this place up and be home in time for corn flakes!" -- is just tragic. I mean, when someone is getting a killed with a large drill while the hero is screaming "screw you," it transcends kitsch and enters the realm of the unforgivably bad. And those are just a few of the millions of unimaginably terrible lines of dialogue dispersed throughout the entire feature. As for the effects, you really have to see them to believe them. I've seen better special effects in a Muppets movie. But perhaps the worst facet of the whole movie is that it genuinely thinks it's smart. There's a line in Mel Brooks' seminal comedy, The Producers, that follows an encounter with a man in drag who introduces himself with, "Mr. Byalistock and Bloom, I presume; forgive the pun." Gene Wilder turns to Zero Mostel and asks, "What pun?" to which Mostel replies, "Shut up; he thinks he's witty." I can just see Verhoeven and his six screenwriters sitting around a table and remarking on how brilliant the concept (which has something to do with dreams and implanted memories) is, when it's really just mush. And in the end, the entire movie is mush. And it's bad mush, at that. Maybe if it had a good sense of humor about how bad it was, it could have worked as a guilty pleasure. But instead it comes off more like Sean Young auditioning for Tim Burton as Cat Woman: it's just sad. There's a scene towards the end of Total Recall in which Cox delivers yet another ingenious bit of dialogue: "You're nothing, you're nobody, you're a stupid dream. Well, all dreams come to an end." Well, I felt the same way about this movie. Only I worried that it would never come to an end.Grade: D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the weakest sugar-coated sci-fi attempts from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Predator" and "Terminator" are good. "Commando" is funny and cool. "RoboCop" is great. But this one is a turkey, neither cool nor funny, neither good nor ultimately bad. It pretends to be something valuable. But such elements as the fighting between the main hero and his "wife" with "picturesque" martial arts moves, stupid taxi service with that cheap talking driver-doll that tries to joke, bits of action without proper "set piece" as a big macho is running, jumping, and killing some mutants and security guards, while trying to save the planet (is it a video-game? then where is the joystick?), pretentious performance and dialogues backed up by violence (remember the evil character shooting a lady in the bar just to show them who's the boss and his face expressions), too many trash-talking characters - especially mutants - making it all look hectic like some crowd scenes of "Star Wars" are ruining it, at least to me. Even a greatly executed (visually) scene with the talking female cyber-mask, which blows the whole place off, cannot save it all. When I witness such things, I am not interested in the plot. It is just another eye-candy from Hollywood - it can be mind-blowing (and perhaps it really is) but I don't care what happens next. If you can appreciate all those super-entertaining details, then it is possibly a movie for you. I cannot. "What a waste of everything" is the only phrase that comes to my mind.Just one parallel to mention here. Does anybody remember the PD shoot-out scene in "Terminator" or any shooting scene in "RoboCop"? The backgrounds for those scenes were overwhelming. The shootouts looked real and serious. They were kind of "fortissimo". And even after repeated viewing I watch them with some sort of awe. And what do we have here? It all looks like a cheap "catch-me-if-you-can" game that just goes on and on till the finale. Cannot call any separate action scene even "mezzo-forte".Maybe I'm completely wrong and it is just the choice of effects, actors, and one-liners, which are to blame.Anyhow, I do not want to recall this "Total Recall" because it does not worth it. The only reason I type this comment is that I disagree with the film's high rating. It is to be 5 out of 10 at most. "RoboCop" (1987) is worth a thousandth buy (great job, Mr Paul Verhoeven) while "Total Recall" is not worth even a second look (can't believe it is the same Mr Paul Verhoeven behind this production).3 out of 10 (to watch once is more than enough). Thanks for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More dull than you would expect from Schwarzenegger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* and 1/2 stars out of ****I like Arnold Schwarzenegger and his movies. He may never win an Oscar, but he knows how to crank out entertaining cinema, with thrilling action films like the Terminator movies, True Lies, and even End of Days. I, however do not like director Paul Verhoeven, who has the tendency to take good ideas and screw them up. Total Recall is a film full of intriguing, and even marvelous, ideas. It's only unfortunate that nothing too significant is done with these ideas.Memories. It's an intriguing concept because it seems to define who we are. Without them, we just wouldn't be ourselves. This is the backdrop of Total Recall, which is probably a far better setup than the film deserves. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker who lives a seemingly happy life far in the future. He has a lovely wife (Sharon Stone) and a good home.But, lately, he's been having dreams about a dark-haired woman (Rachel Ticotin), with the both of them on the planet Mars, which is currently turmoil because of a megalomaniac (Ronny Cox). Then, Quaid decides to go to Rekall, Inc., a company that lets you experience a fantasy world. His recent dreams have compelled him to go through with this fanatasy. But just as he's about to begin the "vacation", something goes wrong and he's thrown out of the building.More problems begin to occur as everybody Quaid knows seems to be after him, even his wife. He eventually begins to believe that all his memories are false, and his search for his true identity leads him to Mars and the dark-haired woman of his dreams.Yes, the plot sounds interesting, and the added mercenaries that are after him seem like it would give them a pace that speeds along, but it really doesn't. After a very absorbing first half hour, everything starts to go downhill from there. The action scenes simply aren't exciting, just gory and gruesome, something typical of Verhoeven. Sometimes, the choreography can even get downright laughable. Thinking of that, I am reminded of the endless kicks to the crotch that Stone delivers to Schwarzenegger, which looks more goofy than anything else. Now, Verhoeven can direct superb action scenes (i.e. Starship Troopers) but his work here is rather lackluster, as is his handling with the script.The reasons behind the lack of excitement could lie in the fact that Schwarzenegger never really seems all that scared. He initially tries that, but as soon as the film sets on Mars, he acts very cocky, like he could take on anybody. His reaction to what's going on around is far from believable, and it might actually have been a better idea to bring somebody in less physically imposing (which reminds me of the upcoming film Impostor, which sounds similar in plot and stars the splendid Gary Sinise, a perfect actor for the role needed).The worst part is, there's an unpredictable plot twist that seems to pop up every half hour that perks your interest up and leads you to believe the film will get better. It doesn't. After the momentary jolt of surprise (I did really enjoy the last twist, which is quite shocking), everything falls back down to Earth (or is it Mars?), and the boredom sets in again.The set design and special effects can be impressive, but everything starts to look hazy and unpleasant after a while. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it could be the choice of color shades the director chose to shoot the film with. The performances don't really amount to much of anything. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays himself again, but a little less convincingly than usual. Sharon Stone is sexy and seductive as Quaid's deadly wife, but she's not given much more to do other than shout, show cleavage, and kick Scwarzenegger around. Rachel Ticotin is simply awful, and I would have prefered if her role had been switched around with Stone.Mars is a fascinating planet that always looks like it's harboring some sort of secret. Total Recall has that element in its script, but it doesn't do anything significant with it. As a matter of fact, just slight changes around and I don't think this film would even need the Mars setting. As it is, the best film about this red planet is still Brian De Palma's underrated Mission to Mars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Arnie movie in order, I come to Total Recall.Plot In A Paragraph: in the future Doug Quaid (Arnie) is haunted by a recurring dream about being on Mars. He buys a holiday at Rekall Inc. where they sell implanted memories. But something goes wrong and he suddenly questions everyone he knows and everything he thinks is real. Some of Arnies acting is awful here (see the scene where he first goes to Recall) it's not Raw Deal bad, but it's still bad, and the effects have not aged well at all, buy it's still very entertaining.Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox make for entertaining villains, Sharon Stone (just shy of her infamous Basic Instinct role) is OK, as is Rachel Ticotin. In his Autobiography, also named Total Recall, Arnie talks about how he always works better with a strong director, how this movie came about, and how it was almost a huge miss. He always looks at the marketing data (tracking studies) from the studio which measures a movies buzz. Due to a poor trailer and weak TV spots (that just had it down as a routine action flick) three weeks away from release, hardly anyone knew it was coming out, and those that did, didn't care. The problem was Tri-Star and Colombia were being taken over by Sony, and we're all about to lose their jobs. So nobody cared, and they were willing to let the movie sink. Arnie got in touch with someone at Sony, explaining "I have a one hundred and fifty million dollar movie here, and the trailer makes it look like a twenty million dollar picture." and arranged a meeting. He screened him Total Recall, then the trailer. Thankfully they agreed with him, and a marketing company was brought in to recut the trailer and handle promotion of the movie. Following on from Twins, Total Recall was Arnie's second movie to Gross over $100 million at the Box Office ($119 million) and end the year amongst the Top 10 highest grossing movies of the year (7th) It actually grossed more (A new record for the oak) but finished the year lower than Twins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is brilliant and quite intelligent (far above your average action flick), a secret agent/sci-fi story full of plot twists and surprises with lots of action. It plays with reality in a brilliant way, rather than a cheap way. More than once one asks the question, is this fake or reality.Decent Schwarzenegger acting here, his typical one-liners are present as are his butt-kickings. The action scenes are very impressive. The blood is excessive to say the least, making this the most violent and extreme action i've seen from old Arnold in... forever! Fans of ultra violence step this way! He still is a larger-than-life action hero here. Baddies Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) and Richter (Michael Ironside) deliver Great performances as usual. Never a dull moment when Ironside's on screen. Sharon Stone has a minor role looking purdy and kicking some butt. Rachel Ticotin is fine as Schwarzenegger's ally, nothing special, though. Director Verhoeven's unique talent and style are very present in Total Recall as well, the ultra violence and gore, the satirical humor, relentless and hard action scenes - it's a fast-paced, bloody roller-coaster ride, and a bloody good one at that. The great and unusual score by Jerry Goldsmith matches the film's mood and theme perfectly. Total Recall is still one of the most violent and relentless films I've seen, even compared to today's standards. But with all this violence comes a very interesting story which is for grown ups and is so worth the concentration needed to be invested in this brilliant Sci-Fi epic!Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

(Mars has been colonised by Earth but is undergoing a civil war of sorts). Upon seeing an advert, he goes to Rekall Inc to take a virtual holiday on Mars through implanted memories in his brain. This sets off a chain of events, leading him to realise that he may have actually been on Mars before...Clever and well thought out central plot, based on a short story by Philip K Dick, writer of books and short stories on which movies such as Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Paycheck and The Adjustment Bureau have been based.Direction by Paul Verhoeven is uneven. Special effects and action sequences are great and most scenes are decently directed. However, some plot developments feel a bit clumsy and contrived. Not the smoothest, most seamless direction. With Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role, you know not expect too much in the acting stakes. However, despite having more dialogue than in the Terminator movies, Arnie does a reasonable job here. Hardly Brandoesque, but it'll do. Besides, he's there as an action hero and in the action scenes he does very well.Solid performances from the main supporting cast: Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, Ronny Cox. Some of the secondary supporting performances feel a bit hammy though, especially Mel Johnson Jr as Benny and Michael Champion as Helm.Overall, good entertainment and far better than the 2012 remake.</fullReview>

The effects were good enough for the idea to be plausible, but not so slick that they're no longer fun and pulpy. Imagine, for example, if the Mars suffocation scenes were done realistically. They wouldn't have been half as fun, and we wouldn't be blessed with Arnie's bizarre "GAAARRRRGGGRRRHAARRRNGHHHGGGGGAAA" noises.Proper pulp sci-fi of the kind we'll probably never see again.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally rad, Arn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very anticipated Arnie pic, in the waiting, and boy did it pay off. It's a very exciting, atmospheric and VIOLENT ride. Again, this Arnie pic, poses that question, what if this was really possible? And what other film, can we see a dwarf woman with three-gazoombies (boobs)? Answer: None. Paul Verhoeven's films never disappoint. They're big and largely and visually exciting, and of course, this one doesn't change that. Arnie, too, doesn't give a half bad performance, as a male beefcake, (Douglas Quaid) who has a hot wife (Sharon Stone, great here and sexy) where he keeps dreaming about Mars. And we ourselves, question, what's so great about Mars. His job is a construction worker, and even when a work associate warns him, not to go to this place, Recall, for what you could say a dream vacation, where they implant fictional memory inside of you, where you're someone else, what does Arnie do? I would never let these twats tamper with my mind. From here the story cracks an interesting thriller twist, as Arnie's implant, has a bad mishap, where suddenly bad guys are chasing him, led by a baddie, (Ironside) wonderful in the role an actor who after this, started to become noticed, where I knew about this guy, years before this, after seeing his great performance in 1983's Cross Country. Ronny Cox plays his boss, the one who owns Recall, and again plays such as bad arse so well, drawing parallels to his other baddie character in Robocop. Like Robocop, T.R, was trimmed for cinema for it's M rating where on video in it's fully restored R version, we get to indulge in all of it's violent glory. T.R. is well written by veteran pros, one of whom's Dan Bannon, co wrote Aliens and Dead And Buried. The dynamite music score stays in your head, sort of like a Basic Instinct'ish opening credit start. The Johnny cab line with a chafed Arnie, before dispersing, is the real tag line that sticks with me, but there is no getting over the one, "Get ready for a surprise". The same could be said for viewers who haven't this super exciting pic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall (1990) is one of the most badass movies ever made full of Arnold one liners, full of gore and action the cast is great you have Sharon Stone you have Michael Ironside and Rachel Ticotin the film was directed by Paul Verhoeven (Robocop).There are many reasons why this film is great it came out on the 90's, Schwarzenegger is starring, the action scenes are amazing, it's R- Rated, you have a talented director and the whole rest of the cast does a great job too bad they had to remake it and ruin it. There's only one Total Recall and it's this one. Final Verdict a 10 out of 10 one of Arnold's Best!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best scifi Arnold films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Total Recall, starring Arnold "White Hercules" Schwarzenegger, is Paul Verhoeven's cult classic that helped to contextualize the style and aesthetic of science fiction in the 90s. It has since gathered quite a following, thanks to its tremendous camp value, surprisingly layered plot line, Arnold, interesting world design and a great basic premise based on the Philip K. Dick story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale".The mentioned premise goes like this. It's the future and the technology to implant memories into people has recently become reality. Thus it's perfectly possible to experience a whole vacation or journey by going and sitting on a chair in the company that fabricates these memories. Meet Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a quarry worker who has a dream of going to Mars, which has been colonized fairly recently and is currently undergoing an upheaval. Douglas cannot afford a trip to Mars so he decides to go and experience the eponymous total recall. Except, not all is as it seems to be. Or is it? One of the strengths of the film is the fact that it knows what to explain and what to leave to the viewer to decide for himself. People are still arguing what aspects of the film are reality and what simply happen in Douglas's mind. There are arguments to be made for both sides, but it's much more satisfying to see the film and decide for yourself, so I shall not spoil it for you.This is also one of Schwarzenegger's better performances and he shows a lot of range, while still doing the usual one-liners, action muscle stunts and general silliness that we love about him.Total Recall is well worth a watch if you're looking for a scifi action film that still explores some deeper themes and challenges you to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Arnie's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Please, stop with Commando, this is an example of one of Arnie's best movies where unlike Commando we have a director and a script. Vorhoven could make some good movies like later Black Book. The movie's pacing is breakneck speed, it starts and goes with hardly any slowdown. The depiction of Mars, and its trademark, what happens when you are exposed to the Martian lack of atmosphere is worth owning the movie for. Also, the eternal is it or isn't it a dream? He puts evidence for both viewpoints but it you listen closely at Recall, the scientist mumbles,"Blue sky on Mars, that's a new one." Also, it is exactly as baldy predicted: everything he says will happen transpires, he does turn out to be Cohaagen's spy. There is more evidence but I think it is clear he is dreaming and he did have a psychotic embolism in the Recall chair. In the end, who cares? It is a great non stop action ride of excitement with much more realism than the silly Commando. Sharon Stone is at her absolute hottest, Ironside is great as the villain. The RoboCop villain Ronny Cox is also good as the yelling screaming leader of the opposition.The film gets a little freaky with the whole mutant thing. Three breasted women is not exactly my bag; this part is, frankly, kinda weird. It doesn't last long and we get back to the action. The first time you watch it you will share Arnie's confusion about who he is and which side he is on. He has lots of people giving Arnie double takes to heighten the mystery of whether he really is being monitored. These support people who take the opposite view from mine that everything is real. You really will not mind the ambiguity; the movie is so entertaining, it has levity here and there though a much more serious movie than Commando. The Johnny Cab is about the funniest the movie ever gets. If you really want to appreciate the film, watch the awful remake, that one doesn't even go to Mars. Arnie is basically on the run the whole movie being shot at, beat up by his ninja wife, and told he is dreaming and going crazy. We, like Arnie, never really know who is friend or foe; we share his amnesia about his past. The first two thirds of the movie is basically a non stop running chase across two planets. If you are looking for Arnie, at his peak, in one of his top three movies, after Terminator and Predator: This is your movie. Great Film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Recall has great special effects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a man goes for virtual vacation memories of the planet Mars, an unexpected and harrowing series of events forces him to go to the planet for real, or does he? Douglas Quaid is haunted by a recurring dream about a journey to Mars. He hopes to find out more about this dream and buys a holiday at Rekall Inc. where they sell implanted memories. But something goes wrong with the memory implantation and he remembers being a secret agent fighting against the evil Mars administrator Cohaagen. Now the story really begins and it's a roller-coaster ride until the massive end of the movie. Roger Ebert wrote "(What's even more unlikely is that after the alien reactors are started and quickly provide Mars with an atmosphere, the endangered characters are spared from explosion.) Such quibbles - and pages could be filled with them - are largely irrelevant to "Total Recall," which is a marriage between swashbuckling space opera and the ideas of the original Phillip Dick story. The movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven, whose credits range from "The Fourth Man" to "RoboCop," and he is skilled at creating sympathy for characters even within the overwhelming hardware of a story like this. That's where Schwarzenegger is such a help. He could have stalked and glowered through this movie and become a figure of fun, but instead, by allowing himself to seem confused and vulnerable, he provides a sympathetic center for all of the high-tech spectacle." There aren't many directors who can blend smarts and action so well. Paul Verhoeven is one of the few who has this ability. He proved it in 'Robocop' and does so again here. Sure, films of this ilk today look even prettier and are louder, but they often lack a good core. This film has great special effects and action, but there's also a good story and performances. Plug yourself into this one and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give These People Air!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point in time, Paul Verhoeven was the guy responsible for special effect and gun bonanza's such as "Robocop" (1987), &amp; later "Starship Troopers" (1997). He does extremely well putting together what is an equal balance of absurd, yet interesting storyline. Taking accomplished actors and making them overreact, or sticking smut in their face (The chick with the third breast is pretty memorable).Definitely one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best. He plays Douglas Quaid, a man in the year of 2084 who has dreams of going to Mars. Essentially he goes to buy the tickets at "Rekall", where they offer fictional memory implants and during the transaction is offered a fantasy package of being a secret agent. However, whilst undergoing the procedure it seems Arnold's character has a past (Or does he?), that eventually leaves him on the run from a bunch of agents (Most notably the always awesome Michael Ironside).Loosely based on the Philip K. Dick story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale", and stuck in development hell for a long time. I would thoroughly recommend seeing this movie, and not for the fact it was one of the most expensive films at the time of it's release. It's the kind of role that suits Schwarzenegger and the creature effects, set designs and make up still look brilliant. Horrible one liners? Pardon my language, but ?%$^ me there's to many gold ones to count.Final Verdict: What a way to kick off the 1990's. Check it out as it is brilliant, mindless fun and highly re-watchable. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Graphic . Great Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Paul Verhoeven's bloody and graphic sci-fi classic. Bullet-riddled bodies, knife slashes, decapitations and arms cut off. Not for the faint-of-heart! The cable-edited version is almost better because some of the gore and cuss-words are reduced. (Too bad it has commercials!) A great story concept from Philip K. Dick about the future of mankind and bargain vacations. Don't actually travel there, just have the whole experience trans-implanted into your mind. This all goes wrong when lowly construction worker Doug Quaid visits "Rekall" and has a psychotic meltdown. Is he Quaid or Hauser? Blue collar worker or company super spy? On Mars or just imagining the whole thing? Several clues point to both possible answers: His "athletically built brunette" looks exactly like the computer model. Sharon Stone bitches that she "had to travel all the way to f*cking Mars, just for this". Mars is a horrible place with no atmosphere. There is a hefty "tax" on oxygen. Luxury Hilton Hotels and a grimy "poor side of town" with dives, beggars and prostitutes. (Love that 3-breasted woman!) A great ending, as good old Arnold sets things right, killing off the stinking pig of an industrialist dictator (played to the hilt by Ronny Cox) in a man-to-man fight. (Guess who wins?) This movie has everything: Sharon Stone as the kick-ass slutty fake wife, mis-formed mutant humans, great special effects, and a great ending, as "Quaid" restores air to the Martian atmosphere and embraces the heroine in a lusty kiss. One of the last major movies that used matte paintings, large-sized miniatures and 10 sets, as CGI was still in it's infancy. If you can handle all the blood and gore, it's a great ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic Action Adventure Old school movie with doses of disgust throw in to make it realistic. Arnold plays one of his greatest parts in this movie. The attention to detail in showing Mars and Earth of the future is imaginative, quirky and impressive. Ignoring all the science which by all intense and purposes is fantasy this movie is plain and simply a fight against evil doers. Secret agent type death squad walking the streets of Earth hunting down an enemy of the Earth. Even Marc Alaimo made a cameo and he became the Tyrant Gul Dukat in Star Trek Deep Space Nine years later. Yes this is a world eerily similar to the Robocop world with the same Ronny Cox as the Dastardly Ruler.Many other films do what this movie does which is have a bunch of Rebels fight against the state and then have an action man come to the rescue but what makes this movie works is a combination great scenes, both exotic and mundane mixed together with futuristic concepts like going to Mars,cosmopolitan atmosphere and Arnold beating up really nasty folks.In some ways the scenes on Mars are crude depictions of warzones in places like Syria today. It is very hard to portray this movie as Science Fiction as it would be stretching science a good bit. It is a typical Action movie of its age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Future perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb is full of people dishing out ratings with no care or attention. But if ever a film tempted me to give it full marks, it's total recall.As with all Paul Verhoven's sci-fi films, total recall still looks futuristic, and always will. The music is pitch perfect, the casting immaculate, the settings, the dialogue. And Arnie fits into this role more sweetly than any other, even that other one he does, where he's a robot.A great story full of ultra violence, twists, multi mammaric women, mutants and more. My Nan would often say 'they'd tax the air you breathe if they could' and Cohaagen made that dream true. He must be the envy of every politician. Quotable sound bites, indelible images, and the most fictionally realised vision of Mars imaginable. Nothing in the film is beyond the realm of possibility, an amazing achievement for a sci fi film set largely on another planet. I just cannot believe how much I love this film. Only two negatives, why did it lead Paul to make showgirls? And maybe if it hadn't been so good, it wouldn't have given some twonk the idea to cash in on its reputation with a remake, which I haven't seen as I'm so offended that anyone thought a remake necessary</fullReview>

Sounds appealing, but for the lead in this film it turns out to be a nightmare. Bad news for Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger), great movie fun for us.Pros: Solid performances across the board. Steady direction. Awesome score. Spectacular effects. Grand production design. Some hilarious bits. Plenty of action. Amazing stunt work. Fast paced from start to finish.

		<fullReview>This movie came out in 1990, when I was 10. Or I might have been 9, depending on what time of year it was. I don't now if i saw it at the movies or if we waited till it was on video (yeah, VIDEO back then), but either way I loved this movie from the first moment I saw it.I am actually quite a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, even if some people think he's not all that talented. I think it's because a lot of his best-known movies are straight out of my childhood and teen years, so he gave me a lot of entertainment back in the day! Total Recall is definitely one of my favourites. It never fails to make me laugh when I re-watch it, and I love the concept as well. The film focuses on some interesting notions, i.e. human memory and what might happen in a world where you can buy false memories. The story makes you wonder what was real and what wasn't. So, all in all I find it a thought-provoking movie as well as being cheesy and silly.I don't see it as the most genius film of all time, so I'm only giving it an 8 - particularly as I don't re-watch it THAT often, whereas there are other movies I will re-watch at least every 6 months. But it's in my DVD collection and it's there to stay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time when interplanetary travel is common, one man yearns for better things. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Scwarzenneger), discontent with his life, dreams of vacationing to Mars. When an opportunity for a virtual vacation presents itself, Quaid visits Rekall Inc. for a memory implant. But during the procedure Quaid is plagued by memories of another life and heads to mars to try to unravel a forgotten past.When David Cronenberg passed on the project, director Paul Verhoeven, of 'Robocop' fame came to the rescue. And although I will always wonder what the talented Mr. Cronenberg would have pieced together, I think Verhoeven deserves credit for taking on the challenge. The film's look is a trademark of Verhoevens and doesn't shy away from being loud in appearance.The film was adapted from Philip K. Dick's 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale' and poses a question to the audience about whether the events after the memory implant are real or not. Undertones of corruption pull the movie along, but Verhoeven's execution of these issues is done with little care.Direction: 7/10 (Verhoeven's anti-subtle imagery and erotica influences drive this film) Cinematography: 8/10 (Jost Vocano's improves Verhoeven's excessive influences) Editing: 9/10 (Puente &amp; Urioste make the right choices here, especially in the Johhny cab scenes) Acting: 6/10 (It's Arnie &amp; Stone. What did you expect? Michael Ironside does most of the work here) Dialogue: 5/10 (Too many hands spoiled this broth. Not awful, just disappointing it didn't turn out) Sound: 10/10 (I was impressed for a film made in 1990. This almost makes up for the dialogue) Effects: 10/10 (It didn't get a 'Special Achievement Award' for nothing. An Oscar well deserved) Art Direction: 8/10 (Verhoeven favourite James E. Tocci is called again to help the director) Costumes: 7/10 (Erica Edell Phillips gives the characters another subtle dimension) Music and/or Score: 7/10 (The music department provided a tasteful Sci-Fi feel to the film)Total Score: 77/100For a film with plenty of action, explosive sounds and visual effects it still delivers an entertaining experience. But don't be fooled ? this film is not for anyone. Best suited for Sci-Fi aficionados and 80s action film buffs. Memorable moments included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post-modern Hegemony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall recounts a dystopian future in which a common man has the choice to lead his own destiny or become a pawn for an interplanetary mega-corporation. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Hauser, a man who is working for an extra-terrestrial mining company which maintains a monopoly on air needed by the population living and working on their main mining base on Mars. The company has employed Hauser in a hunt to find Kuato, the leader of a rebellion against the company. In his search for the rebel leader, Hauser switches sides and begins to help the rebellion. When this happens, the company's lead Mars administrator, Vilos Cohaagen, captures Hauser and uses "Rekall" brand technology to erase and re-programs his memory. In doing so, Cohaagen seeks to eliminate Hauser from further aiding the rebels, and possibly gain an advantage - should Hauser become aware of his former memories and trace his way back to Kuato.The film begins in a dream turned nightmare in which Schwarzenegger and his former female companion on Mars, Melina (Rachel Ticotin), have an accident while exploring Martian terrain. Awaking from this nightmare, Schwarzenegger is now Douglas Quaid, (an identity created by Cohaagen's Rekall technicians), now living on Earth with a house, a construction job, and Lori: his hot blonde wife (Sharon Stone). Things seem hunky-dory for Quaid until he begins piecing together clues leading to his former life on Mars as Hauser.Paul Verhoeven's direction of a script influenced by Philip K. Dick's sci-fi short story is both visually exciting and challenging. In 1990, the producers found this match to be demanding enough to break previous film budget production records. The budget was well spent on creating the film's appearance of new architectural brutalism, future technologies, and on costuming and special effects. The portrayal of the mutant Martian population added a grotesque flourish to the already action-packed science-fantasy.Total Recall is less a classic film for the ages than it is indicative of cutting-edge modernism of the late 80s and early 90s. The main philosophical components deal with meta-cognition (thinking about thought), reality, dream states, control, and flexibility vs. conservatism. It also speaks to concerns about new technology and the old fear of its use by the wrong people. The final sequence boils down to a fight between the corporation and rebels as a conflict over whether the Martian population will be able to "breathe free" or only with the consent of and payment to the company.But the conflict seems to conceal another issue, that being the unfettered expansion humans beyond Earth. This encapsulates post-modern hegemony; both the rebel's trust in alien technology to safely deliver a fresh breath of air (who can really complain if a few windows are broken in the process) and the corporation's conservative stance to restrict the atmosphere are risks to the human condition and neither can be acted upon with the total participation of all those effected. In summation, the creation of a Martian atmosphere is a triumph over the corporation for the moment, but in the long run how will this prevent Mars from being overrun by the very same corporations which were defeated in the film's finale. The answer to this may lay in the film which was developed as a sequel to Total Recall, Minority Report (2002), which saw psychic-clairvoyant Martian mutants employed to help detect and fight crime before it even took place, a film which did not continue the trajectory of Hauser and Melina. Even though Hauser was able to set the Martian atmosphere free, it seems the possibilities for continuing his adventure had been exhausted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Total Recall" is an expensive futuristic Sci-fi film in which Arnold Schwarzeneggar saves Mars.The story opens Douglas Quaid (Arnold) dreaming of walking hand in hand with a mysterious brunette (Rachel Ticotin) on Mars and then waking beside his wife Lori (Sharon Stone). Quaid has a desire to move to Mars but Lori is against it. Stuch in a menial construction job (you know that that's not going to last), Quaid is lured by an advertisement of a virtual holiday on Mars from a company known as Recall.Quaid chooses to experience his "vacation" as a super spy with all of the inherent dangers. Then all hell breaks loose. The virtual machine malfunctions and Quaid suddenly finds himself pursued by unknown assailants. It seems that Quaid may have had his memory erased and that Lori isn't really his wife but an enemy agent.Anyway, he manages to get to Mars where he discovers that his main adversaries are Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who controls the settlement, its air and its wealth and his chief henchman Richter (Michael Ironside). He also discovers "the girl of his dreams", Melina (Ticotin) who seems to remember him as someone called Hauser. It seems that "Hauser" still holds some valuable information in his scrambled brain.After dispatching half the population, Arnold brings the villains to justice and all live happily ever after....or do they?Director Paul Verhoeven gives us plenty of action, great looking set pieces and plenty of extras for Arnold and company to mow down. The fight between Stone and Ticotin is a highlight as well as, the part where Stone kicks the crap out of Arnold. Verhoevan also leaves it to the viewer to decide whether the story was real or did Arnold actually have his virtual vacation.Exciting science fiction.</fullReview>

The cast in the movie are perfect: Arnold Swartzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, and others to name make the movie rock! Living on the planet Mars would be good. Unfortunately, the gases are highly toxic. I liked everything this movie has given. It was full of surprises. The mutants for instance are very unique, some were grotesque. The woman who flashed her three breasts would make any normal man want to be a mutant. That mutant dwarf was very tough. And I like the fight scene between Stone's character and Ticotin's. I liked the part when Arnie's character separated himself from his dangerous "wife", saying, "Consider this a divorce!" The art of sci-fi has really put me in this movie very much. Doing your nails without all the mess, getting to know the truth about things is a must for some people. Plenty of action, full of thrills, this movie is straight off the edge of your seat fun! An Arnie classic. 5 stars!</fullReview>

It's probably one of the best sci-fi movies ever and the reason for this, is not just cool action sequences, but also a vast show for admiration of Dick's work by director Paul Verhoeven. This movie, Blade Runner and also Screamers have me interested in science fiction; forced me to find some other Dick's novels and read them, like "Flow my tears, the policeman said" (which is one great novel by the way-If you like this movie you should read it). Very important thing to me is that this film has many details and layers yet to discover, which is in fact the case with most of Dick's novels. Also it is very notable that makers of this film see a very grim future ( like a writer himself as I mentioned it at the beginning of my comment) where mankind is still divided in two blocks (Northern-Southern) like during the Cold War and fighting for resources instead of sharing them. Bottom line 10 is for brilliant story, directing, cool effects</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall is one of the (many) Arnold-classics out there. It's pure entertainment from beginning to end. The plot is in fact really interesting, it's one of the better of Arnold's movies when it comes to that. The whole movie is a bit cartoonish, but that makes it just even more fun. There are lots of funny moments, including several of the best one-liners coming from Arnold ever ("Consider this a divorce"). Great action is present too, by the way. Most of the time, sci-fi tends to mess up action movies, but here they did a great job mixing action and science-fiction in a perfect manner. I'll recommend this movie to both action and sci-fi fans. Don't expect a movie like "The Matrix" or "Star Wars", though. It's much more funny than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total recall works for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humungous 'Total Recall' fan. Remember the drop of sweat?Despite the fact that the movie is now a bit dated, the special effects remain stunning. Many have claimed that "Total Recall" is best movie of it's type. As for action, it can't be beat. Lots of creatures and lots of firepower give a gung-ho movie fan what he/she wants. The acting is convincing, the technology is amazing, and the explosion of the reactor with Arnold is awesome! The only detractor from this movie is "Minority Report", which takes most of "Recall's" great characters and flushes them right down the toilet. Anyway, "Total Recall" is a great movie in it's own right and deserves credit for that. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I grew to love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first say this film I thought "okay, this is a pretty good movie, I'll give it a seven". But then as time wore on I found myself seeking out the video tape and then the DVD and watching it over and over again. Not only did Arnold's performance grow on me but the story and the whole production became a great event. I started to love it and then compare other films to it. Now I give it a very high grade, especially for story. If there is any moment that doesn't work for me it is when he removes the woman disguise. The effect looks fake and it suggests too much of a hidden story (whole scenes were probably cut from the film).But all in all this is one of the best sci fi action thrillers in the biz. And the twists are just great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific action future movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall really rocks.The movie promises more than it delivers. The beginning of the movie makes you think you are in for a treat, as the plot of the movie begins to reveal itself, leaving you to fill out the blanks.And everything looks well made, from the surroundings to the equipment people use, as the story belongs to the future. The movie takes a wrong turn (i call it "the Hollywood turn") when it starts to act like an action movie, with really incredible stunts and a lot of computer-animated scenes.Don't get me wrong, it all looks very nice, but since i am a very realistic person it just seemed too incredible to me.The idea of the movie is good, and you can really relate to it (well at least i can), the thing that bothered me most was, it could have been better...especially the ending where the city is actually on Mars.The actors, Arnold, Sharon, were solid, nothing special but also nothing wrong, Paul, the director, has his own style, it is really hard to describe, but the actions scenes are not complete, meaning you might see two guys on the ground at one point and then in the next scene they are both standing up and fighting, and in the following scene they are doing something else, so it looks a bit different from what i am used to, but it doesn't make the movie look bad (or worse). All in all, a solid entertaining movie, developing a very modern and soon-to-be-problematic topic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Recall, a film standing as one of the most reminiscent films in Science Fiction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is undoubtedly a Science Fiction film that entices the best plausible action for any Sci-Fi lover, the story itself was originally thought up by Dan O' Bannon and Ronald Schusett who had just finished creating the story of Alien. Total Recall on the other hand was considered to be too expensive and it was not until the late 1980's that it went into production, many director's were considered to direct it but no one had the correct visualisations for the film's setting and since most of the film takes place on Mars, many director's could not take kindly to it, finally the applicable chance came when a young Dutch director known as Paul Verhoeven was enticed to direct it who later on came onto directing the grisly Science Fiction epic Starship Troopers and Basic Instinct 1 and 2 and he has ultimately made the film into something that is really outlandish in general.In case you are wondering on what on earth Total Recall is about, well basically Arnold Schawzenegger plays the role of this construction worker known as Douglas Quaid who frequently keeps having nightmares about the planet Mars and a visit to an artificial vacation parlour unlocks erased memories in Quaid's mind and he soon find's himself being hunted by a group of Government officials who inevitably force Quaid to go to the Red Planet for real.The storyline is very complex as are the film's freaky looking characters, as some of the Martians who you see in the film adopt the same visual looks as characters who you may have seen in Star Wars, the action is great and down right harrowing at times and there is also a good stellar cast, Sharon Stone delivers a chilling performance as Quaid's indisputable wife, Michael Ironside who gives a stunning action packed performance as the corrupt government official Richter, and ultimately there is the film's main villain being the malicious tyrant Vilas Cohaggen who is played brilliantly by Ronny Cox.All in all Total Recall is a stunning Science Fiction film and it incorporates many action elements that are innovative and stunning, there is also some very good visual effects in the film which really give the film an impressive visual style to it, you also get to see some subsequent sequences of the planet Mars, it does looks slightly superficial and overdone but it does looks fairly realistic, the action is very stylistic but as mentioned it does become a bit mind numbing towards the end like in most Schwarzengger movies, as throughout most of the film you will see so many people getting blown away and shot to pieces that you will just grow numb to all the gore. So if you are a fan of Sci-Fi and you haven't had the chance to experience Total Recall, then you should definitely give it a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold is a crap actor. There, I said it. Knowing that, I didn't have very high expectations for this, but WOW, Verheovens directing and the excellent writing more than enough make up for Schwarzeneggers shortcomings. Wonderfully dark humor, plot twists that makes sense and one-liners that are actually funny are some of the things you will find in this gem of a movie.It is also refreshing to see a film for once that isn't afraid of using profanity or brutal violence in a genre that nowadays is so infested with PG-13 movies that anyone older than ten just wanna puke. Verheoven does his thing, and the result is a movie worthy of being put right up there with the classics by Ridley Scott and James Cameron.When it comes to the look and "feel" of the movie I admit it overall felt a bit dated, with outfits that scream late eighties and gadgets that were outdated years ago. On the plus-side, however, some of the special-effects were truly amazing, especially those involving make-up and animatronics. Some of them really makes todays CGI-endeavors look like cheap computer-games.Now if you'll excuse me, I'll try to find out what other films Verhoeven has directed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold Schwarzenneger's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie. Total Recall got cut to avoid an X rating. This is a very violent movie. The story still is confusing though. Paul Verhoeven did a good job. This movie also features a then unknown Sharon Stone. Ronny Cox was good as the villain. The technology is cool in this movie. The acting is top notch. I can not wait to see the unrated version the way Paul Verhoeven meant it to be seen. I have seen the unrated versions of Basic Instinct, Robocop, and Flesh + Blood. Later I bought the cut versions and I noticed how much they actually cut out. I like comparing the R rated versions to the unrated versions. I just recently saw the cut version of Robocop and noticed how different it was to the unrated version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall is just a damn good movie. There's something for everyone here. Tons of great action sequences (complete with over-the-top violence), a compelling and interesting storyline that will give your brain a workout, excellent special effects (still to this day), a wonderful score, and great acting.Schwarzenegger as Quaid and Michael Ironside as the psychotic Richter really shine here, giving excellent performances. You want action? YOU GOT IT! From the intense shootouts to the insane chases, this movie delivers on the action. Aiding the sizzling action are special effects that are as amazing as they were in 1990, from the vast stretches of Mars to all the futuristic weapons, cars, buildings and gadgets. Plus, you have a woman with three boobs. How can that NOT be good? The score by Jerry Goldsmith is powerful and fits the movie perfectly. Sci-Fi master Paul Verhoeven provides us with a kinetic, bloody, and amazing view of the future, just as he did with RoboCop and Starship Troopers. If you like Sci-Fi, don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that they just can't reproduce anymore!*WARNING: may contain spoilers of some kind!: Arnie was at his best in late 80-s, early 90-s. I must say that despite this film being "just" science-fiction, it's pretty good acting on his part. Sharon Stone was fantastic seductress and vicious woman, Rachel Ticotin playing the "amazon" and the good girl. Ronnie Cox and Michael Ironside were both full of malevolence. Special effects were at the time of production unseen and very believable, though same can't be said about masking (Arnie's explosive head) and some of the atmospheric changes at the end. All in all; good piece of popcorn and nostalgia!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Sci-fi Action - probably Arnold's best imo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember absolutely loving this movie the summer it came out when in high school. In fact I snook in to see it at least 4 x in the theater more than any other film in the theater. It is well-paced, graphically violent, with gratuitous nudity and excellent visual effects - top notch during the time and still fun to watch. The story is of course an Arnold vehicle but I enjoyed the Science-Fiction aspect of reality versus dreaming. Of course upon viewing it nowadays it doesn't have quite the flare and panache that made it so huge the summer of '90, but still you can pick it up dirt cheap at WalMart. There are many Arnold movies - but this one seemed the best done imo with the intriguing storyline, fun cast, indicative of the energy on the screen; and it is still fun to sit back and watch every so often. A must for Arnold fans...."See you at the Party Rictor!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exciting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall was a fun film. It was loaded with action, typical of any Swarzenegger film. It was also pretty bloody, but compared to some films nowadays, the violence seems rather tame.Douq Quaid (Arnold Swarzenegger) has a loving wife named Lori (Sharon Stone) and a good job as a construction worker on Earth. It would seem his life is good, but he is having strange vivid dreams about Mars and being part of the resistance group there that is battling the evil dictator Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox). You see, Cohaagen has control of the colony and all the air which allows the colonists to inhabit the planet. Also in these dreams, Quaid has a relationship with one of the resistance fighters named Melina (Rachel Ticotin), who is a brunette, unlike his wife.Wanting to understand these dreams, Quaid goes to a memory implant service to get a trip to Mars. Afterward everything seems to spiral out of control as Doug finds that many people he knew before aren't the same, including himself. Once on Mars things get even crazier as he finds himself being chased by a guy named Ricter (Michael Ironside). He also discovers some startling truths, but he also discovers more lies as well.Though not on the same par as the Terminator films, director Paul Verhoeven (who did Robocop and Starship Troopers) has given us an exciting film with some unusual and funny characters that pop up on the screen at different times. The special effects were good for their time, but now would seem a little dated. I liked it and would recommend it as an enjoyable pop-corn flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Verhoeven does not disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven does not disappoint. This is one roller-coaster ride of a movie.This film is about a man who leads a fairly dull life. I mean, he has a nice wife, but a dead end job as a construction worker in the year 2084 A.D. He has an odd fascination with the planet mars and craves the adventure of one day being able to take a trip there. While riding the bus to his area of work, he notices an ad for a pseudo-trip. I say pseudo because the trip is not real, but an insertion of memory. This place is called recall, and what they do is insert a memory chip, enabling you to believe that you took a vacation to a place that you probably could not afford otherwise. Quaid can see no reason in not going to recall, so he goes- only for the procedure to go terribly wrong, when Quaid realizes that he has already been to mars, and is now a wanted man.Good flick. Seems to live in the same vein as the fifth element. Or the fifth element seems to live in the same vein as total recall, rather. I think that's right. Well anyway, it had some cool graphics, I especially liked the one with the no-air-eyes-pop-out thing. Really cool. My only real complaint is that some of the fight scenes looked like they were filmed by a four year old. Now maybe its because I have seen way too many kung-fu movies, and I believe our generation to be living in a generation of old kung-fu rip-off's (**cough cough** the matrix **cough cough**). The main question on this board seems to be "was it a dream?" Well that much is up to you. But overall good film. Good enough for an 8/10 at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal action from the beginning of 1990's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like brutal action movies and Total Recall is just that: bloody and brutal and well directed.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dennis Quid, a construction worker who learns, after a visit to Rekall memory travel office, that his whole life is just a planted memory. Soon everyone is out to get him and he must head to Mars to find out what really is going on.The main level of the story is the action. Arnold and co. swipe baddies from left and right and we are shown these grotesque mutants and special effects.The more subtle level of the story is asking us, if everything shown to us is just a dream, and his wife (Sharon Stone) really wasn't out to kill him. That there really wasn't an ancient martian machinery beneath the surface, no real conspiracy at all. Just a man dreaming.I'm pretty sure Arnold fans like the movie, like I did. Sure it has some glitches and most of the stuff presented in it is pretty unbelievable, but the film works, even though some of the effects are showing their age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To quote: "...it's 2084 AD and Douglas Quaid is haunted by recurring dreams about a journey to Mars..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genre for this film is: sci-fi/thriller. This film deserves 9.0/10.I viewed this film when I was a teenager quite a few times, and really loved it. This is a great science fiction work with a complex storyline, and after such a long time of not having seen this film, it really enthralled me viewing it again, since I'm now owning it on DVD.The fact that the main lead is Arnie (Schwarzenegger) is the added bonus, as this film is high on action, so naturally, he was suited to this film. He plays his character really well, Douglas Quaid, the guy who starts to recall some locked memories, and a guy who has to start questioning his real life and to be suspicious of the people he thought he knew. Arnie adds his wit with his classic (sometimes cheesy) one-liners.The female leads are played by Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone, who both give it all in action and drama, and the villains are played well by Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox.The visual effects and make-up are top notch, with very futuristic scenes, and the ending is superb. The action set pieces are stunning and violent. And with Mars as the back drop theme for the story, it makes great viewing. I loved the theme music, which was varied through the film, great sci-fi sounds.A brilliant sci-fi movie, not to be missed ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Arnold, But Not A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that Arnold's acting days are on indefinite hiatus, maybe its time for an in-depth appreciation of his cinematic work. No, wait a minute, I'm serious. He was in some damn fine action flicks, movies which in many ways helped establish the popular culture of the 1980s and early 1990s. He has a body of work now, with a primitive beginning of Cannon cheapos and the first Terminator, a fruitful and successful middle period (including this film, T2, and 'True Lies,') and a kind of flabby but still energetic late period. What's it all about?The problem is Arnold was never much of an actor, and even though he did get better, exuding real charm and some humanity as he went along, he was never going to be John Wayne in "The Searchers," or even Charles Bronson in "Death Wish." "Total Recall" shows much of the limitations of his performance, like poor diction, unconvincing "heartfelt" dialogue ("C'mon Cohagen, give dese people AIR" always cracks me up) and a wooden over-reliance on his brawny image. His wisecracks are hit-and-miss, like Roger Moore's in the 007 series, only Roger kind of knew when he had a real groaner and played it for what it was worth with those eyebrows of his. Arnold delivers lines like "You think this is the real Quaid? It is!" like he thinks he's Noel Coward with an Uzi.I go along with much of what the previous poster from Saffron Walden U.K. said, but I don't think Schwarzenegger was quite as bad as that. He did have a definite something to offer, and when he wasn't required to project too much, he could deliver, at least until he started demonstrating real flair and subtlety with "True Lies" and "Last Action Hero." Here, he isn't quite there yet.None of the acting in this movie is great. Ronny Cox looms over the proceedings like Olivier despite his one-note bad guy simply because the rest of the cast, especially Mel Johnson Jr. as the cabbie Benny but also Rachel Ticotin as Melina and Sharon Stone as Lori, are so obviously uncomfortable in the relatively undemanding roles they are given. Michael Ironside I'll give a pass to, he has presence, but I'd be much more impressed if I saw him portray a social worker for once, or St. Francis.But Cox is good, and has some juicy lines, especially when he tells Melina she'll be reprogrammed to become "what every woman should be." That's funny and menacing work. 'I'll be home in time for Corn Flakes,' too. I don't know how he figured on that, but at least here's one screen villain with an appreciation for a well-balanced breakfast.Also, the script is quite clever, and worth likening to "The Game" and "Momento" in the way it plays with reality and perception, by characters and audience alike. Like those films, it's somewhat handicapped by a lack of heart, but it's an engaging mindtrip when you ponder to think of the three different hypotheses it offers.[Slight spoiler alert] People differ strongly on whether Quaid is experiencing the real thing or a botched memory implant that ends with a terminal lobotomy, but it could also be simply that the program worked as advertised and Quaid is on the verge of safely waking up at the end of the film. That scenario has logic problems, of course, as do the other two, but at least this third possibility comes with the silver lining that no one is really ever hurt in the entire movie. [End of spoiler alert.]The mixed bag of "Total Recall" continues with the special effects. There are some amazing shots of the characters' faces as they run out of breathable air (done with puppets, not CGI), and clever visual cuts like the blood-drenched computer screen that turns into a Martian landscape. But the sets are dreary, claustrophobic, and full of cheesy '80s neon. The mutants when we see them, especially the sad Yoda-wannabe Kuato, are from hunger. Comparing this to that other Philip K. Dick adaptation, "Blade Runner," shows how less-advanced FX can be more than made up for by a director with depth in vision. I for one don't see much of an improvement here over "The Running Man," which Schwarzenegger made three years before.What was amazing about this film, and still is now, is the rapid-fire pacing, the way the violence and gore mount with comic timing and at the same time carry the story breathlessly from one plot point to another. I remember seeing this in the theaters in 1990, and how people were exiting shaking their heads and smiling in amazement at what they just witnessed, the pure adrenaline rush it had given them. It still delivers on that count, and it's got that clever story arc besides. Even if you accept what happens here at face value, it offers up some brilliant twists, like the revelation of Quaid's true identity and Lori's part in Cohagen's scheme. Good films often work on multiple levels, and "Total Recall" is a good film in that respect.So while I'm not wild about this one, I respect it. I like Arnold's choice in scripts. I just wish his acting skills at that time had caught up with his tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Total Recall. From watching it at the cinema back in 1990 to today, I enjoy every minute of this great Paul Verhoeven movie.I think what is really good about this movie is that by the end, you're left wondering if the events around Quaid are real or part of the fantasy package from Rekall, as hints are dropped in early in the film to suggest the latter. Whatever, the ambiguity is one key element to Total Recall's success and enjoyment.Schwarzenegger has never been better than here, and the supporting actors are all great. Verhoeven's gore-factor is high, but as in RoboCop, it's done in such an over-the-top way it becomes comic-book violence.Total Recall is highly recommended to sci-fi genre fans, and fans of Paul Verhoeven's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally love everything about this movie.The script one of the best ever, and is both entertaining and thought provoking all the way.The locations are really cool and futuristic both on Earth and Mars. The effects great, and CGI is only used where it fits, like the X-ray sequence. Todays sci-fi movies could learn from that, because CGI just has that artificial feel to it, no matter how many polygons it consists of.The soundtrack is very cool and atmospheric, although you might not think classical music would fit a movie like this, but it does.There might be a lot of unnecessary violence, but it's done in a funny and exaggerated way, like when Arnie says "screw you" and kills a guy with a drilling tool. The acting might not be considered good in a conventional way, but it's just an action flick, and I like the whole energy the actors put into their performance.Definitely one of the most entertaining movies of all time, and that's what really counts I think. There's too many boring movies around, especially compared to this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my honest opinion, this is the most intellectual of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies.The screenplay and plot lines are so well written, coherent, imaginative and complex and cohesive. The performances of these stellar actors are absolutely professional, quality and believably portrayed. PLOTWhile his wife teasingly steers him clear of his obsession, Doug Quaid is obsessed with Mars and Earth's colonization of the Red Planet. In an attempt to realize his obsession without damaging his marriage, he goes to the much-touted "Recall," a memory implants vacation team to have at least the memory of having been to Mars. But something goes wrong, and before they can implant the "secret agent" portion of his mental "vacation," they hit a memory cap which was already installed by an anonymous governmental bureau known only as "the agency." He freaks and begins screaming at the techies, "YOU BLEW MY COVER!!" END PLOTFrom that point on, the action does not stop. But this is not your typical Schwarzenegger fare. This action is underlined and surrounded by intelligence, thoughtfulness and a main plot riddled with complicated sub-plots which are cleverly written and beautifully executed. The sets are creatively designed, the scenes are wonderfully constructed, and the landscapes of Mars are pure sci-fi/effects genius. The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen ANYwhere, and the finished product leaves you feeling more enlightened and thoroughly entertained. For these reasons I say, this is one of the best of AS's movies. It tops T1 &amp; T2. These three, are his absolute best in the genre of sci-fi/action. A definite "Must See," even if you are a fan of sci-fi alone and do not really care about the Schwarzenegger element. As a PS, I would like to add that the Special Edition DVD version of this movie is much more enjoyable with advanced digital sound, remastered Widescreen visuals and a commentary with AS and the director Paul Verhoeven. There is also a behind the scenes special that shows you why this movie won the Academy Awards for special achievement in visual effects. It rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sorry, but if you dismiss this movie because it is too violent (as many people seem to do) then you are missing out on an excellent film. the story is what sci fi should be - thought provoking and unique - not just a story that takes place in the future - but could really happen at any time. arnie always gets slagged for his, "bad" acting but this is just a fashionable thing for high brow film fans to say. he gets the job done - even though english isn't his first language. how many american hollywood actors can act in a different language? not too many i'd bet.in fact - all the performances are very good. ironside is the ultimate henchman - his portrayal is stone cold. ronny cox also returns from verhoevens previous film - robocop - to play a similar role. i also love that taxi driver on mars - he was kinda funny. the much hated/loved action is nicely choreographed - and very bloody.all in all, an excellent movie. don't dismiss it because it has action/violence/arnie/whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>among Verhoeven's best North American films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall revels in the state-of-the-art special effects and frantic violence characteristic of most of director Paul Verhoeven's American productions. Though based on a story by Philip K. Dick, Total Recall is more of an action movie than a philosophical rumination on identity. Still, the film gets a lot of mileage out of the questionable notion that "you are what you remember." The screenplay was finally credited to seven screenwriters; it had bounced around Hollywood for a number of years with different directors and stars before it reached Verhoeven. The director's brand of high-octane, cartoonish, violence is a good fit with the material, though his style may have been better-suited to 1988's more satiric Robocop. The movie received a special-achievement Academy Award for its impressive effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BIG SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big debate about "Total Recall" is whether or not everything after the trip to "Rekall" is real, or a hallucination. Well, if you watched the movie closely, you already suspected the truth: Everything after Rekall IS a dream.When Ah-nold is getting ready for his "Ego-Trip", you hear a tech in the background say "Hey, that's new...blue sky on Mars." At the end of the movie, when the frozen oxygen core of Mars (Huh?) is thawed to create an atmosphere, the sky is blue. (Quite a trick, considering that it's the NITROGEN in our atmosphere that gives our sky its blue color.)Also, when the "girl" program is loaded (athletic, brunette, sleazy, and demure), the screen briefly shows us a full-face shot of...Rachel Ticotin! As Arnie says later in the movie, "She's real! I dreamed of her before!" So the computer at Rekall picked up her image from the dream that opened the movie, and implanted it in Arnie's Ego Trip.Those are the little clues, to say nothing of the description that the Rekall salesman gives about bad guys, mutants, aliens, and all that stuff. The Big Clue, the one that tells you it's all a dream, comes at the very end. Instead of fading to black, the screen fades to white. As Verhoven explains on the commentary track, this is Quaid (Arnie) getting lobotomized, just as the Rekall technician predicted.All right, now that I've established that I'm a TOTAL movie geek, let me just say that I liked the movie. Somewhat. It was no "Star Wars" and it certainly wasn't "Alien", or "Blade Runner". But it was OK. The jokes were good, especially the babe with the three hooties. (A sly nod to "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", which gave us Eccentricia Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6.) I also loved Arnie's line "Relax, you'll live longer." I've used that one many times, and it comes in handier than "I'll be back."It's not Verhoven's best, but give it a try. At least it's better than "Showgirls".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinemagoing experience - and then some.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are occasions when you go and see a movie with an audience in a cinema that the true power of collective enjoyment really comes across.TOTAL RECALL is one of those moments. I saw it four times within a month of it's release in the UK and lapped up not only the movie, but also the reaction of those around at key moments. I regarded it at the time as the best sci-fi thriller since ALIENS and felt it was more enjoyable than the likes of THE ROAD WARRIOR, ROBOCOP and TERMINATOR. However, in recent years, my opinion has shifted to respect all the said films a bit more in terms of what they offer and all are excellent in their own right, maintaining the conventions of storytelling whilst creating new twists in their own contexts.TOTAL RECALL is a movie that had to be made. After years of lagging in development hell in a number of sources, it is also one of two films that the now-defunct Carolco successfully brought to the screen with spectacular fashion from that place (T2 being the other one) I seriously doubt whether David Cronenberg's more urban version of Shusett's adaptation of Philip K Dick's WE CAN REMEMBER IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE would have worked and indeed I would have expected something a bit more bizarre. In fact, I feel that Cronenberg covered that territory well in VIDEODROME.It is also sad that Sharon Stone never really managed to do as well after BASIC INSTINCT and this film, as this is her best showcase and for all the discussion about 'the scene' in BASIC INSTINCT, I actually thought she was sexier semi-clothed in TOTAL RECALL. Rachel Ticotin (who I first saw in FORT APACHE: THE BRONX) was the perfect contrast to Arnie's hero Quaid.The action is superb and is punctuated with director Paul Verhoeven's signature style (inspired by his experiences as a child in WWII!) of violence and unlike some of today's film, the visual effects don't overshadow the story or performances. No need to give away anything, just enjoy it on it's own terms.Another of my choices of films of the 90s!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb film, largely underrated (due to Arnie being the lead actor) which inspired many other films. Think of the Matrix - the scene where Neo has to swallow a pill to return to real reality - that was also in Total Recall - and the plot of the Matrix (is all life a dream?) was clearly influenced by Total Recall. Also I was reminded of many other later sci fi movies, and had to keep reminding myself that they were ideas original to this film first. Even film The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon film seems to correlate with this (secret agent who has forgotten everything but still remember his agent tatics and fight skills).

		<shortDescription>Vibrant action and glitzy sets make a lavish spectacle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven's paranoid fantasy `Total Recall' is a dazzling futuristic sci-fi. The short story by Philip K. Dick is adapted brilliantly, and in many ways is similar to `Blade Runner'. The main difference is the fact that `Total Recall' is not sadistic, over-rated tripe. But there are many things that separate this from your average gung-ho action movie. Verhoeven's directing styles are marvellous and he creates a familiar, but gleaming vision of the near future.What's better than the brawny action is the Twilight Zone-ish atmosphere that is created. The film hits a peak when it reaches the half way mark and we don't know if this is reality or an artificially induced dream. Then again the movie is over-violent. This sometimes tarnishes the sparkling shine, but even the blood has that polished look to it and the stylish comic strip look certainly adds to the shimmering effect.The general acting standard is average if unremarkable. Arnold Schwarzanegger isn't the greatest actor, but he does the required job. Verhoeven regular, Ronny Cox is moderately good in his part as the standard villain, ditto Michael Ironside. Sharon Stone doesn't get enough screen-time, but is still very good as the vivacious wife. The same can't be said for Rachel Titocin, who is very shallow as the typical significant other.It's quite obvious that the standard of visual effects have drastically improved in the past 13 years, but the special effects in `Total Recall' are still spectacular. It's evident that the old technique of puppetry work is used, but the artists create the vast metropolis that was seen in recent blockbuster `Minority Report', but the settings are brighter, flashier and have an added dose of glitz. It's not very often that I can really say this, but this is a sci-fi movie with a brilliant script. There are enough added philosophical twists to dizzy the mind and alter everything that has gone before.In typical Philip K. Dick fashion, the film ends on a question mark. Was he really on Mars or was it part of the dream? The answer is for you to decide. The movie starts out brilliantly and continues up this slant until it reaches a peak at the half way mark (when he meets the man from Recall). After that it fizzles into action formula but retrieves its philosophical characteristics when we learn the truth about the movie's protagonist.One of the coolest, most vibrant and most violent science fiction movies in years, `Total Recall' is a fantastic demonstration that action movies can have brains. There is an equal measure of style and substance so I highly recommend this futuristic noir. My IMDb rating: 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has it been that long?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't beleive it's been 12 years since this sci-fi masterpiece was released. It only seems like yesterday when I was watching the original screenings on Sky Movies. Arnold was right when he remarked that this movie holds up very well all these years on. In fact it puts all of today's sci-fi movies to shame. And nobody deserves more credit for this than director Paul Verhoeven for his exciting visionary style. When Recall first came out it broke new ground in special effects technology (e.g. the camera panning away from Arnold on the train as we get a beautiful and realistic view of the Martian surface. Add to this the brilliant cast and star power of Arnie and Sharon Stone. Ronny Cox was brilliantly evil as Cohaagan as was his equally nasty henchman Richter (played to perfection by Michael Ironside). Verhoeven has given Sharon two of her most popular roles ever - as Arnie's wife/nemesis Lori and of course Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct. The one thing that made these characters so enduring was their unbelievable evilness. Sharon has the ability to play a complete sweetheart one moment and then shoot you dead without any hesitation the next. The movie also gave Arnold one of his most popular roles and dominates every scene he's in. One especially exciting scene was his memorable and heart-pounding fight scene with Sharon. All of their scenes together are unfortunately few, but show their amazing chemistry together - you can't take your eyes off the screen. Combining the awesome special effects with Arnie and Shazza'a strong screen presences resulted in one of the most unforgettable movies in recent memory. It is also notable for being Verhoeven's biggest U.S. hit to date and Schwarzenegger's first action movie to top $100 million.10/10 ExcellentP.S. Sharon would have made a perfect female Terminator (T-X). Watch her kick Arnold's ass in this movie and you'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

If Schwarzenegger died at the end of the movie, audiences would have been up in arms. One other note, I REALLY liked the acting of Ironside.

		<shortDescription>Great Action/Adventure. Thoughtful Filmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Contains Spoliers**"Total Recall's" thoughtfulness, good story telling, compelling twists and plots, action and adventure, not to mention a rolling/continuous storyline, backed up with wit, some humour, and Arnold Schwarzennegger, make Total Recall one of the est sci-fi movies to touch cinema in the last 50 years.Based on a short story by the "master", Philip K. Dick, and adapted to fit the screen by Paul "Robocop" Verhoven, "Total Recall's" story, set in the 21st century, follows the story of Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a construction worker, who continuously dreams and fanastizes of the planet Mars.When dreams become to much, Doug, against his wife (Sharon Stone) and his friends approval, pays a visit to Recall Corporation, whom have the ability to make dreams/fantasies, become reality. Choosing the Secret Agent option of his "Virtual Vacation", Doug's dream becomes reality?However, something goes wrong, and Recall discover a neural implant, already placed there, discovering that Doug really is a secret agent, and they quickly erase all medical history, and send Doug on his way.Suddenly, after twists and turns, Doug finds out that the truth to who he really is lies on Mars, and the adventure, for Doug, has begun.The screen story, some of which is identical to the short story "We can remember it for you wholesale", by Phillip K. Dick, which is a tribute to his writing, and legacy. (He wrote short stories that inspired "Blade Runner" and "Minority Report"). While it differs heavily for the most part, its rolling storyline, combined with action/special effect scenes, really page homage to what the original short story tries to do.It also assembles a fine cast, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, and Michael Ironside (in his best performance from my view).If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, not neceesarily Star Trek, which this story has NO immediate/obvious story plots from the said series, and if you havent already, see Total Recall, and also check out its short story stalwart, "We can remember for you wholesale". You wont be dissapointed, and its the only chance to see Arnie in his most intriging role.Excellent*****OUTOF*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brash, Bold, violent, Ironside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Philip K Dick adaptation is epic science fiction cinema. It's like a modern day 1950s sci-fi film with a huge budget and excessive violence. The film tells the story of Doug Quaid (Arnie) who has dreams about mars, and decides to go to Recall - implementer of fake memories - to get a two week memory of mars. Unfortunately Arnie's trip to recall triggers strange memories. Has Quaid really been to mars before? Is Quaid really a secret agent who is mixed up in an inter-planetary conspiracy? So, from the this point on the plot twists and turns as Arnie tries to work out what's going on. The story is quite engaging, but what really makes this film a classic is the over the top performances, the ridiculous violence and the dodgy special effects. Arnie was never going to win an oscar for this film, but on purely entertainment value he is awesome. Just check out the scene where Arnie is grabbed by Gary and his goons and Arnie screams 'what the f*** did I do wrong?'. This has to be seen to be believed. Truly an actor at the peak of his powers. But as good as Arnie is he cannot compare to the great supporting cast. Michael Ironside puts in the performance of a life time as henchman Richter. This b-movie actor is always immensely watchable in everything he does, but it seems that Verhoeven brings out the best in him. His style is impeccable as he sneers his way through the film. The final fight scene between Arnie and Ironside on the lift, is perhaps one of the all time great movie fight scenes. I recommend repeat viewing for this scene. The rest of the supporting cast is also thankfully truly awful, in a great way. Relative unknown Mel Johnson jnr positively sizzles as mutant cabby Benny, and other Verhoeven favourites, Marshall Bell and Ronny Cox prove their worth. Cox totally hams it up as bad guy Cohagen. As for the Special effects, this film won best special effects at the oscars, and I know it's over a decade old now, but I really don't now how that was possible. I love this film for all the wrong reasons. It is said that when Philip K Dick saw Blade Runner he said it was exactly as he had imagined it while writing the book. I'd love to know what his thoughts would have been on Recall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imaginative but utterly dreadful Schwarzeneger vehicle, with quite possibly the worst script ever written. Perhaps there was simply no money left after the special effects budget to employ a writer, so everyone improvised, or maybe just wrote their own lines? As for the special effects, excellent in their imagination, but like Arnold's one time mysterious box office appeal, Time has rudely passed it by. Much of the set design too seems victim of an expired budget, so that by the last half hour, it watches like a Star Trek episode. From the Kirk era. In fact, it all looks pretty damn silly now. Tron, Logan's Run, etc. And the violence, good gracious! Like most of Verhoeven's action 'work' this movie is obscenely violent, and the inane dialogue strives to set a new record in gratuitous usage of the F word for the F word's sake. I wonder when watching a movie like this, and spotting all of the product placement i.e. Pepsi, Jack In the Box, Lite Beer, what future generations will make of all this? Probably wonder why none of the sex pornography of our generation wasn't likewise sponsored by the consumer product giants. Karl Marx called religion the opiate of the masses, but he didn't live long enough for Hollywood to show him just how wrong he was. For shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whether it's a dream or reality, it's Ah-nuld's best flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Total Recall was released in 1990, I snuck in to see it lying in the trunk of my friend's Pontiac Phoenix. It was my 17th birthday, and for it I received a conundrum: was what I was seeing on the screen what was really happening to the character, or was it simply a manifestation of memory implants that he receives early in the film? Nobody can definitively answer that (and because my review is to be free of spoilers, I shall refrain from delineating my response). But regardless of whether or not the movie is supposed to be real or a dream, it's Schwarzenegger's best work. For one thing, we don't have to suspend disbelief enough to think "sure, the government would hire a 290-pound muscle-bound Austrian to do delicate undercover work" or "sure, he could be an investment banker". Schwarzie's a construction worker. And he can act in this film, which is better written (despite some cornball lines for the villains) than most of his other films. When he acts like an unstoppable hand-to-hand superman at the beginning of the movie, he is shocked and horrified at what he's done. Find me another Arnold movie in which he expresses remorse! The movie has action, suspense, and some themes that inspire discussion long after the movie is over. And although I don't normally care about such things, Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone pull off perhaps the best girl-vs-girl fist fight in movie history. I give it a 9, and I'd rate it not only as Schwarzenegger's finest work but also that of Paul Verhoeven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent action flick with Schwarzenegger still in great shape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger was 43 years old when one of his biggest classics, "Total Recall" was released. He turned out to be rather boring, tame and uninteresting in the late 90's but the beginning of the decade was when he made his last excellent action movies like "Total Recall", naturally phenomenal "Terminator 2: Judgment day", incredibly hilarious "Last action hero" and silly but powerful "True lies" proofed. "Twins" (one of Arnie's softer films) was made two years before "Total Recall" and "Kindergarten cop" that very same year but nevertheless it was still the time when Arnold wasn't afraid to take a bad guy's life with a gun or any other weapon he can get in his hands and that's good because wretched or not, that's what the man's best at - killing folks. Luckily "Total Recall" is much more than just violence because of the violence. It's a nonstop action ride but the idea and the story behind it is quite clever. It's easy to call it one of Paul Verhoeven's best works. It's certainly not as good as "Basic instinct" but better than "Starship troopers" and that was a pretty splendid flick too. "Consider that a divorce" was perhaps the most memorable oneliner we got from Arnie in "Total Recall". If you havent seen this movie and you think you're a friend of action, I wonder what the hell is wrong with you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed Arnie movies, and this one was no different. It's an awesome 007 meets future sci-fi thriller. Arnie is a great actor, and carries the story all the way.

		<shortDescription>Great movie by Verhoeven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Paul Verhoeven did a really good job when he made Total Recall. The story is very interesting with some ideas that maybe will be real in the future, and this movie shows the dark side of brain-manipulation. I think that the movie was one of the best visual movies at it's time, and I still think it is beautiful even today.Yesterday I watched Scorpion King (what was I thinking?) and I complained about how censored the movie was, and it was great to watch this Verhoeven-movie with all that blood, he is not afraid of showing the audience blood. I'm really a fan of non-censored movies, we see too many "correct" Hollywood-movies in these years.Total Recall is the best movie Schwarzenegger has made, it is even than Predator and Terminator 2. I also like the role Sharon Stone has, she makes a nice performance and looks really amazing.This movie is real good and is definitely worth watching, I will rate it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody marvellous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably one of the greatest sci-fi adventures ever produced. You are grabbed from the opening by a beautiful and stunning montage of 3-dimensional credits, dropping down over what looks like the face of Mars. This is one of my favourite title sequences ever, though it seems to pass people by.Then, after a brief shock opening, and being introduced to the main protagonists of the tale, we are plunged into a futuristic nightmare, full of viscera and tooth and claw carnage. This really could be one of the most vicious movies ever! But hen, that's really what to expect from Verhoeven, whos movies are great.It is a hard film to write about without giving away the essence and twists in the film. Suffice to say that it contains some spectacular scenes and locations.The baddies are really bad too, especially the evil dictator's right hand man, who casually shoots who (and what)ever he can. His demise is funny yet extremely sickening (you'll laugh with giddiness when you see what happens).Scwarzenegger really hasn't made many bad films. This is arguably his most compelling and watchable one, filled with mutants, beautiful women, a massive brothel, and not to spoil it, an unexpectedly sweet ending, which only enhances the films appeal.I'm surprised if there is someone who won't have seen it, 'cause it's been going for ages. Best bet, get it on DVD like I want to do, to get the best quality you can. You owe it to yourself to get a movie like this, fun and fast, yet cerebrally challenging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not as good as Robo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven may be one of the best directors of the new generation but his work--ever since the TERRIBLE Showgirls--just hasn't been up to par to his previous work. Total Recall takes the cool, comic book action of RoboCop and mixes it with Arnold's normal "I will beat you up" attitude. It seemed to lack the human factor of RoboCop that I thought made it a classic. If you love Arnold, sci-fi, action, or anyone else in the cast--or were dissatisfied with Minority Report--this is your ticket to bliss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arnold classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you'd expect coming from a Phillip K Dick short story, this film has an interesting view of the future and certainly has a debatable conclusion to it. `Was Qauid dreaming?' Well its not quite the same classic movie question as another K. Dick based film had, that being `Is Deckard a Replicant' from Blade Runner. This is not in the same league as Blade Runner, it falls short on all respects except for the action, this brings you excessive violence that you'd expect from a Paul Verhoven film. This hasn't got the deep meanings that Blade Runner had, this won't be studied in quite the same way but it is not the films intent. It is in parts a satirical look at the future of mankind, part visual delight and part excessively violent action flick. We have come to expect this combination from Verhoven and it works well.The cast are good in the most part. Arnold as we all know is the lead. If this had leant towards different aspects than action then he would not have been suited but for the violence involved there was only one man who could have played Qauid at the time and that was Arnold. This is his ideal role, little to say and lots of mayhem to cause. He does well in his role and gives one of his best performances. Schwarzenegger revelled in these violent films, snapping necks and Verhoven definitely pushes the boundary's of taste where the action is concerned. I enjoyed the gorish nature immensely but some may find it too much. The plot for an action film is very good, we have this ordinary guy who has an obsession with mars, he then goes to a place called Total Recall, where they implant memory's. It's kind of like the ultimate holiday service without the sun tan and the packing of bags. This seems to trigger off a memory in his head that he already has of Mars so the guys at Recall knock him out and dump in a cab. Then from that moment he finds his life is in danger. He has to find out why and stay alive. After he receives help from unknown and known allies he goes to mars, all the time with a man called Richter after him, played villainously good by Michael Ironside. There are twists an turns as you'd expect and the ending poses the question of whether the whole thing was a dream. Anyway as well as Arnold and a near show stealing turn by Michael Ironside we have solid main cast supported by some bad actors such as Richters right hand man. Ronny Cox also revels in his Bad guy role and like many Schwarzenegger films we have some excellent support to balance out Arnolds limitations as an actor, this is true to nearly all the action stars, particularly of that time, Van Damme, Seagal et al. Also in her pre mega fame days, before Basic Instinct we have the sexy Sharon Stone in a delightfully bitchy and villainous role as Qauids supposed wife who tries to kill him. She is good and you could almost say watchable simply for the fact she is so hot. Rachel Ticotin is also good as Melina, who teams with Arnold.The visuals in this film are great, from the special effects to the recreation of Mars, the production design have brought to life some great imagery and this is definitely Arnolds best film in that respect. One great scene is Arnolds meeting with Kauto who helps him remember about a machine that Mars previous inhabitants created that could bring air to the planet, its a visual effects master class and a dizzyingly eerie look. Also the music is great too. Verhoven is a pretty tasteless director as he certainly showed in Showgirls but in general his direction is good and stylish. Overall this is one of the Austrian Oaks best and probably Verhovens best. It is a classic in some respects while you won't see any Oscar winning acting or dialogue, its basically a great story put into an average script. I hope they bring out a special feature laden DVD soon! 9/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it WAS all just a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is strong evidence that the entire movie may have been the virtual "trip" by Doug Quaid. The memory Rekall chooses for Quaid is called "Blue Sky On Mars", and monitor previewing the memory feature the generators revealed later in the film. How in the world would Rekall know about the generators - it's too strong a coincidence, especially since the movie ends with blue skies on Mars. Moreover, after Quaid advises Melina to kiss him before he wakes up, the movie does a fade to WHITE, which is usually reserved in films for people awakening from a dream. In short, yes, the entire film after Quaid enters Rekall was indeed just a memory trip.Don't be sad - Philip K. Dick loved fooling the audience, especially when they didn't realize they were being fooled!</fullReview>

I don't mind watching impossible action scenes but I mean come on: A "trace device" stuck in Arnold's noise the size of a tennis ball? And if Mars is such a bad place with plenty of terrorists, why is the glass non-bullet proof? (especially when Arnie &amp; the brunette are being chased my Madsen). The story/idea is good but watching this film for the end time, I realized how stupid it all is. I sold the dvd copy, it's not worth having in your collection.</fullReview>

That's impressive considering the technology boom following this movie. The entertainment factor combined with Arnie's on-screen charisma and the movie's non stop action make this one of my favorites. It was the first DVD I bought and I'm a little ticked off that the studio released an improved special edition (which I will now go buy). I rate movies based more on entertainment value than I do story or plot (and the story and plot was good too), so I give this movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Arnold goes to a place that promises the best vacations ever while just sitting in a chair and implanting these visions into your mind however Arnold gets into mass confusion of whether or not he's in reality or still at this business that implanted these scenes. The action isn't really that great there aren't many explosions but the story is wicked and I love that scene where the men is trying to explain what's going on and tries to get Arnold to take that pill that scene is too cool. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re: Why Total Recall is deeper than you think [Spoilers]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers AheadTo some extent, I agree with OutKast: The film certainly gives hints that all we are seeing is the implanted memory given to Quaid by Rekall. I think the clearest proof is the title of the dream the Rekall tech reads, "Blue Sky on Mars", or something similar.However, there are hints in the other direction: Why does he dream of Melina before going to Rekall? How does Rekall know so much about his conversations with his wife and coworker that they can flawlessly integrate them into his dream? With the planet-changing events at the end, how will Quaid possibly reconcile any future reality with his memories? Does Rekall end marriages without prior consent? and if all we see is Quaid's memory, why do we see scenes that Quaid isn't in? (Many of these questions can be answered by saying that even the beginning of the film was implanted by Rekall. but then why include the trip to Rekall in his memory? and what about any real memories he had? Did they just overwrite his real wife? his real coworker? If his memory is so dramatically different from everyone else's doesn't that just make him a crazy guy now?)However, I think that the few details like these that point in one direction or the other actually detract from its depth rather than add, like OutKast suggests. I think one element contributing to the movie's excellence is how well the movie works as EITHER an implanted memory OR a reality. Is Sharon Stone upset at the beginning because Quaid is dreaming of Mars showing that her subject is losing his memory block? or is she a loving wife, jealous of the girl in his dreams? Most scenes work exceedingly well with either interpretation.I prefer the ambiguity, because the real depth of the movie is its ability to ask "what is real?". The film asks this question in the best way: by leaving the audience itself wondering what is real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thinking man's Sci-fi actioner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About million years ago, (ten to be exact) I saw this movie and thought of it simply as `Hey, another Arnold shoot-em-up, bash-em-up' stuff. I was much younger and had less use of my brain. The latter was what I supposed to do for Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. Leave ?em out and enjoy the guilty pleasure.But wait! Ten years forward and I got to see it again. What a surprise! The movie worked way better than it did. What better, I got to do thinking these days, and applied it in this movie with good results. This movie is certainly a thinking man's action sci-fi. No offence to non-thinking man, since it can still entertain too, as it did for me ten years back.There is enough plot twist and turn in this Paul Verhoeven directed feature to make The Matrix look like an episode of Tom and Jerry. No offence to Tom and Jerry, of course. The story, based on Philip K. Dick's short story, never seem to date, and it gave Arnold a lot of excuse to actually er...act. You got me right. He actually did some serious acting in this movie. I'm serious. But what is an Arnold movie without Arnold being...Arnold. The violence is still pretty gory, but acceptable when it is okay with the story. Arnold usually doesn't punch bad guys. He THUMPS them. And here, he got to do more than that.There are the usual special effects that made us go ?WHOA!!!' with capital letters those days. It still looks okay, but with a pair of eye trained to spot even the CGI scenes in Lord of the Ring, I felt a trifle uncomfortable with them. Just consider the era and you'll be fine. This movie is heaven sent for Arnold fan, and definitely worth checking out for non-Arnold fans. I think this is easily Verhoeven's best work. Yes, the violence, the campy dialogues and the one-liners are all there, but all in the name of fun and some serious thinking. Unravelling the plot, for a slow bugger like me, takes time, but it was worth the ride. By the way, did I mention Sharon Stone is in this picture? Great huh? Well, don't get excited, she never strips. Almost, that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Total Recall is deeper than you think (Major Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers ahead***(This is all my conjecture and opinion, so I'm not adamant that my theories are correct, it's just something fun to think about.)Total Recall is not deep because of it's numerous plots twists, although those do add to the fun of the movie. If someone calls Total Recall deep, many will respond that it relies on numerous plot twists to "look deep", while it's really an artificial movie filled with violence and gratuity to appease it's teenage audience. I will try my best to disprove this and show that Total Recall does have those moments, but is much more that many people don't realize.One thing always bothered me about Total Recall. Everything in it made sense except for one little scene that just didn't fit. This scene holds the key to Total Recall and all of it's deeper meanings. This deeper meaning is ironically (and people still miss it) in Arnold's last line. "What if this is all a dream?" The entire movie is a dream, in fact, and the scene that holds the key is when we see Melina on screen as Quaid is preparing for his Rekall trip. This part always bothered me. How is it that a picture of Melina is at Rekall? The answer is simple. She never existed.Nothing in Total Recall actually happens and only a small bit of it actually happened in real life. Here is what really happened to Douglas Quaid: Douglas Quaid was a normal guy who always wanted to go to Mars but couldn't because of time, expenses, and his wife. So he decided to go to Rekall and get the memories of a trip to Mars as a secret agent implanted. Unfortunately all goes wrong and Quaid has a schizoid embolism. Then the movie begins. Quaid dreams about Melina, having never met her, but had her image implanted at Rekall. He dreams of going to Rekall and the only real thing that actually happened to him. Then everything plays out in exact detail the way he specified at the real Rekall: Melina, his spy life, and saving the whole planet, just as specified.There are a few counterpoints, but they quickly fail. How could he dream about Melina before he goes to Rekall? He doesn't, the dream at the beginning occurs after he goes to Rekall. What about the guy who offers the red pill to Arnold? He is just part of the dream, not really at Rekall. There are questions I would have for those that think Total Recall is based in reality. How could Melina's profile have existed at Rekall? How is it that everything plays out exactly as planned by Quaid at Rekall? He saves the planet, gets the girl, and crushes the bad guy. What are the odds? Zero.I once hated the mutants and thought they greatly detracted from a fine action movie, but when I realized that Total Recall is nothing more than a paranoid delusion, I finally realized that they only add to the ludicrousness of the idea of the film being based in reality. The mutants would indeed detract from the movie, but they really only add the incredible experience of Quaid's dream.Total Recall has many fun action scenes and one-liners, but it is really a little bit more. There are many who love the twist at the end when we find out that Quaid volunteered to have his memory erased to infiltrate the mutants. The ironic thing is that this is not the ultimate mindbender of the movie. The reality is that none of it ever happened.</fullReview>

I swear I must live in a dream world like the character in this movie, Arnold was most famous for violent action movies in the 80's this film was made in the early 90's what movie did these people think they were seeing? Do they recognize the name Arnold Schwarzenegger? It was made before the miserable Kindergarten Cop, Junior or any other "life-affirming" junk he did later so what is there reference? Did I miss Arnold Schwarzenegger's Hamlet?Did these people go to see the latest Julia Roberts/Richard Gere Disney project, walk into the wrong cinema and sit down? Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger, what a combination, I've never seen such fun in one film. Violence, sleaze, action! Next time you go to an action film with tagline like "They stole his mind, now he wants it back" think twice! I don't think the plot is inadequate either or that there are "holes" in it either, maybe these commentors can only handle one perspective at a time or there wasn't enough spoon feeding of the story? At the end of the movie it is uncertain whether the events that transpired were real or part of his mind/virtual/memory holiday, similar to the ambiguity in Verhoeven's Third man. But then I'm probably wasting my time, maybe the "holes" aren't in the movies plot!</fullReview>

Then add the direction of the great and always controversial Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Basic Instinct) and you have a classic in the making. The movie is a wonderful mix of suspense, action, science fiction, and mystery. Wonderful special effects, beautifully crafted, awe-inspiring sets, gorgeous cinematography, solid interesting action, and great characters. Good performances all around by the cast. FINAL RATING: 9/10 A believable original plot, great direction, good cast, gripping script, and excellent production values make this a movie with very few weaknesses. Total Recall will probably reach the status of classic in the years to come. A movie that can reach across genres and interest all movie fans. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall is probably the best Arnie's film and one of my favorite action movies. Why I like this film is that unlike many blockbuster action movies this one has not only exciting visual effects but also not a trivial scenario with interesting plot and dialogues (my favorite phrase is when Arnold discovers they implanted something into his mind and Sharon says:"Sorry, Dug, your whole life was just a dream". I think original scenario and good old Arnie's play make this film so attractive, and not the special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schwarzenegger on his zenith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anno 1991, when I was 16 years old, I saw "Total Recall" for the first time and it was then the greatest film I had ever seen: Carolco was on the best way to become a further major studio with blockbusters like this one - long time before "Titanic", Verhoeven´s movie was the most expensive film ever produced! The score composed by Jerry Goldsmith is still one of my favorites and Dan O´Bannon had done another brilliant job as script writer. The make-up and the special FX made by Rob Bottin were stunning (remember the female Marsian with THREE breasts or Cuato, the leader of the rebells...) and Paul Verhoeven became one of the most fascinating and provocative directors in Hollywood. There was a superior Arnold Schwarzenegger, a very sexy Sharon Stone, a tough Rachel Ticotin and a charismatic Michael Ironside playing the bad guy. All these facts make "Total Recall" standing in one row with the best action movies of all times like "Die Hard 1+2", "The Rock", "T2" or "Face/Off". Watch nowadays Schwarzenegger´s youngest releases like "End of Days" or "The 6th Day": they´re just solid action flicks, but nothing more. "Total Recall" against it is a classic! (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome stuff man! I really liked the special effects, makeup and action. All of it was a good mix. Oh and also humor. You need humor in these types of films or else u get ugly films with unsympathetic characters in a film that takes itself too seriously. This however isnt one of those. It's just good entertainment. Some of Arnold's one-liners he spoke well. One scene ie: Some mutant Arnold's Quaid character runs into: You have alot of guts showing your face around here. Arnold's Quaid: Look who's talking. I think that line is SO hilarious. I laugh at it every time and often quote it to friends. You see he is talking to some scarred-faced-loookin mutant about his looks.Over all this movie rocked. But unlike what others say about his film carreer declining after this one, I dont think so. Ok so True Lies had its faults, but very few movies don't. The acton scenes and humor made up for a slow and somewhat odd middle. Even though some may disagree with what I am about to say, The first The Terminator may have even had its faults in there. Even though it was a classic to be sure, the budget sort of gave it slightly less potential then it could have had, but it still rocked despite this. Eraser was actually pretty good not as good as Total Recal or Terminator, but it was beter than Commando. Twins was probably his best try at a comedic role/film. Last action hero pretty much was bad but it still wasn't bottom of the barrel. It actually had potential. Batman&amp;Robin may very well has been his worst. I haven't seen the 6th Day so...I'll see it on video, no big deal.Total Recall was and still is a good film to watch for pure entertainment value, with some nice sci-fi elements peppered in there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold's last good action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really. Arnold's movies have never been masterpieces, but you can guarantee that they'll give you your money's worth in violence and stunts. In the last 10 years (after Total Recall), Arnold made mostly cheap, cheesy comedies (Kindergarden Cop, Junior)and failed attempts at good action (Eraser, True Lies, End of Days). Terminator 2 wasn't bad, but it didn't hold a candle to the original. But Total Recall was actually a pretty good popcorn action flick. It has a copious amount of violence (it garnered the doubtful honor of getting a 18+ rating in my native Quebec. As an example, movies like Pulp Fiction and A Clockwork Orange are rated 16+.), excellent action scenes, great special effects and an original story. Ah-nuld plays Douglas Quaid, a man who lives in the future. One day, he sees an ad on his virtual TV for a company called Recall Corp. (or something like that) that enable you to get memories of a vacation implanted into your brain without actually going. Going against his wife's (Sharon Stone) warning, he decides to take a vacation on Mars. However, something goes horribly awry and he ends up on Mars for real. Throughout this he'll 1. meet up with his clone 2. see a mutant with three breasts 3. kill a lot of people. The first thing you'll notice in this movie is the visual style. Everything looks orange. Then, you'll notice that this is violent. When Quaid freaks out and shoves a metal pole up a scientist's head, it gets pretty gross. The action scenes are well made and Ah-nuld is pretty good (to the point of goodness that Ah-nuld can reach). This is an action movie, and it never lets us forget it. I recommend it to anyone who can stomach a lot of violence and who can enjoy an action movie. 8/10</fullReview>

After this, he tried starving himself into a "leading man" physique that may have lead to his requiring heart surgery.In this movie he is at his articulate best (for him) and he is actually given a chance to act--although Sharon and Rachel (and pretty much the rest of the cast ) outshine him, this is pure Arnold.And Peter, the master of high camp violence (probably the Sam Peckinpah of our generation) does his usual excellent job of over the top, but highly original violence.After this one, Arnold was just a pale parody of his former self.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Has Not Been Kind To Total Recall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the great science fiction films, it's clear that there is one great truth: If you create a world (diagetically, not like a different, imaginary planent), sometimes the legacy of the film can survive improvements in technology, but if you limit your scope, soundstages will always look like soundstages and that gets tacky as time passes. The world of Blade Runner, for example, is so complete that even though the special effects in the film are dated, the world remains entrancing. Ditto the Star Wars movies. There's a unity of vision between writer, director, production designer, and cinematographer that's wonderful. In Paul Verhoven's Total Recall, on the other hand, Mars is limited to two or three ugly stage sets. Ditto futuristic Earth. The special effects remain impressive, but the tin-eared script and frequently ugly visuals drag the film down. Only ten years after its release, it looks like a museum piece.This is additionally unfortunate because the story is more than provocative enough. Based on a nifty Phillip K. Dick story, Total Recall is about construction worker Donald Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a man haunted by bad dreams about Mars that even his hottie wife (Sharon Stone) can't get rid of. When Quaid goes to a company that manufactures vacation memories for people without the time or money to take the vacations, it becomes clear that something is very wrong with him. Quaid is not Quaid at all. He is a secret agent and his whole life is sham. And off to Mars goes Quaid to try to sort out what's real and what's illusion.Whereas the set designs for Verhoven's Robocop were perfectly in fitting with the society on the brink of martial law being depicted, Total Recall's world just looks like it's the late 1980s translated to the far future. The costumes? Pretty much late 80s. The hair? Again. The production design owes more to Miami Vice than to any creativity on the producers part.As a director, Paul Verhoven is the master of a kind of hilariously sadistic ultraviolence. He's proven that he can handle this trademark violence both straightfaced (Basic Instinct) and with a satiric smirk (Starship Troopers). On Total Recall he handles the special effects, especially the make-up/gore effects, wonderfully. However, he's undone by the aforementioned production design. Every metal door looks plastic. Every Martian cave wall looks like styrofoam. There's never any sense that the movie takes place in any location besides a studio's backlot. Ace cinematographer Jost Vocano is actually undone by his skill. A DP less effective might have produced images that didn't so completely emphasize the artifice.Another Verhoven trait is horrible casting. The guy doesn't really look for actors, he places faces on a landscape. Basic Instinct is such an effective film (say whatever you want about its quality) because he was actually working with a cast of talented professionals. But in most of his films, especially Total Recall, the casting is just painful. Ah-nold is Ah-nold. He can't act, but his physical presence is what people go to see. Or at least *went* to see. Stone is also a hoot in her limited part, but if she's the only person in your movie actually acting... Well, that's not good news. Verhoven regular baddie Michael Ironside is typically hammy, but from there the cast just goes downhill. Why were Rachael Ticotin, Ronny Cox, Marshall Bell, and Mel Johnson Jr. doing with large roles in a major motion picture? Destroying it. The supporting performances are laughable, and this is the kind of movie where even the one-line roles are badly done. Basically, with a huge budget, Verhoven didn't feel the need to work with professional actors. And he pays the price.As appealing as it is when the characters are running around in circles, there's very little point. The wonderful premise is basically wasted and most of Ah-nold's witty comeback lines fall short. I'd give this one a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Sci-Fi movie of all-time. Schwarzenegger's best ever. Just goes to show you your past really can affect your present.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that the plot of Total Recall is confusing especially for anyone who just watches it for the first time, or for anyone who watches Total Recall many times and understands the plot such as myself, still the film makes me have very different thoughts and feelings it entertains your mind. In 1990 I knew when I first saw this film in the theater what a blast it was! It showed just how advanced film had become and just what a genius Paul Verhoeven was. As Verhoeven showed with his other films like "Robocop" he always gives great insight into what the future will look like as you can see this evidenced in Total Recall and "Robocop". Great story you have it Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger)who is placed on earth as a construction worker he finds himself happily married to the sexy Lori (Sharon Stone). Constantly Quaid continues to have dreams about Mars it's like he was once there. Then a trip to a memory agency called "Rekall" it finally hits Quaid he has really once been to Mars! You name it all hell breaks loose as former Quaid friend, but now enemy and terrorizing dictator Cohagen (Ronny Cox) begins the search with the evil Richter (Michael Ironside). No sweat though Quaid escapes to Mars to search for his real identity after he learned that his identity had been erased. On Mars Quaid once again meets with his true and past love the exotic Melina (Rachel Ticotin). Together they both fight the forces of evil and help the Martian community finally gain a life of freedom. Along the way Quaid meets a cab driver but later it turns out to be a Cohaggen worker. Anyway Benny (Mel Johnson Jr.) provides the funniest quote in the movie and perhaps one of the funniest of all-time in movie history. I'm sure anyone remembers it's the bar scene which includes the hooker {Benny: (to the three-breasted hooker) You make me wish I had three hands.} I never will forget that quote from the first time I heard it I died with laughter, I once repeated that around one of my friends and they nearly cracked up. Great and funny quote! Mention must be made that this is by far the sexiest Sharon Stone has ever looked! The first time I viewed Sharon Stone in Total Recall everything from her face, hair, body, and just anything about Sharon she's just so sexy! It's a shame that Sharon's character no matter how deadly had to be killed by a bullet through the head. That's the one part of the movie I hated to see. I could continue to go on and on about Total Recall, but I will finish by just saying the acting is great this is by far Arnold's best movie {Note: Arnold you need to make a sequel to this}. Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox are tremendous as the villains in this movie an audience can't ask for better villain characters than these two. And Roy Brocksmith (Dr. Edgemar) seemed to get plenty of work in front of the camera in the early 90's I also remember him making guest appearances on two episodes of HBO's Tales From The Crypt series. Where is Roy gone to? Total Recall has the gut crunching, white knuckle, nonstop action that you action buffs will enjoy. So see for yourself it's total war, total Schwarzenegger and the thrill of your entertainment life. And remember just as this film has a theme of the past and as I have told many people many times the past can affect the present. Only if we could go back to our past and deal with problems and people of the past such as Douglas Quaid did. Total Recall has all of us wishing for a real fantasy world.</fullReview>

What makes this movie great is the philosophical aspect of it. My less intelligent friends completely look over this and simply believe what is revealed to them in the plot. The plot proposes two realities : 1. That which the second part of the plot leads you to believe. 2. That which the first part of the plot leads you to believe (meaning the second half is purely implanted fantasy by the wizards at Recall.) Which is the true scenario? The movie doesn't say but trying to figure this out makes this movie very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a teenager when it came out 1990 and I was instantly hooked into it's near-future world. All the way back home from the theatre I talked about the movie with my friend. We puzzled many things like possibility of life on Mars, was Arnold's adventure just a dream or would eyes really pop out on surface of Mars. These questions (with exception of eye-popping;) still capture my imagination after 10 years and 8-10 re-views later. Rarely in these days you really think of anything after seeing another typical action movie or even sci-fi (with exception of Matrix). Total Recall is great balance with complex sci-fi plot, great action and special effects. In addition it is Arnold's best movie and he plays Doug Quaid role with great passion. Ironside is also memorable as Cohagen's right-hand man and Sharon Stone has good femme fatale role as Quaid's wife.In my view Total Recall is also Verhoeven's best direction so far. Avoid "Mission to Mars" and other moronous sci-fi's and watch this sci-fi/action classic!My Rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Total Recall" is one of my all-time favorite science fiction movies. It has everything: action, humor, good performances by its cast, and spectacular special effects. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in one of his best films as a man who finds out that something's not right. He's a construction worker named Quaid, who lives on Earth and keeps having dreams about the planet Mars. He goes to a place called Rekall, where the doctors there implant their clients with memories of the most unusual but exciting sort. Quaid wants to have memories implanted that have to do with Mars. But just as he's about to take his trip, he goes berserk, and finds out that he's a victim of mind-tampering. A couple of sociopathic killers under orders from the dictator of Mars try to do him in. Quaid escapes, however, and travels to Mars to confront the evil Martian dictator as well as his hencemen. "Total Recall" is one amazing thrill ride that is spectacular to look at. The special effects are incredibly awesome. The movie deservedly won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects as a special achievement award, but I would have let it compete in the category with two other movies. If it had, I think "Total Recall" would have still won the Oscar. Schwarzenegger is terrific in one of his best roles; Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside are effective as the main bad guys (the dictator of Mars and his right-hand man); Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone are fetching as the women of Quaid's life (one good, the other bad). Director Paul Verhoeven knows how to direct great action, and he also knows how to work with great special effects teams. He's done a good job with sci-fi material as he has proven with two other science fiction movies that were very good: "RoboCop" and "Starship Troopers". "Total Recall" is an outstanding science fiction movie. If you like great action and great special effects along with good performances, this is a must-see.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

TOTAL RECALL might not be everyone's idea of the standard Schwarzenegger vehicle as it's violence and action is really just bait that's ready to lure you into the finer points of this film. Indeed Arnold sometimes falters in finding the reality of his situation, and one often suspects he is taking all this monumental revelation a little too easily. The beauty of this film, and it is a beauty, lies not with its multi-million pound star, but with its wonderful vision of things to come.This could have not been handled better than by the wonderful director Paul Verhoeven, who has been so ruthless in the past with his unsettling glimpses into society's future (ROBOCOP, STARSHIP TROOPERS). Amidst the slightly ropey special effects, ludicrous death scenes and cringe-worthy acting (yes Ms Stone we are talking about you!), this is a wonderful piece of film-making from a true prince of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the big 'A'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A' for "A lot of blood". No, make that "A lotter"! If you're not into violent movies, you might be offended. However, I always felt the gory parts were essential for Verhoeven's universe. A feeling of the softness and fragility of flesh versus the unrelenting steel of the weapons, armour and sets pervades throughout, like the "momento mori" of baroque art. These worlds mean business, they can harm you in a very real way, they are not the comfy deals we find in most other hollywood-material; "Robocop", "Starship Troopers" and "Total Recall" are all prime examples of this. The characters sweat and bleed their way through this, the most physical of movie-worlds!'A' as in Action; this is a rollercoaster-ride of beautifully choreographed action-scenes, and the plot keeps your brain on its little grey toes throughout!'A' as in Arnold-movie; this movie, along with T2 and Predator, is one of the best examples of a genre all its own, which sets an impressive standard for adrenaline-level and imagery.'A' for Acting. Arnold almost acts (!) in places, not so much in the stale voicing of his Austrian accent, but there is some nice facial stuff in there, which must be considered class A acting, coming from Mr. "I'll be back" Universe! Anyhow, the rest of the cast are excellent!CONCLUSION: A camp Austrian, a mad Dutchman and the twisted genious of Phillip K. Dick; what more do you need? See it tonight, but keep a towel handy for wiping the sweat off your brow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, very intricate script by the excellent Verhoeven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of Arnold's best. Not just for the excellent Sci-fi story and action sequences but especially for the script. I recently re-viewed this movie and noticed some things I had never noticed before. They never REALLY tell you if Quaid (Arnold) is really a secret agent or it is just part of the program, at first glance it seems that he was a secret agent all along and the visit to Recall triggered his memory, yet consider that perhaps this is all part of the implanted memory! Consider these facts, the salesman says "by the end you'll kill the bad guy, get the girl and save the planet". Or a less ambiguous example, the technician in the memory implantation room says "blue sky on mars? huh, that's a new one" which is just what Quaid does, restores atmosphere to mars!Verhoeven has a gift of including complex messages in movies that seem to be made to appeal to the lowest common denominator, (Starship Troopers, Robocop). Yet he has become one of my favorite directors due to his excellent style and use of satire. Watch this movie for the excellent story, watch it twice to pick up on what you missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this reality? Or is this only a dream the ultimate questions in the science fiction action/adventure film Total Recall. That's the fun part of the movie is figuring out if Douglas Quaid is dreaming or not, the events that happen are real I say but other people might disagree. Directed by the always entertaining except in the case of Showgirls filmmaker Paul Verhoeven who has a unique style. Hopefully Paul Verhoeven will come out with another film after the somewhat of a failure at the box office Starship Troopers. Douglas Quaid life is turn upside down after going to the Recall center, his wife and friends keep trying to kill him and he learns he might be someone else. Quaid goes to Mars where he meets up with Melina and the underground rebelling movement. Quaid discovers about his new purpose and about his old purpose created by his other self. The film is a great example how well science fiction and action can mix together to make an excellent movie. The story is intriguing, well scripted and has enough Arnold action style to entertain anybody who likes action stories. If you like this movie check out Robocop and Starship Troopers. Lessons Learned: Colonizing Mars can result in mutants. Mars has a prostitution problem. The concept of a woman having three breasts is not much of a turn on. Even in the future there's Pepsi. Good guys own stripper clubs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awe inspiring action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven delivers another ulra-violent sci-fi action movie, and it is perhaps his best. Arnie plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker in the year 2084. Tired by life on Earth he buys an artificial memory of a trip to Mars (now populated). Unfortunately, this unlocks memories of a past life, when he was a secret agent tying to stop the tyrannical Vilas Cohaagen from crushing the Martian rebels. As Cohaagen's goons give chase, Quaid desperately tries to find out who he is, why he's on Earth, and how he can put an end to Cohaagen's dictatorship forever. This movie never has a dull moment. Apart from the last seconds of dialogue it's perfect, and it's definitely not lacking in the action department as each punch and gunshot wound looks and sounds horrific. The martian landscapes are awe inspiring (despite looking like scale miniatures) and the plot twists leave you wondering if Quaid is inside the memory he paid for, or is really "--an invincible secret agent from Mars, victim to an interplanetary conspiracy to make him think he's a lowly construction worker." All these points and more make Total Recall worth adding to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action Sci-fi and then there's Arnold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is in the tradition of several Alfred Hitchcock films about the wrongfully accused man. But it has a twist, a premise about memory and reality from the author Philip K. Dick which gives the movie a deeper message. But all of this is quickly overwhelmed by the action which is often very violent. The enjoyment of Total Recall depends upon whether you like that kind of thing. In the 90's this violent style has been copied many times. What I thought was overdone in 1990 (the violence) now feels more mainstream.Total Recall's mood is quickly set by the quick pace between scenes and powerful music. The most surprising thing is that director, Paul Verhoeven, gets a fairly decent performance out of Schwarzenegger (as long as you can put up with that accent). I actually believed that he fit into the scenes. Sharon Stone and a supporting cast of bad guys do a very nice job. As for the action, it is well choreographed and the editing is sharp. The first half of Total Recall which is on earth is pretty believable (except for Arnold's calm reaction after being shot at by his wife). The scenes on Mars are less convincing because the sets and some of the special effects don't look very real. Also, Arnold's acting limitations are allowed to show when he uses a hologram to play hide and seek with the bad guys.Problems aside, Total Recall is a quality action film. It is also fairly good sci-fi (is it real or just a dream). If you enjoy this type of movie and can handle graphic violence, then I recommend it. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most of Arnie's movies, this one is extremely entertaining. It's a brainless film, with logic leaps that defy imagination, and with Arnie's usual No-I'm-not-a-300-pound-austrian-at-all-acting and with glitches and goofs that only exist in action movies. But it is oh so enjoyable, mostly because the special effects are quite nice - especially the one involving Arnie's nose - and because of the Martian scenery.It's also good to see some actors come out of the darkness for a bit. Especially Michael Ironside, who I have had a fondness for ever since the days of "V". Sharon Stone wasn't all too known back then, so she gets to show some of her charms as well.There is nothing like a mindless sci-fi-action flick to highten your mood one soggy evening. This one in particular is a great personal ice breaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sci-Fi film with many virtues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the wonderfully named "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale" by Philip K Dick(the man who also penned the equally exotically titled "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"- the short story that inspired Blade Runner)Total Recall may well be the crowning achievement of director Paul Verhoeven's hitherto illustrious career. Being ranked above such films as RoboCop and Starship Troopers is indeed no small praise for any film, but as a Action/Sci-Fi film of many virtues, Total Recall richly deserves all accolades that come its way.It is a perfect example of a breathlessly-paced film: chase after chase, gunfight after gunfight, explosion after explosion... it is all slotted in with amazing efficiency and skill. However, that is not to say plot and characters are disregarded. In fact, it has a surprisingly intricate and involving storyline for a film of its type. We are dealing with dreams and memories here, so things are, perhaps inevitably, rather contrived. However in light of the imagination and ingenuity shown by the director, this can easily be forgiven(but perhaps not forgotten, as you may well have to return to the film several times before comprehending much of it).Add to this an Arnie in great form(considering the role of Quaid requires him to show _some_ emotional depth, he does marvellously well), two great female leads, bucketloads of blood, and some eye-popping(literally!) visual effects, and you've got everything good a Sci-Fi Action film should be, and then some.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This perfect vehicle for the talents of Arnold Schwarzenegger and director Paul Verhoeven is still great to view on laserdisc a decade later. Even minor roles are perfectly cast, and Verhoeven shows he can coax the best out of every actor. On the bad guys side, Ronny Cox and Michael Ironsides are superb, and even the minor henchmen, such as Michael Champion, are great. Plus, you get Sharon Stone back when she was actually attractive. The characters in the Total Rekall office are all minor, but they are all memorable.The script has some great one-liners, which get more hilarious with each repeat viewing. My current favorite is when Arnold's character yells down at the Ironside character, as the latter falls to his death: "See you at the party, Richter!"OK, well, you had to have been there.Anyway, TOTAL RECALL is a classic, and I would hazard to suggest that it is the best adult-oriented action sci-fi film of all time.A word to parents: TOTAL RECALL has no (real) nudity, but it has just about everything else it takes to earn it a hard 'R' rating. You may want to preview it before renting it for the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the BIG question isn't it? Was Quad a REAL memory of HOUSER or was HOUSER an implanted dream of QUAID's?VERHOEVEN takes us on a cleverly edited and cleverly written story that leaves you wondering at the end just which scenario of the movie was the real one. I own this movie on video and have watched it over 20 times and I pick up new clues with each viewing.......the trouble is there are about 12 clues that HOUSER is real and QUAID is fake...... AND .........about 12 clues that QUAID is real and HOUSER is fake!Even the ending doesn't let you know! Unlike "Wild Things" which I really liked also, Recall doesn't let anything away even if you patiently sat through the credits looking for another clue either way.With the upcoming sequel they will probably let us know one way or the other and that's a shame because agonizing over the character of SCHWARZENEGGER is one of the best excuses for playing it again when friends visit (Eric you've been warned!).Until then watch it again and see if you can work it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Want to watch a great thriller blending the elements of a Sci-fi adventure with a spy flick? Then see "Total Recall" and give your brain and eyes a real treat! Arnold Schwarzenegger stars not as the usual supercop, but an innocent man with a great job and a hot "wife" (Sharon Stone). After getting a mind trip from a virtual reality center, he realizes his easy life is just a dream and soon must face bad guys trying to kill him, including his wife!"Total Recall" was a huge hit at the box office, and next to the "Terminator" flicks, this has to be Ah-nold's best movie. Not only does the big Austrian do a great job portraying a guy at the wrong place at the wrong time, but the other actors are awesome as well. Sharon Stone is excellent as the ultra-nasty killer posing as Quaid's so-called wife, and Rachael Ticotin did really well, too, as Quaid's only ally. Watch the cat fight the two actresses have midway in the film. It's my favorite fight scene in the film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, it was hokey, so what? You don't rent a Shwarzenegger film for poignant realism. That should be understood. What I love about this movie is its simple class consciousness (Kwato raising the price of air) juxtaposed with a very sophisticated and frightening critique of consumer culture. The movie is socially aware on two levels so that it may be a meaningful experience for all watchers. The more difficult message of the movie reflects itself in the fact that Quaid actually had a lobotomy at Recall during his adventures on Mars. The movie tells us that we live in a virtual society where our enjoyment is really a delusional escapism that masks a generally lobotimized state (e.g. SUV drivers imagining themselves as rugged and actualized as those on the commercials). It was brilliant how the ending is ostensibly happy (Mars is saved and Quaid kisses the girl) but actually tragic. The fake glory points to our society's state of blissful ignorance in its false conscious consumer frenzy. Beats the heck out of Matrix, that's for sure.</fullReview>

The movie develops in two places: a futurist Earth and an oppressed Mars. The opening scenes with Sharon Stone, than a fresh beauty, are very impressive. The traveling of the plot between Earth and Mars creates an atmosphere of suspense, because we do not know how it will further develop. And then there is the action. Arnold is truly in his best. Some of the scenes will remain with you for ever, like the spinning exploding woman head or the x-ray machine near the subway. One of the most impressive places is Venusville, a kind of futuristic entertainment complex, reminding of a wild west city. The quantity of make up used by the actors there is remarkable.Yes, indeed you will enjoy Arnold!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall is the cleverest action movie I've seen in a long time. The story is more complex than Mission: Impossible, and once you get it, you are really glad and you really enjoy it. It's not as violent as people say it is, no more bloodshed than Die Hard and T2. It starts off as a futuristic Action/Thriller, then after two hours you are seeing it as an epic Sci-Fi/Adventure. Schwarzenegger really helps the film with his non-relaxed, confused performance. His corny one-liners however do not help the film. I don't see how this could produce a sequel, but I hope they do make one and Paul Verhoeven helms once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than "Inception"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film like Verhooven's "Total Recall" is the ultimate proof that it doesn't take a brochette of the most 'in' and bankable stars, an overdose of digital effects or different exotic locations ? la James Bond to convince the audience they got it worth the price of their ticket and their butter pop-corn box. Story-wise, you don't need a 'serious' underacting hero, you know with the emotional scar in his heart, the 'mysterious' spot of a haunting past that keeps drawing a constipated deadpan look. You don't need some gimmicky symbolism or a juxtaposition of universes, to make an entertaining AND intelligent AND multi-layered movie. "Total Recall" is the proof that you don't need to make a seemingly intelligent film to be taken seriously. You don't achieve worldwide popularity by playing it dark and sinister. "Inception" did but it was a project of a lifetime, Nolan's darling, reuniting a stellar cast, a sure Oscar-win for the Screenplay etc. etc. Verhooven only made the usual 90's film with an action star, he didn't play it like Bergman, he didn't overdo the special-effect aspect, he made an entertaining flick yet in a scene where Arnold is confronted to Edgemar telling it's all a dream, you got to scratch your head. Yes, it's full of cheesy one-liners punctuating two gunshots, but I'd take that over any close- up on Leo's deep introspective look. I'd take Sharon Stone's (so to speak) over any Marion Cotillard, and her fight with the sleazy and demure brunette Rachel Ticotin over any Ellen Page disguised a businessman. Yes, "Inception" is made of dazzling landscapes and interminable buildings but it has no wisecracking Johnnie-Cab, no Rekall company asking you to choose the memory of a lifetime (one of the best scenes), no two-headed mutants, three-breast prostitutes, no Last Resort, no Cuato who seems like Churchill sculpted in a belly, no eye-popping when you try to breathe the atmosphere of Mars. "Inception" took its imagery for granted but didn't provide what we expect from movies : escapism .. and aren't dreams the ultimate sources of escapism? "Total Recall" was about the same idea of memories-implants, it leaves as many interrogation marks as "Inception" and even at the end, we're not sure what is true and what is a dream, but we had a great time watching this film, for all these little aspects I mentioned, it had the Martian landscape in the background and it was enough, the rest looked faker than anything from Nolan's "Inception" but are we that difficult in the 'suspension of disbelief' department. "Inception" was made and sold as a complex (understand intelligent) movie, "Total Recall" as an entertaining pop-corn flick, but lying underneath the action-adventure facade, there was some intelligence in "Total Recall", after all an adaptation from Philip K. Dick's novel. On the other hand, "Inception", as intelligent as it was, wasn't fun to watch ... because it was entrapped in its own concept, while in "Total Recall", the concept was only the trigger to the action, it still had a story to tell and some actions to show instead of keeping on 'wowing' us on the intelligence of the script.. I guess that's symptomatic of what is wrong with filmmaking today, a movie is marketed to appeal to audience in so many criteria, so many blanks you got to fill that what you've got is an easy win, this is how technical perfectionism killed pure and fun creativity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, the magnificent work of Paul Verhoeven. From time to time I tend to binge on it and plough through his whole American filmography (even including "Showgirls", when I have the courage) in a day or so, because this man is the absolute master of mixing artistic value, satire and pure unadulterated camp value. "Total Recall" is an awesome roller-coaster ride of increasingly ridiculous action set pieces. The extreme violence is not quite as raw as in "RoboCop", but it's cartoonish (yet still gory) style always gets a chuckle out of me. The best part about this though is the casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead, who delivers his cheesy one-liners with gusto and makes good use of the somewhat clueless glint in his eyes. He really brings home the point that his character has no idea what's going on, comparable to his performance in the much inferior "The 6th Day". He's also made a fantastic commentary track of this movie that I highly recommend, where he just basically describes what's happening on the screen with a childish enthusiasm, adding absolutely no behind the scenes information whatsoever. It's just an absolute treat, you won't learn a single thing about how the movie was made but it's still one of the best commentaries I've ever heard. Even without the track though this is a true classic, albeit a pretty sleazy one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Recall- One of the best sci-fi genre movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review of mine is more like my voice of disagreement with people who didn't like the 2012 version of Total Recall. But first I'll point out what I liked about both the versions.Total Recall(1990)- Of course Arnold. I felt a certain rawness in his act which I liked. He actually looked unaware of things going around, as his character required. For Sharon Stone,she was simply stunning! Enough said. The story was far ahead of it times and stands the same even today thats why it deserved a remake. This is the 2nd movie of Paul Verhoeven's direction that I have seen.(I have seen Hollowman), and his amazing work in Total Recall and Sharon Stone are the 2 reasons, I want to see Basic Instinct now. Also I liked the fact that this was one of the last movies which used miniatures,like for showing Mars planet. Bravo to the team, amazing work. Overall, an entertaining concept, performance and movie.Total Recall(2012)- I liked the major change in the original screenplay and not using idea of Mars and still keeping the same concept of the original Total Recall. Requires a lot of creativity to bring out and create something new from something which is already a blockbuster. Thats the most exciting part of this version. Of course there are scenes which are more of a tribute to the original and shot with new technology and effects. Colin Farrell is an amazing actor. I liked him in the flick 'The Recruit'(2003) and for me he was equally good in this one. Also in this movie, Colin Farrel doing a smooch scene with the director's wife(Kate Beckinsale) in front of him, requires a lot of confidence and professionalism. But Kate comes nowhere close to the charisma of Sharon Stone. Jessica Biel here stole the show. She did a good act. Len Wiseman as a director did take a risk of choosing this remake and I appreciate he came up with something like this. I liked his work in 'Die Hard 4'. This movie is not as huge hit as its predecessor, but its neither a complete washout. But personally I liked the remake and it was entertaining for me.Comparisions- I don't care why critics panned the 2012 version. Both versions were quite different in terms of execution of the same concept. Also I equally liked the sets and the ambiance created in both the movies. In the end, either ways I enjoyed the experience of Total Recall(just like Inception). But still if I had to pickup one thing better from another, then I would say, Total Recall(2012) missed out a point because it didn't have Sharon Stone! Must watch both of them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great action movie that actually, god forbid, has a plot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying, wow! Arnold Schwarzenegger actually plays a convincing real person! Aside from his cloud-like body, where his arm takes up the entire screen with its muscular awesomeness, he convinced me that he was a regular construction worker with an intense desire to go to "maas" (Mars in Schwarzeneggerish). A, cliché words incoming, compelling and thought-provoking story centers around Arnold's character, Douglas Quaid, going to a company called Recall that provides fake memories of vacations, so he can take a vacation to Mars without having to make his wife unhappy. He chooses the popular "Secret Agent" theme for his vacation, but something goes wrong and he is thrust into a conspiracy, where he discovers that he is really a covert agent for a corrupt businessman who wants to control Mars's air supplies. It keeps you guessing until the end, with clever and intense scenes that will really make you wonder if Quaid is only playing out his Mars vacation at Recall, or if it is all real. Finally, one cannot make a review of Total Recall without mentioning two things. One, the three-boobed prostitute mutant. This rather unexpected moment is both hilarious and philosophical. Weird isn't it? The second thing is Arnold's amazing one-liners. Don't make the mistake in thinking this isn't an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. Quips like "See you at the party, Richter!" and "Consider that a divorce!" are just the beginning of a pool of quotable lines.</fullReview>

Dick, who originally wrote the film.Second, this movie was made with real people on real sets. There wasn't the abuse of the overuse of CGI and Green Screens we see today that frankly come off more and more as a blur where storytelling is lost. True, there was a lot of miniatures and special makeup effects, but that's what made it epic.THird, the characters. Arnold, Sharon Stone, Michael Ironsides, Ronny Cox, Rachel Ticotin- all made their characters intense and real, as opposed to zombies standing in front of a green screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took ten years before this project was made. First they searched for a director and after seen Dino De Laurentiis said go but when the money has to be brought on table Dino became broke. Patrick Swayze should have played the main role as Quaid but it never happened because another man was hunting for the role, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Once he knew that the whole project was on sale he informed the right persons and a cult classic was made.It's an excellent flick with a lot of effects done by Rob Bottin already famous for The Thing (1982). There's enough science-fiction to see and it even becomes bloody and gory in some parts. It also started the real career of Sharon Stone as Lori. But not only she, all the acting is sublime.It could never been made if Blade Runner (1982) didn't start this kind of science-fiction flicks. A must have in all collections. Paul Verhoeven was the director and in his best period, before Total recall he just made Robocop (1987), after Total recall Basic Instinct (1992).Gore 2/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

Armed police suddenly invade the place, and Doug finds himself embroiled in a conspiracy where his is a double (or triple) agent who has had his memories replaced with fake ones, is married to someone who is actually an agent/minder and not really his wife (Sharon Stone, in her breakout role), and ends up plotting against (or possibly unwittingly for), dictator Kolhaagen (Ronnie Cox) while falling in with his real lover (or is she) Melina (Rachel Ticotin). Or is this all part of his "holiday"? This brash, ebullient sci-fi romp, based on a Philip K Dick short story, is huge fun. Paul Verhoeven handles the action well, all the actors enjoy themselves (Schwarzenegger's shortcomings as an actor are outweighed by his screen presence and verve), effects, makeup and set design are all excellent, and Sharon Stone is unbelievably sexy.Plus the story is good fun, and never lets you go.</fullReview>

His wife is Lori(Sharon Stone), and she tells him to stay on their home planet as civil unrest is common on mars. He visits a company called Rekall that plants memory chips into clients to let them experience simulated travel. Doug asks for a trip to mars and as he is being implanted, jumps off the table and fights the team. When he goes home, he is attacked by coworkers, who he kills, and then informed by his wife that their marriage is a sham. Thus begins the long journey, ad Doug is followed by bad men with bad intentions. He travels to the real mars and enters the red light district where he encounters several strange mutants who were exposed to radiation. He meets Melina, a former lover from his previous life as Hauser, a guy who worked for a villain named Cohaagen. More memory tricks are played on Doug/Hauser, and the plot is interesting with well choreographed action scenes, and a good ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A construction worker who looks like an Austrian bodybuilder, who may or may not be a secret agent. Alien mutants with psychic powers. A marinate cab driver. A dwarf girl with a machine gun. A beautiful buff big haired 80's ball busting Sharon Stone.Let's travel back to July of 1990 when a new science fiction adventure movie was released that seemed to capture everybody's attention, back when a guy's movie meant a man's movie and you had to wait six months or longer for it to arrive home on VHS or laserdisc. But you won't need a time machine, just a newfangled DVD or Blu-ray player and get your hands on the 1990 version of Total Recall. Starring a never better and still in his prime Arnold Schwarzenegger, who here gives closer to a real performance than anyone was used to. No less than Roger Ebert praised big Arnold for his acting in this one. From Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, who was fresh off the equally great RoboCop and a string of excellent films from his native homeland, Soldier of Orange being the best.This is what action movies seriously are all about. Featuring an array of then stunning visual effects, now perhaps gloriously out dated. Rubber monsters and miniatures are used courtesy of the legendary Rob Bottin, the kind of stuff some of us have never gotten over. In a gorephically violent over the top manner, that is nothing like what is to be found in the watered down contemporary PG-13 rated action pictures, so extreme in fact that the movie had to be cut to avoid an X-rating.To say I can't get enough of Total Recall would be an understatement. And I'm not alone, the movie was a huge blockbuster in it's time, now a cult classic, based in part on a short story by Blade Runner author Philip K. Dick. The picture earned critical praise and audience adulation becoming one of the corner stones of the then booming action film.Today, along with the Terminator movies and Predator, this is one of Schwarzenegger's most recognizable and beloved movies. Set in 2084, and using a totally original look at the familiar genre clichés. It's easy to see why audiences flocked to this, and why so many are still singing it's praises. With exceptionally filmed action scenes, a sly sense of humor, and an unexpected ambiguous ending. This wasn't just a run of the mill action picture, even in it's day.Not like so many of today's movies that are overflowing with just too much CGI, weak storytelling and dull characters. Why a remake know, after a mere twenty-two years, well I would guess because this never had the opportunity to became a franchise, despite long standing rumors of a sequel, that the producers could milk for future dollars. With no sense of history, many audiences will most likely never see, or even if they did see, be able to enjoy the quaint pleasures of this genre classic. A different kind of beast than they are used too, something more mythical, perhaps.I don't want to get preachy here, we are all entitled to like what we like, but for many of us the good old days are really over for good, but a classic never goes out of style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know, I was not the fasted kid in the class. I liked Schwarzenegger's movies when I was little. I have seen Total Recall over and over. Great action movie, great soundtrack Even when the cast is announced it has great music on the background. Special effects were great. If you know what people can do much easier than they could do then, I still have much respect for the people who made this movie.I know a lot of people might already know what had been bugging a lot of people; was it all a dream or not? We get to see the answer when Douglas Quaid is going on his trip to recall. It is right at the beginning of the movie where he meets this boy Ernie and dr. Lull. Dr. Lull is asking Douglas some questions and shows him some alien artifacts. The she gives something to Ernie and Ernie says; "That's a new one. Blue sky on Mars." And just there this Ernie shows us it all has been a dream. If it would have been reality, it should have been coincidence that Douglas met this woman he choose numbered 41A, but it could not have been coincidence that Douglas created a blue sky on Mars.So on the first sight this Ernie had a small role in this movie. But after viewing this movie a lot of times he was the key to an important answer; "What if this all was a dream?" Now this peace of puzzle if solved. Douglas Quaid was dreaming and after his kiss with Melina under the blue sky he should wake up some time. So when he wakes up he is still married to Lori. If that would not mess someone's head...Great movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven's Box-Office Winner 'Total Recall' is a Weird, Interesting, Gruesome &amp; at times, Confusing film, that can be viewed only by those who can digest 'Gore' in cinema. However, I had some fun while viewing this Sci-Fi flick.'Total Recall' tells the story of an apparently unsophisticated construction worker, Doug Quaid, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is either a patient for a failed memory implant procedure or a freedom fighter from Mars relocated to Earth. He attempts to restore order and reverse the corrupt influence of commercial powers, all while faced with the possibility that none of these events are real and pursuing them could damage his brain.An interesting idea, but Verhoeven's take on it is simply weird. His take on Mars and how it would look if humans lived there, are unique and beyond imagination. There is a particular character of a prostitute, located in Mars, who offers a set of 3 breasts! Now, excuse me, but there is a character like that in here, and even gets enough time to hook your memory. Moving on, The Writing is solid at places, but goes confusing at times. Cinematography by Jost Vacano is perfect. Editing is fair.Acting-Wise: Arnold Schwarzenegger is superb. In fact, he gets it right from start to end. Rachel Ticotin is decent, while Sharon Stone comes across as mysterious. Ronny Cox is effective as the main antagonist. Michael Ironside is earnest. Ray Baker &amp; Mel Johnson, Jr. are ordinary.On the whole, I had some fun, but I didn't have a complete blast. I'd say, to those who don't mind such gore on celluloid, should check it out once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain films that aim to entertain and try their very hardest to keep the audience entertained, if not on the edge of their seat, but rarely are they also capable of making the audience think. This movie is fun from start to finish, but it also manages to keep you thinking about reality and the implications of the ideas presented in the movie.Total Recall is certainly one of the better films to come from director Paul Verhoeven whose career I must say has its ups and down. He's has RoboCop, which I also thought was a fun action/satire, but then films such as Starship Troopers had me far less impressed. He is certainly better when adapting short stories in a satirical fashion than he is adapting professionally written stories and trying to satirize them like he did with Starship Troopers- Verhoeven's resulting film seeming more like an insult to its source material instead of an adaptation.Total Recall movie is based on a short story by the late Philip K. Dick, who also wrote the stories behind Blade Runner, Minority Report, and A Scanner Darkly. Unlike Blade Runner and Minority Report this is one of the more satirical approaches on sci-fi and it does have some good laughs among its fun sets and action, but like those two films it provides some of the best science-fiction imagery to date.Of course, being released in 1990, what better male lead in an action film than Arnold Schwarzenegger? Now, the future California Governor has never been the best actor, but he manages to find one of his stand-out roles in Douglass Quaid, a man who is under constant danger and isn't even capable of knowing whether the dangers he faces are real or not! Tired with his life as a construction worker Douglass Quaid is set on having a vacation to Mars. Only problem is he's a tad bit low on cash and his wife isn't very keen on taking a trip to the Martian surface- which is currently under a state of civil unrest and urban warfare between the mutants and the evil business leader, Vilos Cohaagon, who quite literally has an airtight grip over the citizens of Mars. Since going to Mars is out of the question Quaid goes for the next best thing: fake memories.After a visit to Rekall he has it arranged for him to be given a vacation to Mars from the perspective of a secret agent on a crucial mission. This dream comes a bit too true as he is thrust into a fight for his life, never knowing whether or not what he is seeing is real or not. The audience can't tell for that matter for there is enough evidence to support either option.Total Recall is good escapist entertainment and is often quite funny in a black sort of way. Arnold Schwarzenegger is charismatic in the lead and manages to deliver several good one-liners (other than the cheesy "Screw you!"). The art direction, special effects, costumes, make-up, and sets are all quite convincing and fun to look at and overall it is a film that always keeps your attention in some form or another. I give a strong recommendation to Total Recall, but the film does seem to stay in check and never take to initiative to go above and beyond like Blade Runner and Minority Report have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't spoil the plot of this movie if I wanted to... even though I've seen it 40 times since it's 1990 release I have yet to decide if the filmmakers had an actual, logical story in mind or just decided to numb the viewer with twists, effects and lots of things that go boom. The answer is, it doesn't matter."Total Recall" stands as a definitive 90's action film... just enough substance to set up the fight scenes, explosions and laser-blasts. Every generation throws a mono-syllabic action hero to the top of the box office, and the 90's answer to John Wayne or Sylvester Stallone was unanimously-elected Arnold Schwarzenegger, who never met a bad guy or a sentence that he couldn't mangle. Arnie's accent and muscle-borne stiffness seemed to oddly liberate the creative minds in the directors and producers with whom he worked, from James Cameron's two "Terminators" to John McTiernan's "Predator." He works the same magic in "Total Recall," a movie that resembles a PCP-induced hallucination: The Future... on Mars... multiple identities... paranoid delusions... It's like a big bag of buttery popcorn: delicious while it lasts, but no nutritional value.And popcorn's okay, from time to time, but I wouldn't want to live on it. Thanks to crisp cinematography and its "elusive" plot, "Total Recall" still survives today as an exciting action flick. What are you waiting for? Get your ass to Mars...GRADE: B</fullReview>

But when it comes to things on the surface, basically what more could you want from a film: classic Arnie one-liners, buckets of blood and gore, loads of mindless swearing and a woman with three norks!

The action is fast, Schwarzenegger is not the worst actor of the cast and although there is a lot of overacting in the film (Ironside, Cox), it still is very enjoyable to watch. Due to Verhoevens tremendous feeling for the right momentum and his courage of going over the edge, which Verhoeven has done many times in the past.

Going against a friend's advice, Quaid goes to company that instills memories to check his memory and soon uncovers that not only is everything not as it seems, but Quaid himself is not who he thinks he is.From the get-go this movie may seem like a sure-fire failure - a big studio financed science fiction movie with from complex source material. However, like 2002's 'Minority Report' this is also a terrific, twisty, adrenaline-rush of a film. Using elaborate sets and effects, which are pre-digital landscapes so that makes them even more amazing, the film shows an engrossing vision of the future. The success of the production is that the action and effects are kept second to the veering conspiracy storyline and that is what makes the movie very interesting, in addition to very exciting. Also, some great darkly toned, dead pan comic relief is inserted here and there along with Ronny Cox in another great "slime-in-an-Armani suit role" that tops his performance in RoboCop.A minor strike against the film is violence, while not senseless, limits the film to be as enjoyable for everyone as 'Minority Report.' However, it remains a thrilling science fiction actioner that ranks among Arnold's few truly great movies. 9/10Rated R for strong graphic violence, and profanity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzengger stars as Doug Quaid (Persumably no relation to Dennis or Randy) an average joe who gets an artificial vacation only to be swayed into taking an ego trip which his presumed secret agent fantasy turns out to be real to which millions of bad guys come to kill him, there is also about martians, mutants, rebels and politics regarding the price of air. The book originally had the character (Named Quail in the story) get a secret agent vacation to break up his dull life only to wind up awakening his past, where he actually was a secret agent, in the movie though it basically toys with the idea that this is either a dream, his artificial vacation, reality or a product of his lobotomized mind. Once again this all makes the movie ambitious and frequently enjoyable but Verhoeven's kill crazy antics are generally too overwrought for the material and therefore the action takes priority over the story. However there is enough greatness to work and it is an entertaining movie. It just isn't as great as it could have been.* * * out of 4-(Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rachel Ticotin's greatest movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, you may ask yourself: "Who is Rachel Ticotin and why should I know about her?" The answer: two movies: "Fort Apache, the Bronx" and this movie. I won't comment here about her role in "Fort Apache..." but as for this movie, although Arnold Schwarzenneggar and Sharon Stone have top billing, as far as I'm concerned, it is Ms. Ticotin who made "Total Recall" work. In this movie she is beautiful and heroic and sensitive and loyal. She dominates every scene that she is in and carries the movie. In one scene, she slaps "Doug" and throws him out, and then in the close-up of her face she reveals all of her anguish knowing that she has spurned the man she loved ... and still loves. The inclusion of such a scene came as a surprise to me. It was a great scene. As for the story itself, it's intriguing and the main characters are either very good or very bad. Nothing new there. But if you're a fan of Rachel Ticotin, then watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before this movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger had shown his impressive acting abilities by playing a killer cyborg, a barbarian, a commando, a marine, and Hercules. In "Total Recall", he actually plays a character that goes against type: he's a regular guy, albeit one with the physique of a Mr. Universe, who is thrust into extraordinary circumstances.Or is he? That's the central question of "Total Recall", and we're left wondering throughout the movie what Ah-nold's real identity is (I won't spoil any surprises here). It's a fantastic sci-fi set-up, especially when you throw the main setting of Mars into the mix.The plot: Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker in the year 2084 who's been having weird dreams about living on Mars. There's a mystery woman in his dreams, a brunette, who sparks jealousy in his wife (played by Sharon Stone, who's also pretty good in this; it's one of the earliest things I remember seeing her in). Quaid sees an ad for a place called Rekall, which implants vacations in people's memories that are as good as the real thing. So he goes to Rekall, gets a memory-vacation package for Mars where he plays the part of a spy and that includes the woman in his dreams, and that's when things go haywire.This is where the central mystery of who Schwarzenegger really is starts. All of a sudden, he's thrust into a complex story of some rebels on Mars trying to overcome their ruthless dictator Cohaagen, and he's a central part of the story. Here's where it gets twisty: it comes into question whether he's actually Douglas Quaid or this spy named Hauser who's involved in the whole thing! All of a sudden, his wife and friends turn against him, he's on the run from Cohaagen's lieutenant Richter (played by Michael Ironside) and (on the advice of himself, as Hauser) he must make his way to Mars, where he gets embroiled in a plot to help the rebels, mostly a bunch of mutants. They are led by Kuato, a psychic mutant coming out of the abdomen of a fellow named George (Marshall Bell). And his dream girl also comes into the picture in the person of Melina (Rachel Ticotin, who's fabulous), who's also trying to help the rebels. Always on your mind as you're watching this movie is the question: What's real, and what's merely a mind-implant? Is the whole movie from the point he visited Rekall a dream, or was the life he knew the dream? And also coming into the play is the question of whose side Hauser is actually supposed to be on, and what this reactor built by the original Martians a million years ago is supposed to do, exactly...Based on the story "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale" by the great Philip K. Dick (who also wrote the story "Blade Runner" was based on), and directed by Paul Verhoeven ("Robocop"), "Total Recall" is consistently thrilling and amazing, with some incredible visuals, including the barren surface of the planet Mars, and the station where the residents of Mars are housed. Of course, it's a great action movie. There's also a lot of great humor (including a mutant hooker with three breasts), terrific special effects, and constant plot twists throughout (unlike many other Schwarzenneger films, this one makes you think). This movie is easily one of the best Schwarzenegger has ever done (he actually puts in a decent acting job, probably his best ever), and also one of the best sci-fi thrillers ever made. The ending, though it stretches credibility, is a brilliant, old-time sci-fi ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Open to Interpretation, So Here's Mine. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that, yes, this movie is open to interpretation. But that doesn't mean everyone can't give their own interpretations and offer reasons for them.Here's mine: the whole thing was NOT a dream.Quaid's dreams in the beginning of the movie when he's still in his "regular life" with Sharon Stone--his actual memories trying to poke through. The movie establishes later that he had a relationship with Melina before he was with Sharon Stone.Many scenes take place without Quaid being present and/or when he is unconscious. These scenes are totally inexplicable if it's all his dream/implant.Watch the Rekall Center scenes--the technicians are talking about him, while he's knocked out. We would not experience this if it were all supposed to be his dream. One of them says "we didn't implant it yet" meaning they did not implant his little vacation and that there was a "memory cap," which had erased or locked away all of his memories. All this happens when Quaid's knocked out. If this were all a ruse/part of his implant, they would have done it while he was awake to make him think it were true. Instead, only the viewers experience this.The reactors, Melina, etc. that pop up during the Rekall Center scenes-- The techs were asking Quaid questions about his preferences. He was already hooked up to their monitoring machines while this was happening. He begins to fall asleep while they are monitoring his mind. He doesn't verbally answer the last question. But somehow, the techs know what he wants. This can only mean they get this info from their monitoring machines, which are hooked into his mind. Of course they pull these things (Melina, the reactors, etc) out of his mind because they were already in there from his real life as a secret agent.Sharon Stone, the agent's sweat bead do not make sense if it is a dream.Of course he can use kung fu moves, he's practiced and perfected these things while training as an agent to the point where he merely reacts with these movements, and doesn't think about them. He did not have occasion to use these things as a construction worker, so they did not "pop out of nowhere" during that time in his life. Kind of reminds me of Jason Bourne. You can have your identity wiped but still retain non-identity things, such as kung fu skills, intelligence, etc. Bourne finds out, as he needs to do something, that he can do it.Last point--if it's a dream, then this movie totally sucks. I'm not a viewer who likes to know he's invested two hours in a movie with great action, plot twists, intrigue, and a great ending only to find out it's all been a dream. What the hell was the point of the last two hours, then? It was all happening in his mind, so it didn't matter one iota? A thriller only works if there's real danger, with actual consequences. If the consequences are this average, everyday construction worker gets lobotomized because someone has screwed up his implant, then the universe is a sick, malevolent place, isn't it? Kind of contrary to the whole outcome of the plot--the good guy wins, saves the planet, gets the girl. A true thriller/actioner operates on the premise that the side of good can win, and does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few films in which the plot is confusing, sometimes preposterous, but it's still worth checking out. As I said, just go along for the ride and you should have fun. The story and premise are quite original--I'll give the writers that. Paul Verhoeven beautifully handles the fast-paced action sequences. Basically, I lost touch with the plot about halfway through, but I still enjoyed it throughout. Many people I know conjure up the memory of the hooker with the three breasts the minute the film's title is mentioned, but believe me--there's a lot more the film has to offer! Arnold Schwarzenegger, though still no Shakespearean actor, obviously needed a lot of brushing up on his acting skills when the film was made. However, he does deliver one of his greatest lines: "Consider that a divorce." Sharon Stone is sexy as usual, and she gets into a neat catfight with the equally sexy Rachel Ticotin. Of course, it's not the usual hair-pulling catfight you see in some movies, but it's just neat to see two sexy ladies go at it. Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox make neat villains. Those who are squeamish, and unaware of most of Verhoeven's work, should steer away since there is some amazingly graphic violence, even though some scenes were trimmed to get the R-rating. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven perfected in Total Recall and Starship Troopers the super-satirical, anti-establishment outlook that he tried with very limited success to capture in RoboCop. Total Recall and Starship Troopers are perhaps the two smartest SF movies ever made. Both have deep themes, and both are supremely entertaining and can be watched over and over again. When I think of all the horrible movies that are being made every year, one of my few consolations is to remember that perfect, visionary action feasts like Total Recall and Starship Troopers also exist.Total Recall was a hit with me since the first time I saw it in 1990. It posed a number of questions about its own structure that I struggled with for years, before finally understanding: The *entire movie* is the Rekall implant. From the first frame to the last. Both Quaid's comfortable life/wife, his job at the construction site, his visit to Rekall - it's ALL part of the implanted experience. That way everything makes sense, and it's just beautifully made.Also in terms of the overall production values, the movie is immensely well-made by 1990 standards. Great actors, great story, some funny dialog and lots of splendid action and excitement.10 out of 10, definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget Schwarzenegger in the Terminator trilogy, forget Schwarzenegger in "Predator", forget Schwarzenegger in "True Lies", this is the ultimate Schwarzenegger role. He really is at his best in this movie which is mainly thanks to Verhoeven's directing.The beginning has Verhoeven written all over it. It's gross and terribly shocking the first time you'll see it. The rest of the movie is also filled with Verhoeven's typical style of violence and gore. The scene in which Schwarzenegger's character uses a innocent civilian as a human shield who gets shot multiple times is the best example of the typical Verhoeven style in the movie. But like in all his movie's the violence never feels forced or overdone and is used in a brilliant way like only a man like Verhoeven can.Not only Schwarzenegger is casted well, so is the rest of the cast. Especially the villains are deliciously stereotypical. Michael Ironside is always at this best in roles like this and Ronny Cox basically plays his "RoboCop" villain role all over again but hey I'm not complaining about it.The music by Jerry Goldsmith (his personal favorite) is really good and one of his best works.The special effects are acceptable and the make-up is truly fantastic.Still for some reason its not really a movie that I enjoy watching multiple times. I don't know why, I can't really put my finger on it but I think it has to do with the typical 80's atmosphere of the movie (even though the movie is from 1990.). Even though the movie is fun it times, with some typical dark Verhoeven humor it isn't always a pleasant watch.Not Verhoeven's best but still a little science-fiction/action masterpiece.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It not so much too violent as it contains too much violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Total Recall" is an adaptation of a popular Philip K. Dick story combined with the touches of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Paul Verhoeven. With a multifaceted story involving repressed memories, a repressive dictator and a stolen identity, the potential was there for a classic exercise in thrill that would offer more than just spilt blood. Under a more ambitious director, it could have been terrific, but instead it falls into the mire of repetition and tedium.The film is set in a future where the world is divided between two warring factions, one of which has colonized Mars for mining. Vilos Cohagen (Ronny Cox) is the appointed head of the planet and rules with a tyrannical hand. On earth, we are introduced to Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker married to the woman of his dreams (Sharon Stone). The only blemish on their marriage is his constant dreams about Mars and a mysterious brunet that inhabits them (Rachel Ticotin). Hoping to settle his mind, Quaid visits Recall Inc., a highly unusual travel agency that implants the memory of a vacation. However, the implant awakens another set of memories before it can be fully downloaded.Dazed and confused, Quaid tries to figure out why he has such strong memories of the red planet and why people are suddenly trying to kill him. The theory is that he was a spy on Mars, but somebody went to great lengths to erase his past. The scene is complicated by the appearance of Richter (Michael Ironside), a vicious hit man on Cohagen's payroll.Not surprisingly, the stunts are directed by Vic Armstrong, arguably the best in the business. His credits include all three Indiana Jones films, "Last Action Hero," the acclaimed sword fight in "Rob Roy" and the last four Bond movies. "Total Recall" is no exception. Every stunt and fight scene in the film, all 300 of them, are made with great skill.Unfortunately, the film dives head-first into overkill. Not fifteen minutes into the film, the first attempt is made on Quaid's life, leading to a brutal altercation. From there on, the action never stops. As more and more violent encounters occur, the film grows weary and flirts with monotony. The same sequence ensues in a subway station, at customs, in air domes, hotels, strip clubs and gubernatorial mansions, among a hoard of other settings. I truly lost count of the times that Richter's men attack, gunshots fill the air, enough bad guys are killed to give Quaid a crease to run away, and the process resets itself, and I have not even mentioned the psychotic cabbie who never dies.One of the hang ups with action films is the reality that too much of it can and will grow boring. By the time the climax comes, the viewer has had more then their fill of violence and loud bangs. Instead of cheering for the good guys, I was cheering because the film was about to end.To test that sentiment, I had a good night's sleep, and refreshing morning shower, then skipped up the final scene. I was taken aback by how exhilarant it was when it seemed so pedestrian the night before. One part in particular, an all-out brawl on an elevator, reminded me of the original classic in "From Russia With Love." Thankfully, the acting is good in the few moments where the film slows enough to have some. Arnold himself is less of a featureless tough guy, as he sometimes is, and more human. He feels rage, confusion, love and sadness. As far as true acting, 'Total Recall' is one of Arnie's finest moments. Also notable are the vicious Ironside and the lovely Sharon Stone, who makes her mark every time she moves her intoxicating eyes. My favorite performance, though, came from Roy Brocksmith who plays a recall doctor in one scene and steals the show when he is on camera.Had the story been handled more skillfully and the action not been so pervading, I would have loved "Total Recall" and recommended it without second thoughts. Even an action junkie is likely to be exhausted by the extreme overdose. Towards the end of the movie, I had an inspired thought about none other than Quentin Tarantino. After his decision to split "Kill Bill" into two films, he came under fire for using a coercive marketing ploy to double his money. Seeing what too much action can do to an otherwise worthy effort, was his choice not the right one?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Script Helps Solid Sci-Fi Actioner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film to date is a solid sci-fi actioner mixing a superior script with a good cast, some impressive special effects, and one of Jerry Goldsmith's most rip-roaring scores ever.Based on a Philip K. Dick short story, the film is about Douglas Quaid, a construction worker in late-21st century America who has a curious passion for the planet Mars, now colonized and tyrannized by corporate dictator Vilos Cohaagen. His passion has led to several violent nightmares that alarm his wife Lori, and eventually leads him to Rekall, a company that implants fake "memories" of exciting vacations in the brains of curious clients. But implanting a fake memory of a trip to Mars unlocks something else in Quaid, and suddenly this lowly construction worker is pursued by his worker friends, his wife, and a deranged assassin named Richter.Making things more confusing, Quaid is contacted by a "buddy" from Mars he doesn't remember and given a suitcase containing a vast compilation of Martian money, weird tools, a hologram projection wristwatch, and a video message machine from.......himself!Quaid is really Douglas Hauser, an assassin for Cohaagen who has fallen in love with a Martian guerrilla leader (Rachel Ticotin) and who has had his entire life "erased" by Cohaagen. The answers to Quaid's questions lie on Mars, but as he is pursued by Richter, Quaid finds out even more about Mars, including the secret to the planet's pyramid mines - a secret Cohaagen can't afford to let out.But Quaid is double-crossed, and by the most unlikely person imaginable, leading to a brutal slaughter of the Martian resistance and reimplantation for Quaid.The film's excitement comes from its seemingly endless action scenes. If anything, there are a few too many action scenes and a bit too much gore - the riot in Venusville, the famed spaceport gunfight and oxygen hurricane, and a battle of underground drills within the surface of Mars are scenes that could and should have been left out and replaced by more character interplay. Also excessive is the film's gore, particularly in the portrayal of the mysterious Kuato, who should have been portrayed as an alien being in the form of Land Of The Lost's Enik.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, the plot is good and most of the movie is well-executed -- but the director ought to be shot for the completely unreal, cartoonish ending of this movie. It's at that point that your suspension of disbelief breaks down and you think, "What sloppy production." Phillip K. Dick, unfortunately, is spinning in his grave (though after 12 years, his rotations may have slowed somewhat). Another problem is the level of violence. Whoa -- this is one gory film. In fact, it's probably the goriest movie I've ever seen. And it really didn't need to be. It could've stood on the merits of its plot and action. Instead, the director produced a film I'll =never= let my kids watch, which is a shame, because the plot is a good one. This could've been a much better film if they had only changed it slightly, especially by making the ending believable. Instead, the director chose to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. "Total Recall" really shoulda been a 7 or even an 8 (which is really pretty good) -- instead, even without any discount for gratuitous gore, I have to give this movie only about a 4.</fullReview>

The result is; Arnold looks out of place, that huge, muscular man that tries to pass off as an ordinary Joe, is ridiculously obvious and gives a cartoony image that I feel was was not needed for the role. For her part, Ticotin's appearance gives this movie a strong 80's feel, shared by nearly all the other females with their hideous hairdos. I must also regret the presence of a typically funny but submissive token black sidekick for a good while. Hey maybe we"re on Mars but we're sure not that far off from Hollywood.The tone of the film, anyway, is also a problem: If Verhoven managed to include satire in his ultra-violence settings ("Total Recall" is needlessly gory, to the enjoyment of many), here is makes for an awkward mix, literally the worse of both worlds. The effects, advanced for the time, aged and are now grotesque. The "fat lady" bit at the customs, among others, was totally random.As for the general plot, I didn't read the novel but the story was good, although I felt it was dumbed down a bit to fit into the format. The sets were fine (all that money ought to be spent elsewhere than on Arnold), but not well exploited by a vision that lacked grandeur.Immersion here is difficult. "Total Recall", in this day and age, reveals itself as a mediocre sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set sometime in the distant future, 'Total Recall' initially starts with the premise of robbing ones memory and then renting it to someone and then it smoothly shifts to a story of good versus evil. Given the premise the movie could have been a lot deeper and darker rather than go about with the usual Hollywood formula. Yet, it's a highly entertaining action sci-fi. Director Verhoeven loads 'Total Recall' with enough energy, sex, action and creativity to keep the viewer engaged. Arnold Schwarzenegger is solid as the action hero. They rarely make them this way any more. Sharon Stone is alluring and evil as his lethal bitchy wife and Rachel Ticotin is fiery as Quaid's 'true love'. Now what would an action film be without a villain? Michael Ironside fits the role like a puzzle. The action sequences are amusing to look at. The set design and makeup are very impressive. The makeup particularly makes the characters look authentic. However, the special effects aren't of the best quality. The blue screen filtering is very poor. Note, this was made during the pre-CGI era and this flaw is comparatively minor as it does not stop 'Total Recall' from being enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this lousy movie supposed to mean?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film does not appeal to me at all, and I am a big Arnie and sci-fi fan. Everything in this movie, from dialogue to the futuristic world looked so artificial to me; as though it wasn't finished or something. Story is pretty lousy and quite confusing. That's not to say there isn't story, it is just and simply bad. Perhaps there was an effort to make a good movie, but it fell short of even comparing itself with the standard average action flicks like Hard to Kill or Cobra. I really cannot like this movie as much as I want to and my rating says it all: 4/10. Wanna a good Arnold movie? Watch The Terminator, and you will never want to see this crap again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been out and about for full 20 years now, and amazingly I first saw it yesterday. If only I knew...This is one of those special films that are so bad they are actually enjoyable. Had I seen it way back when it was still new, I strongly believe I would have been seriously offended, maybe even asked my money back. But the passage of time has been generous to it, and now Arnie's wooden one-liners can finally be perceived as hilarious. I admit it, I laughed my head off at least three times.Apparently, someone paid about $60 million for this mess, and that was twenty years ago. This is mind-boggling, because the special effects look more or less like those of Plan 9 from Outer Space. Which cost about two dollars. But that also adds charm, in much the same way. Come to think of it, Paul Verhoeven is something like Ed Wood on steroids. Lots of steroids. Oceans of steroids, or even galaxies of them.A good film? Nooooooooooo!!! An enjoyable one? Well, with the right attitude...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How Arnold Schwarzenegger rose to become one of Hollywood's best paid stars is even more of mystery than his subsequent ascent up the political ladder. On the basis of his performance in 'Total Recall', he can't act, his mastery of the English language is limited, he's not even conventionally handsome and, most bizarrely for a star of action films, he runs like a man with a war wound. Paul Verhoeven's film is a comedy thriller made in the late 1980s but set in a future that looks like... well, actually it looks remarkably like the 1980s, with plenty of concrete, advertising, big hair and a portable computer the size of a suitcase. Given the film's massive budget, the failure to convey any sense of the vast otherness of space is a particular disappointment. '2001: A Space Odyssey' did better in this respect over 20 years earlier; the feel of 'Total Recall's vision is more akin to that of 'Star Trek'.The holey plot is based on some interesting ideas that have since been re-used in films like (obviously) 'The Matrix' but also David Fincher's 'The Game': what is reality, and how can we tell? but both those films were far better executed than this. Meanwhile, the (intentional) "comedy" is provided by a prostitute with three breasts, Arnie swearing (something which happens a lot) and by an endless sequence of comic-book fight scenes that are neither convincing, exciting or funny (unless one happens to regard Sharon Stone kicking Arnie in the balls as inherently hilarious: one really needs to do so to enjoy this film, as this also happens on numerous occasions). The unintentional comedy derives from Arnie's performance.If anyone ever re-makes this film, I advise them to save money by hiring a block of wood instead of Schwarzenegger: they'll probably get a better performance out of it. Instead, they should hire instead a decent scriptwriter and a director/designer with some imagination. In it's current incarnation, it's really not good, and as an actor, Arnie makes a damn fine politician.</fullReview>

The special effects are still great, we see Arnold take an ax to a few people, rip off Michael Ironside's iron arms, shoot people, bangs Sharon Stone, eats apple pie, and many other actions such as walking and talking. Paul Verybigchoda directs this sci-fi masterpiece. This could be better than his Robocop. How can you go wrong when you see a woman with three breasts? THREE!

		<shortDescription>Entertainingly violent sci-fi actioner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is a reminder of how big budget Hollywood action flicks used to be. Unlike nowadays, they went straight for an 18 certificate and made no attempt to make themselves available for a wide PG audience. This film typifies this approach with a huge amount of over-the-top violence. It was a style well suited to its director Paul Verhoeven who had already directed Robocop in a similar vein. Total Recall lacks the fun satirical element of that film and instead ramps up the action to very high-octane levels. It of course stars Arnold Schwarzenegger who at the time was on a run of highly entertaining action flicks. This one isn't the best of them for me but it still has enough about it to ensure it remains interesting.It's based on a story by author Philip K. Dick whose work had been translated into the film Blade Runner earlier. Although I have never read the book that inspired Total Recall, I have heard that the movie only plays lip-service to it and it's a substantially different thing. This is hardly surprising news given the focus on action over ideas. Although, in fairness, the ideas presented are still quite good in places ? even if the story is somewhat too convoluted for its own good perhaps. I liked the set-design and look of the Martian settlement and the special effects remain very impressive throughout. While the excessive violence was somewhat entertaining it has to be said. On the whole this is pretty good fun.</fullReview>

Douglas is strung into a rescue mission to save the air-starving people of Mars from the evil administrator Cohaagen.This is an exciting sci-fi Arnold flick with unending gun action and outrageous stunts. However, the plot is pretty exciting, depicting the hapless people of Mars yearning for their planet to be free from control under the dictator, Cohaagen. There are plenty of surprises and tension-filled scenes that keeps the movie's thrills going strong, helped by the decent acting and well-paced plot. There are also an abundance of witty jokes and one-liners from Arnold are in supply, making this a comedic movie as well. The special effects were pretty good and convincing and there is plenty of adventure and twists and turns to make this roller coaster of a movie an entertaining feature.Grade B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rekall the Better Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once, when I was little boy, or 16, I ate up every movie I could in the theatres. Anything, everything. I studied films, read about them, watched as many trailers as I could and went to them all week long. And this was all pre-internet, so the research was limited to, well, real research.Oddly, one completely escaped my radar: 1990's Total Recall. In fact, three weeks prior to release, I had never heard of it. Just saw a mostly black, movie teaser poster with a triangle on it. Later, I would discover it was a pyramid. Two weeks prior to opening, they inserted the SCHWARZENEGGER name on the same poster. I was excited, and then realized this would be a perfect opportunity to go into a movie cold for once. Within the final week beforehand, they just added the name of the movie to the poster. But, at that point, I was already hooked.I remember this like it was yesterday. On opening day, Friday, June 1, 1990, I sat in AMC Metro Theatres for the very first screening, the 10AM showing, completely opened minded and gleefully ignorant to anything I was about to see, other than what appears might be a Sci-Fi Schwarzenegger flick. I was stoked and on the edge of my seat before the movie began.By film's end, I was so pumped up, so excited, and so happy. The movie was 100% everything I wanted out of both an action and Schwarzenegger film. And it made me, to this day, love the feeling of going in completely blind.Now, with today's world ? i.e. the internet and, of course, Facebook ? that's harder and harder to do. Nevertheless, if I get a tiny bit of interest in a big project, especially something I'm fond of already, i.e. Superman, I try my best to avoid all conversations, reviews, comments and absolutely spoilers.I digress. This FIRST and BEST version of Total Recall, based on the Philip K. Dick's too-long title, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, is an almost 100% action packed Sci-Fi adventure of a not-so-ordinarily-built construction worker, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger,) who, after a trip to the mind-altering Rekall Inc. place of the future, sets in motion a series of spy antics and leads him to Mars. There, he needs to regain his memory, save that planet and get the girl. You know, the usual.I've been told, since I haven't read Dick's short story, that the updated 2012 version is more accurate to the book than this 1990 version. Who cares? This one was ten times more fun, so incredibly 90s ? a plus for me and the ideal summer blockbuster. Also Schwarzenegger in his prime! (But, of course, we didn't know any different back then.) Not all movies based on (short or not) books are better if they're word-for-word the original source material.Stanley Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of The Shining was very loosely based on the Stephen King book I read. That was okay by me. The movie was a near-masterpiece in film making. I like to say: I enjoyed both versions, Kubrick's and King's. Later, the TV-miniseries, The Shining was almost identical to King's version and it?sucked.And in 1993, I literally ? dead serious here ? finished the book, The Firm, while in line waiting for the sneak preview of the film based on the John Grisham novel. (I started the very long book 6 days prior, and even though I'm a slow reader, I did everything I could to get it done by the film's premiere. I barely accomplished that while in line!) Following the movie, I was very disappointed because they changed so much, including tone and how the incredibly smart the (book) character, Mitch McDeere, was now dumbed down in the film.My opinion all changed for The Firm when I saw the follow-up movie: The Pelican Brief, which I also read. It was almost verbatim the book. So, during that movie, I knew exactly what was going to happen and when and that was no fun. (The Client followed suit, as well.)Point is, even when a book is masterful, that doesn't mean a director/screenplay writer can't take it to a new level, while playing respectful homage to the original writer and characters. Total Recall took the simple idea, or synopsis printed above, and ran with it on another planet. It was fun, exciting, funny, thrilling, suspenseful, had a great score and great graphics. Sure some things are a bit out of date, but then, that's what they thought in 1990.Despite some minor "futuristic" funnies, Director Verhoeven (who's becoming one of my favorite directors, if not just for that time period) gave me a thrill of a popcorn movie that holds up strongly today. Skip the 2012 version; stick with the original. Well, sorta.Side Note and Spoiler ? fair warned: It's not an implant. The movie's events were real. There's enough evidence throughout, from the looks that both his "wife" Lori (Stone) and friend/coworker, Harry (Robert Costanzo,) gave Quaid prior to his visit to Rekall to the Rekall people stating they keep up with "today's times" and that's why they would have a video picture of Quaid's girl, it's all real. I understand Verhoeven likes those open-ended, discussion-educing finales, but I believe this was all true.Side Note II: Since I've seen this, and it's been many years ago, I've become quite the Star Trek: Voyager lover. In this movie, the automated cab driver's voice instantly told me he was dubbed by Voyager's Doctor, played by Robert Picardo. I was right. Yata! Still, love that man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the recent remake (or "reboot" in the current vernacular), this is one of those films that I always reckoned was little more than a cheap sci-fi shooter with dodgy effects. Happily, having watched it again this morning, I'm pleased to report that I was wrong - it has aged surprisingly well and is an engaging action thriller that makes you think (as good sci-fi should) and that fact isn't a surprise, given that the basis comes from "Blade Runner" scribe Philip K Dick. But part of me wanted this to remain more faithful to the original tale instead of twisting it into an Arnie vehicle with some occasional lapses of logic.The now-former Governator plays construction worker Doug Quaid, bored with his humdrum life on Earth with his blonde wife Lori (Sharon Stone) and troubled by dreams of himself coming a cropper on Mars. In an effort to rid himself of these nightmares, Doug visits a company called Rekall which can implant memories of a nice holiday and Doug seizes on the promise of a "secret agent" trip. Before he knows it, he is thrown into a confusing labyrinth of spies, conspiracy and everyone trying to kill him. Desperate for the truth as he begins to question reality, Quaid travels to Mars in an effort to unravel the mystery and finds himself aiding the rebel cause alongside a mysterious woman who appears in his dreams called Melina (Rachel Ticotin) against the villainous tycoon Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) and his thuggish lieutenant Richter (Michael Ironside).Very few Hollywood films seem to get sci-fi right, using the story as an excuse to bombard viewers with special effects and epic battles between good and evil - think "Star Wars" and you know exactly what I mean. "Total Recall" does things it's own way, working hard to maintain an intelligent and thought-provoking story amid the chaos and typical Paul Verhoeven-levels of gore. The film has a genuine feel to it, fed by a rush of ideas and details that make the film oddly believable. Where it lets itself down is when it can't maintain the high-brow and resorts to the usual action-movie trappings. For example - what kind of a world is it where we've colonised a fair chunk of the Solar System, can implant memories and manufacture extraordinarily complex disguises (in a scene at Mars immigration that almost veers into parody) and yet, we still require construction workers using pneumatic drills and the military still use machine guns? However, you rarely get a chance to consider such plot-holes as Schwarzenegger tears it up as only he can and even tries acting in places instead of his usual mix of grimacing, ultra-violence and cheesy one-liners (though these are still present and correct).The original "Total Recall" is a real surprise by being an entertaining blend of tense thriller, bloody action and smart sci-fi. Most of the effects and make-up have lasted pretty well and it just about manages to avoid becoming yet another futuristic blaster with a meat-head in the lead (stand up and be counted, "Demolition Man"). It felt a bit like "I, Robot" which is also an entertaining and intelligent action flick. However, like "I, Robot", I was somewhat distracted by the sound of the author turning in their grave - I can't imagine Dick enjoying this movie as much as the rest of us as his ideas and themes become little more than an excuse for blood-stained violence and running gun battles. Imagine the reaction of Milan Kundera (the author of "The Unbearable Lightness Of Being") if that film had been turned into a straight-forward skin flick with shameless nudity and endlessly repetitive sex scenes. "Total Recall" may be a bastardisation of the source material but it's still an entertaining and recommended movie for most viewers who aren't afraid of violence, gore and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOTAL RECALLWhat a classic movie. I have seen this film so many times... and it is still as good today as it was back in the 90s.This is Arnie during his peak. He is a legend thanks to the movies he made in the late 80s and early 90s.I know this film didn't really stick to the story in the book it is based on, but I think this film made it it's own.The effects were not too bad for it's time. Obviously these days the effects could be better. But in a way the dodgy plastic Arnie heads makes this film better.As always, Arnie has some great lines that me and a few friends of mine like to quote on a regular basis... "Come on, you got what you want... give these people air"... it obviously sounds better with his accent.I love the mutants in this film... there are so many good actors in here. I would say the casting was perfect.This is not Arnies best film... in fact he has done a few that are better... but this is up there. I am a huge Arnie fan and I loved this film this time around as much as I did the first time I watched it.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A classic Schwarzenegger movie and one that will be treasured for many years to come... especially as it is a lot better than the remake.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut and often gripping future-set thriller with a real idea at its heart and a genuinely pleasing film making ethic to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose by the time Total Recall has gone all gung-ho on us, what with its shootouts and second unit stuff booting out the earlier chase; danger and mystery of the newfound scenario our lead found themselves in, we can kind of forgive it out of its subversive energy. That is to say, the overhanging ambiguity surrounding whether any of what we're actually seeing is real plagues the piece throughout. If it isn't real, it's somebody's dream and therefore one would expect to be presented with stereotypical espionage elements and arrays of action and shoot outs come the final act. It's all here: the mysterious phone call from someone who wants to help; the checking in to a hotel (somewhat mirthfully named "The Hilton"); the jetting off (as it were) to the exotic locales and the rendez-vous' with the good looking women. And yet, how could anything of this ilk set this far into the future running on this premise POSSIBLY play out any differently? Therein lies the magic of this 1990 Paul Verhoeven film: long after one has had the arguments on whether it's a subversive master stroke of film making or merely a cheap sci-fi relying on age old concepts. On top of all else, it's a cracking narrative which in itself requires a careful, patient eye and mind so as to work out if everything holds together.Arnold Schwarzenegger steps back from playing murderous machines and macho commando group commanders to fill a frailer role. For a large part of the project, Schwarzenegger's character hasn't got the slightest idea what's going on and he's in quite a bit of danger out of the fact a group of highly skilled government agents are armed to the teeth and coming after him. He plays a construction worker, Douglas Quaid; a middle aged, everyday kind of a guy with an apartment of his own and a wife in Lori, played by Sharon Stone. We're in the future, a far off future whereby the planet of Mars has been colonised; is mostly inhabited by mutants and one can even clear off to Saturn should one feel like a holiday. Running a pneumatic drill at a quarry with best friend Danny de Vito by your side; pushing the subway to work every day and seemingly not being able to get away from the news broadcasts of trouble and strife between rebels and government agents on Mars, however, is wearing him down. Through the Recall of the title, Quaid hits upon a business who can put him in a chair for a few days; wire him up to a machine and insert "memories" that have him think he's done something incredible during a holiday away. Something, however, goes wrong and he thinks he's living the dream (so to speak) without the final programming having been carried out ? thus, an adventure involving all sorts of new and exciting people, as well as new and exciting places, kicks off and we have in our midst one of the smarter, better sci-fi/action films of its era.Michael Ironside plays the man charged with capturing Quaid, Richter; someone who's already an item with the undercover operative fulfilling the role of Quaid's wife and there's an amusing insinuation Richter is going after Quaid with the intent instead on killing him because of this. The action eventually shifts to Mars and a red light district already shrouded in political turmoil. Waltzing into a brothel to some music from Sonic the Hedgehog, we're introduced to Melina (Ticotin); a young woman who works there who breaks the mould in her appearance amidst the scarred, soft bodied characters including dwarfs; facially imbalanced personnel and three breasted others. It is from here the pair of them begin to occupy the frame for an extended time, taking on the sleazy governing official Cohaagen (Cox) whose own plans to wreck some serious hassle on the Martian inhabitants loom.Structure and pacing are crucial to the film; never are we overwhelmed with details and revelations, nor do we ever lull in proceedings as new information and such keep flowing. What works is how sheltered we, the audience, are from this strange new future of automated taxis and interplanetary travel. We are spared the external shots of anything gratuitous in this far flung future until Quaid has truly realised he is out of his element, something that aides the disillusionment process on both sides. Director Verhoeven keeps the action moving and the scenarios coming, really taking this premise of someone torn from their existence and thrust into another set of circumstances whilst running with it for an extraordinary amount of time: keeping it fresh, keeping it frightening, keeping it exciting. We forgive the film for its eventual descent into second unit dominated territory. Think hard: the moments from our dreams that are the most intense often happen at the tail end of them, do they not? They are the last thing we dream and the first thing that we remember when we awake. If nothing is real and everything is fake, the movement into the final act whereby intense shootouts and near death experiences are all the rage seems fitting, as this constant dicing with death as the denouement looms intensifies the experience. Either way, when the lead character awakens from this particular episode in the morning, it will be a scream loud enough to awake those not just lying next to them, but in the adjacent homes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine the life you're living is a dream and you are actually someone else? Well this is exactly what happens to the character of Douglas Quaid played by famous macho actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The whole story starts with him having a dream about some other life he has with another woman than the one he's married too, Lori, played by Sharon Stone. Quaid soon realizes that what he was dreaming might have actually been real when he learns he really isn't who he thinks he is.Eventually Quaid starts being chased by Richter (Michael Ironside), a man sent by the evil Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) who will do anything to stop Quaid from accomplishing his mission, whatever that may be, because Quaid won't know until much later. And all of these secrets will start to be revealed once Quaid heads to a fake mind vacation corporation called "Rekall". Thankfully, Quaid is not alone, he will soon run into help that will lead him to his destination...but it's a long way there.Hailed science fiction director, Paul Verhoeven, directs the film. And like any Verhoeven film, there is bound to be plenty of carnage, profanity and sexuality. The film is based off of the novel "We Can Remember it for You Wholesale" by Phillip K. Dick, the writer who also brought audiences Blade Runner (1982) and Screamers (1995). Total Recall is another great novel adaptation.As plot goes, the story can be really confusing at times but it also clears itself up pretty quickly as well (MOST of the time). Not to mention the fact that by having the main character confused also creates a lot of tension for the audience. Although Arnold Schwarzenegger is known for quoting himself from other films, he actually doesn't do it at all here. He creates a lot of his own memorable quotes which makes this film more original.The special effects, action sequences and background settings are good looking too. The visualization of mars is quite jaw dropping and the makeup department out did themselves when it came to creating the mutant lifeforms. The score composed by Jerry Goldsmith is a fair one too. It can be repetitive at times but it does create the tension it needs to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats.Schwarzenegger is much more entertaining in this sci-fi thriller. The plot can be extremely confusing but if paid attention to, it shouldn't be that hard to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie that makes you think at the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember first seeing this movie when I was young and I really liked it. Much much better then the remake I recently saw. Arnold has never been that great of an actor but he did a good job here and the rest of the cast plus the original interesting story line made this movie a very enjoyable watch.This movie is about a man who goes to a place called recall to have a artificial memory implanted. He chooses a memory where he is a secret agent who is sent to go save mars. Then a real life situation makes him actually go to mars....or does he.This movie is really good exspecially for a an 80s movie which was not a great time for movies. The special effects were good and the story line makes you really think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic Schwartzenegger Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie: it is a science fiction film with almost non-stop action. It is based around a man, Douglas Quaid (Arnold Swarzenegger), who really wants to go to Mars, but his wife won't let him. He hears of this place called Rekall, which can implant memories of a holiday into his mind. Quaid goes to Rekall, but while they are implanting the memories, they uncover another memory where he is a secret agent in deep cover. Now that his cover has been blown, people are trying to kill him, and he must get to Mars to find out what is really going on.This movie is based upon the story by Philip K. Dick called "We can remember it for you Wholesale", and I have had the pleasure of reading this story so I will first compare the two stories. It is interesting having read the original to see where they digressed. I shall then discuss whether the entire movie was a dream or not. I have no solid conclusion, and though the evidence points to it being a dream, I still believe it to be real, but then so does Quaid.The differences between the stories are vast. There is no rebellion on Mars, and in fact Quaid never goes to Mars in the original story. When his memories are uncovered, he is much more passive, and Rekall are far more cunning, as they wipe his memory but only refund half of his money. Then the bug in his head is never removed, and it is because of this bug that Quaid ends up giving in. Another big difference is that Quaid has already committed the deed in the story, where in the movie, he is on Earth to prepare for the deed. Finally, we are convinced that in the story it is not a dream, we are never sure in the movie. Also, in the story, Quaid's wife is not a spy, she leaves him because she is convinced that she is mad.I guess the major theme is whether we should mess with people's minds, and is it dangerous to implant memories. In both the movie and the book, the question of what will happen if there are already memory implants, and how the patient would react if these implants were disturbed. It also gives a new way of looking at spies and how they can be planted in the future when the mind can be adjusted - it is also curious to see how the memories would meld into the person's life.Now, is this movie a dream. If it is then the dream begins after he leaves Rekall. Now, the things that suggest that it is a dream is that they doctor enters the room on Mars and explains everything to him, and his wife enters to try and convince him of it. When he kills the doctor, everything suddenly reverts back to the way it was before. The implant was called "Blue Skies on Mars," which is what happened in the end. The settings were to Quaid's exact specifications - the sleazy, athletic, demure brunette named Melina; he was a secret agent; and he had a luxury suite in the most expensive hotel on Mars. Kuato, as predicted at the beginning, was a two-headed alien, and the alien artifact is exactly the same as the one shown in the picture at rekal. Finally, the doctor's predictions come true, Quaid goes from being the saviour to Cohagen's busom buddy.The reasons as to why this isn't a dream are also just a numerous. The rebellion on Mars was already going on before the dream started, though this could be incorporated into the dream. Melina was an exact duplicate of the one he saw in his first dream, which he could have created as well. The major factor is that the picture of the woman had white skin, while Melina was slightly tanned. Also, the dream and the desire to go to Mars suggest that there was an implant in Quaid beforehand. My biggest argument is that we see what is going on behind the scenes in the dream, which sort of suggest that this is real.Another thing to consider is how his wife turned against him and so did his best friend. It is strange that his friend was trying to kill him when Cohagan later says that he was on Earth as a plant. Ricktor was not supposed to kill him but was trying to because he was a loose cannon, but Quaid's friend seemed to have very little to do with Ricktor. If this were a dream, then such things as Quaid's wife and best friend turning against him would not be there because it would not allow the suspension of disbelief. The thing that undermines that is that the procedure has failed on Quaid and he is in danger of becoming a vegetable trapped in his own dreamworld. As such there are a number of permanent adjustments being made to his world.The movie never really answers this, and I know the movie quite well and have covered almost everything that falls on each side of the argument. I think that it is a dream, though I would rather it be real.In itself, the movie is astounding. The effects are awesome today just as they were back when the movie was made. Now with computers such effects are commonplace, but we always look upon this movie in awe as to what it is. It is full of action, and has everything that a movie about Mars should have, and it also comes very good with the one liners. I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may be hard to believe if you weren't alive at the time, but 22 years ago -- before soulless remakes were a dime a dozen and blatant CGI cheapened blockbuster flicks -- Arnold Schwarzenegger ruled the world. Produced at the cusp of his pinnacle, "Total Recall" teamed the future-Governator with "Robocop" director Paul Verhoeven, proving to be a match made in heaven as the two forged absolute cinematic gold. Boasting a witty script based on a Philip K. Dick short, mind-boggling special effects and a relentless stream of humor and ultraviolence, "Total Recall" still makes for a fun ride after all of these years.Set in the year 2084, our story revolves around a simple blue-collar worker, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), who can't help but dream of the amber landscape of Mars. Even as his beautiful wife (a pre-"Basic Instinct" Sharon Stone) lies next to him at night, he's off in outerspace fantasizing about a life in another world with another woman (Rachel Ticotin). Against advice from his friends, he embarks on a fantasy vacation to Mars that promises an implanted memory of interplanetary espionage and extramarital lust without all the fuss of space travel and infidelity. As you can imagine, he gets more than he bargained for when something goes horribly wrong in the process and he actually finds himself on Mars, being hunted down whilst trying to, in his words, "give da people da air!" "Total Recall" is nothing if not entertainment taken to the extreme. Without all of the social commentary baggage of "Robocop," Verhoeven is free to let his love for over-the-top action and jarring violence spill all over the place. From the opening scene to the opening credits, the film is a relentless roller-coaster ride. At the helm, of course, is Arnold Schwarzenegger who runs amuck through the scenery, spouting off just as many one-liners as he does bullets. Though perfectly able actors such as Richard Dreyfuss and Jeff Bridges were originally in the running for the role, it's hard to imagine the film with anyone but Arnold as Quaid. A good 50% of the film's charm is thanks in part to his performance.Of course, one would be remiss if they didn't mention the absolutely stunning visual effects on hand. Thanks to legendary (but sadly MIA as of this writing) special effects guru Rob Bottin, there are sights in the film you aren't soon to forget, such as Arnold yanking a golf-ball sized tracking unit out of his nose and a female Martian who is, shall we say, well-equipped. Truly a time capsule of a bygone era, "Total Recall" pre-dates the CGI revolution brought on in later years by the likes of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "Jurassic Park" and yet looks every bit as stunning today as it did when it was first released. The phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" definitely applies here.To put it simply, "Total Recall" is the last of its kind. It's hardly dated (aside from some bad fashion choices here and there) and its entertainment value has not waned one bit over the years. In this film, you have a truly iconic action star in his prime with a director at the top of his game, making for a true, blue action classic. Sure, it doesn't probe the depths of the psyche as much as it could, but there's so much going for it, it's easy to forgive the film its few shortcomings. Put simply, "Total Recall" is a film you'll likely recall for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in a futuristic world Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker with a gorgeous wife who suffers from nightmares involving the now colonised planet, Mars. Quaid believes these dreams mean something and thinks he has once been to planet, something his wife (Stone) desires not to be true. Quaid's obsession with Mars continues and he signs up for memory implants at Rekall inc, a place where they implant a memory of a holiday as opposed to you having to actually go on one. As a special option to his package, Quaid chooses to have an implant of his profession being as a secret agent and getting the girl of his dreams. Midway through the procedure Quaid starts to lose control and awakens, remembering things that he didn't before. The doctors knock him unconscious and drop him in a cab, denying that he ever came in. When Quaid gets home it becomes apparent that his memory has already been erased once and his life is all just a set up. On the run from an armed secret group, Quaid must go to a communist run Mars and prove to himself who he actually is.Unlike many other Arnie movies, this one does provide some back bone. The story is good and takes you away from the world we live in and into one that everyone will be intrigued by. Who wouldn't want to go to Mars? The science fiction aspect shows a colonised Mars, housing hundreds of mutants dictated by a communist leader, who is under threat by a rebel group attempting to force the government out. Mars is played out like it is a country rather than a planet and a popular holiday destination at that. It serves up brothels, pyramids, tube lines and also what looks like an underground Times Square. Looks like a holiday destination everyone would love. Until the rebel organisation comes along of course. It seems to be a Western country mixed with a South African country. Verhoeven manages to create an atmosphere on Mars and makes you believe in the planet as opposed to having to convince yourself that it is actually real. His set up fills in all the blanks you need and for all you know it could just be a different country.I have reviewed Arnie's films before and let's be honest I don't let the guy live down his poor performances but in this movie he actually had me convinced. Let's get it straight, he can't act, when it comes to emotion he just fails, but in this film he shows confusion and vulnerability and strangely he delivers. Of course there is the odd cheese ball line, spoken with more v's and z's then it should be but the odd one I am willing to let go. Other than The Terminator this is Arnie's best performance.For its age the effects are brilliant. Special effects are used throughout and they really do capture imagination. Sure some of them look a little overdone and it is obvious they are fake but that is one thing that makes the film fun. One for instance is when Arnie pulls a golf ball sized tracking device out of his head through his nose. Sure it looks rubber but it looks good.Most scenes are also filled with gung ho action and firing guns. To some people this is too much but it is all so fitting here. Also the effects of a man being shot look so realistic that it has you clenching believing it is real. Only one other film has made me feel awkward during a shooting and that was another Verhoeven film, Robocop, where the villains kill the cop who ultimately becomes the hero. Just the thought of it sends a shiver down my spine.The film gives off a fun feel and has several aspects that many will like. The talking Johnny Cab is one that everyone will love and the mutant child who can tell you your fortune. Lots of areas really help you connect with the film and although many serious themes are involved most of the action is taken with a pinch of salt. It is just fun.Overall an enjoyable film and one I always remember for people's eyes popping out their heads. I hadn't seen this movie for years and although not one of the best I have ever seen it is one that always entertains me and one I always look forward to watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Action, Total Sci-Fi, Total Schwarznegger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phillip K. Dick's novel, We Can Remember it for You Wholesale, is about the classic meshing of reality, false memory and real memory. Total Recall is loosely based on the novel by Phillip K. Dick. This movie has a lot of great visual effects, a lot of great action sequences and some great acting for Schwarznegger. In this movie, Arnold plays a average Joe who wants to travel to Mars. The movie is set in the year 2084 A.D, and it does play a major role in the movie itself. Arnold then goes to a place called Rekall to implant a memory in his mind. But then, his character suddenly bursts into anger as he is what he believe to be a secret agent, who's cover was blown. After the blowout, his friends are all enemies and are out to kill him. So, he escapes and goes to Mars to get his real identity on who stole his true identity and why. Soon enough, the action starts up again. What I like in Total Recall is the themes of identity. The movie's script is adapted by Phillip K. Dick story, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale. The themes also are a major role in the movie. As I said before, Total Recall has some great special effects and great action sequences. But, sometimes the movie can be confusing to viewers because Arnold Schwarznegger is sort of playing himself and someone else in his false identity. Total Recall is a great science fiction action thriller. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 1/2 3 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ground breaking classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is up there as one of the all time greatest action films and for good reason. Blending slick action, futuristic settings and ultra violence into, in my opinion, the best Arnie film to date bar Terminator 2.Appearing at the tail end of the 80's and early 90's it managed to capture the balls out "Yeah!" of the 80's action film while blending it with slick sci-fi special effects. Total Recall and Predator 2 are prime examples of a dying art going out with a bang before being taken over by CGI rubbish.Paul Verhoeven directs in his own unique 'Robocopish' way, making the settings seem both hi tech and tacky at the same time. This film was tailor made for Schwarzenegger (Hardly surprising as it was him who convinced the producers to buy the rights for him!) and you couldn't imagine anyone else in the role, yet Arnies trademark one liners are kept to a tasteful minimum which amplifies their impact and for a man who is known for his fantastic physique he spends all but one small scene of the film completely covered up in clothes that wouldn't look out of place today never mind the future.The combination of violence, smooth hi tech Special effects, which were ground breaking at the time and gross out body horror make this film absolutely irresistible for fans of action, sci-fi and sfx buffs.A ground breaking classic and no mistake. Whoever greenlighted the remake of this priceless gem are the reason that people are using the Pirate Bay to download films instead of paying overblown cinema prices for such unoriginal, money grabbing half hearted raping of vintage movies and should be shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the tone of Robocop mixed with the classic over the top action that Arnold delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie keeps you hooked towards the very end with the expectation of every twist you can think of and just when you think the twist would be the most predictable one such as it was a simulation or dream the film throws a curve ball and keeps going with the notion that everything that is happening is real. This movie is classic Verhoeven with the tone of Robocop (corporation wants to profit above all costs and hero gets shot down by a gang of bad guys, although in this one it was Quaid's simulation.). This film has the best quotes such as Consider this a Divorce and then he shoots his fake wife or Look who's talking after a mutant asks him that how dare he show his face around Mars and overall is not as thought provoking as Robocop but it is one Schwarzenegger's classics, especially if you're looking for quotes, who can forget the timeless You Blew My Cover aghghghghgh!!! The movie is imaginative, it has that Robocop tone but in the future, and is just pure classic action. Definitely a must buy for classic Arnold action. Now to talk about the action, the scene where he uses one of the bad guys as a human shield, detailed head shots, and more!! Definitely a classic in the ranks of True Lies, Robocop, and Predator. Haven't seen Commando yet, but I will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly-flavoured vivid futuristic action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid who has the planet Mars on his mind. He goes for virtual vacation, however, things go awry as he discovers that his job, marriage and life maybe a lie. After a murder he's forced to go to the planet for real but while on the run he finds that he may hold the key to an ancient Martian artifact.Set in the year 2084 there are some nice futurist touches, talking robots, virtual tennis coaches, electronic nail painting to name a few. The internal mars sets are just that, sets, but the external, airport and mine shots are very effective. There is a wonderful otherworldly score by Jerry Goldsmith and some great costumes and spacesuits designed by Erica Edell Phillips.RoboCop (1987) director Paul Verhoeven once again uses Ronny Cox as the menacing protagonist in this Phillip K Dick inspired story. In it's day it was hailed for its special effects and make-up effects and while these have dated slightly, it still holds its own as an entertaining science fiction.If the director reins and main role were given to anyone other than Arnold this may have been a sci-fi thriller, but with Arnie's larger than life screen presence and Verhoeven highly-flavoured visuals Total Recall is not given a noir look that would usual accompany such subject matter becoming a vivid futuristic action flick.While the acting is a little overboard with a cast that include Sharon Stone, Michael Ironside and Marshall Bell it's saved by the intriguing story that moves along at a fast pace and Schwarzenegger performance. The rest of the cast are hired bad guys, mutants and an array of quirky characters.Overall Total Recall is a great piece of captivating entertainment so "for the memory of a lifetime Rekall, Rekall, Rekall."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect stuff for Arnold and his fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The governator plays a future type Joe Sixpack who has Walter Mitty style dreams. Somehow, he has Sharon Stone for a trophy wife, and also a big house with a wall that turns into a giant TV when needed. Maybe this was filmed at the California governor's mansion; one can't be sure.Not being sure about anything is the spirit of this movie, since it establishes a reality, then turns everything upside down, then spins it around again. Somehow, all can't be what it seems. There's a nasty secret, and some covert naughtiness with Arnie as the victim. But why? For some odd reason, Arnie is fascinated with Mars, and decides to take a virtual vacation there. That sets off the fighting, shooting, and explosions you know are coming sooner or later.The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is an trademark of Arnold's films. This makes it all the more fun as conspiracy after conspiracy unravels in confounding fashion. The special effects are terrific and sometimes laugh-out-loud outlandish. The victims of the oxygen-less Martian atmosphere morphing into Muppets is one of the funniest things you'll ever see. Also, I laughed myself sick when a tiny girl picks up a rapid-fire Oozie and starts blasting bad guys.As crazy as it all is, it's well written, and the plot is developed skillfully. Action scenes are numerous, but at least they adhere to what's going on in the story at any given moment. The in-your-face product placement is so overdone it must be the inspiration for Michael Bay. "Mars Today" is just one of many clever sight gags strategically placed in the background as the movie playfully mocks itself.Good stuff. Plenty of good action, plenty of good laughs. A lot of fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most effective during the Philip K. Dick moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this one wholesale and quite fondly. Re-watching it now, I still think the environments and technologies are lacking, as I did the first time I saw it. Verhoeven is more concerned with carnage and action than setting up a believable futuristic environment. Most of the sets seem to just what they are: movie sets. Especially when the story switches to Mars the milieu never becomes credible. Aside from that, the action is generally impeccable, the Goldsmith score suitably majestic and bombastic. I love Michael Ironside but sadly he haven't got much to do here, besides sneering and looking tough. The most effective moments though are the Philip K. Dick moments, when the reality of what is going on is questioned. It gives the movie a certain intriguing tension that ordinary action flick lack, and lifts it up slightly above a ordinary popcorn movie. I would really like to read the discarded Cronenberg script, he worked for a year on the adaptation before stepping down. I guess the producers were trying to emphasize the action elements too much for his taste. If my memory implants are correct I also recall how awkward and uncomfortable Arnold seemed, especially in the opening scenes, and drawing huge laughs from the audience.</fullReview>

Sharon Stone is very young and sexy and Arnold Schwarzenegger, well.., is very Arnold Schwarzenegger!

		<fullReview>Phillip K. Dick stories usually translate pretty well to film: Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly and especially Blade Runner. This one definitely has some interesting plot turns and some great special effects that stand up quite well for an almost-twenty-year old movie. There is a lot of typical Hollywood-formula corniness--some awesomely bad lines, uninteresting romantic plot, stock bad guys. In terms of Arnie, well, it doesn't really approach even the first Terminator movie or Predator and I like the Running Man a little bit better, even though it's nearly as bad and lacks the awesome special effects. If you're a big fan of Arnold or enjoy the other adapted Phillip K. Dick stories then you'll probably enjoy this one, even if it doesn't quite make your favorites list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one thing bothering me about this movie is the obvious rip-off story thingie...Buichi Terasawa's manga "Space Adventure Cobra" from 1977 about a poor salesman who thinks his life is dreadfully boring. One day he decides to visit a dream theater in order to cheer himself up. What he experience is not a pre-programmed fantasy but a latent memory about his previous life, before he had his memory erased...Definitely not one of Arnie's worst movies and well worth seeing if you haven't. Some of the special FX might seem a bit cheap by today's standard, but this was way back when it wasn't all CG. All in all a good way to kill an hour or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popular Sci-fi movie and one of Arnold's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seventeen years on, Total Recall is one of the most popular sci-fi movies out. The special effects and make up are still top notch. This is also one of Arnold's best movies up there with the Terminator movies. The movie is interlaced with a thought-provoking plot and a lot of violence and gore, with some moments of humour. Besides Robocop, Total Recall is one of Paul Verhoeven's best movies that he has directed to date. Sharon Stone, in an early role, is excellent as Douglas Quaid's wife. It's a shame that Rachel Ticotin has not had any major roles, but she is memorable as Milena, an ally from Quaid's past. Michael Ironside nails his role as the volatile Richter. Ronny Cox as Vilos Cohaagen was a little similar to his character Dick Jones in Robocop, but Cohaagen is more ruthless and sinister.Overall, Total Recall is highly recommended to all sci-fi lovers and Arnold fans. Unless you have a weak stomach, check out this movie if you have not done so already. Get ready for the ride of your life.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Schwartzenneger's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw it in the theater I was 15 years old and I thought it was one of the best movies I ever saw. It was some fun to come back to it 15 years later. At this point I can see that there's a lot of humor in there, whereas as a younger person I took it very seriously. Verhoeven is a very good director, and this is one of his better films -- he is able to give us a film that is complex but at the same time not obtrusively so. You can kind of take and leave what you want from Verhoeven's glossy satire. Schwarzenneger's performance is one of his best, one of the only times he played an actual human being with anything like believability. A lot of times his physical mass prevents him from passing as "normal", but here his stature just adds to the sense that something is wrong in the first place with him being this peaceful construction worker, and adds some irony to the fact that this man is made so helpless by the mental tinkerers at "Total Rekall", a place where you can buy the memory of a vacation if you don't have time to take an actual trip.The violence is so extreme that it's at times sickening, but I just find it all humorous because I don't really take the movie all that seriously. A lot of people laugh when they hear that Phil Dick wrote the source story, but this film actually sticks a lot closer to its source material than "Blade Runner" or "Minority Report" or any of the other more "respected" Dick adaptions that I've seen. It's worth pointing out that while the moments of extreme violence in Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" sometimes feel like arbitrary concessions to the action movie audience and don't feel fully integrated into the film's somber tone, Verhoeven's film is consistently giddy, turbulent, and fast, making the violence seem more natural to his film's glossy aesthetic.I think Ron Cox did some good work here but basically Michael Ironside stole the show as far as villains go. He's the definition of a "loose cannon", so jealous of Quaid's (Schwarzenneger) connection with his gal Lori (Sharon Stone, appropriately feral) that he becomes a figure who's both sympathetic and terrifying. Rachel Ticotin is merely serviceable, rather underwhelming considering she's given a meaty role for the love interest in an action film.Special notice should go to the great Rob Bottin and his company for some of his most impressive animatronic work ? which is saying a lot. Maybe the effects are a bit aged now, but they are quality effects, and I predict that they will stand the test of time better than most computer generated effects films. This was one of the last big effects films to use only actual photographic elements for all its shots. It features an impressive matte/miniature shot that takes us from the inside of a train to the Martian landscape and ultimately soaring above Mars' domed cities ? a shot that is very close to one that was planned for the beginning of "Blade Runner" but abandoned for financial reasons.As a Phil Dick adaption, it's an interesting case because even though as stated above the film sticks somewhat closer to Dick's original than most adaptions have done ("Minority Report" deserves particular shame for introducing the exploitative element of the deceased child), it is also the furthest in tone and feeling from Dick's work in some ways. It captures his paranoia about identity and memory control with great accuracy. Simply for communicating such a complex idea ? that a person's identity could actually be changed by artificial intelligence technology ? to the popcorn-munching millions (like my own former 15-year-old self). And in the end we have a film that is essentially a top-notch action film that's crossed over into "The Twilight Zone". Schwartzenneger, whose 2 other best films IMHO were the similarly sci-fi flavored "Terminator" and "Predator", must have known this, as he reportedly took a personal interest in the project before production began. He put his heart in the film in a way he never had before and never did again. For his part, Verhoeven returned to a similar turf in "Starship Troopers", which was also a fun movie but perhaps not quite as much fun as this one or "Robocop". So this is also a career peak for him as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Veerhoeven's Total Recall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is an action packed, bloody, surrealistic, and sometimes confusing sci-fi movie. Arnold stars as Quaid, a construction worker who is bored with his blue-collar life and decides to take part in a "virtual vacation", where he is able to pick the location he travels to. He picks Mars, in a different age where humans have begun to colonize and build a mining operation. Mars is ruled by an evil dictator (Ironside) and filled with freaks and mutants. Arnold's wife in his "trip" is Sharon Stone, who is offed early on and replaced by the slightly less attractive Rachel Ticotin. Of course he takes over his vacation and becomes a somewhat of a vigilante. His job is to destroy Ironside's evil empire and restore peace (and oxygen). Oxygen you say? Yes, Mars has no oxygen. Ergo, Ironside has placed everything in a protective shield a la Bio Dome which came out five years later. He controls the amount in the air inside the city. The movie is great. It, like most other Veerhoeven films (Robocop, Hollow Man, Flesh and Blood) never skimps on the blood and gore but at the same time emphasizes human pain and suffering so as not to make his movies mindless gorefests. There are always a lot of emotional moments on his films. The special effects range from hellish looking mutants with fetuses on their abdomens and women with three breasts, to cartoonish over-the-top violence. A perfect example is the ending scene where Arnold, Rachel, and a bad guy fall out of the volcanic fortress where Ironside resided. What happens to a person who is on a planet with no air pressure? Why, their heads inflate like balloons and their bodies explode! What else? I think the fact that the whole experience was simply a "dream" that Schwartzenegger took over allowed a little leeway to be pretty illogical and off the wall. Many people don't like this movie dismissing it as preposterous and unrealistic. Well in a way it's just as much a FANTASY as a sci-fi. If you watch it with an open mind and don't read too much into it like your lame critically acclaimed psycho-thrillers and highbrow comedy movies, you'll have an interesting trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most worthy of the Philip K. Dick adaptations!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although his name and stories have been known to genre fans worldwide for years, it hasn't been until recently that the work of Philip K. Dick has gotten the attention of Hollywood. Much of the credit has been given to Minority Report director Steven Spielberg. While Spielberg should receive a portion of the credit, the majority of it should to two others: Ridley Scott for Blade Runner, the first Dick film adaptation, and Paul Verhoeven for proving with Total Recall that Dick's ideas can translate into highly successful and highly profitable storytelling on the big screen. Reportedly going through as many as 50 drafts before shooting began, Total Recall was in pre-production for somewhere around two decades. Final writing credits go to Ronald Shusett &amp; Dan O'Bannon and Gary Goldman, who managed to turn out the most well written the most worthy of the Philip K. Dick adaptations. Shusset and Goldman were constantly on set, according to Verhoeven on the DVD commentary, which may explain why Total Recall is one of the few Dick adaptations that doesn't suffer from the constant feeling of having too many writers aboard. Verhoeven knows how to tell a compelling and intelligent story like no other director can, which is obvious here with his complete understanding of the material. Second to Robocop, this Verhoeven's best. His direction is flawless alongside Jost Vacano amazing cinematography. Also at his best, is Arnold Schwarzenegger in his strongest performance. Sharon Stone and Ronny Cox are also memorable in their supporting roles. From every angle, this is a solid film. The only real flaw lies in the choppy MPAA required cuts evident throughout certain moments. If it weren't for the censorship of the MPAA, this could stand as perfect sci-fi masterpiece. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An married ordinary man named Quaid (Arnold Schwartzenger)lives in the future where he gets dreams every night of a mysterious woman (Rachel Ticoton) and wants to do something with his life better then being with his wife Lori (Sharon Stone). He sees a commercial for a special virtual dream memory program called "Rekall" where he can have a dream and memory of his ideal vacation for a good price, but unfortunately his memory has been erased and goes on a special mission to Mars to save it from a dictator (Ronny Cox) and get his memory back.A quality action packed thrill ride that wonderfully mixes sci-fi with action, ideas, weirdness, humor and graphic gore galore. Paul Verhoeven who directed the successful "Robocop" has made another sci-fi masterpiece here, this is indeed one of Arnold's best movies and succeeds at that point! the violence in this movie is quite extreme and almost got an X rating. I remembered when i was 8 watching this movie in a theater back in the summer of 1990, the violence didn't traumatize me at all but the movie became one of the coolest and most entertaining movies i've ever seen.It's always been a personal favorite of mine for quite some time and one of those movies that inspired me to love film. The score from Jerry Goldsmith is truly one of the best music scores i've ever heard! the film co-stars Marshall Bell ("A Nightmare on Elm Street 2") and Michael Ironside, this is a superb sci-fi thriller that is one hell of a roller-coaster ride and a must see.Also recommended: "Commando", "Day of the Dead", "Blade Runner", "Star Wars", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Serenity", "The Fifth Element", "The Dark Crystal", "I Robot", "Videodrome", "The Thing (1982)", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Sin City", "Dawn of the Dead (2004)", "Alien Saga", "Terminator Trilogy", "Predator", "The Running Man", "V For Vendetta", "The Matrix Saga", "Escape from New York", "Starship Troopers", "Robocop", "Minority Report", "A Scanner Darkly", "Return of the Jedi", "Revenge of the Sith", "Men in Black", "Reservoir Dogs", "Bad Boys 2", "300", "Starchaser: Legend of Orin", "Dark City", "Vanilla Sky", "Donnie Darko" and "Rambo Trilogy".</fullReview>

There are so many twists, changes, and turns. - Just when you think you have it figured out and know where it's going, it takes a sudden turn.Every time you watch this film you pick up on more minute details, and the true genius behind the plot, the acting, the dialogue, and the action. Not to mention the amazing special effect and costume design. This is a definite, must watch for any Arnold fan, Sci Fi buff or Action movie junkie. This is everything you ever wished for in a Sci Fi film and more. This is the pinnacle of perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what is probably Paul Verhoeven's best film to date, Total Recall takes Phillip K. Dick's short story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale and makes it into a slam-bang action film that never falters for even a moment. While I don't consider Arnold Schwarzenegger the best of actors, he does a very good job under Verhoeven's direction as Douglas Quaid/Hauser. Kudos also to Rachel Ticotin as Melina and Sharon Stone as the overly sexy Lori (this film really made her film career which she would follow up with Verhoeven in the superb Basic Instinct only two years later). However, the best part of this classic is Jerry Goldsmith's best score of his career. He successfully and interestingly combines classic orchestral techniques with synth elements. Well done Jerry (RIP). This is a very solid 9 out of 10 and a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Verhoeven+Schwarzenegger= All-time Classic !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one action adventure that will never lose its appeal,and is worth repeat viewings,not only for movie-goers but also movie-makers,who think that great CGI alone can compensate for their inability to come up with story lines more novel than a bunch of ugly monsters trying to have humans for lunch,sometimes above ground or sometimes below water,and sometimes even in far away galaxies.This is a film by the Dutch master Paul Verhoeven,and the storyline is unlike any I have ever seen in a sci-fi movie.The redoubtable Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker in the future who is haunted by horrible dreams of another life on the planet Mars.He then decides to go on a "virtual" vacation to Mars, courtesy the cybergeeks at a company called Recall who sell such illusions .The trouble begins when they try to implant this" vacation" as a memory into Quaid's brain,triggering the onset of "total recall",that is,Quaid's complete recalling of his actual memory and identity.He now realizes that his nightmares were actually echoes of a real life he had,and journeys to Mars to find out more .What follows is an adventure of epic proportions, and not for one moment do you feel bored or get the feeling of" hey,I've seen this before !"Paul Verhoeven gives you no room for that. The action is great,the humor is great,and the special effects are breath-taking,if you consider the fact that this was 1990. Schwarzenegger does full justice to the lead role,and frankly,I think his performance here outshines that in "Terminator 2",where he had to be as rigid and unemotional as possible. Sharon Stone has a brief appearance as his supposed wife,and she is gorgeous in those few moments,though evil. Ronny Cox as villain Cohaagen looks too,feeble ,while Michael Ironside as his henchman does a lot better.All in all,a classic that is a must-watch not only for die-hard Schwarzenegger fans,but for all fans of the sci-fi genre itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is one of many films that made Arnold Schwarzenegger exactly what he is...an action superstar. Not only that but Total Recall is exactly what it was set out to be a sci-fi epic from the fantastic mind of writer Philip Dick (Paycheque, Minority Report.) Total Recall takes the sci-fi film to epic proportions and makes it almost fantasy like. The biggest difference between Dick's stories compared to some other sci-fi writers like Gene Rodenberry is that Dick's future doesn't try to be accurate. Total Recall could happen in another reality altogether. There is a fantasy like epic to it.Another one of the great things about Total Recall is it was made in a time before CGI become so dominant. The special effects are resoundingly real, painstakingly created, things are not "faked." The world they create is dark, gloomy, futuristic, very gritty. The film takes you from Earth to Mars, and creates two very different types of setting for each planet. The film is not about the technology or the future or the planets, these things are just normal ideas for the characters in the film...Total Recall is about Douglas Quaid played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Starting out as a regular every day Joe and eventually leading him to a former life where he existed as a killing machine, a secret agent, and a major player in a government conspiracy. Everything unfolds at perfect speed and this film is the definition of non-stop action. The chases, the shootouts, the incredible fight scenes and the extreme goriness of it all like only an eighties "R" Rated film could do. They don't make movies like this period!! The film is chock full of no holds barred gore. The death scenes are brutal and some of the special effects are just stunning. The effect used to warp the faces of humans who breath the martian air is shocking and disturbing and funny all at once. The characters are very real and strong but mostly focusing on Quaid. Schwarzenegger easily holds his own in the film but the rest of the cast is quite good too. Sharon Stone in a pre-Basic Instinct role as the conniving wife of Quaid who turns out to be his enemy. Their fights and her skills as an action star are just awesome. Michael Ironside in his usual bad guy role is good as well but it's not a stretch for him as he's used to this kind of role. Rachel Ticotin as Schwarzenegger's love interest also does a decent enough job. Just like they're are Bond girls, I also like to think there is Eighties Action Girls. Top Gun had Kelly McGillis, RoadHouse had Kelly Lynch and so on...they aren't great actresses but they are used as more eye candy than anything else. But she does an alright job. This film really is made great by the script and Schwarzenegger. It's a Star Wars level epic about the future and this man. It is hands down an absolute must see for Sci-fi fans!! It truly is one of the best action films ever!! It was quite simply awesome!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very partial to "Total Recall", and always will be. Arnold Schwarzenegger shooting Sharon Stone on Mars and quoting, "Consider it a divorce." is classic. And he's known for catchy taglines like that, having a LOT of them in "Commando", and several others through the years.But the reason why I loved it so much was because I'm from Quincy, Illinois. There's only 2 people that have been famous from there. Rick "The Whale" Reuschel, a pitcher for the San Francisco Giants in the 1980s, and Roy Brocksmith, Hollywood's adorable big teddybear. I met Mr. Brocksmith in 1991, right after this movie was released (he had just finished Arachnophobia a few months before) and I got to spend a whole day with him just us 3 (with the guy that introduced us, who worked for the community college in Quincy).At 12 years old, you meet someone like that, and it blows your mind. :) of course, he's not Governor Schwarzenegger (thats still funny), but he's from Quincy and I met him and I loved it. That brings me to why "Total Recall"? Well, its one of a very select few (a handful) of appearances he ever made where he gets real mad. He's really a quiet, gentle man and this role he played as the doctor who yells at Arnold, "But back on Earth - YOU'LL BE LOMBOTTOMIZED (spelled wrong)" That stands out as the most memorable moment of a very nice career. And the story and other characters stand out too, its a classic "ARNOLD KICKS @$$" film. :) One of my favorite movies of all-time. Check it out! We miss you, Roy! God Speed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more I see this film, the worse it looks!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that 'Total Recall' is without doubt one the most mindless, derivative pieces of Sci-Fi/action trash I've ever had the misfortune to watch.The plot (if it can be described as such) concerns Douglas Quaid, an average, everyday construction worker on earth, circa 2084 who is plagued by recurring dreams of him visiting the planet Mars. It's not until he has problems while getting a memory transplant of a holiday on Mars that he starts to learn that he actually HAS been there. He travels out the the red planet to piece things together, and gets involved with Martian resistance fighters in their fight against the local dictator, Mies Coehagen.What follows is a zero-brainpower orgy of unnecessarily gory violence, frequent shoot-outs, and tacky set pieces. Among the film's few redeeming features is a wide-sweeping Special effects shot of the underground atmosphere generator. The rest of the production design featured in this film looks like it had been made out of wood and cardboard, and been garnished like Christmas trees with a lot of rather tacky gaudy-coloured neon. The 'Venusville' slum/shanty town set looks like one big museum for 80's kitsch. With the exception of the scene wher that dummy head opens up, even the make-up and prosthetic effects aren't much up to scratch, considering the big budget that was lavished on this turkey of a movie.Makes you wonder how this festering pile of garbage,'Total Recall' ever became such a huge box-office smash.Ridley Scott did a much better job of predicting the future as one big filthy, rat-infested neon-lit red light district in his piece de resistance, 'BladeRunner' which 'Total Recall' steals a lot of its ideas from.Throughout the film, Arnie spends most of the time cheerily blasting away hordes of gun-toting bad guys with a wise-ass remark and a smile on his face. The highlight out of all of these moments is when Quaid Kills his wife (playde by Sharon Stone) who is in fact an enemy agent, and just sarcastically says 'consider this a divorce'. All in all, this film is a rather tragic waste of time and money. This is certainly a comedown for director Paul Voerhoven from his 1987 classic, 'Robocop', nor anywhere near as witty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schwarzenegger and Verhoeven's Martian Epic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest fans of Paul Verhoeven's extremely violent and stylish SF classic, ROBOCOP, was Arnold Schwarzenegger. Knowing that their artistic temperaments would mesh perfectly, Schwarzenegger promised the Dutch director that when he found the 'right' property, they would make a film together. TOTAL RECALL became their 'dream' collaboration, and stands today as one of the most popular and successful SF films ever made.From his first reading of an early draft of the script, very loosely based on Philip K. Dick's novel "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale", Schwarzenegger was confident of it's potential, but had to wait for Dino De Laurentiis, who owned the rights, to decide what to do with the property. When the Italian producer decided against filming it, the action star bought the script, then used his leverage to get Carolco Pictures and TriStar to finance the production, with himself in the lead, and Verhoeven to direct.The script, while very good, needed a lot of work ("It lacked a strong third act," as Verhoeven put it), and a number of writers, credited and uncredited, contributed to the end result, with Gary Goldman doing rewrites on the set, daily. A fabulous cast was assembled, including ROBOCOP alum Ronny Cox (again playing the villain), Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, and, in her breakout role, Sharon Stone as Schwarzenegger's 'wife'. Despite having done nude scenes before, Stone shyly balked at Verhoeven's request to "show some skin" in a bed scene with Schwarzenegger ("I got her back in BASIC INSTINCT", the director would joke). Shot at Carolco's studio in Mexico, the production proved rigorous but enjoyable, with Schwarzenegger keeping the atmosphere light and productive.The story combines many classic SF elements (brainwashing, virtual reality, mutants, interplanetary war, ancient alien civilizations and technology), served up with Verhoeven's unique brand of graphic violence and sexuality, and Schwarzenegger's humor and brawny action. As 'Douglas Quaid', a construction worker on Earth who has dreams of a totally different life on Mars, he would discover that his entire life, including his marriage and even his name, were all an elaborate lie. In his search for his 'true' past, 'Quaid' would become a hunted man on two planets, and a tool for both sides in a conflict to determine the ultimate destiny of humanity on Mars.Although the 'science' of the film is farfetched (terraforming a planet in minutes stretches credibility!), the story is fast-paced and spectacular, and would become a major box office hit, worldwide.And with Verhoeven and Stone moving on to BASIC INSTINCT, and Schwarzenegger's follow-up projects KINDERGARTEN COP and TERMINATOR II, TOTAL RECALL heralded the start of the most successful period of each of their careers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total-ly Revolting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sci-fi tale of "is it real or is it Memorex?" had interesting potential. But is suffers from wretched excesses: gratuitous violence, endless filthy language, and a preoccupation with stupid-looking rubber doll puppets that can got through all kind of improbably grotesque distortions. This is a hard-edge film that simply is uncomfortable to watch. It should have been "terminated" for gross stupidity and a high "yuck" factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it reality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fast paced Arnold movie is a futuristic blood bath. A guy who wants to go to mars (we can do that in the future apparently) decides just to have the trip implanted in his brain as a memory. Instead of doing that though it makes him remember his past self who is a spy. They clear his memory again and he has no recollection of his being a spy, but he is attacked again and again by everyone. He gets to mars and there is more bloodshed. This one has a lot of action, but it has a rather good plot as well. The effects are pretty good too, as the scenes on mars are pretty convincing. All in all a great action thrill ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that will leave you confused.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch this movie, and just happen to pay attention, you'll be very confused by the end. Warning: major spoiler ahead.There's a scene where Arnie is getting his vacation chip installed in his brain, and just before he gets it, a technician is looking at the chip. The guy mentions something like 'oh look, here's a new one, blue sky on Mars!'. They proceed to embed the chip and away we go.At the end, after Arnie activates the Alien atmospheric converter/creator, a s***load of oxygen is released and creates an atmosphere, complete with lightning and thunder. Eventually a blue sky forms. This is where the confusion comes in. The whole movie revolves around the audience wondering if Arnie is really a secret agent whose past memories have been triggered, or if he's just experiencing his vacation chip. Philip K. Dick originally wrote the story to keep you guessing, even after you read the last page, and the movie successfully carries this off. However, most people I've talked to never noticed the technician talking about the blue sky on Mars chip, and hence don't get the full effect of the built-in confusion. I think if you watch this movie again and really pay attention (maybe even turn on the subtitles), you'll enjoy it much more. Realize the paradox: blue sky on Mars chip, blue sky on Mars at the end of the movie. Overall, a great action film with one of the best action film guys ever. Special effects are pretty damn special, or at least were in their time. The plot kinda sucks, and the dialogue is predictably bad, but who goes to see Predator or a film like this expecting a really interesting plot and some great lines other than 'I'll be back' or 'stick around'? One good quotable is 'open your mind, Quaid'. I forgot if Arnie gets any catchy lines or not. A good way to waste 120 minutes of your life. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall was just an awesome movie. It is as good as a solid action packed film. Arnie was amazing and there was lots of fighting in that movie. Blade Runner just sucked like s***. What was ford thinking of. Total Recall did not just copy Blade Runner but they did an improved version of it. It has great futuristic settings and storyline. Man does Arnie rule in that movie. This is certainly a Great Arnie movie which alot of his movies were good at that time. I recommend you watch this film if you are into action movies but if you hate action movies and you only care about stupid gymnastics then watch garbage Blade Runner with a girl doing a summersault scene until you fall asleep and your family has to call in the fire department just to drag your body into bed. This is the movie to watch not BLADE RUNNER!10/10 FOR A SOLID WELL DONE MOVIE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Verhoeven masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone in this film is at their best: Paul Verhoeven, Sharon Stone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Ironside, Ronny Cox, and even that dummy they used for Johnnycab. Yes, that last one was a joke. Just another film that was ripped off in order to create The Matrix, Total Recall's claim to fame is being the first film to be released in Australia with two seperate VHS versions. Of course, the R-rated VHS version was deleted due to commercial reasons, but we Verhoeven fans are having the last laugh now that DVD-Video is driving VHS towards its well-deserved extinction, with the full R-rated cut available in all its digital gory glory.I wonder if anyone actually kept a tally of the number of people that were killed during this film? More people get shot during Doug Quaid's escape from the subway station than during the entirety of End Of Days, and Total Recall is still Arnold's best film ever. I'm not sure if it still is financially, but it certainly is in terms of plot and acting. Ronny Cox puts in a performance that, like his turn in RoboCop, I like to think of as an exhibition of a schoolteacher with some guts. Michael Ironside is a delight to watch in this film... it was like watching myself in a film where someone's turned the clock ahead by about thirty years. Sharon Stone, of course, proves that even with the massive improvement granted to all involved, she still can't act, but she is only in the film for a total of about fifteen minutes at most. My only complaint about the film is that I wish they'd cast someone a little more appealing or believeable as Mileena. She was the only weak spot in the film as far as I am concerned.When Paul Verhoeven commits himself to a film, you know he's going to give it his all, regardless. Even when he churns out a real turkey, it is plain to see in elements thereof that he put his heart and soul into it. When he builds a total masterpiece like Total Recall, which is rumoured to still be less violent than the cut he originally wanted, he puts that much more oomph into every aspect of the film that you just can't help but watch. Violence and intellectual stimulation have been the two saviours of my life to date, and Total Recall provides them both in spades. Nine out of ten (ten for the director's cut when it comes out some day).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like The Running Man, an original concept is taken and bent pretty seriously to make a Schwarzenegger action flick. The parallels between the movies are uncanny. In both, the basically-written scenario of a fairly normal Average Joe thrust into a bizarre situation beyond his control...is turned into a hugely muscled supra-man blowing away folks left right and center. When TR forgets that it is a Ahnald flick it's actually pretty entertaining and intellectually engaging. But then the producers remember who their star is, and throw in some gratuitous violence and standard Ahnald one-liners. But the mind games aspects are few and far between. The casting is well done - Ironside, Cox, and Stone are great villains, and even underrated folks like Roy Brocksmith and Michael Champion get their moments. But don't go in expecting a great s.f. movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is but a dream.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreams and reality are always in conflict because the line gets blurred so easily and there isn't a real way to be sure. I'll admit I've actually had several instances where I thought that my dreams were actually the real world and then when I woke up I was confused if I really woke up to reality or if I'm still dreaming. This film is one of my personal favorite sci-fi movies everything about it is just great let alone the fact it's based on one of the short stories from my favorite sci-fi author Philp K. Dick.Everything about the film is just great from the production value, everything is practical from make up to set pieces there is very little CGI and when the CGI is used it looks great because it looks real. This film to me is one of the best examples of effects and CGI used the right way, well and for the right reasons. One favorite effect of mine is the Robot mask sequence, the mask was practically a three dimensional puzzle, I love how we see it come apart and put itself together. But most importantly I just love the world of the future created because it feels possible and plausible, some concepts are slightly prolific on what we have now. Like the concept that we've been able to colonize planets and are able to travel to them as an everyday convenience. But also the technology mainly the Recall machine which is an interesting and fascinating concept because it's the ability and freedom to create memories and identity anyway you want, let's say I decided my memory vacation would be New York City and I gave myself the identity role of a superhero Batman and I was in some ongoing situation and kicking butt, I would really believe I was Batman at that point in time because that dream vacation is part of my memories. The action sequences are great their all well choreographed and practical plenty of gore effects, like one of my favorite shootouts was in the alien plant and Quaid was using the hologram as a decoy, it was great because even I was fooled sometimes let alone it's sort of acts as an irony to the theme of the film. But also the infamous scene of seeing both Melina and Lori fight, it was a short fight but still it was fun because of just how well choreographed and slightly realistic it was and just the fact two strong hot women were fighting is a turn on for me (seriously I don't know why it just is). The music score is great by one of my favorite composers the late great Jerry Goldsmith, the theme song is one of my favorite themes ever it's an adventurous epic tone.And the characters are great. To me Douglas Quaid is my favorite role from Arnold Schwarznagger. Not just do we like the character Quaid because he can kick butt and has charisma, but that he's actually sympathetic. Throughout the film you see him just completely disoriented with everything happening around him and is struggling to make sense of it but is unable to because there are so many twists and turns and nothing to nobody is what it seems. One moment where I really sympathize with him was in getting jumped by spies and suddenly he starts fighting and killing the guys, after the battle is over he looks at his hands in shock over what he's done. You can clearly see in his eyes he's thinking the same thing we are, "how in the hell did he do that." I like Melina (Rachel Ticotin) she's like the common femme fatale in thrillers one to help the hero and fall in love with, she's hot and has the persona and fighting skills to boot. Even the villains are great other than Lori (Sharron Stone) whom was great as the typical deceptive dangerous femme fatale to foil the protagonist. Cohagen (Ronny Cox) whom is a ruthless CEO that rules Mars with an iron fist as well as make big profits at the cost of lives. But to me the villain that stands out is Richter played well by one of my favorite actors Michael Ironside, he's just a right hand man that is just so ruthless and hell bent on wanting to kill Quaid for no apparent reason it just seems like he hates his guts, may'be both had some bad blood in the past I don't know. He's menacing because of his unbending determination to kill him, he's willing to kill anyone in the way if it means he has a clear shot. He's kinda fun/funny because there is this really black sense of charisma or dry humor to his character.It tackles the existential philosophical concepts on what is reality as well as what is identity. It really is trippy when you think about it, whenever you wake up everything is always the same except the day which always changes and with every tomorrow we always add more to our identity or discover things about ourselves we didn't think existed. And how much about our past can we really remember, there are times when there is conflicting viewpoints on how we remember certain event of our life, another at that event may remember and viewed it differently, or it just didn't happen at all.So are we in reality or dreaming, it's really up to you.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it came out in 1990, and at the time, it was a Sci-Fi film made exclusively with adults in mind, what a concept! Paul Verhoeven spy thriller set in space is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable movies ever made. The action is terrific, the special-effects are excellent, and the characters (while not deep in scope) are nevertheless very interesting and help to keep the pace of the script tight. Ahnuld puts forth his best performance as an actor, Sharon Stone was never more sexy, Michael Ironsides essentially plays the "Ham Tyler" role he played in the mini-series V (in which he was fabulous), and Ronny Cox plays a great SOB bad guy. The visual appeal of the film is undeniable and the pace of the action make it a Thrill Ride of Your Life. You have to watch it more than once to catch everything!One of Arnold's best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, Total Recall is one of my favourite films of the 90s. Its an epic action movie, the story is full of twists and turns and has a few funny moments with the brawny man (Arnold) saying his epic one liners. And this is one of those films where is acting is quite good. Its a lot better than the running man (Another fantastic film).The action scenes are fantastic. Sometimes when you see action films which are new, when someone gets shot, there is no blood, and no impact. But in this film, when someone gets shot, there is blood, lots of it, and it shows the impact it has on the character. The bullet will come out of the back, they will fly back, or they will be injured.... and get shot again.The film is being remade at the moment, and i hope it lives up to this one! I hope its not a 12a or pg/13 either. I hope its just as violent as this one, and as well made, and as entertaining as the original, well i have hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TOTAL breathtaking RECALL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Totall Recall (1990), directed by Paul Verhoeven (Starship Troopers, Robocop, The Hollow Man, Basic Instinct, etc.) is called "The avenger of the Future" in Portuguese. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone are together in the original futuristic movie where a man can buy memories. Similar to do an upload of situations, places and people and even be someone that in real life is not possible to be. Douglas Quaid / Hauser (Schwarzenegger), goes to the company Rekall buy a false memory, but ends up involved in a bad situation and leaves the viewer in the eternal question of whether it is all a dream or reality. The film is a landmark of special effects a la bloody Verhoeven. The old special effects are fantastic, creates a unique signature in the film. For those who like overpast special effects and a good story, I recommend it. Ideal for movie fans of "intelligent action", those where blowing things up is just a detail within a complex story full of breathtaking twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul and Arnie are a match made in heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a while since I read the short story by Philip K. Dick(one of my favorite authors of the genre) and that, coupled with the fact that I'm not entirely certain if I actually did read it, or I merely got memories implanted of doing so, means that I'm afraid I cannot make many comparisons between the two. I will say that this captures the essence pretty nicely(without being confusing), and it is an immensely entertaining ride. It's a typical Schwarzenegger flick, only smart(not so much that you can't follow it). Verhoeven nearly always delivers plenty of extreme, brutal violence(with that said, this isn't downright grotesque, as was the case with RoboCop, in spite of the cast members they have in common), a ton of awesome, exciting and fun action(shoot-outs, fights and chases), a solid serving of sex(at times including nudity, though not often in this; Stone is a fox), and *excellent* FX(seriously, stunning work, well done, Bottin, as you always do). Oh, and lest we forget, *biting* satire. And this is no exception. The designs are very cool, and the villains are pitch perfect. This has a fast pace, and there isn't a boring second to be found. It's intense, but not overpowering. The plot is marvelous and works out well, and the ambiguity is pure gold. You can tell that Shusett and O'Bannon, the two people who wrote Alien, were part of the team who did the script for this. The dialog has real shining moments, and the one-liners are memorable. While the acting varies a tad, it is mostly good. In addition to what I've already mentioned, there is frequent strong language in this. The DVD comes with a promotional(and not terribly informational) 7 minute behind-the-scenes featurette, a theatrical trailer and a teaser. I recommend this to any fan of the people who made it happen, especially the director and the star. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Recall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Total Recall, Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) living in 2084 dreams of being a secret agent of Mars and after a trip to a facility to give him the memories of a super-spy he is thrown into the middle of interplanetary espionage as his old employers attempt to bring him to Mars to help quash an uprising by the native people.The plot is taken from a Philip K Dick novel and is adapted to create an action film that has a clever plot with spectacular twists and turns, plus the theme of fantasy vs. reality, as we are left to decide for ourselves how much of Quaid's adventures are in his head. The action scenes are bloody but thrilling and entertaining whilst the suspense builds throughout the film, towards the impressive climax.There are problems with the film however. It is difficult to believe in Arnie as an everyman character or indeed anything other than a murderous robot. Another problem with the film are the constant chase sequences, which at times serve no purpose other than to show off the special effects and feature unnecessary violence. The vision of the future borrows heavily from the eighties fashion and as such the look of the film is some bizarre cross between futuristic neon and vulgar 80s couture, drawing unfavourable comparisons with other Philip K Dick adaptations like Blade Runner.Despite this, Total Recall stands out amongst other action/sci-fi films of the time, as instead of trying to dazzle the audience with over the top action, it creates a clever and well thought-out plot, with many twists and turns, as well as giving the audience something to think about after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun-filled Verhoeven-Schwarzenegger pairing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a HUGE Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, because in his prime in the 80s and early 90s, he made hugely profitable and entertaining movies. TOTAL RECALL (1990) is Arnie at his action (and perhaps even acting) peak. Total Recall may be the first movie of Schwarzenegger's that I realized, "Darn! This guy ain't a bad actor!". For you guys that think that Schwarzenegger can't act, watch this film. Actually, given the director, the great Paul Verhoeven, I should not have expected any less. He does an amazing job of taking larger-than-life beings, like Murphy in Robocop, and the superhuman Schwarzenegger in this film, and humanizing for all of us common folk. We actually relate to these powerful, yet sensitive, skewed, and damaged beings.Set sometime in the 'future',Total Recall tells the tale of Douglas Quaid (the aforementioned Schwarzenegger in a totally convincing performance). Quaid has a hot wife (Sharon Stone in her trademark super-sexy, conniving, backstabbing vixen role that she would become famous for in pretty much all her later films) and a seemingly content existence. But he has dreams of another life on Mars with an alluring brunette (will talk about her later). The bored Quaid wants some excitement in his life and so he goes to the company Rekall where they implant memories and visions of a completely different personality and existence. Quaid requests to be a secret agent on Mars with a sexy girlfriend, a la James Bond. During implantation, something goes terribly wrong and it appears that Quaid already has implants that the Rekall procedure has messed with. Turns out that Quaid has been to Mars and is a secret agent named Hauser put on Earth for a special mission, or so we think.When I first saw the film, I couldn't distinguish whether or not the stuff happening at Rekall was truly happening or were part of their implants to Quaid b/c he DID request to be a secret agent on Mars with a sexy girlfriend. Ironic that he already had all that! That's part of the fun of the film: it keeps you guessing. And along the way, you get treated the classic Arnold puns and one-liners (got to have those). But in this film, Arnold actually shows some acting chops while he's delivering those pun-liners! He's really good.The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast: the aforementioned Stone, Ronny Cox (from Verhoeven's prior masterpiece Robocop), Michael Ironside as his #1 henchman (Ironside was also in Verhoeven's later Starship Troopers), and someone I've mentioned several times in this review, Rachel Ticotin as the dark-haired sexy girlfriend Melina, the one Quaid dreams about and requests at Rekall. Ticotin may just be the first (and last) Schwarzenegger female co-star that was his equal in terms of toughness and resourcefulness. Alluring is the word I used to describe her and that's what she is in this film: sexy without being overtly sexual, moderately attractive but still very desirable. It's easy to see what Quaid sees in her: she represents the excitement and danger that his humdrum daily existence lacks.Being a 'futuristic' film that came out in 1990, the film just barely escapes the dated look of 80s futuristic films. The look and feel of the film is believable enough to make you believe its the future, although some of the set pieces are a little humorous to take seriously now (the Johnny car?). But, all that aside, Total Recall is a great, thought-provoking action film with a complex premise and an all-time hero that everyone can root for: Arnold Schwarzenegger!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing special effects and a lightening fast script keep you interested in this very violent Arnold Schwarzenegger science-fiction action flick.Director Paul Verhoeven has created (with a little help from some special effects experts I'm sure) an eye-popping film that follows our hero from earth to Mars as he tries to find out who he really is. To tell any more of the plot would not be fair, or very easy I assure you. Some may find this frantic story line a little confusing. However, "Total Recall" is never dull and both Arnie fans and action fans should give this one a hundred and nine minutes of their time.Tuesday, September 17, 1991 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy, but has some fun parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like any Schwarzanegger flick, it has Arnold's tough and entertaining swagger, but nonetheless this film doesn't warrant watching twice. The dialogue provided to the actors is clichéd, and really limits the potential of the film.One of the major disappointments for me was that the sexy Sharon Stone gets shot half-way into the movie. In the time that her character is still alive, her performance is limited incredibly by the unimaginative writing that curses this movie.The special effects were the weakest point in this movie. They were cheesy to the point of not even being funny. Perhaps the stupidest special effect I have ever watched on film was the fetus-like "thing"--the leader of the rebellion on Mars-- emerging from the torso of one of the rebel's, like some retarded baby-Yoda.Everything that's good about this movie can be ascribed to two people: Arnold Schwarzanegger and Phillip K. Dick (upon whose book this movie's story is adapted from). Arnold provides the action and laughs, while Dick's story provides some interesting material on a philosophical and conceptual level. This movie also made me aware that The Matrix clearly stole several concepts from Dick's book.Worth a single watch, but definitely not two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!When you bring together one of the best satirical directors, two of the most evil looking men on the planet famed for their bad guy roles, and Arnie, to make a sci-fi film based on a Phillip K Dick story, it can't possibly be a failure. i'll start with the downers: if you are not an Arnie or sci-fi fan, you probably won't enjoy the high levels of violence or the one liners, and the plot may seem too confusing for it's own good. However, watch the film in its entirety, and it makes perfect sense.Good stuff: the Oscar winning effects are some of the best of the late eighties, early 90's, the plot will keep you guessing, and guessing wrong, Cox and Ironside are superb, the theme tune is a classic, and there is all the usual Arnie escapades. I won't give a plot overview as i'd be here all day, but if you like Arnie and sci-fi, this should be a favourite. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's confusing, but it's good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not so sure what I can say about this film. It's exciting but I was also confused on a few things. Everything seemed to go pretty fast. But I think I got the plot. Of course, it's kind of strange to see Arnold scream. So that was a bit of a distraction. You got to admit, the accent made who he is. The movie takes place in the future. People go to Mars for vacation. And taxi drivers are robots. There are mutants. And it just gets weirder and weirder. I hope the future will not turn out like that. The movie is good and the effects are amazing for it's time. I would recommend this for Arnold or action lovers. Just to let you know, Arnold does do a lot of screaming. But you do get to also see how the 80's fashion will come back in the future. Oh, man, that's scary. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TOTAL DISASTER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> This is a really bad movie in my opinion. The film has a cheesy plot, all I can really say is that it's Arnold Schwartzenegger and Michael Ironside goingaround shooting everything in sight when not shooting at each other. This is a typical Verhoven film, it contains a lot of violence, and some sexual content which Verhoven loves putting in his movies. The best thing about the movie is Jerry Goldsmith's action packed music score. I think he should have won anOscar for it or at least have been nominated. But other than the music, this is a horrible movie which I named "Total Disaster!" Schwartzenegger should havefound something else to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>just rented this stinker of a film. it should be thrown in the large dumpster reserved for all of the worst movies ever made. realizing it was made in the late 80's, when movie making was at a very low point, there is still no excuse for such poor writing, poor acting and hoakey special effects. except to realize that when some productions head on a downward spiral there is no salvation. there is very little to say otherwise except perhaps that no film ever had a less appealing cast of characters: absurd chase scenes, poorly costumed and made up mutants, midgets, big hair, grueling faces, a grouchy ronnie cox, an idiotically menacing michael ironsides, this film should never be rented, not even for a rainy day, completely stoned lark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is bad! Look at the costumes. They seem to be made out of plastic. They look like the "dress up like Robocop" outfit for 5 year old kids! They seem to be made out of plastic. Then look at the story. It is so unconvincing and childish. Then look at Schwarzenegger. His facial expression is always the same, and his tone of voice is so plain that it is like a vocoder speaking. Well, I guess that makes him more like a Robocop. This film is not for me. If you want Sci-Fi, I think you should go for "Pitch Black" or "AI".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is a much better film that I expected it to be. Being a sci-fi fan and with a remake due out later this year, I decided to finally check out this film. The one thing I noticed right away is that this film had very good special effects for the the year it was released which was 1990. I read that this is one of the first major Hollywood films to use CGI.This movie is designed to make you think due to the complexity. It's a movie all about these versions of reality. The plot is way to complex to describe in detail.The acting is solid. Arnold gives a strong performance based on the fact he brought emotion into his character. Sharon Stone delivers her top performance ever, right next to her role in Casino.Overall, this is a great, complex sci-fi film. It's like the Inception of the 1990's. Not only there are plot twists, there is explosive action and very good special effects which I believed were honored at the 1991 Academy Awards. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muscles, Minds &amp; Mars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Arnie ramps slaughter and destruction into overdrive with this no-holds-barred science fantasy.The story is too complicated to explain here. Arnie has a series of overlapping identities each serving different environments and situations that have been 'artificially' created for him. And all the while, he is in ignorance. Until...Set somewhen in the future, space-travel is commonplace. Mars has a thriving colony. There's a great commercial enterprise running things, and - as usual - running things without the least regard for humans. Equally inevitable; there's a civil war in progress. Arnie's multiple identities are entailed in all of the conflicting interests.The movie got big bucks to spend. Sets are lavish and believable. Special effects are absolutely top-drawer, as good as any CGI. There are any number of the most bizarre mutants, each wearing complicated and believable prosthetics. Sound and music scores are right on the money, with a good, thumping base line. The script is intelligent and witty. As a piece of cinema it is hard to fault.It's also very brutal. Yet there's still a discreet thread of tongue-in-cheek humour running through it. And on top of all this, there's the often mesmerising mixture of Arnie's complex identities, giving the viewer a genuine pause for thought about who we actually are. In this regard it is an especially clever movie.But don't ever take it seriously. It's just wildly over-the-top fun. Much of what it poses is pure hokum; it's certainly NOT science fiction, but fantasy at its most brash, so nit-picking is pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best 90's action based Sci-Fi film I've seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I've never been a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, not that I mind the actor, I've just never liked the type of films he's in. But this is definitely one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger films I've ever seen, he really should stick to Sci-Fi. Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox are always great, but they both always seem to play the bad guys, but they're good at it so why not.I was a little sceptical about this movie although I had decided to see it, but when I say the name Rob Bottin the genius behind the special affects for John Carpenters "the Thing" (one of my favourite movies by the way)I couldn't wait to see what this movie had in store. And it delivered. For a movie from 1990, the special effects are amazing, maybe slightly dated, but who cares. Also Jerry Goldsmith also known for the Star Trek movies musical scores, just makes this movie even better.The story itself, has so many twists and turns, but is still understandable and it is always filled with action. It keeps you exited and intrigued all the way to the end. Except for having the typical 90's action movie feel to it, with a lot of shooting and explosions much of the time, this movie will please both action and Sci-Fi fans.I give this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death by gunfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best movies Schwazenegger has ever been in. But I really don't think that is saying much. The action in this movie picks up very fast, and doesn't stop. If you like a lot of mindless action, guns, and gory death sequences then you are in for a treat. The amount of people in this movie who are killed is about....well a lot of people die in this movie. So many people were killed in the original cut of this movie, that the MPAA issued the movie a X-rating for its extreme violence. The story is simple, but some people may argue that statement. Was he dreaming, or was it reality? In the end it really doesn't matter, because its not meant to be known. Overall the movie was an enjoyable action experience, but for my taste of movies, just too mindless. Did anybody else laugh really hard at that cornflakes line at the end of the movie? I really liked what IMDb member James Hitchcock had to say about Total Recall, "Poor Man's Blade Runner". I couldn't say it any better myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Recall was a most enjoyable Arnold Schwarzenegger-Paul Verhoeven movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Total Recall for the second time though the only things I remember from the first time was when Arnold Schwarzenegger shot Sharon Stone and said, "Consider that a divorce!" When Michael Ironside had his arms ripped off hanging in that moving elevator and the end. Slow moving at first, things get going real fast when Arnold's character suddenly remembers things even before the people at the Total Recall building put the "memory" in his mind! From there, it's nothing but fast-paced action and chases as we thrill to see him get his "identity" back as he has to choose between "wife" Stone or his more alluring "fantasy" Rachel Ticotin as they get in one of the coolest catfights in movie history! And how about Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox as the villains? Or the Jerry Goldsmith score? Or the Rob Bottin make up effects like that guy inside of this other guy who helps Arnold's character? Not to mention one of the coolest action/sci-fi directors ever, Paul Verhoeven? Man, I was riveted the whole time and I couldn't believe how enjoyable this was this second time. I don't think I'll forget anything this time around. Certainly not that Johnnycab robot who I just found out was the voice of Robert Picardo who I remember from both "The Wonder Years" and "China Beach" during that time. What a funny character that one was especially when he said he didn't know that place when Arnold said, "Sh--!" I think I've said enough so I'll just say, go see Totall Recall if you haven't and are a fan of Mr. Schwarzenegger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, stupid but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid. He lives on Earth in the future with a loving wife (Sharon Stone) and a good life. But he keeps having dreams about Mars and another woman. Then he finds out they might be more than just dreams...There's a lot more going on in the plot but I won't spoil it. This came out in the summer of 1990. It was a huge hit but was attacked by many critics who complained about the extreme violence in the film. Seen today it still IS very violent (I'm surprised it got by with a R rating) but...it's just a movie. Also, if you don't take the film too seriously (and you shouldn't) it actually gets kind of amusing. There's plenty of blood and dead bodies (and body parts) flying around but it's really hard to take it realistically.The plot is very complicated--too much. The twists and turns keep you guessing but there are a LOT of plot holes in this. Two huge examples--How did Melina know they were going to take Quaid down the service elevator when she saves him and who (or what) IS Quatro? We see him/it but it's never explained why he's viewed as a God. And the constant product placement is Venusville was very obvious (and annoying). Still, I DO recommend this movie.The movie moves very quickly (it's directed by the great Paul Verhoeven), the violence keeps things interesting and the acting is not bad. Schwarzenegger (surprisingly) is pretty good in the main role. Stone really sucks in her role but this movie was her breakthrough. Michael Ironside is lousy too--but then he always is. However Rachel Ticotin is great as the heroine and Ronny Cox has lots of fun as Cohaagen, the slimy villain (although supposedly he was appalled at the amount of violence in the film). The special effects are great (no crappy CGI was available back then) and there's a GREAT cat fight between Stone and Ticotin.So it's fast, extremely violent and lots of fun. Just don't think about the plot too much. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hard to remember five minutes afterward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an ironic title for such a forgettable movie, reportedly one of the most expensive ever made, although most of the over-bloated budget, wasted on gratuitous special effects, would have been better spent on a halfway decent screenplay and basic elocution lessons for Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former Mr. Olympia certainly has the beefcake proportions of a matinée idol, but none of the necessary charisma: he mutters expletives, sprays bullets around, and thereby exhausts his acting skills.The almost incoherent plot, concerning mind games on the Martian colonies in the near future, is just an excuse for an endless, irritating succession of chases and mayhem, directed by Paul Verhoeven with a lack of excitement matched only by his lack of imagination. Verhoeven hasn't enough sense of style to bring even a token gesture of fun into the (mean-spirited) action sequences, and when Arnold uses an innocent bystander to block a villain's bullets we're meant to applaud his quick thinking.The script was based (very loosely, one suspects) on a Philip K. Dick story, but it's a shame artificial memory transplants like those featured throughout the film couldn't be used on the audience to leave a better impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Planet runs red with blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Total Recall began, I thought to myself, "This shouldn't be too bad." The film had elements of mystery and science fiction, always a good combination. The special effects were extraordinary for their time, and I always enjoyed viewing pre-90's attempts at elaborate visual effects. However, the film quickly turned into an ugly and violent action movie. The violence in this movie is beyond gratuitous, and if you are looking for a decent sci-fi movie, Total Recall is not it. If more focus were put on the mysterious aspects of the story and more thought was put into making a world of the future, then Total Recall might be worthwhile. But for me, this was just Ah-nuld finding various ways to impale people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent concept, but a dumb film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise, a man plagued by memories and unsure whether they are real or false could have made for an intelligent, thought provoking, tense thriller, and indeed it did some six years later in Terry Gilliam's 'Twelve Monkeys'. Unfortunately here the idea is wasted, reduced to a run-of-the-mill actioner, used entirely as a vehicle for the once popular Arnie. There are a dozen running gun battles, but each is exactly the same as the next. Anything that can explode must explode. Anything that can erupt in a spray of blood must explode in a spray of blood.In it's defence, Arnie hasn't made a film in the same league as this since Terminator 2, and it introduced a seductive Sharon Stone ('If you don't trust me you can tie me up') to a wide audience, giving us a taster of what she and Verhoven could do a year later in 'Basic Instinct'. Perfect if you - like the customers at Rekall inc. - have had a labotomy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only watched this film recently and despite people praising it as a sci-fi film of legendary performances I can't help but feel let down by the films awful plot and acting.Maybe it was a clever idea. Who would have come up with the idea of Arnold acting badly (as he does best) and killing a few people, genius. Needless to say it takes more than a few special effects (which haven't stood the test of time despite what some of the reviews here say) and fights to grip my attention.

		<shortDescription>Partial success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently the last of the pre-CGI blockbusters, which means everything and everyone you see, at least in one sense are real. Therefore it's perhaps unfair to judge it by modern day standards, but it has to be said that all the blood (and there's lots of it) looks like tomato ketchup, the fight scones look very fake and much of the make up effects look like grafted on rubber. Then there's the perennial question, how do you solve a problem like Arnie? He plainly can't act, get into character or even say a line without giving the appearance he's memorised it the minute before. Well, like my brother says, you make a singer who can't dance look like they can by surrounding them with good dancers and while it's arguable director Paul Verheuven does that with the quality of acting here, there is a terrific Philip K Dick storyline playing out in the background, not to mention some memorable scenes and visual effects for good measure.The idea of replacing a man's memories for me is a fascinating one and one that reminded me of Dennis Potter's excellent TV drama "Karaoke" from around the same time starring Albert Finney. Of course, the finesse in the story is blockbustered away by Schwarzenegger's action hero status which effectively means that the long middle part of the movie is one extended chase sequence, but the movie does hint at a degree of intelligence after all by giving us a slightly enigmatic "Inception"-like finish.The most memorable SFX undoubtedly involve make-up and the use of prosthetic masks, like when Arnold's impersonation of a lady tourist comes unstuck at the space station and when he and Melina's facial features nearly explode when they come into contact with the Martian atmosphere. Verheuven directs most of the movie seemingly through a red filter giving a suitably other-worldly sheen to events.Sure the direction is often flashy, occasionally crude and repetitive (try counting the number of dead bodies, smashed windows and trashed cars and you'll get the general drift), but there's no doubt it's an entertaining movie which helped propel Shwarzeneggar to top box office status for the rest of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the year 1990, I was reading the action, paranormal, fantasy, sci-fi french movies magazine Mad Movies and that's surely how I picked this movie and later discovered PKD works! If the screenplay is a bit different from the short story, it's however a excellent story about identity, space colonization and the movie is totally gripping with talent everywhere: Goldsmith's soundtrack is extraordinary, Stone new coming is remarkable, Ironside is the definition of hard-boiled and as in Robocop, the big boss is really this dirty CEO. For sure, the visuals of this future and Mars is realistic and Verhoeven knows how to give a really fast pace while not losing the audience in a complicated script! Here, it's clear, clean and well cut. Maybe there is too much blood and bodies count but at the end, that's among the finest example of what's sci-fi: a never seen experience as much for the eyes than for the brain!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has an excellent plot and design but is far too cheesy and gratuitous for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall features an original story by Phillip K. Dick, a script by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett (the two dudes behind Alien), special make-up effects by the great Rob Bottin (the guy responsible for all of The Thing's gory glory) and is directed by renowned Dutch director Paul Verhoeven (the guy who did all the good films) so with talents like these this film is bound to be good right? Right? Well everyone loves it and I can certainly see why, with all it's great plot points and futuristic sets, this film is instantly appealing. The design is especially one of the things that stands out most of all to me. It's stuff like the ominous Mars pyramid and all the wacky and narrow tunnels and corridors inside of it that still make me shiver. That's not to mention the awesome giant generator thing at the end. It's stuff like that which manages to be really cool to look at but also super eerie at the same time.Aside from all the claustrophobic action and demented twists and turns, Total Recall gets a lot of it's greatness from an incredibly intricate plot. It's filled with so many different things- the chases and fight scenes on an excellently imagined Earth, a simple man being plunged into a chaotic adventure, dreams (real or maybe not), ancient aliens, psychic mutants, a corrupt, over-crowded Mars with its own mini war going on, a fake identity, a secret group of rebels, retracing old steps, wife problems, a dream woman, robot taxis, double crossings and Jerry Goldsmith (:D) music- that, feels just a bit too overwhelming... It manages to pull off all these different aspects without really letting up however, and never seems too ambitious. With a great introduction and setting, the film sadly begins to loose its grip in terms of rationality and unfortunately hands itself over to the cheesy conventions of 80's and early 90's action movies. With Verhoeven's previous film RoboCop (which is amazing by the way), it has a cheesiness that really helps define and distinguish itself, lending towards its satirical edge. In other words: the cheesiness of RoboCop makes the film feel more individual. However, with Total Recall, its cheesiness just makes it feel more generic an than it should be. In conclusion I write that: Total Recall is smart but makes itself dumb. It's still great but I feel that it was trying too hard.THE ENDCan't believe I wrote all that without mentioning Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well... he's in it. Bye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See you at the party, Richter!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a young guy growing up with action movies in the 1980's and 1990's, it was virtually impossible not to come across the numerous Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. I have seen "Total Recall" a couple of times since it was initially released, and the movie continues to be as entertaining as it was back then.While this is hardly not a contender for the best movie by Schwarzenegger, then it is still an entertaining movie and one that does stand out in his repertoire of movies, given the nature of the movie and its combination of action and Sci-Fi.The movie is about Douglas Quaid (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is having vivid dreams of the red planet Mars. He goes to Rekall Inc. where they sell implanted memories. But something goes awry and Quaid finds himself to be a secret agent named Hauser fighting against the sinister Cohaagen (played by Ronny Cox).It is the mixture of Sci-Fi and action that makes this 1990 movie an enjoyable movie to watch. And even while the effects are questionable by today's standards, then they do serve their purpose well enough. And back in 1990 they were actually quite good. And after having seen this movie, who will ever forget seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger or Ronny Cox on the surface of Mars suffocating. That has just amused me since 1990 and is still fun to watch today.There is a good amount of action in the movie, and there is a nice flow to the storyline and the movie. And the storyline was actually nicely paced and had a good continuation.For a movie from 1990, then there was a really good cast in the movie, which includes Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside, all names that you would know if you watched movies during the 1990's.If you compare the original 1990 version to the 2012 version, then this older gem far outshines the new movies and it is much more entertaining. Should you not already be familiar with the 1990 version directed by Paul Verhoeven, then do take the time to sit down and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it's a bit outdated and cheesy as hell, it's still a re- watchable movie even in 2015. Like I said the setting, the character interactions and the costume design is very cheesy but when it comes to the direction and development to the main twist it is done pretty well. It's not a sci-fi movie that I would watch over and over again and think of it as a classic. But I do have a bit of respect for what it accomplished when it came out. It's not the most clever or intelligent sci-fi film like the book this movie is based on. Not even quite sure if Arnold Schwarzenegger was the right actor to play this role. But it's Arnold so he does make this film to not be overly serious, dark but leads to memorable lines and humors. Not that those lines are highly intelligent and makes you think, but it's humorous. Some of the interactions are far from being something that you can accept as being legit even for a movie that came out in the early 90's. It's still a movie you can watch around friends with a couple of beers. Overall I think this is a good movie for it's time that audiences can still have a decent time with. I give this movie a 7.5/10 because I do think it inspired other film makers like the Wachowskis.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There Are Better Philip K. Dick Adaptations Out There than This Verhoeven Film, (Blade Runner (1982) and Minority Report (2002), for Example, but This Violent, Visually Impressive Movie is Not Bad. In Fact, it was Cutting Edge Miniatures and Very Early CGI that Gave the Movie a Very Modern Appeal in 1990.But While the SFX Still Hold-Up Today, the Plastic Make-Up, Not So Much and there is a Lot of That. It is the Make-Up that Makes the Film Seem Dated Today. The Movie was Very Popular In Its Day, and Got Mostly Good Reviews and Made Good Money. Some of that was Due to Arnold's Box Office Appeal.Schwarzenegger's Acting Ability is Tested in This One Because of the Complicated Script and While He Gives it His All, the Thespian Falls Short in That Regard. But He Must be Given Credit for Bringing This Story to the Screen as it Languished for Years in Hollywood Limbo.The Action is Intense and Bloody, the Look and Satire are Verhoeven Sheen. But the One-Liners are Very Inconsistent and the Director Could be Slighted for Going Way Over the Top at Times Instead of Just His Usual Over the Top. The Eye Popping Scenes for Example Go On Way Too Long and are Used Three Times.Overall, the Movie is a Bit Overrated and the Plasticized Mutants are Many and Dated, but Enough PKD Story Remains (I Can Remember it for You Wholesale) to Intrigue, and the Action Delivers for Those Arnold Expectations and the Director's Visceral Appeal.

		<shortDescription>Pure Arnold Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is a science-fiction story about a man named Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is on Earth, but is having a very strange dream about being on Mars. In an attempt to further understand the meaning of this dream, he goes to a place that specializes in this sort of thing. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan.This film definitely shows off its age quite a bit after the twenty-five years since its initial release on the big screen, (as you can suspect from any pre-modern science fiction movie) and unfortunately the age it shows does subtract from the experience at times for a first- time viewer like myself. Nothing gut-wrenchingly bad or anything, but just enough to make me wish I had seen the film when it was initially released.Arnold still prevails a big success as the lead role in an action film, and he is as great as he has ever been in this one. The plot to this film is actually better experienced knowing as little as possible, so I don't want to reveal too much, but expect gore, guns, and some blood.Overall, Total Recall can be campy, (and it can be dated) but it's a good old-fashion action flick for just grabbing a coke and some popcorn. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie messes it up. Again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually a far better movie than I expected. Paul Verhoeven is one of Holland's best when it comes to big budget cinema, but the true credits go to Philip K. Dick, one of the most interesting sci-fi writers of the 20th century, whose short story "We Can Remember It for Your Wholesale" inspired this movie. The special effects are excellent (no CGI's yet, hooray!) and the body horror is absolutely fantastic. But alas, when I see Arnold Schwarzenegger's face on my screen, I just want to rip my eyes and ears out. He's such an awful, unbearable actor and turns every movie he shows up in to crap. While I am able to enjoy The Terminator and Predator it is a very hard task to separate the qualities of the movie from the fact Arnie is messing the whole thing up. If I want to see bad acting, I'll watch a b-movie where it feels more authentic and not a big budget one where I expect overpaid actors to (try to) work for their money and not be an effing gimmick. So, to conclude, Total Recall would've been so much better without Arnie in it. And no, I'm not going to watch the remake where Colin Farrell took his place. A 2012 Hollywood movie will never have those groovy special effects and awesome body horror that made the 1990 version so good, so why bother?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similarities with RoboCop, distrust of corporations, dreams are made of this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IN conjunction with the release of the Total Recall remake on Aug 2, I'm running a review of the original flick.While watching director Verhoeven's 1990 flick on DVD today, I'm reminded of his RoboCop (1987).Both flicks share similarities, and not only in the excessive body count and gruesome violence. The main similarity is the director's mistrust of corporations, headed by rich white fat cats, which exert enormous power on a repressed populace and bleed them dry financially.Total Recall says corporations will go to great lengths to protect their profits and will not stop at anything, even murder, to ensure money flows into their pockets.The movie encourages viewers to sympathize with a regular Joe (Schwarzenegger, playing a construction worker. Ha, ha) who helps the rebels rise up against the oppressive corporation. Arnie plays a character who used to work for the corporation, but has now switched sides because he took a harder hit to his head.Verhoeven plays tricks with viewers, constantly questioning their perception of reality. He even inserts a scene where two people, who act as a fail-safe device, pop into Schwarzenegger's dreams to get him to snap out of it.In the movie's reality, when do the dreams actually begin?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent script makes up for the sub-par monotous presentation of the main character, leaving you asking questions well after the film has finished.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In typical Arnie fashion, his presentation in the film leaves a lot to the imagination, with many lines delivered with that clichéd monotone delivery with corny 'one liners' that he is so famous for.Now do not interpret my criticism of Arnie as an attack on the film, because it is utterly brilliant. It poses the question, if you had the choice to create any memory you wished and believe it were real, would you? The depth of the script is shown when the main character, DOuglas Quaid arrives on Mars and the intricacies of the Rebel resistance begins to reveal itself. The story poses an interesting situation, when humans are living on multiple planets, where will the law lie and exactly will people get away with? The concept of high prices for air, and passengers on a train inferring that Mars is forgotten my earth leads the viewer to feel a sense of utter isolation once the story arrives on the martian homeland. The viewer is often left either confused or curious as to whether the entire film is simply a dream, or whether the happy ending everyone hopes for is even going to arrive. The story itself, without spoilers, keeps you gripped with constant twists and unexpected turns to the story making this film quiet an epic. That being said, it doesn't lose impact by its constantly changing script, in fact it adds to it superbly. Often films present twists and turns as clear fillers or Hollywood requirements, however, this film makes every component of the story not only logical but seemingly believable.It is quiet hard to review this film without giving away any of the many spoilers contained within the film, so the only advice i can give if you haven't seen this film is give it a shot. There are very few films that have such an outstanding and believable sci-fi/futuristic script, even fewer that would mean that arnies often plastic on screen appearances do not detract from your immersion in the film, this is well worth watching and i honestly doubt any further remakes will ever truly compete with the original masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie has serious holes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you never read the book you will probably enjoy the movie and give it high marks. I vastly preferred the novel "Total Recall" by Piers Anthony that came out a couple of years before the movie. I have never read the original story "We Can Remember It for You, Wholesale" by Philip K. Dick from 1966.The movie was 100% faithful to the book by Piers Anthony on the scenes shown. It just did not show everything. And I would have shorted some the chase scenes to include the missing information or just deleted the scenes where they were going to be cover the WHY's of it being important to the movie.An example is in the very beginning it has a scene concentrating on a news report for about a minute and then never returns to it or why it is important. It has several of these threads just dangling and forgotten.I suspect the original story by Dick did not leave all the holes and the reader with a "What was that about and why did they include it?" questions.I understand the movie is being considered for remake. Hopefully they will either drop the scenes or include the scenes that complete it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schwarzenegger-ized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall is based on "We Can Remember it For You Wholesale", a typically metaphysical Phillip K. Dick story. The film adaptation follows the same basic plot, but a lot of things have been added. The result is that Total Recall tries to cater to the action crowd. Ultraviolence, sexuality, arrogant one-liners... it's a typical Schwarzenegger movie. Not exactly what Dick had in mind, I imagine. But the film still pulls it off. There are true moments of tension and shock to be found, and the metaphysical side of the film still works. But then there are the comic-book corporate bad guys, the obligatory love interest and the unconvincing heroism of the lead character. The clever plot twists and psychological thrills are sometimes deafened by the hail of blood, bullets and boobs. Hell, the Mars rebellion even felt genuine for a little while. Still, the world is convincing and there are plenty of unforgettable scenes.So, to recap: Total Recall is a psychological thriller with great action, an unnecessary love story and light, cartoony villains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad sci-fi action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What looks, in retrospect, like a classic Verhoeven action flick, Total Recall is a punchy, edgy but ultimately mainstream sci-fi adventure. It works out many of the same themes as Blade Runner with it's manufactured realities and the deadly political struggle for control of that altered state. Schwarzenegger plays (Douglas) Quaid (called by his surname throughout the film), a nobody who suspects sinister scheming afoot after a mind-implant short-circuits. This may be an early role for Sharon Stone but she plays Lori as a real viper - it's a strong showing. Ronny Cox is the Dr Evil character (it's rather a pantomime setup when all's said and done) Vilos Cohaagen, a character type to which he's better suited than the buttoned-up righteous types of the Beverley Hills Cop movies. The sfx are notably rudimentary but Verhoeven chucks them about on screen to maximum effect like a virtuoso painter. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic 1990s Action Pic, Perfect To Watch Stoned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, Total Recall is one of those classic action flicks we've seen a million times on TV, but we overlook Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance, judging it as nothing more than action hero presence and not really acting. But Ahnuld is one of the reasons the movie works. He isn't a hulking superman, although he incidentally fights like one. He's a baffled and alarmed guy, deceived by the edifice of reality. And in his susceptibility, he opens the way for this hilarious and ultraviolent Philip K. Dick adaptation to be more than simply a violence and special effects run-around, although the latter half conforms to such.There are loads of action and violence in Total Recall, which frankly would be the perfect movie to watch stoned, and practically every frame appears to inhabit one or more special effects. This is one of the most multifaceted and visually attention-grabbing sci-fi movies even still, in spite of how heavily dated it is now. What would happen to one's mental purity of essence if it were possible to be equipped with memories? If your whole past could be plugged into your brain, taking the place of the experiences through which you had really lived, up till that very moment unashamed for having treasured the things akin to those lacks and wants that caused you to do the things you have done? That's what looks as if to happen to Quaid, the Schwarzenegger character in Total Recall, which should have kept Dick's original title, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, while periodically neither Quaid nor we can be certain. As he did with RoboCop, Paul Verhoeven creates a desensitized and cynical future, where Quaid lives with his curvy blonde Sharon Stone wife, and works in construction. His life gives a pleasant impression, but he keeps having these violent dreams about Mars that ultimately move him to sign up with a controversial travel agency that endows you with the memory of the perfect vacation as opposed to all the work of achieving a perfect real one.But is this a packaged memory, or a real experience? The movie plays tantalizing mind games with the likelihood, pivotally in a great scene where a doctor and Quaid's Sharon Stone seem to appear out of thin air to convince him of one of the possibilities. Mars is in the middle of a revolutionary war between the forces of a greedy, power-drunk captain of industry, played with great comic book-style verve by Ronny Cox just as he did in Verhoeven's RoboCop, and a group of rebels. There is a mystery involving a huge reactor that was ostensibly assembled by aliens on Mars a million years ago, and has been discovered during mining operations. And can the sexy Rachel Ticotin trust Quaid, who doesn't know that they were lovers some time ago? Total Recall moves from side to side among different translations and planes of reality, whereas all at once filling to the brim with fertile details of a messed up future.I am baffled by the thought that in the future, firearms of all kinds would not be outlawed inside an airtight glass shell like the one in which Earthlings must remain on Mars. There are to be sure quite a lot of moments in which people are sucked outside when the air seal is shattered, but that doesn't stop the movie's villains from never hitting their target, or for that matter the good guys from ever missing theirs.But one can argue that the gaping inconsistencies in this quintessentially 1990s Schwarzenegger picture are on purpose, because the science depicted is laughable all the way through, and right from the start. At many points in the movie, characters wind up outside on Mars, and right away begin to inflate, their eyes popping and their faces ballooning. This is just an example. And from a good deal of what I have seen of Verhoeven's work, such as The Fourth Man, RoboCop and Starship Troopers, he knew how silly this was, and cynically satirized the action adventure tradition's cavalier approach to realism, mortality and violence, which frankly is preferable over an action picture with these approaches that takes itself seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid and confusing, but loads of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzzenager movies tend to be pretty entertaining, and this one is no exception. "Total Recall" is a fun, often laughable, but never bad science fiction action psychological thriller....and it's also quite confusing by the end as to what actually happened, but it doesn't take much away at all from such a fun movie.Arnold Schwarzzenager play Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who's world is turned upside down when he decides to use total recall. Total recall is a place where you can remember memories from places you've been before, or even create a new fake persona for yourself. Douglas is attacked, and people now know him as Hauser. Douglas is confused, as was I, as will you be. But in all the confusion, this movie has lots of great action scenes, interesting special effects, hilarious one-liners and pure exhilarating entertainment.Overall, this is a very fun movie, that I'd recommend to any fan of sci-fi or action movies.My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins. R for violence and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Verhoeven and Arnold do Dick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody did sci-fi excess in the 80s and 90s quite like Paul Verhoeven. Whether dealing with bug-like aliens (Starship Troopers), cyborg policemen (Robocop) or invisible maniacs (Hollow Man), the Dutch director rarely took the subtle approach, preferring to mix heavy handed satire with ultra violence. With Total Recall, he once again takes the audience on a wild ride of OTT action and gore, delivering a hugely enjoyable, if somewhat far-fetched, tale based on the Philip K. Dick short story 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale'.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker plagued with dreams about Mars, who decides to pay the red planet a 'virtual' visit through Recall?a company that can implant memories.However, when Doug chooses to receive the memories of a secret agent, he gets more than he bargained for: as a result of tampering with the old grey matter, Quaid discovers that he really has been to Mars, his wife is not who she seems to be, and he may hold vital information in his brain that can change the course of Mars' history forever. Or maybe all of this is just part of his 'virtual' holiday from Recall.With a plot that twists and turns like a rattlesnake on a roller-coaster, it is not long before he (and the audience) is unsure of what is actually real and what is the inevitable result of messing around with the mind.Verhoeven brings together state of the art effects (for 1990, at least), a great cast (which includes Michael Ironside, Sharon Stone, and Ronny Cox) and plenty of action to deliver one of the better movies in Arnie's curriculum vitae. Sci-fi pedants might easily be able to pick holes in the plot (and even I admit that the ending takes some swallowing!), but as far as I am concerned, any film with a machine-gun toting dwarf prostitute is OK in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Total Recall' is one of the sci-fi movies where you are not sure what is real and what is not. Later we saw these kind of things in 'eXistenZ', 'The Thirteenth Floor', 'The Matrix' and 'Vanilla Sky'. 'Total Recall' is the most violent I know but also one of the better ones. Even in the end you still can guess whether it was all a dream, or just parts, or not a dream at all.In the future it is possible to take real vacations to planets like Mars, but you can also let memories implanted of one of those vacation. You are not really going but it feels you have been there. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) does this because he keeps having dreams about Mars. He can add a couple of options to his vacation but during the implant things go wrong. Or don't they? You are never sure because the events that follow fit the options he has chosen for his vacation, but there are also clues that it is really happening. I want to tie a baby to the back of a truck then reverse into a wall.With a lot of bloody action, some nice humor and great special effects in almost every shot this is one of those sci-fi adventures that is never boring. With great plot twists, pretty believable in a movie like this, and an interesting story this is probably the best American movie done by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven. From Druggy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't get too distracted by the acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from some truly horrible acting (does anyone actually think Arnold is talented in that realm?), Total Recall's an interesting piece. The plot has more twists than a Rold Gold factory, and there's the interesting notion that any part of the movie could actually be the dream/hallucination - even what we consider the eventual climax and resolution.And effects-wise, absolutely superb. This one definitely deserved its awards - from the violent action sequences to everything on Mars, the visuals are crafted to near perfection. Complaints that Recall is too heavy-handedly bloody ignore the fact that ruthless dictators are almost universally violent - look at Somalia or Iraq if you're confused on that measure. Bad guys in charge need guns to keep themselves in place, no matter where they are in the universe or in time.Recall is worth watching, even a couple times. Put it in your DVD player or VCR on one too many an occasion, and you'll probably start noticing some of the ridiculousness - but that's okay, so long as you appreciate both the bad and good elements of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Enigma of the Human Mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I must say this is the most vulgar movie Schwarzenegger ever made. The profanity was so astonishing that I had to run the film again and count the number of loathsome words used by the man who was to become the governor of the great state of California. There were thirteen instances of the "f" word, seven of the "a" word, eight of the "s" word (including those cases in which the word was incorporated into the expression usually indicated as "BS"), five "q" words, four "x" words, and one case of the "z" word, for which I am willing to exculpate him because it's a well-known fact that all Viennese are fond of zithers. I suppose a man can't help being what he is.That's certainly true in the example before us. Arnold, with his endearing accent ("Heff a nize day") is what he's been programmed to be by the folks who monopolize the Tympanium mine on Mars ("Mozz") and try to kill all the rebels and turn Arnold's identity so inside out that he doesn't know whether he's coming or going. His mind implants may (or may not) undergo a schizophrenic embolism, which is a neat trick all by itself, but he inserts himself into the rebel group on Mars as a kind of mole for the job creators. He does so with the help of a jive-talking black guy who drives his taxi. At least I think that's what happens. Whenever Arnold came up with his most quizzical look, I was right with him. If anyone can explain why Arnold is disguised as a middle-aged overweight woman at the Mars Airport, and why the get-up suddenly goes awry -- well, I don't know.That's enough of the plot, I think. It's a kaleidoscope of strange images, non sequiturs, and appalling vulgarity. I'll tell you the truth, I was sickened by the odious imprecations. I'm still stunned. And to think this man was my co-star in the magnificent "Raw Deal." True, he accidentally knocked me on my dupa during a brawl in a gambling den. I leaped at once to my feet and informed him -- not in an unfriendly manner -- that my hands were registered as lethal weapons in the state of New Jersey.The fact is that the language would have been tolerable, as would the popping out of eyeballs (twice), and the ridiculous menacing earth movers covered on all sides with giant worm gears, if only the movie had had some gratuitous nudity. But, no. Rachel Ticotin is a beautiful woman and doesn't even get to wear a skin-tight suit like Emma Peel.So while away the hour and a half and watch the eyeballs pop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clunky Robocop on Mars, starring Conan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just having seen Total Recall in both incarnations, I can review the old 1990's one with a fresh perspective. The thing with the recall (heh) is that I remembered this film as one that I liked. Sure, it was a bit awkward and it made no sense for any science, but I did like it. And now, 22 years later from its making, I watched it again. And, for no good reason other than nostalgia, I liked it again.Now, it is a film made by the director of Robocop. The corporate evil, the clunky metal vehicles, the gratuitous violence, they are all there, along with ridiculous dialogue and bad acting, but some of the bits of the film show good design and thinking. Add to this Sharon Stone when she was hot, Michael Ironside when he was young and Arnold Schwarzenegger doing Conan the Barbarian on Mars, with submachine guns and you get a cheesy, clunky, ridiculous film that somehow feels good.What is the secret? I don't know. Probably Paul Verhoeven saw in the film the same flaws that I see and just didn't give a damn. He accepted the shortcomings of technology and of himself and did the film as well as he could in the circumstances. Bottom line: not really a good film, but who can say it was a bad one?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that can easily get you confused if U let it? Arnold Schwarzeneggar plays a Douglas Hauser/Douglas Quaid. We first see him on Earth with his wife Sharon Stone. Quaid is a construction worker who is wanting to take his wife on a vacation to Mars. She is totally against the idea and tells him he would hate it and tries to persuade him for a long trip to Saturn. He is fascinated with going to Mars, he ask one of his buddies about Rekall, a place where U can go and get a virtual vacation just like the real thing. His buddy, Carl, I think tells him no they will screw with his mind, and tells him of the story about a friend of his who was nearly lobotomize. Quaid ignores his so called wife and friend's advice a goes anyway. Once there he tells them he is interested in a trip to Mars, but the programmer also tries to talk him into some other virtual vacation. Quaid insisted a trip to Mars is what he wants. When he is in the virtual reality chamber,something goes wrong. He starts to freak out before they have a chance to implant the programmed trip. Once he leaves Rekall, he is followed by people who are trying to kill him, including his friend. Once home he tells his wife people are trying to kill him, but little does he know she is in on it too. Once he escapes, the assassins, he is left with clues to find out why they are trying to kill him and is told to get to Mars ASAP. Once there, he hooks up with people who know him by the name of Hauser, little does he know he is about to find out who he really is and who he is really working for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Arnold's best vehicles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Total Recall" offers fine slam bang action and an intriguing, twist-laden story, co-scripted by Ronald Shusett &amp; Dan O'Bannon ("Alien", "Dead &amp; Buried") based on the story "We Can Remember it for You Wholesale" by Philip K. Dick. Production design, visual effects, makeup, and atmosphere are all vividly realized in this fun movie that comes up with some great concepts along the way. As entertainment, it certainly does its job. Schwarzenegger gets one (actually, more than one) of his more complex roles, as blue collar guy Douglas Quaid who wants something more out of life, and has developed an obsession with the planet Mars. He knows of a company named Rekall that creates artificial memories of lavish vacations, and figures it will be "safer" than the real thing, so, not being able to get Mars out of his head, goes to Rekall for their Mars package - the scenario he chooses casts him as a secret agent - only to find out that he is not "real", and is simply the new identity for another character. After his arrival on Mars, he finds that his mission will be to help stop the power crazed megalomaniac Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who cruelly controls the fates of the Mars inhabitants, mutants and humans alike. Some scenes and images here are highly memorable, and director Paul Verhoeven, who'd previously given us another satirical look at a grim future in "RoboCop", takes the violence to a hysterically over the top level; one's gotta love the chase sequence where one poor innocent schmuck is used as a human shield. Also noteworthy are the scenes where Quaid removes a "bug" from his skull, by going through the nostril, and where a disguise of his starts malfunctioning. Everything is done on a grand scale, including the pounding music score by Jerry Goldsmith. And the actors supporting Arnold are exceptionally well chosen, with Cox and the always intimidating Michael Ironside (who was initially considered for the title role in "RoboCop"!) making for nasty, formidable villains. Rachel Ticotin is feisty as the "sleazy and demure" leading lady Melina, with Sharon Stone adding plenty of sex appeal as Quaid's dubious wife; she figures in a payoff scene that features one of Arnold's many well loved cinematic one-liners in "Considuh dat a dee-vorse!" Fine character players dot the landscape, too, including Marshall Bell, Michael Champion, Roy Brocksmith, Ray Baker, Dean Norris, Robert Costanzo, Marc Alaimo, Michael Gregory, and Mickey Jones; Robert Picardo supplies the voice of the priceless "Johnnycab", and Lycia Naff and Debbie Lee Carrington have two of the best roles in the feature; Naff's bosom will definitely stick in the mind (it WILL make guys wish they had three hands). Makeup effects expert Rob Bottin finally won a richly deserved Academy Award for his work here. Humorous, lively, and interesting, "Total Recall" has fine forward momentum and packs its scenes with details, never letting filler get in the way of a good story and offering crowd pleasing thrills. It's a diverting movie from beginning to end. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall really rocks.My opinion, this movie IS the greatest movie ever told. You have everything you want in a movie right in front of you and it delivers it in high quality. I will say that if you TRULY want to enjoy this movie than you need to watch the first Terminator movie. It will help you understand the storyline in the overall series and have a better appreciation for this movie. This movie is well worth the price to buy along with all the other Swartnegger movies. However this one is the most superior to them all and all other movies in general.Sharon Stone was awesome in this film and the directing was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK for sci-fi fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's still an OK movie, if you like science-fiction films. Arnold Schwarzenegger, although much too massive to be a normal person, at least plays one here. He's actually a little charming, and actually can act a little. (Which makes me think that acting isn't really that hard) Sharon Stone was at the height of her beauty and looks great. The real kudos go to Rachel Ticotin. It's too bad that I haven't seen more of her over the years.There is an interesting plot, even if full of holes. The special effects are everywhere, and although some seem a little cheesy now, I'm sure that at the time they were first-rate. Many of the effects are excessively disgusting, but this was obviously by design.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The part I don't understand is if there was a "reactor" or whatever at the centre of the planet why hasn't it been working all this time? Who would turn the thing off in the first place? The original Martians were both advanced and probably peaceful otherwise they would not have been able to build such a machine in the first place. The idea that the "planet would go into meltdown" as Cohaagen seems to believe is wrong so why was the thing turned off? Also when the reactor starts and replenishes the entire planet's atmosphere in less time than it takes for two people to die from decompression wouldn't this result in an explosion that would have killed everyone in the immediate vicinity? The idea of a colonial revolt is good but there was too little depth and development. This "deus ex machina" is too much of a shortcut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing... but totally unfaithful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so as funny-terrible as the whole movie was... when I read the short story, "We can Remember it For You Wholesale" by Phillip K. Dick, I was really astonished at how different the two are. Day and night. I mean, the action sequences aside, the meaning of the story was so different... I don't know how they ended up at that conclusion.In We can remember... the man goes to get the fictional vacation to Mars like in the movie (of course, he doesn't pick out the ideal female or anything in this version). In fact, he's not married, or if he is, his wife isn't a secret agent. And he never actually goes to Mars in real life, either. Like in the movie, they can't write to his brain, there's stuff there, and yes, he was a secret agent once. However, that wasn't the real problem. Unlike the movie, the story goes on to present even more worrying conclusions that have little to do with the idea of Mars, secret agents or space travel.Instead, once the doctors can't erase the memories he's remembered from his secret agent work, they try to re-write it with what his deepest fantasy would be. They do a lot of testing and uncover that his fantasy is that when he was a small child, mouse-sized aliens came down to earth and met him, gave him some magic gifts, and decided that they would delay destruction of the planet until they died. The doctors then find out that this is entirley true, these are his memories- and that they can't kill the man or erase his memories, because the memories won't erase, and if they kill him, the planet will be destroyed.Somehow, that's so much more disturbing than the action movie with the midget prostitues. I'm not claiming that its anything really deep or earth-shattering, its just a totally different kind of thing. I'm not sure what the ever-paranoid Phillip K. Dick would think of the action movie, but... I don't think it was his original intent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to like this movie. but now that I've seen it again on a Full HD-TV, I can see how bad it really is.The set-pieces are so lame. The cities on Mars look like something from a low-budget TV-show. The mountains and the sky are clearly paintings. The puppets replacing Arnold and other actors are badly made. Kuato, the alien-baby stuck on a guys chest is the worst made puppet in the film. Chucky was more convincing in Child's Play two years prior to this movie.The air bursting through the windows where people live at the end look really bad. All in all the special effects are awful, even for a movie at that time. Aliens from 1986 have more convincing special effects and still looks good today, 24 years later. Besides from one scene shot outside, the entire movie is shot on various sound stages. And it makes the movie look extremely low-budget although I'm sure it was very expensive at the time.The bad-guys are too much cliché. Ronny Cox was so much better in Robocop.Michael Ironside is also wasted here. He was much better in Starship Troopers.Even the fun grotescue violence, that is Verhoevens trademark and the sometimes funny scenes can't save this crap.The way too obvious product placement made me sick. In two or three scenes, it becomes very clear what paid for this entire movie and Arnie's presumably very large paycheck.The only good thing about a movie that looks like a low-budget sci-fi today, is Sharon Stone. She was incredibly sexy and every time she appeared in a scene, me and my buddy started paying attention to the movie again, at least while she was on the screen. Why Arnies character, Quaid, would prefer Rachel Ticotin over Sharon Stone is a bigger and much more interesting mystery than whether or not the whole thing is a dream in Quaids head.And the plot does'nt make sense. Others have commented on the many plot-holes, so I won't be getting into that.I give it 2 stars because of Sharon Stone. The rest of the movie sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why must action movies require a mindcheck at the door?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Total Recall while I was in high school and since a friend of mine owns it and was talking about it the other day I thought I'd check it out again. I love Dick's novels and for that reason alone thought this would be worth watching. So sadly wrong. It was evident that the original idea was a good one, but a whole lot of garbage had been tacked on to make this into a Hollywood scifi bomb.I do not understand why some fans of science fiction and action movies think it necessary to have their intelligence insulted in order for a film to be enjoyable. Action and intelligence, sorry to say, are not mutually exclusive. The plot was by no means as complex as I remember it being, and Mars seemed even more contrived than in my first viewing.Very simple plot points could have been corrected to make Total Recall a bit more respectable. The most glaring: why is that the vague "aliens" who built the reactor made the indentation in the panel which starts it up in the shape of a human hand? Puhleaze. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not as good as I hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Schwarzenegger and sci-fi fan and Total Recall is often considered one of the best movies of his career. But I have to say I was rather underwhelmed by Total Recall because I was expecting a bit more from it and it wasn't really what I was expecting. Like for one thing, I thought the special effects to be very weird and silly and some parts didn't make sense and it doesn't really reveal whether it was all dream or it was reality and it doesn't really mention why Vilos Cohaagan is after Doug Quaid/Hauser in the first place. And the acting and action scenes are kind of cheesy and over-the-top at times. But there are a few things I like about Total Recall. Like I enjoy the chemistry between Doug and Melina and the one-liners (i.e. "Consider the divorce") and I thought Melina was a good and interesting character and some of the visual effects were cool.But I wouldn't really consider this movie a masterpiece or Schwarzenegger's best (like The Terminator or Predator or True Lies) but I'm sure it's better than the recent remake of it with Colin Farrell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Aw-nuld movie all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had to come here and leave a review, seeing how I just watched the new Total Recall and thought I was going to puke! There were plenty of things about this version that could have been better but after seeing the new one I have to say it was just right. The new Total Recall is completely devoid of any humor, terrible soundtrack, and too much action. I would expect a re-make to take whats good from the original and try to improve upon it. But instead, they included the few cheesy scenes from the original and dumped everything that made the original great. The violence is this version could have been toned down as at many times it seems more than just excessive. I've heard that the original cut was so excessive that it was given an "X" rating for violence. Is that possible? Anyhow, if you haven't seen either one, don't bother with the new one. That is unless your under the age of 15. Not to mention they made the women in this version tough, but not too tough that it was not believable. The new version is just ridiculous. Skinny, supermodel types like Kate Beckinsale don't go around kicking the crap out of men twice their size. The new "Wonder Woman" powers that modern movies give to women is just silly and makes a lot of people in the theater feel a little uncomfortable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best, but not the worst!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Total Recall' is surprisingly good for an Arnold Schwarzenegger film (excluding the first two Terminator films of course). It's a sci-fi film about an ordinary man whose life turns out to be a lie, or does it?In the beginning it isn't really explained that well but you begin to grasp the plot as it continues and the ending is very well written. The ending itself works really well because throughout the film you're trying to figure it out yourself. The ending does surprise you and has clearly been thought about in great detail by the writers as you don't really expect that ending. The sets and makeup are of course out-dated but the imagination used for the designs is a lot better than I had expected, particularly with some of the mutants on mars.The acting is pretty poor; it lets the film down unfortunately. Schwarzenegger is weirdly the only decent performance in the film; this may be because you already expect his acting to be poor anyway. It is poor but everyone else overshadows his lack of acting capabilities. Sharon Stone was definitely the worst; having never seen any of her work apart from in a few television shows she really appalled me. Luckily, she doesn't have a great amount of screen time but her scenes are really really bad!Overall, 'Total Recall' is certainly not the best sci-fi film ever but it's not the worst. It has strong violence and scenes of gore which you don't see much of nowadays in sci-fi or action films but it's not too much to divert your attention away from the story. The film is explained really well and is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few things to know before reading my (any) film reviews. I consider these categories utterly important when paging through reviews.Reviewers age: 30 (this matters because there are a lot of films which are generational, meaning that I might like a film that someone who is 50 or even 10, might not enjoy. "Get It? Got It? Good." If you just thought "I don't get it!" then we are on the same page ;)Reviewers sex: Male (this should always be included in a review. You can usually tell by the name or avatar pic, but not always. Men and women share different opinions (in most cases) on film reviews. And that is not a bad thing. However, most women can stop reading now because my wife and I differ on just about every movie.Last time said film was viewed.FILM: Total Recall (1990)Dialouge: 5/10 (side note, spice this section up by narrating it in Arnold's voice.) The characters in this film interacted like common movies from it's era. The awkward pause before a trope-phrase, i.e. "Hasta La Vista, Baby." Or in this movie's case, every time someone cusses. "No S*&amp;^." With Arnold movies, you get Arnold. This movie was no different.Visuals: 7/10 I might have lost some readers after seeing that score. I'm just trying to be 'respectful to the timeline' here. I remember seeing parts of this film as a boy thinking that it looked cool. Though then, I didn't have a lot of patience for movies. Even watching older films today, I love the nostalgia-factor of 'feeling like I'm back in 1990 when I watch this'. The effects were good for it's time, and I don't mind watching them today. Sharon Stone in spandex was pretty hot today, so I can imagine she was steaming back then.Characters: 6/10 The main-cast couldn't have been more common for this movie. They didn't really gel well. Arnold's name in all of his films should be Arnold. The baddies were the guy who looks like Jack Nicholson (Mike Ironside), and the bad guy in Robocop (which Paul Verhoeven also directed). I usually get a feel for "freak characters", but I didn't feel too attached to any of them here, and this movie had quite a few. Most background characters create the backdrop in a lot of scenes in this movie, and they did an awesome job of doing absolutely nothing.Overall Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little cheesy but has a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would you do if you had the opportunity to take a virtual reality trip to Mars? It sounds like an awesome idea right? Well it ends up being not so awesome for Douglas Quaid when he takes his virtual reality tour, only to discover that a chip has been implanted in his brain and all of his memories are fake, and they were implanted there by some sort of secret government agency. Or... were they? Total Recall is, in part, a sci-fi action flick as well as a mind bending thriller where nothing is as it seems and we're never really sure what is reality and what is a dream. Douglas Quaid, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is looking to escape reality through the virtual reality trip service Rekall. Things go awry and Quaid learns startling things about himself that he sets out to find the answers to. But, the question is, is it all really happening to Quaid or is it just a dream put together by the Rekall system? Throughout the film there are various events that hint towards both sides, and in the end we must decide for ourselves.With this kind of ambiguity running rampant throughout the film there's an element of excitement that makes the whole film very interesting to watch. We want to know the truth, but we can't be too sure of anything. Then, at the same time the reality versus dream storyline is taking place, it's the undercurrent for the story taking place on Mars that has to do with the rebels trying to take down the Martian government so that they can get air at a fair price. Mars is run by the ruthless Cohaagen who is in charge of distributing all the air on Mars, and it is the thing that keeps him in such control over the whole planet. Quaid makes it his mission to defeat Cohaagen and save Mars from tyranny. But, once again, is he really doing all this or is it all in his mind? Story wise, Total Recall is awesome. It's brilliantly original and wildly creative. It's what makes Total Recall an awesome film to watch, because it lacks in some other areas. Nothing too serious, but the film is a little cheesy with it's streak of dark humor running through it, some sappy dialogue, as well as pretty terrible acting. But it's definitely fun, and an overall really neat film to experience. It's a great work of sci-fi that shouldn't be missed by any sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film won a Special Achievement Academy Award for its visual effects. In 2084, a construction worker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has a dream and remembers he had a previous existence as a secret agent on Mars.Total Recall is an over-excitable, science-fiction fantasy film that introduces bone-crunching violence when it stumbles over its overlapping ideas. The plot takes dizzying turns at regular intervals, as it tries to keep up with Philip K. Dick's overstuffed original story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale. But the film can be watched as an effects-driven spectacle, its themes reduced to background incidental mood music. Under such circumstances, if you've half a mind to watch, that's all you'll need.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox star in this 1990 sci-fi film based on a short story. In 2084, A construction worker gets an implanted memory and learns he may have been a secret agent on Mars. Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker who has recurring dreams about Mars and a woman who's with him. He explains to his wife, Lori (Stone) that he's never met the woman in his dreams and never been to Mars. He longs to get away by taking a virtual vacation on Mars choosing his lifestyle and woman to accompany him. Doug discovers he's not who he thinks he is and tries to find answers. He finds out he was a secret agent, Hauser and that his identity and marriage are false. He meets the woman of his dreams, Milena (Ticotin) who knew him as Hauser and faces henchman, Richter (Ironside) who works for evil businessman, Cohaagen (Cox) and tries to help the mutant &amp; alien inhabitants of Mars. Doug wonders if it's all a dream or reality. This is a great sci-fi flick, Rob Bottin did an amazing job as usual with the make-up effects and Jerry Goldsmith's score is also terrific as usual. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Total Recall. Not because it is a great movie. Because it is extremely entertaining and funny. Especially the one liners from Arnie. The plot is interesting, the cast is superb, the action is acceptable. All in all e great entertainer, you can watch again and again and it never gets you boring.Well, having said that, I have to come down to the business. Do not look for a logical plot in here. How can be a planet with no air can turn into a place with the atmosphere as the world has in seconds? Come on! Why would Martians build an engine to add Mars an atmosphere and left without doing it? How come did those funny looking mutants come up? The story line is confusing. When I watched TR first time, I understood nothing. Absolutely confused. It took me two or three watching to get who is who and what actually happens. Another weak point is special effects. Most of the effects look terribly bad and not convincing.In total, it is not a bad movie. Has lots of re-watching value. Do not expect a logical SF with brilliant FX. Just enjoy.</fullReview>

Up to then the twists and turns of the story kept me interested in guessing who the Arnie character really was.The special effects were indeed excellent for their time but were unfortunately used mostly to expolit the gratutious violence which made up the bulk of the film. Violence was necessary for the story but there's no need to labour the point. It's taken well over a decade for the wonderful special effects now available to be used to support the story (e.g. Lord of the Rings) rather than the story to support the special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise reduced to a pretty good action flick. 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Total Recall, only a bit over a year ago, I thought it was a fun action flick and nothing more. I remember being a bit disappointed at it. The scene where Edgecomb enters Quaid's hotel room and tells him that he is trapped in his own mind made me think how much better the film could have been if the writers had tried to make the audience think that maybe the whole movie (after Quaid visits Rekall) was just an accident in the memory implant. Well, after watching the film twice in one week, I have discovered some things. The writers did try to make the film ambiguous. There are two huge clues to this fact right before Quaid is knocked out in the Rekall lab: 1. the picture on the screen is obviously Melina. 2. One of the technicians says, right before Quaid falls asleep: "Blue skies on Mars. That's new." (the second chapter to the end of the DVD is titled "Blue Skies on Mars).So there we are. The story is ambiguous. Or is it? Very few people have even noticed this. I'm sure there are plenty of fans of the film who would violently argue that most of the film takes place in Quaid's head. These people should take the next step. There are huge problems with the last two acts of the film if it is just a dream. The biggest problem, the one which makes the whole dream theory fall utterly apart, is that at least a third of the scenes after Quaid is sedated take place without him on screen. One cannot dream without being present at the events which are unfolding.I also think the writers were confused about the whole backstory. Hauser, is he supposed to be a good guy or a bad guy? Most people will pick up that we're supposed to think he is a good guy at the beginning, then near the end of the film he is revealed to have been involved in the whole plot against Kuato. It seemed like a really good plot twist the first time I saw it, and it felt like a kick in the stomach. The last time I watched it though, there is an interesting scene where Richter and Cohegan talk. Cohegan seems very frightened that Quaid might reveal the secrets he has found. He then tells Richter that he has a plan to capture him, and says, "I have a plan, if you're willing to play along." The plan he is talking about has to be the creation of Hauser as a bad guy who was only turned to Quaid so he could infiltrate the mutant rebellion. We can also see that Hauser was a rebel sympathizer earlier when Richter complains to his companions (not to Quaid), "We should have killed Quaid on Mars." Why would he say this unless Hauser had actually been an enemy before? If one thinks this back story out, it makes no sense whatsoever (notice that Benny infiltrated the mutant headquarters without any complex plot, thus they didn't really need Hauser to get to Kuato). Cohegan could have easily created a video with a fake Hauser (just as Quaid appeared as a fake fat woman). He could have easily implanted a fake memory in Quaid to make him believe that he had always been Hauser. The writers must have been confusing each other, though, because it seems that near the end they completely forgot that Hauser's evil persona was false. Cohegan persists in saying that he wants the old Hauser back. This makes no sense with what has come before.The consensus: great premise that failed because of the screenwriters. It turns out to be just a fun action movie. The only thing the film did completely right: the Tri-Breasted Hooker and the Midget Hooker. I think they should get their own television series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>¨If I am not me, then who the hell am I? ¨I decided to revisit the 1990 hit film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger since the remake with Colin Farrell is coming out this weekend. I really couldn't recall what the movie was about except for a couple of scenes, but in all honesty I don't think this film has aged very well. Arnold may have been an action hero during the 80's and 90's, but he really isn't a very good actor. I preferred him in more comedic roles actually, although I must admit he was great in the Terminator films. Total Recall fails because it tries to take itself too seriously and goes a little over the top with the violent scenes. I'm not against violent films, but in Total Recall it just feels a little over the top and exaggerated as is the case with most of Paul Verhoeven's films (famous for Robocop, another film that is getting remade, but that I actually enjoyed more). There are some clever one liners that will get a smile out of you because it's what Arnold is best at, but most of the dialogues feel forced. It just didn't work for me. The concept of the movie is interesting and the ambiguity of the film is what many people liked, but I didn't enjoy it all that much really. I think this is one of the worst Phillip Dick novels adapted for the big screen considering I liked Blade Runner, Minority Report, and The Adjustment Bureau a lot. This film plays out a little more cartoonish than the others, but unintentionally and that's why I didn't like it. It tried to be serious and ambiguous, but it ended up being cartoonish. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker who feels like his life is too ordinary and something is missing. He has a beautiful wife, Lori (Sharon Stone), but is obsessed with Mars and has this recurring dream where he is in Mars with a brunette who he has never met. There is a human civilization in Mars and Douglas dreams of taking a vacation there but doesn't have the time or money to do so. Instead he decides to visit Rekall Inc., a company that specializes in implanting memories, and asks for a memory where he goes to Mars on a mission as a secret agent. Something goes wrong during the process and the doctor realizes that his brain has already been implanted and he's been living on a fake memory. Douglas realizes that he actually isn't who he thinks he is and begins discovering things about his past. Lori isn't actually his wife; the memory was implanted in his head and she has only been posing as his wife during the last several weeks. Everything is a hoax, even his job as a construction worker. Douglas finds himself running from several men who are trying to kill him and discovers a clue about his past. He's actually a secret agent from Mars and somewhere in his head he has an important secret that the administrator from Mars named Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) is trying to keep locked up and hidden. Douglas travels to Mars to try to discover more information about his past while trying to decipher what is real and what is a memory implant. I really didn't like any of the performances in this film. Sharon Stone is beautiful here, but she just doesn't give a very memorable performance. Arnold Schwarzenegger has some funny moments but he just can't play the serious parts very well. Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside play one dimensional villains and the actor who plays the taxi driver, Benny, is just terrible and obnoxious. The story didn't work for me either so there were very few things I liked about Total Recall. They had some original and interesting ideas, but they just weren't able to work them out in a cohesive manner. The science fiction and futuristic part of the film actually is what I enjoyed the most about it, but some of the effects were a little too far out. The scenes where some of the characters are being inflected by the atmosphere in Mars are way too cartoonish for my taste. Total Recall isn't a terrible film, it has its entertaining moments with some good action scenes, but I just don't think it's a movie worth remaking. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Understand the Praise but the Film Just Doesn't Work for Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total Recall (1990) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi/action picture has Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Douglas Quaid, an average man who is growing tired of his world so he goes to the company Total Recall so that he can experience life as a Secret Agent. He wakes up and sure enough people are coming after him but is it just the fake dream or reality? Every single film buff will have "classic" movies that they simply don't get and TOTAL RECALL must be one of them for me. I'm really not sure what it is but I really didn't like this movie when I first watched it around the age of ten so I decided to give it another shot all these years later but the result was pretty much the same. While watching the movie I can honestly see why so many people love it but it seems the reason they love it are the reasons it didn't work for me. One problem I had with the film was the actual story. I'm not sure what so many people see in it but for me I thought it was rather boring and not once did it ever grab me and bring me into its action. Another problem I had with the film was the casting of Schwarzenegger. I think this is the only time I've said this but I really didn't like him in the movie. Rachel Ticotin was the best thing about the picture but she doesn't enter until towards the end but Michael Ironside was another plus. We've also got Sharon Stone looking extremely sexy but her performance isn't so hot. The early scenes of Arnold and Stone playing husband and wife featured some of the most laughable acting in any action picture. The special effects are extremely good and they hold up well after all these years but these aren't enough to keep me entertained. Yes, TOTAL RECALL is a classic to many but it's one classic that simply slips past my understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Recall is such an excellent epic with tons of action, fantastic special effects and make up, great acting, colorful characters, and a wonderful musical score! Its one of the greatest films of all time! The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, Michael Ironside, Marshall Bell, Mel Johnson Jr., Michael Champion, Roy Brocksmith, Ray Baker, Rosemary Dunsmore, David Knell, Alexia Robinson, Dean Norris, Priscilla Allen, Gloria Dorson, Michael LaGuardia, Marc Alaimo, Robert Costanzo, and Robert Picardo! Arnold is just as great as he usually is! Rachel is very good and this just might be her best role! Stone is really incredible in this picture. She really knows how to fight! Ronny Cox is his usual villain self here but he's really got an attitude in this one! Ironside is awesome in the film as well. He really is a bad guy here and I love the looks he gets on his face and another thing I love is the chemistry between him and Stone! What makes their relationship so good is the music that Jerry Goldsmith wrote for their scenes is great! Costanzo has a very good performance! Bell, Baker, Brocksmith, and everybody else all have very good performances! The action is one of the key factors that make this film so great! The violence is incredible and its one of the most violent films I have seen. The shoot outs are outstanding. I love the classic 'many bad guys getting shot several times' where one guys kills a dozen baddies! They don't make films like this anymore! The special effect are just fabulous and arguably better then today's effects! Jerry Goldsmith's score for this is perfect! I think its one of the best ever written. Its one of My favorites. Not that many people give the great composer credit for it. He should have won an Oscar Award for it easily in My opinion! I love the score and if you do I recommend you go to Amazon.com and purchase Total Recall: The Deluxe Edition because it has all of the score that Goldsmith wrote for the film! Its really an incredible masterpiece! Paul Verhoeven directed this film greatly! Head over to Amazon.com and get the special edition of Total Recall on DVD! It has superb quality and a ton special features including a brief interview with Jerry Goldsmith! The DVD is just so cool! If you love Arnold, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, Michael Ironside, Marshall Bell, Robert Costanzo, Robert Picardo, Action, Science Fiction, Thriller, Adventure, one of the greatest musical scores, and exciting violence then I strongly recommend that you get the film today!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:Here are some other Arnold recommendations: Conan the Barbarian, Conan the Destroyer, Red Sonja, The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines, The Running Man, Red Heat, Commando, Predator, Kindergarten Cop, Last Action Hero, True Lies, Junior, Eraser, Jingle All The Way, Batman and Robin, End of Days, and Collateral Damage!If you like alien movies and/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films: The Thing from another World, The Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds, Horror Express, The UFO Incident, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, John Carpenter's The Thing, Krull, Time Walker, My Science Project, Howard the Duck, John, Carpenter's Starman, John Carpenter's They Live, Mac and Me, Explorers, Invaders from Mars, Alien Seed, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Commando, Fire in the Sky, The Arrival, Mars Attacks!

		<fullReview>5 out of 10Total Recall is a movie with good ideas, at least for a while. The film toys with the belief that memories make us who we are, a concept that's inherently fascinating (and was done with superior execution in Dark City). Recall is a futuristic thriller that stars Arnold Schwarzennegger as an average joe named Douglas Quaid who finds his life in turmoil after a visit to a Rekall center for a "virtual" vacation. Seemingly everyone is out to kill him, even his wife and friends, he doesn't know who to trust, but believes the answer to his past lies on Mars. This Arnold Schwarzennegger action vehicle has a superb opening half-hour, mixing just the right amount of intrigue, bloody action, and dark humor to make for a suspenseful mind-boggler. Unfortunately, once the film sets on Mars, it's all mostly downhill from there. Bringing the movie down significantly are a lot of silly subplots focusing on mutant rebels and "instant atmosphere" machines left behind by aliens. The mutants, in particular, are extremely annoying, and quite loud and crude. And we're supposed to be rooting for these guys!Not all is entirely lost in the final 75 or so minutes. There are a few more plot twists that are genuinely surprising and while the action scenes aren't spectacular or even all that thrilling, the graphic violence is pretty amusing. The open question to whether or not this entire adventure is just Quaid's dream adds an extra dimension to the film, even if it ultimately never makes much of a difference. Still, when all is said and done, Total Recall isn't all it could and should have been. Director Paul Verhoeven's over-the-top style doesn't quite fit this intriguing premise and a lot of those subplots should have been excised or rewritten. The end result is simply a middling endeavor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but TOTAL RECALL is another in a series of endless "survival game" thrillers set in the future, and a constant throwback of THE RUNNING MAN, where killing nearly does all of the work. Paul Verhoeven did much better with STARSHIP TROOPERS overall, despite me not being a fan of his bloody science fiction stories. I get turned off for the bad acting, and especially parts of its writing, leaving me stunned out of a movie that generated millions of dollars. The same goes for the voluptuous vixens, one of which possessed the "Big Three" to make such a total embarrassment. Here is where science fiction started to carry a bad name for itself, and just by proving, it shows off a sleazy catfight between Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin. What TOTAL RECALL really stood out best was the nightmarish feeling of fantasy we get when we're living in a state of chaos. Arnie's your main man if breaking bones and blasting flesh is what you desire. Recommended only for Verhoeven buffs, but the movie is left criminally overrated to justify my interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do NOT understand how this movie can be rated here, on IMDb, to be nearly as impressive as Edward Scissorhands, which came out in the same year? How can this happen? First of all, the effects are awful, even for the time! It was hands down the worst acting I've ever seen from Sharon Stone. In the first 5 minutes I knew everything about her character because of her shallow acting. Where's the depth? And, not to point out the obvious, but California's governor plays very much the same role he's played in every other action movie with the exception of the Terminators, and that was only a different role because he played a robot! The writing in Total Recall was SO bad that in the first 15 minutes I still found myself laughing awkwardly at their casual conversations about going to Mars and the mystery "dream girl." Everything about this movie was a standard Sci-Fi book cliché and it hurt my soul to watch it... but I couldn't find my remote... and I'm a terribly lazy individual. May this movie be seen for what it is and may those who nominated it for Oscars have to answer to St. Peter, when their time comes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long time fans of movie Science Fiction will be familiar with this film's troubled production history. Total Recall passed through the hands of a great number of actors, producers and directors and was given the title of "the greatest sci fi film never made." Well several years ago it did get made and the results were not worth the wait. What might have been a fairly decent sci fi peice is turned into just another macho posturing, B.S. movie chock full of incredibly lame one liners from star Arnorld Schwarzenegger. Total recall marked the downward slide of director Paul Verhoeven, a slide that reached it's depths (or heigths?) with the turkey of the decade, Showgirls. And let us not forget that this film is responsible for putting mega sleaze Sharon Stone on the map. As an aside, why does Hollywood continue to put this no talent in pictures since she hasn't had a hit since Verhoeven's other super stinker, Basic Instinct? At least Ronny Cox and Micheal Ironside are on hand and they easily walk away with the top acting honors. But then again when you're up against Scharzenneger and Stone, it's no contest. About the only good thing to come from Total Recall was the fact that Rob Bottin finally got a long overdue Oscar for his makeup effects. Even so, his work in Total Recall is nowhere near as good as his work on The Thing, the film he "should" have won an Oscar for. Let us all have some collective memory loss and forget Total Recall ever happened.</fullReview>

The special effects weren't bad either, especially for 1990! The problem came in with the dialogue, and the plot line. The dialogue just wasn't much and came across as lazy to me, and the plot line dwindled, and I got bored with the film. I wish the movie would've kept a constant tone throughout, but it just didn't &#x1f615;. This is just one of those movies that started out well, but went on a downward spiral as it went along.

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a happily married construction worker with a beautiful wife(played by Sharon Stone). The only problem is that he has a recurring dream where he is on Mars in mortal danger. Despite the disapproval of his wife and co-workers, he goes to Rekall Inc. where he gets the Mars implanted memory that is just as good(if not better) than the real thing. Something goes wrong though, and Quaid awakens to a nightmare where he really(?) is a secret agent, and his wife and co-workers are in on a conspiracy that leads back to Mars run by a corrupt administrator(played by Ronny Cox) who targets Quaid for death by his chief enforcer(played by Michael Ironside) after Quaid makes it to Mars.Large-scale Sci-Fi action film based on the Philip K. Dick story is full of elaborate set pieces but short on credibility. Arnold is appealing, but film doesn't make enough use of its "Is it real?" premise that is far more intriguing than the standard alien artifact subplot, and overly violent story. Too bad, though it ends just when it could really start to get interesting! (No coincidence I think...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terribly acted splatter gore projected over the canvas of an astonishingly bright, daring sci-fi premise. Director Paul Verhoeven is no stranger to this sort of conundrum, with Robocop immediately preceding this picture and Starship Troopers only a few years down the road, and he squeezes as much carnage and gunfire as he can from Phil Dick's brief initial concept. Oddly enough, it's those moments of unrestrained action and wanton violence that hold the whole thing together while the plot explains itself, expertly blending Verhoeven's knack for tongue-in-cheek parody and reckless self indulgence with Dick's outrageous ideas and cerebral plot twists. Merging the two creators' distinct sensibilities, which appear to be at odds from a distance, actually results in the creation of a unique third identity that's bigger and better than the sum of its parts. The flick's runaway success is in spite a horrible performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger at his most steroided, who grunts and growls in a hilarious near-English while the screenplay does its best to buck him like an untamed bronco.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I wanted to hear views about the film 'Total Recall' of course I went to the Internet Movie Data Base. I have a great respect for the director Paul Verhoeven. He has made some porkers such as 'Showgirls' and some classics too, like 'Starship Troopers'.'Total Recall' is a different matter. OK, there is imagination and formula working closely together. At times moments are truly memorable. The mutant hand scene, for an example.Paul has pace as a director and detail yet how he could have allowed those sets designs to pass his critical eye, I will never know. They are small-scale in construction and unimaginative. The production design in this movie is just not up to standard. You keep noticing that the protagonists are running around the same piece of set. The cars in this film were also very badly designed. The lighting is also poor. Mood and atmosphere are lost by an overall bleaching or flooding of light. It gives the picture a cheep look. Which is surprising as I think it was one of the most expensive movies of its time.Arnie is an actor with a limited range. He gives his characters a depth as deep as the paper they are written on. Yet he can pull it off! With a good director, that is. I suppose it's his energy and charisma. The casting in the rest of the film is exemplary. Sharon Stone laps it up as double-crossing bitch. She positively shines. The evil sidekick in black leather is also wonderfully played by Michael Ironside.So what was Paul thinking when he made this? Was it a money job? Does he care?'Total Recall' made a ton of money. It was good for all involved.Is it a good film? No. I firmly believe that Paul Verhoeven will direct another classic in the not too distant future. He is a very good director with wit and intelligence that other directors like Ron Howard or Michael Mann would practically kill for.</fullReview>

What made things worse was that the watcher was expected to figure out who exactly A.S's character really was, he did not know himself. The violence done to the human frame in this type of film with no apparent ill effect always spoils any enjoyment that might be gained from these stories. Outrageous plots are acceptable, being exposed to several minutes of the vacuum of Mars with instant recovery when an earth-like atmosphere with blue skies and fluffy clouds is manufactured is too much.

		<fullReview>This is such a typical (director) Paul Verhoeven movie, which means a lot of good and bad mixed in. The good and bad involves every aspect. For example:The action scenes are inventive and interesting but too long too and exaggerated and, after awhile you get tired of it. The characters are always interesting and varied, especially Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone's roles but also with Ronny Cox, Michael Ironside and Richel Ticotin, but they are all too sleazy, too profane and usually not too likable. His villains are always about nastiest people you'll ever want to see on film. Cox is always good at playing a detestable scumbag.Personally, I think this film could have been a lot better had they toned down the sleaze factor. Kudso to the special-effects department, though. Over 15 years later, the "effects" are still dazzling and fun to view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Total Recall', which I bought for just over $5 for the remastered special widescreen edition DVD, is a good example of what is happening to movies just 10 to 15 years old. First, they are usually not quite as good as we remember them, and second, the DVD price is getting dirt cheap. Who could have imagined just 20 years ago that for a mere five bucks or so, you could own a copy of a feature-length movie, with a crisp and detailed picture, surround sound, and all kinds of extras?? You get all that in 'Total Recall', although it is more cheese than you can swallow in one sitting. I enjoyed it enough, again, after all these years. California's Governor, Arnold, does a respectable job. And here we see Sharon Stone before she hit it big with 'Basic Instinct.' But the story, while inventive, has a screenplay which falls flat very often. Some SPOILERS follow, you may not want to read further. Just one example of how the story goes into the absurd. Quaid comes home after some guys try to kill him, he turns out the lights and tells his 'wife' (Stone) to get down. Then, she starts shooting at him, they fight, he throws her, they fight more violently, he gets the upper hand, then they calmly sit down and start talking about how she isn't (she says) really his wife, his memories were manipulated and she was planted as part of a bigger scheme. Just couldn't happen that way. More SPOILERS ... Anyway, we think Quaid ends up on Mars later, but then something happens to make us wonder if it is part of his 'Rekall' dream implanting. But in the end, when some of the Earthlings inhabiting the Mars settlement start to suffer oxygen deprivement, Quaid listens to the alien sticking out of another man's belly, starts the big ancient generators, and everyone gets saved by the resultant outflowing of oxygen. The pink skies become blue, clouds form, and pretty soon Mars looks just like Earth. Billions of pounds of cheese.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Man's "Blade Runner"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The purpose of intelligent science fiction is not only to speculate on how science and technology might possibly develop in the future, but also to consider the philosophical, ethical and social implications of those developments. The most common science-fiction theme is, of course, space travel, but there are other possible technologies that also lend themselves to a science-fiction treatment. `Total Recall' takes as its subject one of those themes, and combines it with a more conventional story about the colonisation of the planet Mars. It imagines that at some date in the future neuro-technology will have advanced to the point where it is possible to implant false memories into a person's brain- that is to say memories which the person believes to be genuine but which in fact relate to events that have never taken place.One of the applications of this technology is the service provided by Recall Inc., a travel agency that offers to supply its customers with memories of holidays they have never actually been on. The central character, Douglas Quaid, experiences frequent dreams about Mars, a planet that he believes he has never visited. These awaken in him a desire to see Mars for real, but because he has a low-paid job, he settles for the cheaper option of visiting Recall Inc. to have false memories of a Martian holiday implanted. The operation, however, seems to reawaken memories of a genuine previous life on Mars, and he comes to believe that he is in fact a secret agent whose mind has been altered to erase memories of this previous life.Quaid now actually makes the voyage to Mars in an attempt to find out the truth. Mars is under the rule of a dictatorial leader named Cohaagen, and Quaid joins forces with a rebel army who are fighting to overthrow him. The plot then becomes very complex with a number of twists. Quaid does not know which of his associates he can trust; moreover, he does not know whether he can trust himself. Is his personality as `Quaid' real or is it merely a set of false memories implanted in his head by Cohaagen's agents? Did he have a previous life that he can no longer remember? If so, was his previous self good or evil?While I was watching this film, it reminded me of another science-fiction movie from a few years earlier, Ridley Scott's `Blade Runner'. Both films use a science-fiction theme to ask potentially profound philosophical questions about the nature of identity and what it means to be human. (I was interested to learn from other reviewers that both were based on the writings of Philip K. Dick). In terms of quality, however, the two films are very different, `Blade Runner' being superior by far.The reasons for this difference lie partly in the casting of the lead role, partly in the directing and partly in the script. In order to make the most of the possibilities of the situation, the actor playing Quaid needs to be able to suggest three different personalities; Quaid the ordinary man in an ordinary job, Quaid as transformed into the agent fighting alongside the Martian resistance, and Hauser, Quaid's alter ego. In other words, the role requires an actor far more subtle and varied than Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has difficulty conveying one personality beyond that of his conventional tough-guy action hero, let alone three. (Harrison Ford, the star of `Blade Runner', would have been a much better choice). The rest of the cast are also indifferent, with the honourable exception of Sharon Stone as Quaid's beautiful wife Lori who may not be all she seems.The main reason, however, why the film fails to fulfil its potential is that the scriptwriter and director tend to skirt round the deeper implications raised by the plot and treat it as just another goodies-versus-baddies action thriller. The potentially fascinating questions, `What is the nature of the self?' and `How might our concept of the self be changed by the technology of the future?' take a poor second place to `Will Quaid overthrow the evil Cohaagen?' and `Will he get the girl?' (I will not reveal the answers or the ending of the film, beyond saying that it struck me as very implausible). The film raises deeper questions and then avoids them; the result is a wasted opportunity. Paul Verhoeven fails where Ridley Scott succeeded brilliantly.Incidentally, I note that in Dick's original short story the central character was called "Quail" rather than "Quaid". It is interesting to speculate why this may have been changed. Was "Quail" an insufficiently macho name for Schwarzenegger's persona? Or were the filmmakers worried that it could have been taken as a comment on then Vice-President Dan Quayle? 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry for my poor English, I was just watching "Total Recall" and I admit that I totally has been forgotten it. But I had never forgotten Sharon Stone. I realize that cinema grows older very fast and this is natural. I have a friend (unfortunately non English speaker and writer) who is irritaded by the fact that Forman's "Hair" doesn't exist at the Top 10 movies of all time. Although he understands "The Seventh Art" his feelings, his love was given to a just melodrama. I am a technocrat and the lack of future vision by the director makes me (either I want it or not) very sceptic about the value of the "Total Recall". Ridley Scott said recently, that Science Fiction" is dead. If you cannot predict, don't do Sci Fi. Everything (at least almost),that Jules Verne predicted became true. Nothing, that was predicted in "Totall Recall" isn't. P.S. I mentioned Sharon Stone - "Casino" an example f a brilliant play. "Total Recall" is an example of an undistinguished. P.P.S. The idea of flat screens is not new, now I see some boxes looked like a 1956 recievers. P.P.P.S And why for God's sake at the end of twentietn first century people are crushing rocks with hammers - Nonsense. A highly industrial society already dropped this to the machines. I'm sorry about my weakness writing in English once again. Thank You:Zarko nanev</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Awful Mutants!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Total Recall was first released, I dragged a friend to see it. I had seen the trailer and I thought it would impress others as it did for me. Big mistake! The movie started off great. The plot seem interesting and suspenseful. Then, some rubber mutant freaks came wandering and I was left pondering over the embarrassment for recommending the movie. This embarrassment includes a puppet popping out of an actor's chests, a chick with 3 hooters and some deformed plastic all-sorts walking around the set. If only they had not used any mutants in the movie. This film could have been more mature and if it was, it might have been a great all-time sci-fi classic. Instead, it's one big lemon in my books. Personal Opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cool to watch but really stupid if you think about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this isn't exactly Shakespeare. And, some parts of the movie just need you to suspend disbelief (especially the ending as Arnold and his main squeeze are rolling around the surface of Mars gasping for air and the part when Arnold pulls that HUGE thing out of his nose). However, sometimes I just like to watch a movie for entertainment value and don't mind if it's not the greatest or most uplifting film ever made. Yup,...this film is just plain cool. The extremely special effects-laden script is pretty interesting and the stunts are amazing for its time. Plus, sure it's low-brow, but Arnold's line "consider this a divorce" is really neat on a purely emotional level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Recall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Paul Verhoeven (Turkish Delight, RoboCop, Starship Troopers), the star of Predator and Twins had truly established himself as a movie star, and besides his most famous role as The Terminator this is one of his finest action movies. Basically it is the future, 2084, and construction worker Douglas 'Doug' Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been having trouble sleeping dreaming about Mars and a mysterious woman in it with him, his wife is Lori (Sharon Stone) dismissive of taking a trip to the planet, but then he ignores warnings from co-workers and visits Rekall. The company uses memory implants to send people on a vacation to wherever they want, and in Doug's case he also chooses the option to go under a different identity, he chooses to be a secret agent, and he also selects the option of the beautiful woman he will meet on the trip, it happens to be the woman from the dream. Before any implant can be made he reacts violently, but he is sedated and they erase his memory of visiting the company, and the next things he finds his co-workers are attacking him, he kills them, and then Lori turns on him as well. She explains that their marriage and Doug's entire life as a construction worker is fake, and he is now running to escape being caught or killed by thugs led by Richter (Michael Ironside), and contacted by an unknown man on the picture phone he finds out he is being tracked. After the unknown man leaves Quaid a suitcase full of gadgets, fake IDs and cash he also finds a video of the man he apparently used to be, Hauser, who through a recorded message tells him he used to work for ruthless governor of Mars, Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), he tells him how to remove the bug in his head, and that he has to go to Mars. On the red planet Quaid again escapes the thugs, and he follows the clues to a hotel and then to Venusville, the red light district populated by mutated people affected by the radiation poorly shielded, there is the Last Resort strip club, Mary the three-breasted prostitute (Lycia Naff), Thumbelina the dwarf prostitute (Debbie Lee Carrington) and of course Melina (Rachel Ticotin). She is Hauser's former lover, even as a rebel she refuses to help him thinking he still works for Cohaagen, and returning to his hotel room Quaid meets Dr. Edgemar (Roy Brocksmith), President of Rekall, who tries to convince him that he is currently living the fantasy he created with the memory implant, and Lori is there also trying to persuade him to take a pill to end the dream. Melina comes to the rescue after Quaid kills Edgemar, and in a fight he also kill Lori, who was Richter's lover, and they escape getting a ride from taxi driver Benny (Mel Johnson Jr.), and while they go through the tunnels behind the bar Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation in Venusville to suffocate the people. Quaid is led to the resistance, and on the chest of George (Twins' Marshall Bell) appears their leader, mutant Kuato, who reads his mind and determines that the artifact he has hidden within his mind is that there is a reactor that when activated can create a breathable atmosphere for Mars. Kuato is killed and Quaid and Melina are taken, but they manage to escape, they have a confrontation with Benny who is killed in the fight, and they manage to locate the mines where the reactor is, using a hologram device to fool the bad men, and Quaid and Richter have a final fight before the villain is killed, and Cohaagen appears to stop him, claiming that the alien device will kill everyone. In the end, after creating a vacuum, Cohaagen is sucked out and dies from choking and decompression, the reactor is activated, and just in time to stop Quaid and Melina dying from the same way in the vacuum of space, Mars becomes a habitable planet with blue skies, Quaid takes a moment to wonder is he still dreaming, so Melina tells him to kiss her before he wakes up. Also starring Ray Baker as Bob McClane, Dean Norris as Tony, Robert 'Bobby' Costanzo as Harry, Priscilla Allen as Fat Lady and Star Trek: Voyager's Robert Picardo as Voice of Johnnycab. Schwarzenegger gives a great performance as the ordinary (apart from the muscles) man turned action hero trying to find out his true identity, Cox is good as the mad power crazed villain, Ironside is terrific as the henchman obsessed with killing the hero, and Stone who was climbing the Hollywood ladder is a fantastic find, and of course the following year went onto Basic Instinct. I admit that I used to find this find this film a little confusing with the story involving reality, identity and the subconscious, but eventually I got the hang of it and could enjoy all of, the characters are all great, it has entertaining chases, fights and action, the violence is part of the fun, it is just a perfect science- fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award (for Visual Effects), and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>
