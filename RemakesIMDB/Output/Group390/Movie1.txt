		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Good 55 Minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I figured this would be a very dated, corny and dumb B-cowboy movie, but was wrong. It was a very interesting short film that was done very well.It had action, comedy, romance and suspense all packed into a movie less that lasted only 55 minutes. It had a convincing nasty villain, a pretty girl, a talented horse named "Duke," and a crooked-but-funny judge. The horse was able to untie rope and acted almost human.The only thing that looked a bit dated - but applied to all classic westerns - is when they broke chairs over the good guy's head and it never seemed to faze him. Only in the movie can a guy get punched flush in the jaw and have a wooden chair broken over his skull, and the victim is no worse for the wear!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this clichéd when it was made? It is now, of course. Every line of script is hombre, garsh ma'am and reach for the ceiling! But, now, almost everything from the old movies is clichéd. In 1932, was this material fresh? I doubt it. Everything about this movie screams one-shot direction and fast production.But, that's okay! It does what it was meant to do in providing a fast and furious western saga. John Drury (Wayne) is new in town but wastes no time taming an angry horse (Duke), making sweet time with Ruth (Hall), and going after the film's villain (Hagney).Folks seem a little harsh in judging the acting and plot. This movie rushes along as it was meant to. There's little time (55 minutes) to waste on characterization or thoughtful pauses. What we do get is wall-to-wall action which, I believe, is what the movie was shooting for. For drama there are some double-crosses (Drury is framed for being the murderer) and tough talking.John Wayne is nowhere near as polished as we see him in later (and more successful) movies. But his charm is right there in all it's rough glory.I recommend this movie for couch-and-snacks enjoyment. 5 of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Start To Short-Lived Series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ride Him Cowboy" was the first of six westerns that John Wayne made for Warner Bros. for the 1932-33 season. Most were remakes of Ken Maynard silent westerns pf the 1920s thus giving the studio the opportunity to use stock footage from those films (which they did). This one is a remake of Maynard's 1926 film "The Unknown Cavalier". To match any stock footage used, the studio costumed Wayne in Maynard's costume and used a horse ("Duke") that looked the same as Maynard's "Tarzan".This first film gets the series off to a good start. Directed by Fred Allen (No, not THAT Fred Allen), the story moves along and holds the viewer's interest. Since the series was made at WB, the production values were far superior to those in Wayne's later "Lone Star" westerns.The story centers on how Wayne came to acquire his horse "Duke". The Hawk, aka Henry Sims (Frank Hagney) and his gang are robbing and pillaging the local ranchers. One particular night they hit the Gaunt ranch. The foreman, Bob Webb (Edmund Cobb) is attacked. The attack, for some reason, is made to look like Webb was trampled by Gaunt's prize palomino "Duke".The horse is about to be destroyed after a "trial" in town when a stranger, John Drury (Wayne) rides into town. He pleads with the Deputy Sheriff (Henry Cribbon), the owner John Gaunt (Henry B. Wathall) and his daughter Ruth (Ruth Hall) for a chance to ride the horse and tame him. He does this and the horse takes a shine to him. Gaunt allows Drury to take the horse as he also becomes attracted to Ruth.Drury offers his services to the town to track down the mysterious bandit. He and Sims who offers to be his guide set out in search of "The Hawk". In the desert, Sims reveals himself to be "The Hawk" and ties up Drury and leaves him for dead. "Duke", however, is able to free his master.While attacking another ranch, Sims plants Drury's harmonica and later cites him as "The Hawk". A mock trial before Judge Clarence "Necktie" Jones is held, Drury is found guilty and..................................A good series opener with little obvious use of stock footage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horsing Around with Maynard and the Duke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne (as John Drury) saves a Devil-horse ("Duke") from execution, after the horse's murder trial. Honest. Then, Mr. Wayne ventures out to find the real killer. Wayne and "Duke" have a good screen presence. Ruth Hall (as Ruth) is suitably fetching; she was the niece of novelist Ibá?ez, who had several stories adapted for Garbo and Valentino. Henry B. Walthall (as Gaunt) tries to provide some much-needed acting gravitas. The already inferior "Ride Him, Cowboy" swipes its most exciting material from Ken Maynard's silent "The Unknown Cavalier" (1926). The nicely done segments, especially the climatic ending, look like they are from the other film. *** Ride Him, Cowboy (1932) Fred Allen ~ John Wayne, Ruth Hall, Henry B. Walthall</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne In His First Starring Turn at Warner Brothers . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Fred Allen's "Ride Him, Cowboy," a remake of the 1926 Warner Brothers' Ken Maynard western "The Unknown," toplined John Wayne in his first oater for the Burbank company as a harmonica playing hero out to break up a ring of range thieves terrorizing ranches. Essentially, "Ride Him, Cowboy" was a B-movie sagebrusher where the star's horse shows more sense than most of the characters and behaves like a resourceful canine rather than a skittish mount. Aside from a cowboy orchestra strumming a tune, "Ride Him, Cowboy" contains no orchestral soundtrack, but this western boasts better than average production values and looks more expensive than Wayne's later Lone Star westerns that he made after Jack Warner turned him loose some five westerns later. Indeed, this is John Wayne at age 25 looking skinny and rawboned as an upstanding, romantic lead. Predictable from fade-in to fade-out, "Ride Him, Cowboy" is nothing distinguished, but director-turned-editor Fred Allen makes interesting use of dolly shots and there is an interesting point-of-view shot of the sun boiling down on our hero when he is tied to a tree in the desert."Ride Him, Cowboy" opens during one dark, rainy evening as the notorious outlaw 'the Hawk' (Frank Nagney of "The General") a.k.a. Henry Sims and his henchmen attack the Gaunt ranch to steal money. A fierce horse storms up and drives the henchmen away. Jim Gaunt (Henry B. Walthall of "Judge Priest") and his granddaughter Ruth (Ruth Hall of "Monkey Business") check into the disturbance and find one of their ranch hands, Bob Webb, unconscious and in pretty bad shape. Gaunt is surprised to see Sims on his property. Sims explains he just happened to be riding along when he heard the fracas. Sims argues that the horse tried to kill Webb and ought to be destroyed. Meanwhile, the doctor thinks that Webb will pull through without harm, but the ranch hand remains in a coma for three days.The next day in the frontier town of Cattlelow in Maricopa County around the year 1900, Judge Bartlett (Charles Sellon of "Baby Face") convenes court to decide whether to destroy Duke or let the horse live. Sims offers compelling testimony against the horse and Duke rears up at Sims. Ruth rushes to Duke's defense and pleads with the judge not to destroy a horse as gentle as he is. About that time, wandering cowpoke John Drury, late of the Tumblin' Ace Ranch in Texas, rides into Cattlelow on his horse 'Buddy' playing a harmonica without a care in the world. When Drury leans about the impending demise of Duke, he intervenes and persuades Judge Bartlett to let Duke live if he can ride the ornery horse. Sims makes a one-hundred dollar wager with Gaunt that Drury cannot stay aboard Duke and loses. Ruth and Gaunt are overjoyed that Drury saves Duke and a bystander observes that Drury would be a great addition to the vigilantes in their fight against the Hawk. Gaunt invites Drury to their meeting after our hero says that he loves excitement and gives Ruth a loving eye.At the vigilante meeting, Drury suggests that the best way to handle the Hawk is for one man to tackle the villain. Drury learns that nobody knows what the Hawk looks like, except the man has ridden roughshod over the county for years now. John Gaunt persuades Sims to escort Drury into the Hawk's bailiwick. One of the best dolly shots in "Ride Him, Cowboy" occurs during this scene when Allen dollies out from a close-up of Sims to show the entire with several western characters seated around a table. The deputy, Clout (Henry Gribbon of "Yankee Doodle in Berlin"), provides top-notch comic relief as a clowning blow-hard coward. Later that evening at the Gaunt ranch, John and Ruth get to know each other and Ruth insists that John take Duke when he leaves to track down the Hawk. At the same time, Duke trots up and strips the saddle off Drury's horse Buddy. Drury rides off on Duke and meets Sims the following day at Eagle Pass. They ride into the desert and take a breather where Drury explains that his revolver is a 38 caliber gun in a .45 caliber frame dampen the recoil. They compare their ability to make difficult shots look easy and Sims tries out Drury's six-gun and gets the drop on our hero. He ties Drury to a tree while Duke restlessly pulls at his own reins after Drury has knotted them to nearby tree.The Hawk gathers his men, attacks a ranch, and kills the son of the owner and wife. Burning down the buildings, he frames Drury for the crime by leaving Drury's harmonica at the scene. Sims informs Ruth that Drury left him without a word in the night and hasn't been seen since he rode off. The vigilantes and the sheriff catch up to Drury. The only reason that Drury didn't die from exposure of the sun is that Duke pulled himself loose from the tree and untied Drury's bonds with his teeth. The authorities take Drury to a nearby abandoned town where Judge E. Clarence 'Necktie' Jones (Otis Harlan of "Dr. Socrates") convenes a hearing and pretty much railroads Drury into a noose based on Sims' testimony. Meanwhile, Webb recovers from his coma and informs Ruth that it was Sims as the Hawk who attacked their ranch. Ruth mounts up and rides like the devil to save Drury's life. Along the way, she runs into the Hawk's henchmen and fools them into following her to 'Necktie' Jones' courtroom. Ruth arrives in the nick of time to save Drury from an inevitable hanging.Clocking in at a lean, mean 55 minutes, "Ride Him, Cowboy" moves at a brisk pace and never bogs down. Producer Leon Schlesinger is the same individual who supervised the Warner Brothers' cartoons with Bugs Bunny and company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayne's Warner Brothers' Vitagraph Debut Forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ride Him, Cowboy was John Wayne's debut film for Warner Brothers from 1932. Wayne stars as a drifter who happens upon a small town besieged by the "Hawk", a vandal terrorizing the townsfolk for a reason that's never fully revealed. A horse named Duke (of all names) joins up with Wayne in thwarting the "Hawk". The film is a remake of an even older Ken Maynard film, and the plot and characters are creaky. The film moves at a brisk pace, but Wayne never gets to show his stuff much and is upstaged by Duke the horse, as is everyone else in the film. Frank Hagney plays Henry Sims, in one of the few credited roles he played; most of his later roles in his long career were uncredited bit parts. Cornball comic moments are provided by the deputy played by Henry Gribbon and Judge "Necktie" Jones played by Otis Harlan. Film is not up to later Wayne standards, even for a programmer. *1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Wayne western is a good B-film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A smart horse and a pretty girl are the hero and heroine of RIDE HIM, COWBOY, in which a very young JOHN WAYNE is a drifter mistaken for "The Hawk", a ruthless villain who's the leader of a bunch of gunfighters. Its plot sounds like something that Mel Brooks could make into one of his western satires about a villain called "The Hawk" and a weak sheriff, as well as the hero mistaken for a villain.It plays well, fast and furious with some plot devices that have become clichés over the years but manages to hold the interest throughout despite some obvious flaws and the dated look of the film itself.RUTH HALL is the pretty young woman and the smart horse is "The Duke", an amazing animal used well as the critter who identifies the masked man known as "The Hawk" and takes his revenge for the final scene. He's also involved in a clever rescue when Wayne is left strapped to a tree to die in the desert with the horse nearby, able to free himself and Wayne from the predicament.Summing up: Surprisingly good, unpretentious little western that winds up its tale in less than an hour. Easy to note how Wayne's acting skills became vastly improved over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Cast in Fast Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ride Him, Cowboy (1932) *** (out of 4)Duke, a horse, is on trial for killing a man and the judge is about to put him to death when cowboy John Drury (John Wayne) makes a deal. If Drury can tame the horse then it can live. Of course the cowboy comes through and soon the two of them are trying to track down the real murderer.RIDE HIM, COWBOY was Wayne's shot at stardom as this was the first of the six picture deal that he signed with Warner. The film is certainly a step up from movies like TWO FISTED LAW, which featured Wayne in supporting parts. On a technical level this might still be a "B" movie but it's still better than what we had seen the now legend in up to this point.The best thing about the picture is actually Wayne and his supporting cast of actors. I thought that laid back approach of Wayne's worked pretty well here including the scenes where he trying to smooth talk the leading lady played by Ruth Hall. Wayne and Hall share some nice chemistry together. Frank Hagney does a good job in his role of the villain and Henry B. Walthall turns in another fine supporting performance.As you'd expect, there's a lot of gun play as well as other Western trappings but they're all handled quite nicely by director Fred Allen who keeps the film moving at a nice pace throughout its 55 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . during her Troubles of the 1900s into our 21st Century for hanging BOTH Quasimodo's crush Esmerelda AND this gypsy gal's dancing goat! Just thinking about that poor, innocent goat flailing around at the end of a rope is enough to make anyone toss their French fries. Warner Bros. uses RIDE HIM, COWBOY to warn America that the "Red State" West is every bit as uncouth and gauche as backwards France. It's bad enough that a 25-year-old John Wayne is almost strung up for possession of a harmonica, before he's done anything in Real Life to earn his nickname of "The American Anti-Christ." But the heartless bozos who populate the U.S. West go too far in putting Wayne's Wonder Horse "Duke" on trial, with an eye toward dropping the white stallion on the Gallows. Both "Dukes"--man and horse--are nearly doomed on the say-so of the local crime-lord, a top honcho on the town's Vigilante Council. Red Stater's inability to differentiate between Angels and Demons explains why they're now going down at the Final Trump, Warner Bros. explains with RIDE HIM, COWBOY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Let the stranger ride. We accept his proposition".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1931/1932 movie release season, Columbia Pictures had Buck Jones under contract to do a series of Westerns. During the same period, they also signed up a young John Wayne, perhaps to groom for future leading roles. However with the signing of yet another Western hero, Tim McCoy, Wayne became expendable after appearing in three films that featured Jones and McCoy.So Wayne was picked up by Leon Schlesinger over at Warners, resulting in a series of six films; "Ride Him, Cowboy" was the first. Long after seeing all sixteen of Wayne's Lone Star Westerns (1933 to 1935) he made right after the Warners gig, I've been diligently seeking them out, and lo and behold, all six appeared on the Turner Classic Movie Channel this past week, aired in the order of their original release. Sometimes the movie gods smile down favorably.The film opens with Wayne galloping into view atop his horse 'Duke', perhaps not as dramatic an entrance as he made in the opener for "Stagecoach", but impressive nonetheless. What's interesting is that the picture serves as the origin story for Wayne's horse, who appeared in all six of the Warners sagebrush yarns and released as 'Four Star Westerns'. In the story, Duke is put on trial! for being a menace to the community of Cattlelow in Healer Valley, Maricopa County. The film's captioning stated the town's name as 'Catalog', but I use another reviewer's description since it seems to make more sense.Duke, who's owned by the Gaunt's (Henry B. Walthall and Ruth Hall), is saved by harmonica playing John Drury (Wayne) after successfully staying on board the bucking Duke to prove that the horse is manageable. That scene of Drury taming down Duke was handled using stock footage from an earlier Ken Maynard film atop his horse Tarzan. Duke himself, a white horse, was selected because of his resemblance to Tarzan for just such an eventuality. One more note of interest - Duke appeared to have some sort of brand or mark on his left hindquarter, and depending on the camera angle, the mark looked like 'A1' or '/H', a little difficult to tell, although in the follow up picture, "The Big Stampede", it definitely looks more like 'A1'.Duke proved invaluable in the later going when it became necessary to save his new master from dying in the desert after the villain Hawk (Frank Hagney) tricked Drury into giving up his gun. Duke managed to uproot the tree he was tied to and undid the rope securing Drury so he could bring the Hawk and the rest of his rustling gang to justice. Before that though, Drury had to stand trial for a raid on the Gordon Ranch, having been implicated by his harmonica placed at the scene by Henry Sims, the Hawk. A newspaper headline touting 'Dewey Captures Manila' in the office of Judge 'Necktie' Jones (Otis Harlan), places the date of this story some time after May 1st, 1898.Riding hard to make the save, because Duke couldn't actually speak, one of the few things he wasn't capable of, Ruth Gaunt arrived just in time after outwitting a trio of Hawk's henchmen. In a story made credible only by the standards of these early B Westerns, Drury and his gal Ruth close things out with a kiss, establishing a tradition that would carry through the remaining Four Star Westerns as well as the Lone Star films to follow.Addendum**** 6-7-2016 - Doing a little research on 'Duke', you can see a pretty good screen capture of the brand noted in my review here at: http://www.b-westerns.com/hoss-jwayne.htm. Apparently it's a combination of the letters AH as one can see from the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Two Dukes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts with a horse named Duke coming to the rescue of a man being bushwhacked. The man is cracked over the head and killed, so one of the robbers claims the horse went mad and attacked them. So the horse is put on trial for murder. I'm not kidding -- the horse is brought to town and put on trial in front of the whole town! Before he's sentenced to death, a cowboy (John Wayne) shows up and offers to ride the horse to prove he's not wild. After he does and saves Duke, the horse's owner (great character actor Henry B. Walthall) asks Wayne to help the town catch a masked bandit named the Hawk. The first of six B westerns Wayne made for WB in the early '30s. He was named John something-or-other in every movie and always had his horse Duke. They're routine westerns. Forgettable but watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introducing the Duke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was the first of a series of B westerns that John Wayne did for Warner Brothers and it was decided to give him a horse companion named Duke. Duke the horse was fine, the film left a lot to be desired.A horse is the only witness to a robbery where another witness was beaten unconscious and lies in a coma. He went after the villain and the villain who is masked bandit known as the Hawk says the horse is a mankiller who attacked him for no good reason. Since by day the villain is a respectable town citizen everyone believes him, almost.One of the almost is young cowpoke John Wayne who says he can tame the stallion and proceeds to do so. He even offers to track down the Hawk.It starts to get a little ridiculous here especially in the way that the villain gets the drop on Wayne. Of course in the tradition of Trigger, Champion, Topper, and Robert Taylor's horse Varick in Knights of the Round Table, Duke rescues his friend John Wayne. Doesn't that sound a little odd.Otis Harlan has a very funny bit as the country judge before whom Wayne is tried when he's accused of being the Hawk. And the villain does get a poetic ending.Still it's hardly one of John Wayne's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong case can be made for a horse being smarter than everyone else in this film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1930s, John Wayne made a very long string of low-budget westerns. Despite their limitations, most of these films are pretty enjoyable for what they are--films to compete with series by the likes of Gene Autry and the like. And, compared to these other films, the Wayne films are generally a bit better. However, none of the films of this genre are high art--with often silly and tissue-thin plots but plenty of action.This film irritated me a bit, as you must accept the notion that everyone in the film has an IQ lower than a tomato's! Heck, Duke the Horse is MUCH smarter than everyone else in this silly film! You see this is one of the earliest scenes where Duke is on trial(!). He's accused of being vicious as he reacts horribly--at least around certain people. No one seems to notice that he is a gentle horse and only acts up around people who turn out to be evil! No one in town seems to know who the local villain, 'the Hawk', is, but Duke sure knows--and might pay for his life because of this! A bit later, it turns out that Wayne's character is also amazingly stupid. In a badly written scene, it's obvious to every single person in the audience (including the babies) that the guy in the desert with Wayne is the Hawk. Their conversation clearly lets you know that the guy is the Hawk and people in the audience were no-doubt yelling "it's the Hawk--don't trust him!". Yet, oddly, Wayne hands this evil man his guy to 'try it out' and low and behold, he takes Wayne prisoner!! And, for that matter, the Hawk isn't all that bright either, as he ties up Wayne and leaves him instead of just shooting him in the head! I guess the Hawk knew Wayne was the hero and, as such, was invulnerable! Later still, it's obvious that Wayne is a good guy. So what do the townsfolk do? Yep, they decide to hang him despite having almost no evidence!! And, when Wayne offers to give them proof that he's innocent, they ignore him! They also won't allow him to testify in court! What a bunch of poop-brains!! Is there lead in the water or something that might account for everyone being so incredibly stupid?! Perhaps there is a stupid gene and everyone here is related to each other! To make it even worse, a nice young lady learns who the Hawk really is and tells everyone in court who the Hawk is...and they STILL want to hang Wayne!! Overall, this is a pretty terrible film--even for a B-western. Wayne went on to make some very good Bs, but his early ones for Leon Schlesinger Studios were amazingly bad. This and "Haunted Gold" are two of these dreadful films he made with them and fortunately his films made just a few years later were much, much better--such as his Three Mesquiteers series. Any film that requires characters to be this dumb to make the plot work just isn't worth seeing--except for its value as comedy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worth watching Duke (the horse)...Duke (the human) leaves a lot to be desired. As a fairly early Western, this picture has many of the classic ingredients...bad guys, good guys, romance, lively crowds of town folks,and even a horse for a hero. The problem is sub-par acting, a ridiculous script, and amateurish direction. However, even with these faults whatever possible enjoyment Western fans might have found is ruined by the incredibly poor acting of John Wayne. It's impossible not to be distracted by his low level of performance and even a cowboy fanatic like myself could not suffer more than a few of his awkward scenes before fleeing the scene myself.</fullReview>
