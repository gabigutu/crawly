		<shortDescription>Minnelli Directs Garland In MGM Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The day was bright, The air was sweet, The smell of honeysuckle almost knocked you off your feet ..." This is unashamed nostalgia for an idealised America, dating back to an age of innocence before the two World Wars.It is 1903, and the city of St. Louis is ablaze with excitement as it prepares to host the World's Fair. Here in the geographic heart of the USA, the very pleasant Smith family lives in a very pleasant suburb of the very pleasant St. Louis. We watch the Smiths through the seasons and into Spring 1904 as they fall in love, dress up for Hallowe'en, bottle their home-made ketchup and .... well, ride the trolley.This is a world of tranquillity where nothing can threaten the homely complacency of Middle America. The evening meal is always a wholesome family gathering, the month of July is always sunny, big brothers are always handsome Princeton freshmen and the iceman's mare knows the neighbourhood so well that she stops at each home on her round without needing to be told. The only shadow which falls across the Smiths' domestic bliss comes when Alonzo, the paterfamilias, proposes to move the household to New York. However, Alonzo soon realises what a terrible mistake it would be to tear his wife and daughters away from their beloved MidWest: he relents, and family harmony is restored.This heartwarming, exuberant musical is one of the very best ever made, and MGM knew exactly what it was doing in terms of box office success. The film was calculated to cash in on the zeitgeist of 1944, the year in which vast American armies were sent across to Europe and the war in the Pacific turned decisively in America's favour. Millions of young American men found themselves far from home in what was certain to be the last Christmas of the War, and millions of families back home missed them terribly: " Some day soon we all will be together, If the fates allow. Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow ..."In this idealised America, everyone is prosperous, everyone conducts himself like a good citizen should, old folks are cheerful, healthy and alert, domestic servants feign grumpiness but actually adore their masters, and teenage girls are flirtatious but impeccably proper. There are strong American folk-resonances in the homespun wisdom of the family elders, the strong, straight young adults and the 'down home' hearthside gatherings and dances. It could be argued that the film invokes an America that has never in fact existed. This maybe so, but the Perfect America which we experience here exerts an emotional pull far stronger than any real place could command.Vincente Minnelli directed the movie with panache. There are many subtle but sure touches - for example, two short scenes which establish the proposition that the family's happiness is inextricably linked to St. Louis. Alonzo announces the move to New York, and with clever choreography Minnelli turns him into a pariah in his own living-room. Esther and Tootie gaze at the snowmen which they will have to abandon in the yard, and we know without any dialogue to help us that the eastward migration isn't going to happen. With similar cinematic economy, Minnelli shows us the happy commotion around the Christmas tree without allowing it to distract our attention from Alonzo and Anna, whose wordless reconciliation sets the seal on the plot. This is directing of rare skill.In films of the 1960's and 70's a stock device was used: a sepia-tinted photograph would 'come to life' with colour and motion, to show that the scene was laid in the past. Minnelli employs the trick elegantly in this film, and I am not aware of any example which pre-dates this one.This is a 'formula' movie, but its ingredients are so fine and they are combined with such marvellous skill that the whole eclipses the parts. Among the elements which contribute to the project's success are the songs - and the film contains three classics: "The Trolley Song", "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" and (of course) "Meet Me In St. Louis".Judy Garland was 22 years old when she made this film (though she easily passes for a 17-year-old) and it was this movie which cemented her relationship with Minnelli. They married one year later and Liza was born in March 1946.Predictably enough, the film has a happy ending. The teenage girls Esther and Rose are paired off, and the Smiths get to visit the World's Fair as one big happy family. As they look for the restaurant (once again, a meal signifies domestic harmony) they are distracted by the lighting-up of the city, a filmic metaphor for the approaching end of World War Two. The sisters are filled with awe at America's technological ascendancy, and that such miracles can be achieved by such folksy, simple people - "Right here where we live: right here in St. Louis!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland never looked better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a sweet, wonderful movie - a slice of 1900's America that probably was never so perfect, but we would like to think that it was. The storyline is not a love story between Esther (Garland) and "The Boy Next Door" (one of the three timeless classic songs found in this movie). The storyline is really about the whole Smith family, based on an actual family who lived in St. Louis at the turn of the century. The real-life "Tootie" Smith (played by Margaret O'Brien) wrote stories of her life for the NewYorker. These stories were bought and compiled into this classic musical. "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" originated here, and has become a classic yuletide song. It has been sung a thousand times by a thousand artists, but no one could ever capture the heartfelt emotion expressed by Judy Garland. If it doesn't bring a tear to your eye as you listen to her sing the song to little Tootie, I would have to wonder if you have a heart at all.The most fun song is "The Trolley Song" - you can even see that Judy herself had a ball singing it. That scene was done in one take.Judy Garland never looked better in any of her films as she did in this one. Perhaps it was one of the happiest times in her life? It is well-known that she married director Vincent Minelli after this picture.Beautifully directed, depicting with accuracy the passing of the seasons of one year in the life of the Smiths of St. Louis. What a fun, charming, movie. I could never tire of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feel Good Movie if Ever There Was One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is sheer delight from start to finish. I'm sure St. Louis in 1904 wasn't really the same as its depicted here...but it should have been! Only the most jaded cynic imaginable could not be charmed by this film.The songs are perfect, the cinematography, the set direction, costumes, everything really - MGM movie magic at its best! Vincente Minelli did a superlative job of direction, and the cast simply could not be bettered. Judy Garland gives what I feel is the most relaxed and charming performance of her career, and sings like an angel, not like the jittery bundle of nerves she would become in later life. Tom Drake is very winning as the "Boy Next Door" we should all be so lucky to have. But Margaret O'Brien absolutely steals the picture as the adorable but irrepressibly morbid Tootie, a refreshing change from the normally saccharine moppets of Hollywood's golden years. Marjorie Main also swipes a scene or two as the mouthy cook, and Mary Astor and Leon Ames give sterling support as the parents. Their "make-up" scene at the piano is beautifully done.What a wonderful antidote this movie is when you need to retreat from the harsh world and have your spirits lifted for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland at her best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies with Judy Garland in it (the others being 'A Star Is Born' and 'Easter Parade'). She is so superb in it! Vincente Minnelli's direction is pristine and lushly beautiful. The supporting cast of the film also adds flair to the film. Little Margaret O'Brien plays Tootie, Judy's little sister in the film, who is a real standout. Lucille Bremer (a former Radio City Music Hall Rockette, who had a very short career at MGM), plays Judy's older sister who tries flirting with a colonel. The fabulous plot is very simple:The year is 1903, the town, St. Louis.Tthe Smith family is anxiously awaiting to go to the World's Fair in their hometown. Esther (Judy Garland) has an endless crush on the boy next door Jon Truett (Tom Drake. Then, Mr. Smith (Leon Ames) breaks the news to the family that they are moving to New York City so he can get a job. Mrs. Smith (Mary Astor), Tootie (Margaret O'Brien), Agnes (Joan Caroll), and Esther (Judy), are extremely disappointed. But, on Christmas Eve, they decide not to move after all, and become one of the first visitors to the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904.This movie is one of the greatest movie musicals of all time, and one of Judy Garland's BEST movies! (She sings the legendary "The Trolley Song", the heartwarming "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas", the lovely "The Boy Next Door", and the cute duet with Margaret O'Brien, "Under The Bamboo Tree")I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WHOEVER LIKES MUSICALS! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too sweet? Perhaps...but not too syrupy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was no other reason why Judy Garland married Vincente Minnelli, then this film supplies the reason for how he won her hand. It's a valentine to her talents and, as an example of MGM's gilt-edged manufacture, it's a sold gold entry.Yes, Tom Drake was a bit wan as Judy's love interest but everyone else in the cast, maybe even including the too-glamorous Lucille Bremer, are just right, especially the inimitable Marjorie Main. Mary Astor, already deep in the throes of her extended bout with alcoholism as the family's matriarch shows nary a sign of her illness, such was the wizardry of the makeup artists, costumers, hair dressers and the cinematographer. And Judy, too, already addicted to the medications that her tyrannical studio bosses used to keep her nose to a very demanding grindstone, looks as wholesome and lovely as one could wish, particularly in the "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" number.It's one of those Golden Age classics that always repays a return viewing and its naysayers are in a rather lonely minority, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Happiness of Not Moving--At Least for Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest movie musicals, and thus one of the greatest American movies, "Meet Me in St. Louis" tells a story that may appear insultingly inconsequential: a happy family living in turn-of-the-century St. Louis considers moving to New York, but decides against it. Yet Vincente Minelli, working with a wonderful cast and unusually intelligent songs, takes this story and makes it the one really convincing screen refutation of Tolstoy's claim that all happy families are alike, and indeed perhaps the only fully rounded and persuasive representation of a happy family in the history of movies. From the small family conflict over the quality of homemade ketchup that begins the movie, to the agony over moving at the end, the Smiths are a collection of distinctive, vibrant and at times almost incompatible characters bound together not only by love but by a contagious, and very particular, sense of fun. Minelli's genius for musical numbers in interior spaces--most notably the great party in the Smith home near the beginning of the movie--is complemented here by two unforgettable outdoor sequences, Judy Garland's matchless "Trolley Song" and Tootie's Halloween adventure in the neighborhood, where she shows such vulnerability, such courage,and in the end such diabolical lack of conscience that no one can fail to love her. These outdoor scenes protect "Meet in St. Louis" from the claustrophobia that so frequently limits the power of "family" dramas.Tootie, at five, is the youngest of the five Smith children, and as played by the great child actor Margaret O'Brien, she is also the center of most of the fun. Her relationship with her older sister Esther (Judy Garland) is captivating in its joy, complexity, and ultimately in its sadness. For even though the catastrophe (!) of moving to New York is narrowly avoided, Esther will still leave home for life with the boy next door, and the powerful unity of these lucky people will ultimately give way to other claims of new love, new suffering and new duty. The happiness the Smiths knew while living together will only increase the pain of each parting. We're blessed, though, to have glimpsed their particular brand of happiness at its glorious peak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable Achievement in Musical Comedies and Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen this film several times as a child before studying it in earnest as part of a college film class. Now, nearly 20 years past, I look more at the nuances and subtleties of the performances and direction in a movie that seems easy to characterize as sentimental. Indeed, the vibrant color, the relatively simple plot contrivances, and the resolution of the big question of the movie all make for what seems superficially like a film for fans of Corny Musicals.Let me argue against "sap" for the main reason that a deep undercurrent of real and heartfelt emotion underlies the entire enterprise. And the credit can be spread wide for that: 1. The rich and subtle performance of Judy Garland, who does not miss a step, a note, a glance or an inflection throughout the entire movie. For many la Judy can be an acquired taste, but she shows her "stuff" here. Watch her primping at the mirror with Rose, watching Tootie as she sings "Dear Mother," or in the scene where The Boy tells her he can't get his tuxedo out of the cleaners. She was a marvelous actor, and it shows in the small scenes as well as the grand singing ones. Her transition from worry and disappointment to exuberance in The Trolley Song is a wonder to behold.2. Margaret O'Brien as Tootie (and also the writer's characterization of Tootie): here is a child who is not "nice" or "cute" the way TV/Movie kids are today. But she is compelling and wonderful in own right - a real flesh and blood kid. In particular the Halloween scene really shows the dark side of childhood where scary fantasies can become real, and the depths of her despair at leaving St. Louis capture the essence of leaving everything that is familiar and right.3. The acting company is so wonderful from the smallest supporting actor to the largest role, there is a give and take (note the "passing" of the title song from person to person at the beginning of the film) and the easy banter, the dinner table interactions, the scene where everyone finds out about the Big Move, and you get a sense that this is a real family.4. The integration and the transition from the emotion of the scene directly into the emotion of the song, and then back to the scene is repeated again and again. This is not an easy thing to do, and for all I can recall, Minnelli was the first to master it. Most musicals would stop dead in the their tracks to do a song, but the music here is so organic and truthful you hardly notice the strings moving in the background.5. And don't get me started on the score, which is really wonderful, echoing the various themes at just the perfect moment. The Halloween bonfire music is especially good. I think credit goes to George Stoll for that.6. And for putting the package together, a tip of the hat to Vincente Minnelli and Arthur Freed, who went on to do many wonderful musicals, but none perhaps as wonderful as this one. Minnelli works magic with staging (the "Skip to My Lou" and "Trolley Song" are wonderful group numbers), and it must have been true love that helped Judy Garland's wonderful performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How have I missed seeing this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never seen this movie until a few weeks ago. After I rented it from Netflix last month (I still have it, but I plan to buy my own copy soon), I saw it on AMC. Has it been on TV before? I mean, I've known of its existence, because I've seen the title in the sheet music for Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. I heard James Taylor talk about the movie in an interview after he recorded that song in response to 9/11 and I've been wanting to see it ever since. Now I've become a MMISL junkie. I can't stop watching it! I've read everything I can find on the Internet about it (and about the St. Louis World's Fair, which is absolutely fascinating--did you know that one of the pavilions featured actual premature babies in incubators?), and I just started reading Sally Benson's original book. For those who complain that this film is some kind of idealized or fantasized representation of life in America, I say read the book. It's based on Sally Benson's actual recollections of growing up in St. Louis and the movie dialogue and situations are lifted almost word for word from the book. It jibes pretty well with other things I've read about the era and with stories I've heard my parents and grandparents tell, so I have no trouble believing it at all. Actually, the situations and relationships are not that different from what families face today (at least the normal, two-parents-of-the-opposite-sex kind that I'm familiar with). Just listen to Mrs. Smith tell her husband to count to three before responding to his daughter. (He counts to three and shouts at her anyway!) As for Mr. Smith giving up a lucrative career move for the sake of his family's happiness and well-being, how many parents have not faced similar decisions?I think there are five main reasons I like this movie: 1. Judy Garland. She's just one of the greatest performers of the 20th century, that's all there is to it. 2. Margaret O'Brien. What a joy to watch on the screen. Now I know why she was one of the most beloved child stars in America. 3. The wonderful songs. It doesn't get much better than "The Trolley Song," "The Boy Next Door," and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas." 4. The beautiful Technicolor cinematography. In the DVD version, the colors are so brilliant that it looks like it could have been filmed yesterday. And Rose and Esther's clothes are simply stunning. I especially love the (Oriental?) robes they wear at home. 5. Last but not least, I enjoy its refreshingly positive, upbeat take on family life and life in these United States. I just wish I hadn't had to wait fifty years to see this sixty-year-old movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of cake and a song to blow away the wind of change.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that is firmly ticking all the boxes for those looking for a family classic to admire and tap your feet along with. This delightful musical deals with one family and their struggle to deal with the changing of the times at the turn of the century. When the Father is requested to move to New York permanently with his job, the rest of the family are not that keen to leave their memories and their beloved home in St. Louis, and in to the mix is the varying degrees of blossoming love involving the elder daughters and their respective beaus.This film is just so gorgeous on many fronts, the colour beautifully realises the tremendous scope director Vincent Minnelli brings with his recreation of the era, the attention to detail is quality supreme. The story is good and earthy, a sort of tale to have the viewer hankering for the good old days before the world got itself in one big hurry. The songs are crackers, enjoy standards such as The Boy Next Door, The Trolley Song, and the simply precious Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. The cast are across the board doing good work but it is of course Judy Garland who carries the movie firmly on her slender shoulders, and here she has never been prettier, and her voice is practically as good as it ever was in her career.A film for all the family to enjoy, a film that is from the top echelons of musicals, and a film that simply demands you relax and enjoy. Right, I'm off to get a piece of cake... 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of the Hollywood studios during the War years made these nostalgic films about a simpler time when no foreign foe threatened our way of life. MGM's contribution to these films was not bettered served than by Meet Me In St. Louis. It's a simple story about the Smith family in 1904 St. Louis eagerly awaiting the World's Fair that would take place in their town. And to my knowledge no other World's Fair had as enduring a theme song as the one written for this fair, serving as the title song for the film.The Smith family consists of parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor and their five children, son Henry Daniels, Jr. and daughters in descending order, Lucille Bremer, Judy Garland, Joan Carroll, and Margaret O'Brien. Grandfather Harry Davenport lives with the clan and so does live-in maid Marjorie Main who functions like Alice in the Brady household. A good meal and an occasional wisecrack to keep everyone in line.Everyone's excited about the upcoming fair, St. Louis's rival city Chicago had one a decade earlier and Buffalo did three years earlier, but this one promises to be the most extravagant of all. Ames gets an opportunity in business and wants to move the family to New York, but one by one the family has or develops obligations and ties to St. Louis that makes them reluctant to leave. Not to mention they don't want to miss the fair.Vincente Minnelli directed Meet Me In St. Louis and it was his first opportunity to work with Judy Garland whom he would marry after the film was finished. Judy got to do three of her most identified songs from the Hugh Martin-Ralph Blane score that was blended with some traditional music of the times. The Boy Next Door, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, and The Trolley Song all come out of Meet Me In St. Louis and were staple items at Garland concerts for years. One of the Oscar nominations that Meet Me In St. Louis received was for The Trolley Song for Best Original Song. It lost to Bing Crosby's Swinging On A Star that year. The other nominations were for musical scoring, color cinematography, and screenplay.Margaret O'Brien did a remarkable job in this film, this was probably her best role while a child star at MGM. Not that she was the youngest and most appealing of the kids, she was that. But Minnelli did a great job in directing her. She had all the fears and trepidations of a child growing up and not wanting to leave all she's known and loved in St. Louis. Her acting reached its zenith in the scene where she destroys the carefully made snowmen in her yard and in the Halloween scene where she is induced to play a practical joke on a neighbor the rest of the kids regard as scary. Her number with Judy Garland, Under The Bamboo Tree is a gem.Meet Me In St. Louis was one of the earliest and best films coming out of the Arthur Freed unit at MGM. It was films like these that gave the Freed unit and MGM its reputation for turning out the best in musical film entertainment. It can never be duplicated because you don't have studios with all that talent under contract.In its way the film itself is as nostalgic as the time it celebrates. I guarantee your heart strings will go Zing Zing Zing as you hear Judy Garland sing the score from Meet Me In St. Louis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early modern musical still worth watching, barely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly cliché, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII:Next year all our troubles will be miles away,Someday soon, we all will be togetherIf the Fates allowWhat does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943.Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy.And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart.Spoiler alert:In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Musical Masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie covers four seasons between the summer of 1903 and the spring of 1904. Based upon the recollections of Sally Benson (who wrote for the "New Yorker," 1941-1942), the spotlight is on the upbeat lives of the upper middle class Smith family that, residing in a suburban St. Louis Edwardian house, includes patriarch Alonzo Smith (Leon Ames), wife Anna (Mary Astor), four daughters, an uneventful son (Henry H. Daniels, Jr.), a wisecracking grandpa (Harry Davenport), and even an imperturbable housekeeper, Katie (Marjorie Main). The main excitement is, of course, the announcement that St. Louis will host the 1904 World's Fair (Louisiana Exposition, the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase). The other story lines mostly focus on three of the Smith daughters. For two older girls (Esther and Rose) the emphasis is, of course, on romance. At dinnertime, twenty year-old Rose (Lucille Bremer) gets a long distance telephone call from her boyfriend in New York, waiting for a proposal that never comes. Seventeen year-old Esther (twenty-two year-old Judy Garland) falls in love with the boy next door, John Truett (Tom Drake). For the youngest girl, Tootie (Margaret O'Brien), a little terror, the focal point is on mischief, especially on Halloween. But the biggest threat of the happy existence of the family is the announcement of the patriarch, a successful attorney, after he arrives home from work on Halloween evening. Mr. Smith notifies his family that he will accept a job promotion to New York City effective January 1904. Uprooting the family's comfortable existence will shatter everyone's dreams as the Smiths are intrinsically linked to St. Louis, the heart of Midwest America. Expertly directed by Vincente Minnelli, "Meet Me in St. Louis" is one of the most beautiful musicals ever created, despite its formulaic storyline (not unusual among musicals anyway). Minnelli's eye for period detail is stunning. There are the impeccable sets (like the colorful rooms in the Smith house and the electrical lighting of the Fair), music score, early twentieth century costumes, and first-rate artistic performances. In particular, dark-eyed and auburn-haired Judy Garland danced, sang, and looked as well as she ever did. Charming with old-time innocence, the film's musical scores are almost beyond comparison ("The Trolley Song," "Skip to My Lou," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," etc.). Note how deftly Director Minnelli handles the change from scene to song back to scene without skipping a beat. In fact, the songs are integrated with the storyline. Minnelli loved gorgeous color, especially red motifs. Note the shiny red automobile at the very beginning, reddish wallpaper, the family room table lamp, grandpa's fez, the hall bench seat across from the upstairs bathroom, the milk pitcher, the small rose wall picture, and the homemade ketchup. Then there are Judy Garland's winter dress and ruby red lipstick. Color red is also prominent in the four framed prints ? sepia photographs that come alive in color ? that herald each season. Each frame has its own character and does remind one of the Americana of Courier and Ives. The arrangement was probably copied five years later by Mervyn LeRoy in his "Little Women." As the coming-of-age members react to each predicament, there is that undertone of adieus that will change the family forever. Then there is that hint of a complex world (the Exposition itself) descending around the Smiths that foretell the end of the simple ways of the good old days (the period before World War I). But for the next few months the Smith family will be at its peak and the changes will be slight. It is the World's Fair that will garner attention. After all, as Esther remarks at the end, "I can't believe it, right here where we live, right here in St. Louis."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Me in St. Louis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks.And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role.My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor.I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Judy Garlands second best film, next to the Wizard of Oz. It has the nostalgic feeling of fantasy for a different time &amp; place. Feeling good &amp; no place like home come into play too.Vincent Minelli directs this Garland starring vehicle &amp; then marries her after the film. Arther Freed, the MGM musical genius produces it. The supporting cast is strong from character actors Marjorie Main &amp; Chill Wills, to Mary Astor &amp; even a 19 year old June Lockhart.The story is basically about St. Louis &amp; a family living there in 1903. During the first half hour Judy sings several songs. Then there is a musical break for a while before the songs come back as we go from summer to fall. Then in the winter in the last 15 minutes, Judy finally gets to that tune "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas." Besides Over The Rainbow, this is her next most famous song. This Technicolor musical is a good film. Some of the tunes are now dated, but Judys Christmas song is as timeless as any she ever sang &amp; she is in excellent voice. The film features the mandatory happy ending which most films of the period have. It runs a little short of 2 hours so it doesn't get bogged down which makes it quite watchable &amp; even though it has Christmas in it, it is not broadcast as often as other Christmas films, but is as good as many of the films which are broadcast every year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't quite add up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine.The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should.It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Louisiana Puchase Exposition of 1904</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nearly flawless musical film by Vincent Minelli based on a series of writings by Sally Benson about her real life family from St. Louis, Missouri at the turn of the 20th Century. Although the most famous sequence (and a real heart-breaker at one point) deals with the current Christmas season, the film really looks at the events in the Smith family from Spring 1903 to Spring 1904, culminating in their attending the above mentioned Louisiana Puchase Exposition that was under construction at the time. It was one of many Worlds Fairs that were frequently occurring in the 19th Century, the most notable previous ones in the U.S. being the 1876 Philadelphia Worlds Fair (the movie CENTENNIAL SUMMER is about that one), the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (subject of a few movies), and the 1901 Pan American Exposition at Buffalo, New York (which is involved in the plot of the film THIS IS MY AFFAIR, because President William McKinley was assassinated there).The Louisiana Purchase Exposition was best remembered for the invention (by accident) of the hot dog and the ice cream cone, the latter when a vendor ran out of paper mittens for holding the frankfurters and sausages and bought some roles, the latter when a vendor ran out of paper plates for ice cream and used some soft waffles as cones. But in it's day it was an exciting place and it was a very successful world's fair.The Smith family is made up of the father (Leon Ames), the mother (Mary Astor), the grandfather (Harry Davenport), the son (Henry Daniel Jr.), and the four daughters (Lucille Bremer, Judy Garland, Joan Caroll, and Margaret O'Brien), and their cook (Marjorie Main). Bremer has a boyfriend studying at Princeton (Robert Sully) and Garland is fascinated by the next door neighbor (Tom Drake). In the course of the year we watch the family enjoying their close friendships with other St. Louis residence (even little Tootie - Margaret O'Brien - likes to ride and help the iceman Mr. Neeley (Chill Wills)). We see them having social parties with singing (Minelli includes many songs in the film, but he does maintain period music - one hears Ethelbert Nevin's "Narcissa White" and the popular tune "Under the Bamboo Tree" that is sung and danced by Garland and O'Brien). Even some of the songs for the film are set in that period, most notably "The Trolley Song".The trouble in the story is the decision by Ames to move to New York and begin a New York City office of his large St. Louis law firm. This shakes up the family, who are used to living in St.Louis, and think of New York (in the warning words of Marjorie Main) as a place where people live in tenements! While this film has great, sweet comic moments (O'Brien in Halloween disguise playing pranks on neighbors with flour and fake bodies), it also has one truly gut wrenching moment. If any film belongs to two players (despite ensemble excellence) it is MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS. Garland's songs (THE TROLLEY SONG, THE BOY NEXT DOOR, HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE Christmas) all are wonderful and became part of her legendary repertoire. But O'Brien stole the heart of the audience as "Tootie", not just by her funny antics (she looks so cute and little in this film) but in her dramatic scene - when she breaks down at the thought of leaving St. Louis and destroys her snowmen family so nobody else can have them when they move. The sequence always brings tears to my eyes as it is perfectly done.This comment does not ignore the other players. Ames turns in a gilt edge performance as a father who learns a valuable lesson in what is important to his family above larger salaries. Astor is properly loyal to her mate, even if she disagrees with his initial decision. Davenport spices the film (particularly at the Christmas dance scene, where he rescues Garland), and Main has her normal salty comments about the activities around her. It is one of the greatest of MGM musicals and a wonderful look at the lost world of Teddy Roosevelt's America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great family film that's always a pleasure to watch especially during the holidays. From the cast to the costumes and sets, director Vincente Minnelli took great pains to make this film as true to life as possible.There are just some films you don't tire of seeing. Released in 1944, it stands the test of time and brings home a sense of nostalgia when viewed more than 60 years later.I'm a classics fan and most films today don't even begin to compare with the sincerity, the warmth, and class this film delivers. It was filmed when the Hollywood musical was king of the box office. I recommend it to anyone who wants a diversion from the extreme in-your-face forms of entertainment like Family Guy and Beavis and Butthead reruns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland at Her Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am only 14, however I am very well versed in older movies. One of my favorites is "Meet Me In St.Louis". Judy Garland's presence is amazing in this feature. She can steal a scene from almost everybody. One person where her presence was equaled, if not surpassed, was Margaret O'Brien. Miss O'Brien won a Juvenile Academy Award for her part as 'Tootie'. I found the love story between Esther and John quite believable, and the songs "Meet Me In St.Louis", "The Cake Walk", and "The Trolley Song", very enjoyable. It was wonderfully acted, and is one of those movies that just makes you feel good, and you can forget about your problems because of watching it. I liked the representation of the year, and I liked the Halloween scenes with Margarget O'Brien and how she was so proud of herself throwing the flour in Mr.Broakoff's (that may be spelled incorrectly) face. I also liked the sister relationships between Agnes and Tootie, and Rose and Esther. Katie the maid, played by Marjorie Main, was a riot, however I didn't like how she disappeared after the "Snowman Scene". Overall a wonderful '10 out of 10' movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clichés strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see.This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand a few people giving this film and Judy Garland such ugly reviews. Some people just hate anything old fashioned, I guess. This film is beautiful, and Judy Garland is gorgeous. Are a few people blind? And Judy's singing is absolutely wonderful. I must say though, that most reviews I've read, I've almost never seen anyone badmouth Judy, just on a couple reviews for this film. Other bad reviews I've read, people are usually picking at other things about Judy's films but are still saying they love Judy and her singing and they still think she's pretty. Anyway, enough about other reviewers. I think Judy is beyond pretty, she's beautiful and heavenly. And her singing is also beautiful and heavenly. I love old fashioned classics such as this film and Judy's other films. The wonderful songs in this film are "the trolley song", " the boy next door", "have yourself a merry little Christmas", and the title song. Judy and the other characters here are great including a very young Margerate O'Brien. This film and Judy are pure, sweet, wonderful, old fashioned, classic good cheer from Hollywood's golden age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Me in St. Louis is still one of the greatest movie musicals ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the third time I watched this particular movie and the reason I watched this just now was because it was Christmas and this film had the song "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" sung by Ms. Judy Garland to Margaret O'Brien. Because I knew this film was made in 1944, part of me wondered when that song was written with those lyrics (much different than the revised ones written for 1957 when Frank Sinatra sang it and others after him would follow suit) during that time whether it was meant to address the audience of that period of their worries of their loved ones being overseas during the holidays and their concern of them ever coming back to them in the future. Anyway, this is such an entertaining musical with such great comedy and drama from not only Ms. Garland and O'Brien but also Harry Davenport as the grandpa and Marjorie Main as the maid. The best sequence involves Ms. O'Brien going out alone on Halloween involving a prank that was common during the 1903 period. Oh, and Ms. Garland also did great numbers like "The Boy Next Door" and "The Trolley Song". Oh, and no wonder she married director Vincente Minnelli after making this as she gets some of her best close-ups here! So on that note, that's a high recommendation of Meet Me in St. Louis. P.S. Great intro on the DVD from Judy and Vincente's daughter Liza Minnelli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastically hokey but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Me in St. Louis is a rather ridiculous "good old days" movie. Told episodically, it focuses on a family's problems, which mainly involve daughters trying to get husbands and decisions on where to live.While silly, the movie has charm to spare, supplied mainly by the always riveting Judy Garland and by Margaret O'Brien, giving her best performance as an anti-Shirley Temple.O'Brien's performance is surprising. While most of the movie is artificial even by the standards of the times, O'Brien offers a surprisingly id-based child obsessed with death and provocation. It is far more real than the simpering children who inhabit most 40s films.While the story is slight, the movie gets buy on tremendous moments, all involving Garland and O'Brien, as when Garland's heartbreaking rendition of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is followed by O'Brien's surprising reaction.While it's no more realistic than Sleeping Beauty (even though Republicans often act as though this white, patriarchal, upper middle- class world is a thing we could actually "return" to), it is utterly charming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful, touching musical about a middle-class St. Louis family in the year leading up to the 1904 World's Fair. In particular the love lives of the two teenage daughters (Judy Garland, Lucille Bremer). While there are some great songs, including classics "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," there's much more to the movie than that. It's got a lot of heart with genuinely lovable characters that you actually care about. A lot of praise rightfully goes to Judy Garland and precocious Margaret O'Brien, but the rest of the cast is excellent as well. Especially good is Leon Ames as the father, probably my favorite role of his. It's an amazing film, enjoyable at Christmas or all year round. Wonderful early 20th century slice of life Americana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine relaxation of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review won't be long because I do not have too much to say about this movie. So here it is. "Meet Me in St. Louis" is about the Smith family that are living in St. Louis at the time of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's Fair in 1904. I don't find anything groundbreaking about this movie, because of the amount of praise it gets. Don't get me wrong, I like the movie but I don't think its a masterpiece or anything like that. For what it is, I think its fine and it is indeed watchable. The cast in this movie are good, especially for Judy Garland; although I like her more when she was in "The Wizard of Oz." I do love the film's cinematography and its setting. I really do enjoy the atmosphere of St. Louis as you go on out and have a wonderful time. The movie is also well directed and well written. The movie itself is not really a Christmas movie, but at the end, it does somehow leave you that Christmas feeling as Garland sings wonderfully with the song "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas;" the songs in the film are fine too. Again, there is nothing groundbreaking about it but I do think it is a fine relaxation of a movie as you just want to enjoy the atmosphere of St. Louis. So that is what I thought of "Meet Me in St. Louis," and I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion.It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.</fullReview>

She is a beautiful actress and singer. Her character is also very enjoyable. She is so poised and proper on one hand, and the other she is brave and strong. The scene where her character hits John shows how she stands up for what she believes in. After like a typical woman she goes back to him apologizing for falsely accusing him. Her character is one that many women can relate to in the fact shebelieves in finding true love. The children also brought humor into the film. They helped as a sort of comedic relief in many scenes, for example when the father announces the family will be moving again. The children are always telling wild stories and stretching the truth.

		<fullReview>Meet Me in St Louis was the second pairing of producer Arthur Freed and director Vincente Minnelli, but unlike their first collaboration on Cabin in the Sky, this time both appear to have hit their stride and made a mission statement on how a screen musical should be made.Meet Me in St Louis is sometimes wrongly identified as the first "integrated" musical ? that is, a musical in which the songs are part of the story rather than distinct interludes. However there were plenty before this, going back to 1929's The Love Parade, as well as the 1936 version of Showboat, the Disney features and of course the one everyone knows, The Wizard of Oz. In fact you could say that this picture is less integrated than many of those earlier musicals, as its score is cobbled together from a mix of new material and period songs ? few of which literally relate to the story in the way that say, Hammerstein's lyrics do.But Freed was after a different kind of integration. The exact lyrics do not really matter, it's how the placing of the song makes it part of the narrative. For example, look how the title song is used in the opening scene to introduce the family, moving from room to room and character to character, whilst simultaneously keying us into the mood of the picture. We also have "The Trolley Song" ? in itself a fairly meaningless ditty about riding a trolley and falling in love, but as the number plays out we see Judy Garland's disappointment that John Truett is not on board, followed by her rush of excitement to see him catch it at the last minute, which eventually turns to embarrassment as she doesn't know what to say to him. "The Trolley Song" is effectively a scene in its own right even though, apart from a few lines at the beginning, it has no dialogue. That is the Freed effect.Minnelli was perhaps the perfect director to work with Freed, and he had many of his own ideas about how a musical should be shot. In 1930s musicals, the songs were all too often shot and choreographed flatly, as if shooting a stage performance. When directors did experiment with a musical filming technique they tended to be either filling a unique niche (Busby Berkely) or they were making one-offs and never returned to the genre (James Whale in Showboat; King Vidor in the prologue of Wizard of Oz). Minnelli's approach is subtle, and yet it is so precise. In a slow song like "The Boy Next Door", he just gradually changes the framing around Judy Garland as the song moves from one verse to the next, in a similar way to how Vidor filmed her singing "Somewhere over the Rainbow". In a busy dance number like "Skip to My Lou" he keeps the camera moving in time with the music, following one dancer and then another as they take it in turns to pick up the song. The camera had not been so smoothly woven into the choreography since Busby Berkely's heyday in the early 1930s ? but the difference is that while Berkely's numbers were completely abstract, Minnelli's make sense as part of the scene.Perhaps the most pioneering moment in Meet Me in St Louis is his staging of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, which is even more restrained than "The Boy Next Door". The camera does not even move, although the shot changes a few times to give us close-ups at key moments. But Minnelli makes a subtle kind of choreography out of the smallest movements ? Judy Garland putting down the music box, then taking off her bonnet ? little actions that keep the number moving visually without being jarring or intrusive.Aside from the music, Minnelli had now developed into a competent and unique filmmaker. Of most obvious note is his exquisite shot composition and use of colour, which is extra special because whereas most directors would colour co-ordinate a set or an establishing shot, Minnelli plans the colour arrangements for wherever the actors are standing or the camera is pointing at any given moment. Then there is his handling of the Halloween segment. It's the dullest part of the picture because it is the longest break without a song, but at least Minnelli gives it its own character, showing the scenario with a child's eye view, and mixing stereotyped horror atmospherics with comedy.Of course Freed and Minnelli would be nowhere without their able collaborators. Ralph Blane, who actually had a longer career as a lyricist than as a musician, captures the spirit of the era with his original compositions. Judy Garland, despite being sick of playing teenage roles, shows a developing maturity and even displays a hint of the sass and cynicism that would later become her trademark. There isn't a single bad performance amongst the supporting cast, although the most enjoyable to watch are Harry Davenport and Margaret O'Brien ? probably the most talented child actress of her era.Meet Me in St Louis did very little that had not been done somewhere before, but nevertheless it is a landmark musical, but it helped establish the trend for all future screen musicals. It didn't mark the beginning of the integrated musical, but it marked the end of the non-integrated musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first combination between star Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli is a success as they tell the simple, yet elegant story about a family living in St. Louis in the early part of the twentieth century. What makes this such a classic musical is the fact that it is so fun to watch these characters go through trials and hardships because we know they will come out on top somehow. The Smith family is so likable and charming, we really get to know them and we feel the pain and happiness they go through. This is due mostly to the terrific cast, led by the incredibly talented Garland, who shines in every scene she is in. The supporting cast is stellar, but Margaret O'Brien as the youngest daughter, Tootie, almost steals the show in her small role. The sets are stunning as director Minnelli gives us beautiful settings for the look of the booming town of St. Louis in the early 1900s. There aren't too many songs as there are in other musicals, although there could have been more. What really makes this work as a film is the fact that it centers on the Smith family and their dedication to the rise of a town that wasn't too important at the time. It is a timeless tale of faithfulness and family and one of the best musicals in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the loveliest of all movie musicals...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair.One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Me In St. Louis is a "family values" exercise in traditional Americana.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Me In St. Louis is one of the most daring and poignant film musicals. There is convention: it moves along like family life - from one season to another, and the plot seems nothing more than the way young people in a large provincial town fall in and out of love, and the rather remorseless way in which marriage closes in on them. So this is, in fact, a picture made by some smart, cosmopolitan people about the abiding charm of home, stasis and the lack of alteration, none of which is particularly or famously American. Yet the best songs in the film - like 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' - are poised on the edge of loss. The enchanted moments, like the front parlour cakewalk, are tributes to nostalgia and the undying light of memory that sustains it. There are so many things to be enchanted by: the pretty tableaux that stride into life, the amber fall of Esther's hair, the songs, Judy, the vibrant colour, and Judy being gazed upon by director Vincente Minnelli for the summer in which there was nothing wrong or awkward. Of course, none of that lasted: the marriage, Judy and the Technicolor all perished. People usually pass over the stories that musicals are trying to tell; the appeal of the genre is in the songs and dance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream a Little Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dream of a movie, which is to say that it's as much like a dream as any movie I've ever seen. In this dream the world is a happy place, everyone is good, people only do kind deeds, lovers always come together, there is no deceit, only misunderstandings that are always resolved for the benefit of all concerned. It is a perfect movie, ravishingly, deliriously beautiful. Every time I visit it I'm smitten all over again. Judy singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" always breaks my heart. It's like a keepsake.All this sweetness and light is nicely balanced by Margaret O'Brien's portrayal of the little girl and her obsession with her dead - and buried - dolls. It's a delightful touch of ghoulish comedy - Margaret O'Brien really pulls it off, too (I also saw her, recently, in "The Secret Garden", and I was really impressed with her maturity and range in that film). In fact, the entire Hallowe'en sequence is a sheer phantasmagorical delight, perfectly capturing the illusions and imagination of childhood. I know someone who adamantly refuses to watch old movies. Not to seem smug or superior, but it's too bad, because experiencing the world from another time and place, spirit and mind-set, and marvelling at the beauty created by artists and technology of the past, are priceless. Movies can do that for you. So whenever I need to dream a little dream I pull out my copy of "Meet Me in St. Louis" or simply arrange to be home when it's playing on TCM. Then I move on with my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High budget chick flick for a war weary nation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Late Victorian turn of the century Americana was a favorite for the USA of the past, and still resonates with the WASPy population, myself included. This film shows us a slightly more innocent time in terms of the idealized family, and took the audience of 1944 away from the troubles of both European and Pacific theatres as the second world war was coming to a conclusion, and the foundations of the Cold War were being laid.The family is large, and weighty with estrogen. The token males are of course the father, the son who's barely visible in the entire film, and the grandfather who offers elderly wisdom and kindness not found in the immediate parent. In short, it's a chick-flick from the Golden Era of Hollywood, complete with a familiar backstage lined with Victorian homes.The film is a welcome sight for audiences who've had their share of high-budget teenage drivel that's been plastered on the screen the last 20 years. This film comes from a day and age when courting still commanded popular culture, and still held stalwart in said same culture. The faster paced life was not unknown, but properly shunned, and kept at a distance with ceremonial rituals designed to test the social mettle of suitors.Note the dancing scene, or the party scene, the eager yet restrained and conservative approach to two young hearts of the opposite sex approaching and testing one another. It gives a man confidence :-) I guess those days are still with us in some respect, but, it seems like they've all but vanished in a day and age when commitment means not getting divorced within the first five years of marriage.Back then it was a serious thing for a man to take a woman to his heart and home. It was a thing to be cherished and celebrated, not thrown into the popular den of sexual wolves. The sexual aspect was there, but it was held in a higher regard than it is today--a disposable commodity, which can only be detrimental to society. The focus was on the heart and feeling. From there all things are possible.The film focuses on the exploits of the daughters, but should draw laughs and "awwws" from both men and women. Judy Garland, the star, draws her share of attention and does not disappoint. What dude wouldn't fall for a girl like that? An idiot.True to Hollywood this film has a happy ending, but with a bit of a twist, as well as some religious symbolism at the end.No bullets, no bombs, no lurid shots of the female anatomy, this is definitely one for the ladies, but in my opinion it makes for a good date flick. Take your wife of many years out to the pictures again, and relive your courtship with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rousing musical study of a domestic family crisis...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEET ME IN ST LOUIS is a quaint, lush piece of work from musical director extraordinaire Vincente Minelli. Starring the lovely, young Judy Garland as Esther Smith, the movie traces the story of the Smiths as the two girls of the family try to land marriageable prospects, even as their father's (Leon Ames) decision to move the family out of the picturesque St Louis to New York threatens to tear their dreams asunder.The movie isn't particularly demanding or especially thought-provoking. In fact, it's little more than a slight family drama dressed up with some songs (albeit lovely ones, including the title song, The Boy Next Door, The Trolley Song, and breakout classic Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas). Garland is fresh and pretty in her role as Esther, and displays some of her surprisingly sharp comedic talent in a scene where, due to a misunderstanding, she (quite physically!) berates her beau John Truett (Tom Drake). At this point in her life and career, Garland's voice is unparalleled, and it's certainly put to good use in this movie. There's little doubt that this movie was plotted around her talents; she is without a doubt the star, although little Margaret O'Brien puts in a valiant, adorable performance as her mischievous sister Tootie, and Mary Astor and Ames do a good job of depicting a relationship that's, in the end, still founded on love. (Their duet 'You And I' is unusually affecting, given that all the other songs in the film are really just for Garland to show her stuff.) You can't be much blamed for not remembering a whole lot of this movie's plot when you're done watching it though. It's so slight as to be a little unremarkable in that respect. The movie, while not objectionable in any way, is certainly one of the lesser entries in the canons of both Minelli and Garland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck.There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story".All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again!As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making.About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing.Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Meet Me in St. Louis' is a film about a city and a film about a well-to-do family that live in the city and their lives. The film is a romantic musical with elaborate design, filmed in Technicolour. Judy Garland plays one of the daughters, and one of the most touching parts of this film is when she sings to her little sister Tootie 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' when the family are upset to learn that they may have to move from St. Louis to New York City. Ester (Garland's character) is striking up a romance with the guy next door, and romance is a very important part in this film. Tootie, the younger sister, is charming in her own way and sometimes steals the show. Good musical numbers and well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre though well-made musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Judy Garland was offered the part of Esther Smith in this film, she took it even though she thought her character was lifeless and childish. This turned out to be a good move for Garland, even though the whole movie did turn out to be a thoroughly vapid affair.The movie tells of the life of the Smith family in turn of the century St Louis through the seasons of the year. The Smiths are presented as the model all-American family going through all-American travails. Esther and her sister Rose spend their time chasing boys, their younger sisters frolic and play, and their father frets over making enough money. His decision to move to New York to take advantage of a job offer thereby disrupting his family's picture-perfect life forms the core of the film, along with Esther's romance with the "boy next door." In the end Rose and Esther get the boys they are each after, the father decides to stay in St. Louis, and the World's Fair comes to town, demonstrating that they don't have to go to a big city like New York to have enjoyable and accomplished lives.The movie was meant to be the ultimate escape, presenting an idealized, sentimentalized view of the American family during the hard times of World War II, a goal it accomplishes admirably well. Perhaps too well. The characters are oversentimentalized to the point of caricature, and the situations they find themselves in are usually dull or predictable. Though it is commendable for Hollywood to try to escape the then-predominant goal-and-obstacle formula, this film sorely needs a strong narrative to carry its paper-thin characters through its two hour length. The musical numbers are static and uninteresting to watch and do not make the film any better, even though some of the songs are quite good.The only things that make this film watchable are Margaret O'Brien's as well as Judy Garland's performance and Vincente Minnelli's direction. Like the bright pastel and candy colors the film employs, Meet Me in St. Louis oozes sicky-sweetness; watching it is like eating several pounds of skittles within two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Of A Chick Flick Than A Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a woman's movie, this classic is more appealing to a female than a male. It centers more on romances than on anything else, even though it's probably listed as a musical. Most of the characters, though, were interesting even to me: someone who doesn't like "chick flicks."Child actor Margaret O'Brien, in her first starring role, is okay but a little annoying with her emoting. She sure was a ham in her child acting career in the 1940s. Judy Garland, meanwhile, well.....I certainly can't knock her voice but she was too strange-looking. Perhaps it was her hairdo, which made the shape of her head look too triangular. She just looked odd.Leon Ames, as head "Mr. Alonzo Smith," of the household, played the most likable character, followed by Harry Davenport as the grandpa.As for the music, "The Trolley Song" was my favorite although I admit I found myself humming the title tune for several days after watching this. Although billed as a musical, the stories in here were played up much more than the songs, of which there were only a half dozen.The costuming of the ladies and of the period (turn of the 20th century) were beautiful, as was the Technicolor. If you enjoy color, this is pretty film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of the Most Memorable Scenes in Movie HIstory!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judy Garland has some of the most memorable scenes in movie history! Judy Sings "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" as a sad, sad reminder that her family will be moving to New York. When I first saw this movie, I was surprised that it was a HOLIDAY movie, a Christmas movie, because one wouldn't know from the title.This movie has incredible costumes, color is everywhere from the houses, to the horse and buggy, to the businesses. This movie makes you yearn for a more glamorous time and also a more simpler time where families really do bond and spend a lot of time together.This is one of the greatest musicals ever made. See Judy Garland in her prime with great performances of "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"This movie was a box office smash, breaking records at the time, rivaling Gone with the Wind.THE MUSICAL PERFORMANCES Boy, so many great performances in this movie.Judy Garland, this is her greatest performance in a movie since "The Wizard of Oz." "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" originated here, and has become a classic Christmas anthem. It has been sung a thousand times by a thousand artists, but no one could ever capture the heartfelt emotion expressed by Judy Garland in this movie. The song will bring tears to your eyes as you listen to her sing the song to little Tootie, trying to cheer her up but doing a terrible job of it.The funnest song in the history of movies is "The Trolley Song" ? you will have a ball watching it, and have a ball singing it to yourself in the shower. The fact that this scene was done in ONE TAKE is amazing. Just imagine how hard it would be to do this scene as perfectly as it turned out.The song "You and I" performed by Mary Astor and Leon Ames is truly magnificent. Just a wonderfully delightful performance with Him as the piano and Her shadowing him over his shoulder. Great harmonies.THE DIRECTOR Vincente Minnelli and Judy Garland met on this movie, and married soon afterwards. Minnelli is one of my favorite directors. He has a way with the camera especially in capturing a moment in a memorable way. This movie is in Color, and boy does he love to showcase a lot of color in this movie.SUMMARY Judy Garland never looked better in a movie, she is only 22 years old when she made this movie, and it really feels like she is having a lot of fun in this one. This heartwarming musical is a movie you will never tire of, it is one to watch at least once every year at Christmas (if not more often than that!). Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no place like home, Louis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. There are, even amongst otherwise intelligent movie lovers, those who proudly proclaim "I don't like musicals". It's a somewhat understandable stance since so many of this genre are simply a group of songs linked together by a thin story with uninteresting characters. However, when done well, the musical can be a most enjoyable, emotional and entertaining ride. One of the best and most beloved is director Vincente Minnelli's Meet Me in St. Louis.If you were making a musical in 1944, your dream cast would certainly include Judy Garland. She was 22 years old at the time, just a few years removed from her iconic role as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. Ms. Garland was desperately trying to break free of her "Oz" and "Andy Hardy" teenage ingénue image and transition to adult roles. In fact, she pushed back hard at MGM against being cast in this film. Because of this, she initially struggled with the character of Esther until finally grasping the tone that director Minnelli was after. The result is clearly one of her best performances, and maybe her most beautiful look ever on screen.The story is broken into four sections ? the four seasons leading up to the 1904 World's Fair to be held in St. Louis. The Smith family lives in a charming upper middle class Victorian home that serves as the centerpiece for most scenes ? especially the intricate, winding mahogany staircase, and the elaborate gaslight fixtures throughout. Mr. and Mrs Smith are played by Leon Ames and Mary Astor (known best for The Maltese Falcon). They are joined in the house by a son Lon (Henry H Daniels, Jr), four daughters (Rose ? Lucille Bremer, Esther ? Judy Garland, Agnes ? Joan Carroll, Tootie ? Margaret O'Brien), a spry grandfather (Harry Davenport), and wise-cracking housekeeper (Marjorie Main). The family dynamics are such that numerous sub-stories are constantly being juggled.There are numerous pieces and tidbits associated with this film, so let's discuss just a few. While audiences today may find 7 year old Margaret O'Brien's performance as the youngest daughter Tootie to be a bit over the top, she won an honorary Oscar that year as the Best Juvenile Actor. Two sequences in particular stand out: the quite dark and harsh Halloween portion which accurately displays the dangerous activities of that era (today's trick or treat seems quite tame), and the song and dance routine performed in the parlor while wearing a nightgown. This is also the film where director Vincente Minnelli and Judy Garland first met. They were married the following year and of course had a daughter, Liza Minnelli. All three were Oscar winners: Judy in 1940 for Best Juvenile Actor, Vincente for directing Gigi (1958), and Liza for Best Actress in Cabaret (1972).Sally Benson's series of short stories published in the New Yorker magazine inspired the film. The stories were based on Ms. Benson's childhood in St. Louis and she consulted on the script and set. In the movie, the Smith house is located at 1935 Kensington. For filming, the house was built on the MGM backlot on what became known as St. Louis Street. The street was used for many films, and the same house was used for the original Cheaper By the Dozen (1950). Sadly, the street fell into disrepair and was later destroyed and sold off by MGM (it's now condos and office buildings). Of course, this is a musical so the songs deserve mention. Many were original compositions for the film, including "The Trolley Song" (nominated for a Best Song Oscar) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", the latter showcasing Ms. Garland in peak singing voice. The film was a huge box office success and was nominated for four Oscars (no wins). The set design and costumes are extraordinary, and the story is quite affecting as it focuses on family and what makes a home so special. This is a wonderfully sentimental taste of Americana at the turn of the century, and one of the best examples of how effective a musical can be in telling a story and connecting an audience to the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nicely Leavened Holiday Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next to "Easter Parade", "Meet Me In St. Louis" is my favourite Judy Garland vehicle from the MGM film-factory days. Chock full of those freshly scrubbed, wholesome family values that Hollywood used to love to propagate (if not necessarily emulate), the picture is a warm, endearing fantasy with just enough realism to keep it out of the treacle jar. Opening in the summer of 1904, it starts innocently enough with Esther Smith (Judy Garland) mooning over boy next door John Truitt (Tom Drake), older sister Rose (Lucille Bremer) pining for Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully) with everyone happily laughing and singing about the impending world's fair coming to St. Louis next spring. So far, so predictably good. But then the plot gets seriously leavened as we are introduced to Tootie Smith (Margaret O'Brien), the youngest sister of the clan whose girlish pranks and blood-curdling prose mix a little comedy with some genuinely mean-spirited Halloween behavior that take us to the darker side of human nature, adding some much needed sinister malevolence when it is most needed. But there's more as the plot thickens still further when patriarch Alonzo Smith (Leon Ames) imperiously (albeit with the best of intentions) informs everyone, the day following Halloween, that the family is leaving St. Louis for New York. Initially laughed off, this unexpected announcement turns out to be one post-Halloween trick that is no treat as nobody, wife Anna (Mary Astor) included, is much amused. "I don't believe it!" "It's true: I'm to start the first of the year. We'll leave right after Christmas." With noteworthy attention to period detail, the film is brilliantly directed by Vincent Minnelli, trumpets some excellent acting from its ensemble cast, and includes an engaging Ralph Blane/Hugh Martin score that, for the first time in motion picture history integrates the songs directly into the plot, something pioneered for the stage a year earlier by Rodgers and Hammerstein when "Oklahoma" premiered on Broadway. Better yet, "Meet Me In St. Louis" also deftly combines Christmas candy and homespun virtue with the contemporary reality of the danger of making the business agenda, the bottom line, the sole arbitrator of what really counts, even if that wasn't the film's original purpose. Indeed, with the Smith's standing in for all of us, the movie is not just an enjoyable, warm/fuzzies romp through a bygone era. It is also a timely reminder that even the best of well intentioned actions can elicit unforeseen responses, that people, not impersonal automatons, are the final repository of all human actions, noble, imperious or mean-spirited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly the perfect musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM.But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma &amp; Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also.There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas".I rarely give an "8", but here's one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Meet Me in St. Louis"(1944) depicts a beautiful life where everything is vibrant and pristine while everyone depicted is as happy as can be, without a serious care in the world. This is an aesthetically attractive feel-good movie with surprisingly like-able characters (the fact that they all have porcelain complexions and glossy hair, doesn't hurt either.) They are like-able because though the girls (actresses Lucille Bremer and Judy Garland) spend inordinate amounts of the movie scheming for husbands and perfecting their looks they do so in the most innocent and modest of ways. Though their consumption with attaining a husband may be looked down in this day and age, the movie succeeds in capturing a picture of what life may have been like if you were white, rich and Midwestern during the epoch of the 1900s.The scenery in the movie is also enjoyable with bright colors, a plethora of starched taffeta gowns, lush green plants, everything is captured beautifully on screen. It's actually quite impressive considering the movie was made in the forties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful film about a year in the life of the Smith family leading to the 1904 World Fair in St. Louis. Filmed in gorgeous Techicolor, it is smoothly and lovingly directed by Minnelli. Garland, who would marry Minnelli soon after the film was completed, looks radiant and sings beautifully as one of the Smith children. She gets good support from Astor and Ames as the parents, Davenport as the grandfather, and Main as the family maid. O'Brien is made out to be a bit too cute as the baby of the family and her morbid sense of fun is somewhat disturbing, but she and Garland do a nice little number. In fact, all the songs are good in this charming musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judy Garland (star) and Vincente Minnelli (director) team-up for a classic MGM musical. Ms. Garland is the focus of the camera's attention as part of a sweet St. Louis family; with younger sister Margaret O'Brien following close behind. The other players are suitably supporting.The film is beautifully photographed, with extraordinary colorful sets and locations. This "Smith Family of St. Louis" is a studio "creation", and probably looks like no actual St. Louis town that ever existed; but, that is irrelevant. The film's musical numbers are very strong, with "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" my choice the highlight (it's nearer the end of the film). "The Trolley Song" and title song are not far behind. Garland performs them perfectly. I thought the song "You and I" was very much like the song "True Love"; it seems like one swiped the other.Ms. O'Brien is both sweet and tearful, holding her own with a stellar cast. She played the role wonderfully, but I was distracted by some of her character's actions. I have been through a lot of Halloweens, but never like the one O'Brien experiences. Perhaps that is how the evening was celebrated? I found it strange, even with her "bad girl" tendencies. Note also the film has a message curiously similar to "The Wizard of Oz".******** Meet Me in St. Louis (11/28/44) Vincente Minnelli ~ Judy Garland, Margaret O'Brien, Tom Drake, Mary Astor</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vividly Realized; Nostalgic Period Musical, Under Vincente Minnelli's Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Me in St. Louis won a tremendous popularity when it was released in WWII United States' movie houses. I do not find anything extraordinary about the film with the exception of three factors which I suggest contributed mightily to its success. The first is the phenomenally- consistent "period" feel of everything about this St. Louis based nostalgic musical's production--done on a California movie lot. The second is the direction of this rather claustrophobic production with such skill, based on his stage experience, that the director, Vincetne Minnelli, enabled his actors to seem to be moving naturally at all times. And the third is the film's unusually accurate dialog; the story line, drawn from author Sally Benson's own childhood but transferring to the Smith family's youngest child, herself, some actions which in reality were done by her older sister, has several drawbacks; the lugubrious little girl is demanding, gives her dolls funerals and general misbehaves rather frighteningly, her overstated part being the only major problem in the development of events. The scenario by Irving Brecher and Fred F. Finklehoffe seems to me to capture Benson's intentions very well indeed. The story of this film can be told in three negatives. The Smith family, living at the turn-of-the-century, complete a year of four seasons' worth of adventures, most of them inconclusive; the first 95% of the film is spent waiting for the St Louis World's Fair to be opened; and in the meanwhile, the entire family's busy lives of working, growing up, discovering love etc. are haunted by the threat of having to leave their smaller city and be moved to New York. Roger Edens and Arthur Freed produced this daunting work; and they commanded some of MGM Studios' finest talents to bring it to life in color on a movie screen. George Folsey as director of photography, Art Directors Lemuel Ayers, Cedric Gibbons and Jack Martin Smith translated Benson's book to the screen in what I consider to be memorable visual style. Famed Set Decorator Edwin B. Willis and Costume Designer Irene Sharaff produced professional and beautiful work that exceeded all expectations, according to many appreciators. In the music department of this tuneful narrative, the work of Roger Edens, orchestrator Conrad Salinger and George E. Stoll need to be recognized. Hugh Martin's contributions, including "The Trolley Song", add a great deal to a surprisingly effective score. Other featured songs include, "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and "Meet Me in St. Louie". But despite all these efforts on a highly professional level, the piece succeeds principally I assert because everyone in the cast enjoys, appreciates and contributes to the film's verve, pace and authority. Judy Garland has one of her best roles as Esther, second oldest of the Smith girls; her sisters are played by Lucille Bremer, Joan Carroll and overused Margaret O'Brien as the youngest, "Tootie". Harry Davenport seems touching as Grandpa, with fine support from noted character actors such as Chill Wills, Marjorie Main, June Lockhart, Henry H. Daniels as brother Lon, Robert Sully, Hugh Marlowe, and Donald Curtis. As the parents of four youngsters, Leon Ames and Mary Astor contribute very convincingly to the genial but Victorian feel of the work; they are even allowed to sing a lovely old-fashioned ballad. Tom Drake, as John, the boy Esther falls in love with, I find to be the vital center of the piece along with Garland; they are just different enough to be touching and interesting together in every scene they have. This in my judgment is not a great movie, owing to the weaknesses of the storyline; it is, however, a remarkably watchable and occasionally a memorable experience, the skills of whose makers render it in my opinion as beautiful as a remembered dream out of the American past; if for Minnelli's direction alone, the cohesion and taste he brings to every moment, it deserves more than one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plucky family film with music...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turn-of-the-century musical from MGM has sisters in St. Louis pining for romance, planning dates for the big dance, and surviving the tumultuous holidays. Based on Sally Benson's stories, this glossy production has become a year's-end perennial for many movie buffs, and has a colorful, amusing familial unit at the story's center. The episodic structure, and the somewhat slack finish (which seems a little cheap, allowing us no more than a glimpse of the World's Fair the family's been eagerly anticipating), do not intrude on Judy Garland's starring performance, and her song numbers ("The Trolley Song", "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", "The Boy Next Door") are thrilling. Margaret O'Brien won a special Oscar for Outstanding Juvenile Performer of 1944, largely on the strength of her work here as Garland's feisty kid sis. Good fun! *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet you in St. Louis? No problem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Judy Garland musical might be most famous for either 'The Trolley Song' (to this day I see comedians reference it. Spouse saying something that the comedian doesn't want to hear? Hands over the ears and they start yelling 'CLANG CLANG CLANG WENT THE TROLLEY!'), or perhaps for 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,' perhaps for the very beautiful title song, or perhaps as the musical where Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli fell in love. Whatever reason for its fame, 'Meet Me In St.Louis' is a wonderful musical that sits in the upper ranks of the genre.The story is about a St.Louis family and one year in their lives. Their dramas range from the daughters trying to meet boys, to pranking the 'meanest' neighbor on Halloween, to the more serious drama of whether the family should move to New York in order to pursue a much higher profile and higher paying job for the father. The story moves at a leisurely but not unenjoyable pace through each of the four seasons and ends with winter and the convenient resolution of all these dramas.I have a hard time not loving Judy Garland on screen and she's very good here. She headlined the film, although she did receive reliable and strong support from Leon Ames, Mary Astor, Lucille Bremer, Chill Wills and Harry Davenport. Judy Garland had some misgivings about being in this film. She was 21 and didn't want to play teenagers anymore but had also been advised by Joesph Mankiewicz that the best part in the film would belong to youngest sister 'Tootie.' Although MGM did ultimately convince Garland to be part of the film, Mankiewicz's prediction came true -- 'Meet Me in St. Louis' gave 7 year old Margaret O'Brien an honourary Academy Award in the Juvenille category and solidified her position as a major child star for the 1940's.Great songs, Judy Garland, strong performances, a sweet and charming story line; these things make 'Meet Me In St. Louis' well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enchanting Insightful, Harmonious ? An Empathetic, Patriotic Musical on Family Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Minnelli's portrait on the highs and lows of an affluent household in St. Louis is so tenderly remembered for its expressive combination of tragic melodrama and delightful musical numbers. MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS also reminisces the irresistible nostalgic charm of ingénue Judy Garland, who grounds the film with such confident optimism while singing several striking show-tunes.Crafted in 1944, the plot in this film would later become the foundation for many perky much more contemporary movies and TV episodes. Children having to move away, a girl falling in love with the next-door-neighbor, a kid yearning to play with the bigger people...all have been used so frequently in the media that the ideas have become totally clichéd. However, what truly distinguishes this from all the others is its psychological study on family structure. It evidently shows the actions, traits and behavior that mutually unite people living under the same roof. For a musical, this film carries an incredible amount of symbolism. Undoubtedly, the most poignant sequence in the movie was Tootsie's (adorable Margaret O'Brien) destruction of her snow people?a sign of her fury and hatred toward her real family. Another tremendous representation utilized in the picture was its accommodating image of America depicted towards the end in the World's Fair, a minor but nonetheless significant reference.Perhaps the most notable aspect of the film for most people is the charismatic appeal of the legendary Judy Garland and its incorporation of remarkable music. After all, this was the film where Garland looked fondly out the window belting out "The Boy Next Door". What about the endearing scene where Tootsie and Esther (Judy's character) danced to "Under the Bamboo Tree"? Everyone has been moved by Esther's heartbreaking rendition of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". However, the most popular, cherished number is arguably the colorfully show-stopping high point, "The Trolley Song" (Klang, Klang, Klang went the trolley...) with Garland in a bus full of animated passengers. Every member of the supporting cast is just as captivating: Leon Ames as the stubborn father, Mary Astor as the suffering housewife, O'Brien, June Lockhart and Lucille Brenner as the daughters, Hank Daniels as the son, Harry Davenport as the volatile grandpa and Marjorie Main as the maid.Since its release, this innovative picture has truly become a landmark musical. It broke new grounds giving fewer restrictions for modern family films rather than becoming some sort of unlikely fantasy fluff musical. MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS introduced domestic conflict to the celluloid, a topic that would forever reverberate beyond the walls of American cinema. This is without doubt essential to every fan of musicals. Even the average person would find this film certainly satisfying or entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely, Heart-Warming Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank you, TCM. This was the perfect movie for the holiday season. I really looked forward to Judy singing "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas." She wore a beautiful, stunning red velvet dress (the pattern was similar to my own wedding gown which I made, only in cream satin) and little Tootie was so sweet playing with the monkey (I think) musical toy. The song is always repairing whatever is wrong with our hearts or our lives at the time, and tears come even more -- every time I hear her sing this. I was also looking forward to the angst-ridding maneuver of Tootie batting the snow-persons our of their misery; getting rid of her bottled up anger. Rose is so sweet; trying to be so sophisticated. Too bad they tried to get girls married off too young in those days. Nowdays, young women go to college, and marriage is way off in the distant future.The cakewalk song had racist connotations, as if the lovers in the song were going to cohabitate under the bamboo tree or were they really going to get married with the benefit of clergy according to the mores of early 20th century America? The lovers were "of dusky shade", which seemed to connote supposed moral superiority on the part of the singers of the song or at least the lyricist. That time period reminds one of minstrelsy, another post-Civil War (late 19th and early 20th centuries) white people's parody of African-American culture. "I like-a-you and you like-a-me. I'm gonna change your na-a-ame." The lovers were of royal blood. Wouldn't the lyricist have them speak in better English? No. It was fashionable at the time to have black people and Native Americans depicted as less intelligent than "those white folks".Tootie talking about her dead dolls was so disturbing. Some were even buried in the ground. Her Halloween scenes were quite unusual too, what with the neighborhood kids divvying up who was gonna scare and "kill" which grownups. Their costumes were strange, too, as I noticed the boys dressed as women, and the girls dressed as male hobos and bums. I think Margaret O'Brien was around eight years old in this movie, but the character was five years old. Margaret was too big and too intelligent to be age five here. That part was not convincing. LOL.The family is all musical. Lon is so nice to the girls. As usual, Marjorie Main is wonderful in the part of the maid-cook-whatever. She and Mrs. Smith organizing the ketchup-making scene is such a hoot, and of course Grandpa has to have his authoritative taste-test. The Dad is a pushover deep down, pretending to give the family what they don't want (I would want it, though) - the move to NYC - and yet knowing that their lives are forever interwoven into their old community. Grandpa and John and the tuxedo situation are so cool. The goofy boys dancing with Judy at the ball are so outrageous -- the large boy, the small boy and the tall boy who thought the ballroom was a speedway. Of course, they are not the *boy next door*. Did I see June Lockhart in this movie? She was stunning. Did I leave anybody out? The girls on the trolley were neat, and I think one was Julie Newmar (??). Esther and John both pretending to need help turning out the lights in the house was so precious.Ah, we get older, but we always love the nostalgia, and somehow these characters seem younger and younger -- even Grandpa. Wish Esther could have gone to college too, and made *the boy next door* wait for her. LOL. I love all the songs, and of course the dancing. Anyone who reads my other reviews knows that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy and Vincente at their best....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS is a colorful and entertaining 1944 musical surrounding the oh-so-simple events in the life of the Smith family, in St. Louis, excited about having the World's Fair come to their sleepy little hamlet but worried about their impending move from St. Louis due to Mr. Smith's job transferring him away from their beloved home. Judy Garland was at her career peak and never looked more beautiful on screen than here portraying the second eldest Smith daughter, Esther, trying to deal with the idea of moving from St. Louis just when she has found love with the boy next door (the forever bland Tom Drake). Leon Ames and Mary Astor offer strong support as Esther's parents and Margaret O'Brien steals every scene she's in as youngest Smith daughter Tootie. A meticulously crafted film, with Judy offering three of her finest song performances with "The Trolley Song","The Boy Next Door" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas." Her duet with O'Brien, "Under the Bamboo Tree" is also a delight. This was the film that first brought Judy Garland together with 2nd husband Vincente Minnelli and his love for her is evident here...this film is Vincente's exquisite valentine to Judy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Me In St. Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Me In St. Louis is from 1944. It's a story which happens in St. Louis in the year leading up to the World Fair held there sometime in the past. The exact year is irrelevant, and I cannot be bothered to look it up. It follows the story of a family embarking on all sorts of every-day adventures, such as the little girl's first Hallow's Eve, the slightly elder girl's problems with having a little sister, the two oldest sisters' problems with young men, and ketchup-making. Also the father's dilemma of being successful and getting a job in New York, thus disrupting the happy family's "small-city" life, or continuing to be only successful in St. Louis. Not much is to be said about the plot besides that. This movie has Judy Garland. And singing. And dancing. Of course. It's stupid. It's clever. It's silly. It's fun. Yes, there is a boy-meets-girl plot here. Yes, there is a girl-almost-misses-out-on-boy plot. And it's perfectly okay. Because it's fun. And that is the essence of a musical. To be fun. That doesn't mean it's only "fun", and nothing more to be said about it. It does involve some technical innovations, like the "crane dolly" (I think that's what it's called), a clever little thing that allowed the camera to move and rotate in any direction. It's not exactly Bullet-Time, but still quite clever, especially for filming choreographed dance sequences. Like so many films from this era, it is greatly superior to many films of today (with the exception of Tarantino and a few other masters of film conversation) in terms of conversation. It's wit is a delight at times, and some scenes are what they are simply because of the sense of ingenious dialogue. The singing and dancing is seamlessly constructed and choreographed. They're diegetic (serve the advancement of the film's plot, instead of simply being a gratuitous musical scene, like in most musical in the late 1920's and early 1930's). And now for the shortcomings. It is a bit corny at times, but I'm not sure if it's because it's truly corny or if I've just seen it in so many films made *after* this film was made. I really like Judy Garland, unlike many of my colleagues. In this film, though, I did get a slight feeling of frustration with her, but not for too long though. It might be that I felt this way about her character because *she* felt this way about her character, which she apparently did. It's completely and utterly predictable, with only a couple of exceptions, which don't exactly have anything to do with the main plot, but more like subplots or deviations from the story. But that's okay, because this is a musical. In all, Meet Me In St. Louis is a fine film, I'll rate it at around 4 out of 5.Useless ps. A song in this film is called "Skip To My Lou". That is also the nickname of an NBA player, Rafer Alston, who now plays for the Houston Rockets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endlessly Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film twice now and fortunately both times it was on the big screen with a theater packed with people (just as the movie making gods intended). As I was driving to the film last night for my second viewing of it, I was trying to remember the plot and I couldn't really recall it. A few minutes into the movie I realized I couldn't remember the plot because there really isn't much of a plot to remember. Despite the lack of plot -- even by musical standards -- this movie never really drags and is quite entertaining. Besides the musical numbers, it is fun to watch the interaction of all the family members. The character of "Tootie" has a wickedly gleeful edge to her that is rarely found in child parts, and is but one of many elements that makes "Meet Me In St. Louis" a classic film. When the film ended last night the entire audience applauded, and deservedly so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a good cast, a worthwhile story, and some fine musical numbers, this is a very enjoyable and pleasant classic that is worth seeing more than once. While in one sense it is nostalgic, it really just recognizes some of the things that are the most meaningful in (family) life, regardless of the era. At least for those who enjoy classic cinema, "Meet Me In St. Louis" would be a very hard movie not to like.This is probably one of Judy Garland's best roles, and she gets a good variety of material to work with. A couple of the musical numbers stick with you after the movie is over, both because of Garland's singing and because of how well the songs themselves were written. Garland also gives a lot of life to her fairly straightforward character. Several others in the cast are good also, but it is Margaret O'Brien who is the most unforgettable, giving one of the finest of all performances by such a young performer.The story-line is generally overshadowed by the musical numbers, but it also works in itself. The plot deals with the kind of simple family questions that are usually only of importance to those directly involved, yet the film makes the family's needs and concerns believable enough that you want to see how things will work out. The story is generally upbeat, but it also has some serious moments that work very well. The structure around the four seasons works well, and it sets up some good material. Overall, "Meet Me In St. Louis" is an enjoyable and well-crafted musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully filmed in Technicolor with lovely costumes and songs, this film is a visual and oral feast. I have known the songs for many years and have only one regret - that is the title theme "Meet Me In St Louis, Louis" is not actually sung to its full length in the film although it does exist as a musical recording. I bet most people have never noticed this ! In the film Judy Garland starts to sing part of it with her sister on the piano, but the song is interrupted half way thru by their father's coming home ! Most Annoying !That apart, the other numbers and sets are magnificent. The script is of course limited in scope but that is more than made up for by all the rest. I highly recommed the R1 dvd which has just been issued as there is in addition a "Music Only" track, a feature which for some stranger reason is all too infrequent on dvd's for the time being. There are also documentaries which enable us to learn a bit more about the making of the film.Last but not least we have the subliminal beauty of Judy Garland plus her lovely voice...........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meet me in St.Loius-- the movie is about the life of a well established St. Louis family named Smith. The family has four daughters named Rose (Lucille Bremer), Esther (Judy Garland), Agnes (Joan Carroll), and Tootie (Margaret O'Brien). The second oldest child falls Esther in love with the boy next door. John Truett (Tom Drake) by name. He is standing on the lawn next door while Esther is on her front porch. In autumn the girls prepare Tootie and Agnes for trick or treating. They meet at a bonfire and decide which house each child is to take. Tootie decides to take the hardest Mr.Braukoff's (Mayo Newhall). She goes to the front porch and knocks on the door and when he opens the door Tootie throws flour in his face and declares that he is dead. `I killed him' she exclaims.All at once, the father (Leon Ames) enters the room and announces that he has received a position in New York and they will be moving after Christmas.Everyone is up in a roar because they don't want to leave their friends, especially Esther who has finally made the boy next door notice her. At the winter dance, she awaits John but, where is he? John didn't get his suit before the dry cleaners closed, so he borrows one and finally shows up. Esther tells him about having to leave St. Louis, and John tells her it will be okay that they will always love each other. As he walks her home under a snowy moonlight sky, John asks Esther to be his bride. Esther says "I have dreamed of this moment for so long.' Tootie waits at the window for Santa to arrive; she is worried that Santa won't be able to find her next year. Esther comforts her little sister and sings `Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'. Tootie is traumatized by the thought of moving that she runs out into the snow and smashes her snow people and the family don't know how to calm her. The doctor comes and they finally calm her and father starts to realize that moving is too hard for his family: he decides to stay in St.Loius. The last scene shows the Smith family and John at the Worlds Fair: And Esther exclaims `Oh, isn't it breathtaking, John! I never dreamed anything could be so beautiful. I can't believe it. Right here where we live, Right here in St.Loius.' The director Vincete Minnelli moves this family through the day to day life crisis that all families have to face. The movie is a brilliant form of life and music combined to a dramatic conclusion. This reviewer gives it a four star rating. </fullReview>

Judy of course was absolutely marvellous, and a prize performance from a very young Margaret O'Brien. The story is one which dates but little and the actors portray their characters very well.

		<fullReview>It's interesting to hear from someone who talks about the "ugliness" of the people in this cast. He says she wasn't pretty and didn't have a good voice. If anything, this entire movie counters ugliness. The hearts of the characters, the wonderful mixture of personalities, the songs, which are unique and gentle, were there to counteract the sadness of wartime. Margaret O'Brien gives one of the greatest child performances ever. Her face is so expressive and her precociousness is not offensive. She delights in life in one way--yet has the morbid side to her. Nothing in this movie is anything serious or earth shattering, yet it is about love and about roots and about basic human kindness. No, it isn't a dramatic masterpiece but it deserves a lot. When I heard Judy Garland sing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" to the sad little Margaret O'Brien, my heart melted. The bittersweetness of the song has stayed with me for the twenty years since I first saw this movie. The movie is uplifting and about what is truly valuable in life. Maybe I'm being sentimental, but this is one of those efforts that allows us to feel a little sad, a little happy, and think about the way the world should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another hypnotizing Vincente Minnelli movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944) 8.5/10Vincent Minnelli isn't by all means my favorite director, not even the best director of musicals, but all his films I've seen seemed to hypnotize me. They are magical, colorful, funny and pleasant. The 20 minute dance sequence of AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, the innocence of GIGI, the situations that Spencer Tracy has to handle in FATHER OF THE BRIDE aren't really touches of genius, but come from someone who knows the magic of cinema. MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS is probably his most pleasant film to watch, probably because it mixes all the elements that would please parents and children of the '40s: vivid colors, friendly songs, a story that comes from the heart, a smart child and most of all Judy Garland. This is among her best performances, along with THE WIZARD OF OZ and A STAR IS BORN. She is cute (though not gorgeous), bright, expansive and charismatic. Although she is not my favorite actress, not even my favorite musical actress, she caught me here. The real star, however, is Margaret O'Brien, who plays Tootie- she steals every scene she's in, putting on shame veterans like Mary Astor. MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS is a great musical, the perfect film to watch with your whole family. Your 5 year-old cousin and your 80 year-old grandmother will like it the same way. It's a fine slice of Americana, but if you want something to mess up your wind... see MAGNOLIA or REQUIEM FOR A DREAM instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder why the user below felt the need to criticize this film not once, but twice. Strange.At any rate, I couldn't allow those negative and misleading comments to be the first read by those who haven't seen "Meet Me in St. Louis". This movie is NOT plotless, obnoxious or racist."Meet Me in St. Louis" is what is sometimes called a "slice of life" story. Basically, it tells the story of one year (1903-1904) in the lives of the Smith family. What gives the story its charm is that everyday yearnings and incidents become the stuff of major drama, just as they do in real life. Older sister Esther (the wonderful Judy Garland) is determined to get the attention of the object of her affections, the boy next door (Tom Drake). Youngest sister Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) uses Halloween to prove that she can be a mischief-maker on a level with the older kids.Taken by themselves, neither of these events seems terribly exciting. What is great about "Meet Me in St. Louis", however, is that it gives these events the importance that they hold in the minds of the characters. As Esther sings in "The Trolley Song": "As he started to go, then I started to know how it feels when the universe reels!"Most of us will never rule a nation or go on a great adventure. But we can all identify with what it's like to be seventeen, NEEDING to win the love of your crush. Or when you're five and MUST prove that you're not a baby anymore. This is why this film is so beloved and timeless.As to the criticisms levelled at the color-saturation, I saw this as a way of showing how we always see our youth as a bright place. Don't we tend to imagine our youth as brighter, sunnier and more colorful than it actually was? And as for the songs...well, if you can't appreciate and enjoy songs like "The Trolley Song", "The Boy Next Door" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", I feel sorry for you. No one sings "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" with the yearning and pain that Judy gives the song. And "The Trolley Song" makes me smile every time I hear it.It's true that "Meet Me in St. Louis" isn't for everyone. The overly-cynical and pessimistic probably won't enjoy it at all. But for those of us who like to look back and smile on our youth and escape to a less-complicated world for a couple of hours, there's no place like St. Louis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meet Me in St. Louis was one of my favourite movies as a kid. It's about an American family that lives in St. Louis and awaits the World's Fair (all except for the father). I loved all the singing, and the different situations. I also liked how they showed how the seasons passed.The best part of the movie was probably "The Trolley Scene" or when the family had a party.Of course, this movie sure showcases Judy Garland and shows how much of a gem she is, but it also is wonderful for all the other actors, as they are just as great.Meet Me in St. Louis is a fun song and dance movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be on of Judy Garland's best movies. Her performance as the young Esther Smith is simply wonderful and she looks lovely. The songs are all catchy and the supporting cast are excellent. One interesting peice of trivia is that the words to 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas' originally were: "Have yourself a merry little christmas/it may be your last/next year we'll all be living in the past" but were changed it to "Let your heart be light/next year all our troubles will be out of sight" by Judy because she felt the song was sad enough already. This was appropiate because the film was released just before the end of World War two.</fullReview>

I'd like to pinpoint an overlooked subtext in it: the schizophrenic twist. Just a hint of it: Tootie is a lovely little girl, a murderer, a sadist and a morbid soul. That is shown in complacent ways. The trolley accident she causes is not shown: we hear of it. And the other characters are also vile creatures: take Esther and the ball carnet filled with the names of the local freaks. It is only too emblematic that Halloween is their celebration of preference. There is too much too be said about this masterpiece in too narrow a space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic Hollywood musical from the great Freed/Minelli team, replete with a number of classic show-stopping tunes still with us today. It's very easy to attack the film today for its over-sentimentalised picture of family life in turn of the century America but given its genesis in 1944 when the Allied Forces were still trying to win the war against Germany and Japan (I'm writing this coincidentally on remembrance Sunday), its admittedly overdone message of home town loyalty and family life still strikes a chord.Yes, you may have a job uncurling your toes after watching the antics of infant-terrible Toots (surely no-one calls their offspring by a name like this, even in America) - her Hallowe'en "adventure" in particular is excruciatingly embarrassing to witness and worse, takes up a good ten minutes or so which could have been filled by another song. And what songs..."The Boy Next Door", "The Trolley Song", "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" (lovely to hear this as the festive season beckons) and of course the title song itself.The story takes us through a year in the lives of the family and each quarter is cleverly kicked off with a picture-postcard still coming to life, effortlessly drawing the viewer into the fantasy. Brat apart, the rest of the family are likable enough if too much this side of the unctuous-o-meter. Judy Garland shines far above the rest with a less sentimental approach to the gloopy material, at the same time looking healthy and pretty and singing as only she can.The ending of course is never in doubt, with everybody living happily ever after. I'll remember it more for the set-pieces which drape those wonderful songs, although Minelli's camera-work is a wonder throughout, imbuing the whole with a magical colour and light you simply don't see nowadays. If only they'd inserted "Toot Toot Tootsy Goodbye..." into the song-list!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within its genre this is simply a great movie to watch. It's a random slice of life that concentrates on a 'random' everyday family living in St. Louis, in the early 20th century. A real 'Americana' movie. It has all of the ingredients you could expect from a movie like this; drama, romance, comedy and basically everything in between.But above all its a cheerful movie. After all it's a Vincente Minnelli musical, even though the movie is not filled with songs every 10 minutes. Nevertheless the songs that the movie does feature are magnificent and make the movie joyful to watch and gives it a lot of heart and color.It's a great looking movie, that got shot completely in color. Early color movies from the '40's are often very bright because of their very vivid colors. It's doesn't always look too well by todays standards but in this particular case it works out greatly for the overall movie its feeling and atmosphere.It's mostly a character driven movie, fore the story itself is of course quite formulaic for its genre but good and effective nevertheless, that has some nice themes in it, which get handled even better by the movie. The movie is filled with some great characters and the family gets portrayed nicely within the movie. It's a fine movie for Judy Garland, who looks great in this movie. It was the first movie she and director Vincente Minnelli did together. Shortly after finishing this movie they also got married together. I think its fair to say that their first movie was also the best one they did together, even though I haven't seen all of them yet.There are a lot of musicals set in the same time period as this movie. I however feel that this movie in particular does a great job capturing the particular time period. with its costumes, sets, props settings, etcetera. It's a professional looking movie that got greatly put together, with some nice directing and editing. It's a well paced movie, which helps to make this a pleasant watch but not without being effective with its more dramatic themes as well.Simply a great movie to watch!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>masterpiece of American cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm very fond of this movie, and rate it highly, I can see why it might not be to everyone's taste. The values it appears to espouse, and to imply are universal, are underpinned by other, unspoken principals that today might stick in the craw. For example, although there are no black faces in the film, "Skip to my Lou" and "Under the Bamboo Tree" both refer in an unthinking and somewhat patronising way to non-white cultures. On a different critical tack, none of women in the film show the slightest inclination to move beyond the home. You might reply to these criticisms, with justification, that they err in applying liberal stances of our own day to those of both St Louis 1903 and Hollywood 1944. But, as I say, I can see the objections.Nonetheless, I am both impressed and moved whenever I watch Meet Me In St Louis. Impressed by the beautiful camera-work, the splendidly crafted sets and costumes, and the excellent performances. Moved by the result of the underlying structure, taking us through a year from one Spring to another, through the fear of encroaching night of Autumn, into the darkness of Winter, and out the other side. And moved, too, by the honour of the characters. When June Lockhart's Lucille Ballard turns out to be the very opposite of the Smith girls' vision of an East Coast snob, they are forced to change their unworthy little plan. The ensuing scene is one of the highlights of the picture for me, as Judy Garland's Esther, put on the spot by her grandfather (wonderful Harry Davenport), pays the price for her and her sister's meanness of spirit, and is rewarded by the unexpected appearance of her true love.Yes, maybe these comfortable people in their big house can afford to be big-hearted. But that's the way symbolic drama has always worked: Oedipus and Lear are kings so that their fall is all the greater. This is the key to the inevitably more modest Meet Me In St Louis, but nonetheless the film is amazingly ambitious on its own terms, and teaches its moral lessons well, particularly so in the ballroom episode I've described above, but elsewhere too: for example, when Leon Ames's Alonzo witnesses his youngest daughter's extreme distress at the thought of leaving St Louis, and finds a way out of the situation in which he has dumped himself and his family, and thus demoting the economic values he has put before the happiness of his nearest and dearest.But it isn't all morals. The emotional heart of Meet Me In St Louis is the relationship between sisters Esther and Tootie, played by the headliners Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien. This finds its climax in the heart-rending "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", which I have watched through tears on many occasions. Situated in the depths of winter, it is a lament for hope defeated by loss, simply filmed, magnificently acted - especially by the amazing O'Brien - and perfect in every way.Don't let my 8 out of 10 fool you: Meet Me In St Louis is a wonderful piece of work. I concede the two points firstly because "Skip to my Lou", which does nothing for the story, should have been completely re-thought or, ideally, cut; and secondly because, in the 21st century, the idealisation of the family's world has lost some of its power - especially when you consider author Sally Benson made her screen debut a year earlier working on the dialogue for a somewhat more critical celebration of mid-West life, Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. As we've seen, it's not as if darkness doesn't inhabit the world of Meet Me In St Louis, in particular that of Tootie, who imagines she has killed someone, that someone has tried to kill her, that Katie the maid (the incomparable Marjorie Main) has killed her cat, and so on. But today the no-place-like-home/love-conquers-all message of this wartime fantasy, no matter how brilliantly it is realised, sits as uneasily with us as, say, Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew does.The fact that I can happily discuss Meet Me In St Louis in the same breath as great works of drama demonstrates to me that whatever reservations I, or others, may have, it is still a magnificent achievement, and an undoubted masterpiece of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't got around to seeing this film, despite it's high reputation and the presence of Garland, but now I have - I'm just a bit disappointed. It is far too saccharine and drags when the musical numbers have gone by (the songs are fine, The Trolley Song, The Boy Next Door, Have Yourself A Very Merry Christmas ...), and Margaret O'Brien, good though she was, is very irritating and I don't have much goodwill left for her by the end of the film! Lucille Bremer makes a colourless elder sister, Judy Garland seems a little old to be skipping about and fighting with boys. Leon Ames and Mary Astor are good as the parents, however (they even sing duet at the piano, how civilised this family are!). Harry Davenport is reliable as ever as grandpa, and Marjorie Main does a little scene stealing in her usual way as Katie the maid. I just can't understand what Esther/Judy sees in the boy next door! Tom Drake sadly has the charisma of a wet fish. I'd file this film as hit and miss. As far as the St Louis' 'fair' goes, once we get to it, I'd much rather have the fairground in 1945's 'State Fair', and the spirit of that film too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very sweet musical starring Judy Garland. The plot concerns a family living in St. Louis whose patriarch has accepted a job in New York City. His family is devastated. The two oldest daughters both have beaus, and the oldest son has a girl as well. The plot is passable. If it weren't for the exceptional songs, the film would have been almost entirely forgettable. Even as it is, I doubt I'll remember much beyond "The Trolley Song" tomorrow morning. It shoots itself in the foot; all but one of the songs are front-loaded onto the first half of the film, with only one (albeit a great one, "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas") occurring in the last fifty minutes. Because of this, the film often seems uneven. Although Meet Me in St. Louis is one of the best remembered of the classic era of musicals, Minnelli made many better films. He's only able to pull a couple of non-musical rabbits out of his hat. As for the acting, it's decent. Judy Garland is as beautiful as ever, but I found her character fairly uninteresting. Just another one of those musical heroines who wants nothing more than to be courted. The biggest joy of the film comes from the two youngest daughters, played wonderfully by Joan Carroll and Margaret O'Brien (the latter won a special - and much deserved - Oscar for best child actress of the year). Together they have a morbid fascination with death and murder, a touch that might have been more at place in a Hitchcock film. Well, it still works wonders here! 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of MGM's greatest musicals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe Judy tried to dump the project when the people at MGM bought "Kensington Stories" believing it to have potential as a new Judy Garland musical vehicle. Wanting to prove herself capable outside the child roles which had made her so famous, it had been a long time before she began to get the first of the adult roles she wanted. "For Me and My Gal", the film which also marked the movie debut of Gene Kelly is the most memorable of the first of her adult roles. Even her Mother, who Judy saw as the 'real wicked witch of the west' backed her up in trying to get out of the musical commitment.Thank goodness Judy played Esther. It is a role that seems to be tailor made for her, because she plays it so perfectly. It was a role that eventually became one of her favourites. Alongside her, a great supporting cast shines. Veterans Leon Ames and Mary Astor, as Esther's parents, and others, including Margaret O'Brien, Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake, relative newcomers, whose work in this film will be remembered. Margaret O'Brien is great as Tootie, however annoying she may look in pigtails. Lucille Bremer, as Rose is one of the best performers of the movie, but unfortunately, at a studio like MGM already overflowing with Hollywood's top stars, she did not receive as much attention to her talents, and probably did not become as famous as she may have.The songs are completely addictive. I got myself a copy of the soundtrack last year. Along with an excellent score, songs include "The Boy Next Door", the title track, and the song Judy immortalised forever "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", a heartbreaking rendition of reassurance. Somehow, the film makes the old classic children oriented song "Skip to My Lou" seem refreshed. The highlight was the current hit of the moment, "The Trolley Song". On a $200 000 set of the St. Louis street on which the trolley runs, it is there that Judy performs one of the gems of her great career.An outtake from the film was "Girls and Boys Like You and Me". It originally came from the Rodgers and Hammerstein debut "Oklahoma!" and was tried in a couple of other MGM musicals including the Frank Sinatra vehicle "Take Me Out to the Ball Game". All ended up on the cutting room floor, until it was somehow turned into a ballad by Rodgers and Hammerstein for their television adapted version of "Cinderella". The story of middle class life in St. Louis becomes a little slight. But with the screenplay fitting, all is adequate. This is Vincente Minnelli's masterpiece, even more enjoyable than "American in Paris", and especially better than "Gigi". But the musical, a real family treat, is more than just another "Christmas" film. It cannot be expected to live up to the same season feel as "It's a Wonderful Life" but that's in part due to the fact the movie follows a whole year. Unforgettable things occur at Halloween too, which could very well eclipse Christmas time.But in technicolour splendour and an unforgettable drawing power charisma, "Meet me in St. Louis" deservedly remains one of the best musicals of its decade.Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is beautiful! The songs are great and the performances are wonderful! The script has a lot of great lines, the funniest coming from Tootie (wonderfully played by Margaret O'Brien). There is one scene at the dinner table, when Rose is making a phone call, and says something, then the grandfather says "Good evening, Joe." Hilarious! The songs are fantastic. I can't remember who wrote them though. The best was "Trolley Song" where you actually see Judy Garland enjoying herself. "Boy next door" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" are beautifully staged, with Garland showing her sensitive side. The costumes are also beautiful, and that's all I have to say really on that subject. Now for the performances. Judy Garland looks beautiful here, and is obviously enjoying herself. The parents are also good, and they even sing a very nostalgic song. The grandfather and John Truitt are very well done also, but the scene-stealer is a really young Margaret O'Brien, who made me laugh and cry at the same time. ("I was drunk last night dear mother", when she hurts herself and blames it on John Truitt, and when she is seen in the snowy garden knocking all the snowmen over because she doesn't want the family to move). It is a little long, but you will love this musical. 10/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Christmas movie above all, you should know this much going in. What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility.So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness.But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera.There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll admit it. I don't like musicals, and this is corn.But, I gave it a chance. I watched it all the way through, didn't fast forward (I couldn't, I was in a theater!), and tried to get into it. And I came to the following conclusion: I don't like musicals, and this is corn.But this particular kind of corn was stock-in-trade for the major movie studios, and the whole system was perfectly adapted to churn out this kind of bland, lovable, inoffensive fluff. I'm not so much of an ogre that I won't admit that I chuckled a few times. I did.But didn't anyone notice the dysfunction under the veneer of wholesomeness? I'm especially thinking of the five-year-old daughter who is utterly obsessed with death, kills her dolls, has funerals for them, and insists that the neighbor boy that Judy Garland is hot for "tried to kill me!" In another era, she'd be a goth chick waiting to happen. Did they send 5 year-olds to the psychiatrist back then? She definitely needed some major couch time, let me tell you.I am upset and feel I got gypped out of the action at the St. Louis Worlds' Fair. This is a topic that I am somewhat interested in, and also supposedly a place where the hamburger, the hot dog, and the ice cream cone were first glimpsed. I thought that's what the whole film was about. But no, it wasn't. There's just one meager scene at the end of the film, lasting about one minute. I wanted wacky hi-jinx at the fair! Encounters with foreign visitors! Intrigues! Lost children! Escaped tigers! Train crashes! Stuff like that. Perhaps someone could make that film, it sounds a lot more interesting. Maybe I'll have to write it.I enjoyed the scene on the trolley as well, I wish there was more trolley! There's my litany. It certainly isn't going to change most people's opinion of this film. Seems to be a beloved classic for almost every person that commented. Oh well. I can't be expected to agree with the masses all the time, or, ever, for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Character, Two Bodies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may be interested in a special category of movie: those where a director and the chief actress are lovers. There are many I have in a database I am building. The love is obvious in many of them, but perhaps not as colorfully as here. Judy is a technicolor redhead here and really made very pretty, despite the dated hairdos. Oddly, she would never again look as good, not even in the other projects directed by then husband Minnelli.The construction here is noteworthy. This was the first musical story that had just one reality. Previous musicals either had no story: they were stage shows or embedded stage shows; or they had a separate reality that shifted in and out of the reality of the story.This was four years before the celebrated "Bicycle Thief" officially announced "neorealism" and at the same time put Italy finally on the cinematic map. Since then, nearly all Italian- American directors have been either obsessed with or unknowingly locked into a character- based "real" Italian style. I consider this the real beginning.One character, two bodies. Instead of redoing Jo March, they split the character in two. One half was played by an adult Judy acting like an eighteen year old. The other half played by a precocious, lovable brat. As with "Little Women," where all the characters (limited character pieces) add to one grand character, here we have the two.Judy in fact was half one and half the other, a bicameral curse that would haunt her for years. After this, no one could get the two halves on stage at the same time, and she would consequently never be loved quite the same.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent! Judy Garland is really great and Minelli is definitively an elegant and great director... Obviously all the picture was filmed on the studio (they are some outside set painting you can see through the windows of the family home but who care's ? The picture is shared in 4 acts (that's more and more rare todays, every blockbuster is sliced in 3 acts like Bambi) and the cast is excellent. M.M.I.S.L looks like a colored and musical remake of Orson Welles'Samson. Is that correct ?By the way, someone could tell me, which different titles composed the 6th song of the soundtrack tittled "Skip To My Lou... There's traditional south marches and songs...

		<shortDescription>"--- (Judy and Margaret) --- an irresistible package ---"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Commemorating the Louisiana Purchase 100th anniversary with an Exposition in St. Louis is not the only event to happen in 1903. The travel time for the first cross country auto trip, from San Francisco to New York, was 52 days -- Henry Ford organized the Ford Motor Company -- and, Wilbur and Orville Wright finally got their invention off the ground at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina -- not a bad year for American technology."Meet Me In St. Louis" (1944) deserves a place in our film libraries; but we Social Security beneficiaries should overlook a microcosmic plot, which enables the showcasing of the considerable talents of Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien, while under utilizing an able and multi-talented supporting cast (Leon Ames, Mary Astor, Lucille Bremer, Joan Carroll, Harry Daniels, Jr., Harvey Davenport, Tom Drake, Hugh Marlowe, Robert Sully, and Chill Wills). The storyline relates twelve months in the lives of an upper middle class St. Louis family, planning a move to New York, prior to the opening of the Worlds Fair in 1904 -- it's really a thinly veiled variety show; and after superstars Esther (Garland) and Tootie (O'Brien) do their respective songs, dances, and routines, you keep anticipating an emcee stepping forward to introduce the next act.Judy Garland's Meet Me In St. Louis repertoire may not be her best of bests; but it comes pretty close. Her songs alone, by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin, including "The Boy Next Door," "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," and especially "The Trolley Song," are worth more than a stack of new DVDs. Garland paired with O'Brien (maybe at age six), makes this film an irresistible package despite all shortcomings. My mother liked Judy Garland; but she adored Margaret O'Brien -- and most of wartime America did too.Before we get too nostalgic about a time before television and the automobile (1903), when St. Louis had a population of about 600,000 (it's much smaller now), we should remember that super markets and electricity were also in the future, together with most household appliances and conveniences. The Smith's maid, Katie (Marjorie Main), not only cooked and baked every meal from scratch, she even made the condiments (catsup). Katie probably did not milk the cow, churn the butter, grind the wheat, nor grow all fruit and vegetables; but she had a big house to clean and loads of laundry to wash (by hand), with all the dresses and petticoats the women wore to socials. But the trade off -- in lieu of the conveniences we enjoy today -- was more family and family-oriented activities at home.It is somewhat surprising that America adopted Meet Me In St. Louis enthusiastically, and embraced the affluent Smith family in 1944. We were a nation of immigrants (42% immigrant American families in 1900 census) and a struggling, working class -- who stood outside in the cold, with our noses pressed against the windows of a big, warm house, watching wistfully while Esther and Rose entertained their Ivy League boyfriends (Yale and Princeton) in high style. But maybe we knew that -- even though our humble shelter was located on the other side of the tracks from Agnes and Tootie -- if we worked hard enough in this land of opportunity (sometimes for one hour longer, for one dollar less) everything that the Smith's possessed and more, would be ours one day too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently checked out this gem from the library mostly because it was one musical I had yet to see. Im glad I checked it out. I enjoyed it over all. Very cute and I loved the songs, especially the song the movie was named for, the trolley song and the boy next door. ^_^ I am such a musical freak, and may eventually add it to my DVD collection too. I recently saw Singin' in the Rain too, and I enjoyedit too. Everyone in this movie was great! And Judy's voice in this film was really top notch and just fun to hear.

		<shortDescription>Delightful! A musical for all to enjoy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most enjoyable of movie musicals, one that people across the spectrum of age, experience, and intellectual sophistication can enjoy. That itself is a remarkable achievement! The young romances never sag; the cinematography, sets, and costumes are impeccable and beautiful; all characters are credible. The story never slows and is free of any obvious contrivance for the introduction of a musical number; indeed, the songs aren't predictably 'set up' so that one knows exactly when one will be used, a critical fault of many movie musicals -- but not this one. Sixty years later (2004) it loses nothing. It still looks good, and it seems not to have aged in the least. There's nothing hokey about the movie, which is rare for a musical. One can almost feel oneself transported to upper-middle-class (it is definitely that) in the early 20th century and not want to leave.The plot is slight by current standards (the prospect of a move to New York to enhance the father's upper-middle class career), but intensity of feeling that avoids going over the top allows us to empathize with the coming-of-age youth whose lives would be disrupted. Mastery of direction well conceals the slightness of plot.The only movie musicals that I think surpass this one are &gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt; (if one considers it a musical; I consider it more of an adventure story), &gt;Singin' In the Rain&lt;, and &gt;West Side Story&lt;, all in AFI's Top 100 Films List -- and better than &gt;The Sound of Music&lt; because it is less 'dumbed down' than the hokey story of the Von Trapp family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet me in a Technicolor greeting card</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't want to watch a film unless it is contemporary and realistic, you should give this a miss. If that's not the case, however, Meet Me in St. Louis is eminently worth watching. Yes, the setting and characterizations are completely idealized and even hokey, but the gorgeous Technicolor gives it a holiday card flavor and the acting is above reproach. The Christmas montage, beginning from Judy Garland's definitive rendition of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and culminating in Margaret O'Brien's destruction of her beloved snowmen while sobbing hysterically, is an absolute classic. If you can watch this scene (especially knowing how Vincente Minelli evoked such an emotional response from O'Brien) and NOT be moved, this is probably not the right movie for you.Treat this film as if it were a greeting card: savor the bright colors and the sappiness, and don't look for deep meaning or symbolism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a five letter word for "the perfect musical", here is your title, a film so sentimental yet true to the human desire for home and roots that even today it remains fresh and alive, colorful and magnetic in every way. Of course, it will always be remembered as the film which first paired Judy Garland and director Vincent Minnelli (although he was the one responsible for the "Our Love Affair" fruit/cake orchestra in "Strike Up the Band!") and the film which moved her from black and white ingénue into one of MGM's most photographic Technicolor ladies. It will also be remembered as the film which moved rising child star Margaret O'Brien into the realm of Judy's past as MGM's greatest young actress and for the many beautiful songs which were written for it in its translation onto the screen. There's even the unfortunately short-lived but much loved 1990 Broadway musical version of it which had been trailing around as a touring production for years before being perfected for the Great White Way. A T.V. series was also developed years later when MGM moved into that medium, but nothing can top the wedding cake of perfection that is this salute to the early part of the 20th Century when state fairs (like one perfected in song by Rodgers and Hammerstein the following year) were must-visit attractions and "courting" was the way young lovers romanced each other-by gaslight!From the moment that Judy pokes her head out the window to sing her love of "The Boy Next Door", you know that her future as a maturing leading lady looks brighter than ever. Gone are the Mickey Rooney "Let's put on a show!" films, and even if she does put on a show here (in an impromptu duet with Ms. O'Brien), it's much more believable, as it is part of a house party where Judy does more than her share of trying to catch the eye of that particular boy, played here by the handsome Tom Drake. Her parents are played by Leon Ames and Mary Astor, and if it is at first jarring to see the vixen of "The Maltese Falcon" playing a house frau, just remember that she had played Judy's mother once before: in "Listen, Darling!"."Older sister" Lucille Bremer was Arthur Freed's big attempt to create a new leading lady, and while she's a likable young actress, she seems lost when shown on screen with the magnetic Judy and the perky Margaret. Then, there's the beloved "grandpa", played by that old rascal, Harry Davenport, and the family's cranky but lively maid, Marjorie Main, who dominates the kitchen (and her ketchup recipe) much like Mary Wickes would do almost a decade later in two Booth Tarkington similar stories, "On Moonlight Bay" and "By the Light of the Silvery Moon". Ironically, in the big Broadway musical, another MGM leading lady of the 1940's, Betty Garrett, would assume that part, stealing every moment she was on screen.The story is a simple one: Papa Ames wants to move the family from St. Louis to New York and their desire is to remain there for the upcoming world's fair. O'Brien goes homicidal, burying her dolls and killing the snowmen, which leads to a comforting scene where Judy serenades the sobbing girl with "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". It should be noted that the original lyrics of that Christmas standard were much darker than what was heard on screen, yet perfectly in tuned with the sometimes darkened theme of the story. Such is the case with the Halloween sequence where O'Brien must "assassinate" the town grouch by pelting him with flour. You wouldn't see anything like this in a Greer Garson movie!Once Judy steps onto a streetcar for the famous "Trolley Song", you've got the stuff that show business legends are made of. The team of Arthur Freed and Vincent Minnelli produced and directed some of Judy's finest works, and Minnelli proves that he is an artist in every way, making the film look as if it was taken right out of Currier and Ives. There's a big rousing version of "Skip to My Lou!" (which features a young June Lockhart amongst its dancers) and a sweet duet between Ames and Astor who re-establish their own love as they watch their growing children discover their first.While the World's Fair sequence is only briefly presented in the finale, it is the dramatic story leading up to it which makes this magical in every way. Simple times, maybe never as simple as this presents, yet still lovely, and something many audiences yearn for today, just like Judy sang with "Over the Rainbow". Sumstuous costumes, lavish sets and rousing songs make this a delight from start to finish which the newer generations have brought into their hearts and cherished to make a family tradition for decades to come, and hopefully much longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Me In St. Louis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincente MInnelli's masterpiece of reminiscence is much the better for its acute awareness of its own time: made when America's wartime involvement was at its height (1944), the film yearns for refuge in a simpler time and finds it at the turn of the century in a growing but still youthful (the streets are yet to be paved) Midwestern city. Minnelli's mastery of editing to coax complicated feelings from his performers is exquisite, particularly in long, gliding takes that completely envelope the audience as the characters experience emotional peaks (falling in love) and valleys (the threat of being uprooted from home) which are then broken through cross-cutting to discuss them. Made with a genuine appreciation for hearth and home, the film ostensibly features Judy Garland; but Minnelli seamlessly incorporates her into his large cast, and also allows ample room for complex performances from the wonderful Leon Ames, Mary Astor and, in the pivotal role of the youngest daughter Tootie, the sublime Margaret O'Brien. Not just a great musical--a great work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Judy's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fabulous Technicolour MGM musical is a pure delight for both the ears and the eyes. We not only get great musical numbers- we also get terrific colour and set design from Minelli, and Garland at her most physically attractive (she was falling in love with Minelli at the time).Great numbers include 'The Boy Next Door' (belted out by Judy, who was at the top of her vocal powers), the fun and seamlessly introduced 'The Trolley Song', and Garland's wistful and soothing rendition of 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas'.Judy is definitely the star of the show here, though amazing child actress Margaret O'Brien does a good job of challenging her with her remarkable performance as young Tootie. The rest of the cast include Mary Astor (who only played the femme fatale in 'The Maltese Falcon' three years earlier!) as the mother, Leon Ames as the father, and the lovely, talented Lucille Bremer as sister to Garland and O'Brien.The plot revolves around the Smith family in turn-of-the-century St Louis. The setting allows Minelli to explore wondrous colours, tones and styles (he even formed a new paint colour, the 'Minelli yellow' for this film!) as well as set up the very warm and engaging musical numbers. Following on from Garland's 'Joys Of The Home'-themed 'The Wizard Of Oz', Minelli's musical also focuses on family and home, and is, at it's most basic, a touching ode to small-town life.A true classic of the musical genre</fullReview>

The movie tells of the family that can sing together...can stay together, along with their genuine appeal that makes their acting so natural that they seem as if they are a real family. Judy Garland was a beautiful lady, with more talent than we would ever hear about. I think we only got to see a glimpse of the talent she had in her lifetime. All the other characters and dancers are a treasure that make this film the best. This musical deserves an Oscar, along with Judy Garland and the whole Cast.

		<shortDescription>Beautifully realized film directed by Vincente Minnelli</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judy Garland, Mary Astor, Lucille Bremer, Leon Ames, Harry Davenport, Margaret O'Brien, Henry Daniels, and Joan Carroll are the Smiths of St. Louis in "Meet Me In St. Louis," a musical lavishly produced by MGM and lovingly handled by Vincente Minnelli, who would eventually marry its star, Judy Garland and beget Liza with a Z.The story is simple enough, that of a fairly well to do family in St. Louis right before the opening of the World's Fair in 1904. The two older girls, Rose and Esther, are plotting how to get their men - for Esther, it's the boy next door, John Truett (Tom Drake) and for Rose, it's Warren (Robert Sully); their brother Lon prepares to take off for college. Meanwhile, the two younger girls, Tootie and Agnes, live highly imaginative lives - particularly Tootie (O'Brien) who has both terminally ill and dead dolls and revels, screaming all the way, in the Halloween tradition of throwing flour in someone's face. Tootie grew up to become the author of the novel, Sally Benson, but seeing this, one might think she grew up to be either an actress or institutionalized or both. When their attorney father announces that he is taking a lucrative job in New York and the family is going to move, the ground falls out from under all of them.The musical chores fall mostly to Garland, and who better? The songs are perfectly integrated into the story, not stopping it at all, as she sings "The Boy Next Door," "Over the Bannister," "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas." At a party, she and O'Brien do a wonderful rendition of "Under the Bamboo Tree," Everyone has a turn at "Meet Me in St. Louis" as they climb the stairs, etc., and the nicest thing about that is Grandpa screwing up the words just as someone would.All the performances are excellent. O'Brien is a little scene stealer. Garland looks lovely and is warm, vulnerable, and funny. "You don't want to lose your bloom," Rose advises Esther when she says she'll let John Truett kiss her. "Frankly, I think I've got a little too much bloom," Esther decides, looking in the mirror. Her try at romance with Truett when she asks his help turning out the lights in the house is adorable. Lucille Bremer, as Rose, the sister who's not getting any younger and needs to nab Warren Sheffield, gives a very good and funny performance, and she and Garland make great sisters. When they pledge to "destroy" Warren's date to a dance, they decide how many men each of them will have to attract that evening - and of course, neither one of them has any doubt that she can do it. "I should have been born with raven hair," Rose declares. "Nothing would have stopped us," Garland agrees. "You with your black hair and me with my auburn." Marjorie Main as the maid is a hoot.Mary Astor plays it straight, making her lines even better. "Now, be sure you only throw a little flour in people's faces," she advises her younger daughters. Leon Ames is a wonderful harried father. "My daughter is practically on her honeymoon and I've never even met this man," he complains.Minnelli's direction is fabulous as he shows us the life of the Smiths, freezing the house in sepia tones before bringing it to life each time. He perfectly captures the atmosphere of young love, St. Louis heat, Halloween, dances, and family life. The author of the book, Sally Benson, was consulted as to every detail of her home, and the costumers were taken from a Sears/Roebuck catalog of the era. A beautiful film for the whole family and one to definitely enjoy over the Christmas holidays. You'll shed a few tears - it's that perfect mix of humor, holiday melancholy, and sentiment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does one follow up one of the most successful and revolutionary films of all time? Well its quite simple: with a sequel that not only possesses the spirit of the first, but also contains a brand new dynamic of plot and personality. This is the essence of 'Meet Me In St. Louis,' the Vincent Minnelli and Judy Garland engine that dares to be the sequel to the revered "Wizard of Oz." This film, released in 1944, follows the adventures of Dorothy, as, once more she goes 'over the rainbow' and into the land of Oz. This time though, she does not meet a witch or scarecrow, but instead a seemingly normal family living in the Land of Saint Louis - a previously unmentioned land. This land of course, is just as new and fantastical as Munchinland, possessing trolleys, Christmas and many other wonders! It is Dorothy's primary objective to assume the role of Esther Smith, the daughter of the family, and to convince them not to move from their lovely home! But the father has other plans for the family, as Dorothy soon finds out. But look out! This father might not be all that he seems. Lets just say there is something a little...wizardish...about him :) Anyways, I will let you discover for yourselves the wonderful journey of Dorothy through Oz under the guise of Esther Smith. You will be sure to love every heart warming moment of it. Based on L. Frank Baum's second and fourth books of Oz, "Meet Me In St. Louis" is a sequel not to be missed, comparable to such noteworthy sequels as Aliens, and The Godfather Part II. You and the whole family will love this American classic. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This exquisite film is one of the great antidotes to the modern malaise of cynicism. One of the functions of 'art' is to illuminate and expose the 'human condition'. Does this film do it? Absolutely.Here we have the Smith family moderately well-off but tense with the stress not of economic adversity, but that of emotional turmoil. Rose is anxious to get engaged, but the boyfriend won't pop the question. Ester is experiencing the pangs of love for the first time, and Agnes and Tootie are thrown into a maelstrom by plans to relocate.Under the cosy suburban romantic melodrama here lurks an incredibly subtle depiction of the strength and guiles of womanhood. The patriarch of the family is out-manoeuvred in each of the film's three main segments. His son 'Lon' is shown to be putty in the hands of the initially villainous Lucille Ballard. Rose manages to get her way largely by giving the impression that she might be falling for the much older 'Colonel'. And John Truitt really gets the works from the infinitely scheming Ester.All this is fine at a structural and thematic level, but what the film really does is give the audience one of the most unambiguously enjoyable thumps in the emotional solar plexus. Several of the scenes - not just Tootie's famous iconoclastic tantrum - are breath-taking in their emotional power, and the songs stick in the mind and worm their way into the softest, most emotional part of one's (well my at least) psyche. I am blessed with four wonderful daughters and MMISL has become, across the years, our 'family film'; as a life-long cinephile and sometime critic, I could not fault their choice.Meet Me in St Louis is a wonderful film for Christmas - but it's not just for Christmas - it's for life, in the fullest sense of the expression!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic!!! Supreme!!! A wonderful look at life at the beginning of America's Golden Age.My one major issue with the continuity of this movie is that "Meet Me In St.Louis, Louis" was not published until 1904 when the Worlds Fair opened in St. Louis. In the first duet scene with Esther(Judy Garland) and Rose(Lucille Bremer) they sing "Meet Me In St.Louis, Louis". If you paid attention to the first photo intro to the season you remember seeing "SUMMER 1903". OOOOOPS! Musically, the songs could not have gone any better. Perhaps a director such as Vincent Minelli and a producer such as Arthur Reed knew they had a true screenplay gem on their hands. I don't know, but I wish I did.Margaret O'Brien gives a sterling performance, who needs lessons acting like 5 when you look act 6. Even her duet with Esther(Garland) is professional. Great qualities for a child actress. (See her in Little Women or The Canterville Ghost) Lucille Bremer, Joan Carrol, Marjorie Main, Tom Drake they all bring a special fortitude to this movie. Rose Smith(Lucille Bremer) receiving a telephone call from her on and off again boyfriend Warren Sheffield doesn't tarnish her one bit. Although she can act and put up a brave face, we know she is hurt.So its not a musical by name but a warm family movie with good music, sewn seamlessly by a great director.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Charmer from Start to Finish: brimming with iconic moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Meet Me In St. Louis" is the quintessential teenager in love, feel good movie of the 1940s and despite the fact that the film is sixty years old, it sparkles like vintage champagne from the canons of MGM's illustrious musical heritage. Judy Garland is Esther Smith, a girl pining for the affections of the boy next door (Tom Drake) while lamenting the fact that her father (Leon Ames) is about to move the family to New York. And all this before young Esther and her siblings have a chance to see the World's Fair. What's the critical desperation of youth to do? Well, if you're Judy Garland you warble one effervescent tune after the next. From The Trolley Song to Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, truly, this movie is a veritable potpourri of golden memories. Margaret O'Brien and Lucille Bremer costar as Garland's sisters. Mary Astor and Harry Davenport are ideally cast as mother and grandfather respectively. One of the great joys of cinema, Marjorie Maine, surfaces as the Smith's gregarious housekeeper.THE TRANSFER: It's really no surprise that Warner's high resolution digital mastering has made "Meet Me In St. Louis" look and sound as it never has before. In the mid 1990s MGM home video gave us a very smart looking laserdisc box set. This DVD improves upon the resolution of the old format and provides a smooth, rich and textured visual presentation of one of Vincente Minnelli's greatest achievements. Colors are bold, rich and fully saturated. Contrast and black levels are bang on. Fine detail can be seen in even the darkest scenes. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 (as it was on the laserdisc) and is very well represented. There is nothing to complain about in this presentation.EXTRAS: The same documentary as was previously available from MGM, narrated by Roddy McDowell and chronicling the saga of bringing this film to life plus several short subjects particularly produced for this 2-disc special edition.BOTTOM LINE: This classic is an absolute must for anyone who loves movies ? period!</fullReview>

Maybe because I was fortunate to be born in my favorite city - St. Louis just like Tootie.The music, the costumes, the story, the acting, the singing, the humor, the different seasons all are so fun to watch. I loved the little look into that time period and how different it was for a middle class family at the turn of the century.Judy Garland looked her best and "Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a classic.Meet me in St. Louis is a Christmas tradition in my household and I think it would be a great addidion to other people's traditions too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I'll be the first to admit that "MMISL" is sappy, and yes, they do tend to over use the "MMISL" song in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie....but in ways, I wish life were back to being that un-hurried again. It's a sweet, simple movie about a turn of the century family and what can happen in just one short year. A new romance, an old romance re-kindled, the uneasy feeling of moving, and the world's fair coming to "your" home town. Such excitement for a family with growing children! This movie was made famous for many reasons, but one song stands out, Judy Garland's "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". EVERY TIME I hear Judy Garland sing it, I cry like a baby. Nobody does it like Judy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's not to love? Judy Garland never looked or sounded better, Margaret O'Brien is perfect as Tootie (a child character with a refreshing weird streak, who goes about burying her dolls and pulling pranks), a supporting cast with dependable stars like Marjorie Main, a beautiful score, a heartwarming script that feels warm but never sappy --- this is simply one of the best movies ever made. If you ever have the opportunity to see this film in a theatre, you'll also see marvelous detail in the sets and costumes that simply don't show up on video --- and the candy-colored technicolor looks magical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie, everyone knows about "Wizard of Oz" which is fantastic of course, but this little gem doesn't get the attention it deserves. This movie, made during WW2, must have been a wonderful homage to what was remembered as a simpler time in America when family and home were the most important aspects of our lives and the worst thing we had to worry about was troubles with our boyfriends and moving across country. My favorite part of the movie is when Judy sings "The Trolley Song" on the trolley (where else!!)waiting for John Truitt to arrive so they can all go to the fair grounds together. Many people have sung "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" but no one has ever sung it like Judy did in this movie, with so much emotion and poignancy that it brings you to tears everytime. "Meet Me in St. Louis" is so charming and delightful that I watch it several times a year and enjoy it everytime even though I'm from New York and can't understand why EVERYONE doesn't want to live here!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies. The songs are excellent. How anyone could go past The Trolley Song or Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is beyond me. Set in 1904 just prior to the World's Fair coming to St Louis, it shows the importance of family, and that the pursuit of money/status is not the aim of people, as represented by the move to New York and living in an apartment as opposed to a large (several generations old) family home in a 'small' city.The best scenes in the movie (apart from the aforementioned songs) are the Halloween scene which (if you see it from the child's viewpoint) are what scary is all about; and the scene when the girls are preparing for the dance and planning their assault on the eligible boys to keep 'that Lucille Ballard' unattached. Loved the tying of the corsets, which shows women's fashion has NEVER been based on being comfortable.Perfect to watch at Christmas time or when you're feeling depressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film sparkles and glows with exhuberant colors and fine acting, good music, and perfect style. Music mixes teens jazz with 40s jazz to nice results. Minnelli's directing is particularly good here -- I especially liked the overlapping dialogue with expressions in the scene with Trudy on the bed admitting she lied about John hitting her, and the sequences showing halloween rites, which were very odd. Unusually good child acting from O'Brien, who's made the spokesperson for death and loss in the film's symbolism. Judy shines as always. Tired plot but well written script, an A+ production by A. Freed and MGM at their peak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincente Minnelli's production of "Meet Me in St. Louis" is a joy to behold. From the Technicolor cinematography and set decoration to the costumes and musical score, this one is a winner. Three excellent songs composed for the film are nicely balanced with several "golden oldies," making for a perfect mix of early 20th century nostolgia.Judy Garland looks radiant and sings magnificently. She is in full control of her voice, managing to float some lovely high notes with grace, as well as "belt" out more rambunctious passages. Her acting is completely charming, drawing attention to her area of the screen at all times.A fine cast plays in flawless ensemble fashion to make this a screen musical gem. The recent video includes a well-done "Making of," documentary, with guest appearances by such as members as Margaret O'Brien and Lucile Bremer. Songwriter Hugh Martin shares amusing stories behind his writing of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," "The Trolley Song," and "The Boy Next Door." In an extra bonus feature, a pre-recorded soundtrack for a superb song by Rodgers and Hammerstein, entitled, "Boys and Girls Like You and Me" is touchingly sung by Garland. It also has a surprising history, being written for and dropped for a Broadway show, then bought by MGM for this film, then cut and put in another film, which was also cut. All that remains today is the lovely Garland track, which is a most moving rendition.How fortunate we are to have preserved this classic production in a beautifully restored edition.". . . and it was grand just to stand with his hand holding mine . . . to the end of the line."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ms. Judy Garland had a troubled life. Everybody knows about the pills and a few failed marriages that left her in ruins. What people sometimes overlook is a movie she once made with a director-soon to be husband named Vincente Minnelli. It takes us back to 1903...To a family of four girls and a boy. There's (starting from the oldest) Rose, Alonzo Jr. 'Lon', Esther, Agnes, and Tootie. All of these people are stunning and cheerful and the little girl Tootie played by Margarit O'Brian is wonderful! With gorgeous music (believe it or not but the song 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' first came from this song sung by Judy Garland) and a great plot line this movie could never be better. Judy really shines in this movie. She's beautiful...And this is one of the only movies she ever said she felt beautiful in. It shows. When Judy was happy about it life it really showed. Well, Liza Minnelli, you really should be proud. Your mothe was great! This is a must see to everyone who's ever had a little dream and loved someone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful old movie! This film just drips quality throughout with its terrific direction, acting, singing, writing and production. While not the best MGM film ever made, it certainly is among the best musicals they made. That's because not only are there a modest number of songs, but those in the film are awfully enjoyable--particularly the final song, HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE Christmas. It was pure magic and is probably Judy Garland's best adult performance--she is radiant and on the top of her game.I think another reason I love this movie so is that it is not just a bunch of songs thrown at the audience, but a very enjoyable slice of life film about a wonderful family filled with great characters. From the tough but loving father to the bratty littlest child (played by Margaret O'Brien in her best performance), they all are special and sweet without being too saccharine.This makes a wonderful Christmas movie and is best viewed on Christmas Eve with the lights turned low.FYI--If you have a chance, get a hold of the wonderful two-disk set. The second disk has an amazing set of extras--enough to keep you very busy and very happy. One of the shorts, "Bubbles", is NOT good but still well worth seeing despite its creepy characters, as you get to see Judy Garland performing like a pro at age 7!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is perhaps no happier or lighter feeling, then watching a great actress do what she really loves! Judy Garland is one such actress, and in the movie Meet Me in St Louise her voice shines like a jewel. My memoirs of this movie led me to buy the special edition on DVD and I wasn't disappointed! As Ester, Judy allows the audience to truly believe that she is in love with the boy next store. Judy is in my opinion the greatest actress of her time. Everyone from the young to old will enjoy this classic film, as you are swept up in the music and in the way you feel Judy smile as she sings. The female energy really shines in this film with Margaret O'Brien as Tootie, Lucille Bremer as Rose and Marjorie Main as the maid Katie who also played Sonora Cassidy in The Harvey Girls with Judy. Tom Drake , Harry Davenport , Leon Ames Henry H. Daniels Jr also star only adding to the beauty of this musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gag me. This is everything I hate in a musical.A family in the suburbs of St. Louis are living their life happily while their two eldest daughters, Rose and Esther, contemplate love and marriage. The beginning sets off the tone nicely: "How is this ketchup?" "Oh well it's too sweet..." "What do you think?" "Oh, much too flat." Indeed, the movie was nice enough to use its own device to describe what's wrong with it: sickly sweetness and flat tones.I haven't a problem with Technicolor or sweetness, but these people look like they're made out of marshmallow peeps and St. Louis looks like Candyland. Even the muddy street looks edible! Even when worries come up, there's never really any conflict, just a bunch of stretches to try to find a good way of fitting another song in; basic musical conceit, keep setting up songs and it's fun for the whole family.Now the singing is absolutely excellent, I'll give it that, but the music isn't particularly remarkable and the lyrics are terrible. However, it's all in the name of good family entertainment.Honestly, if it wasn't for the singing and the relatively compelling character of Tootie, who despite her cutesy name and her cutesy image is something of a fledgling sadist, it'd be hard to really care about the plot... wait a minute, plot? You mean the thing where these characters fall in love, then fear a move, then don't move, then just go back to being in love? Oops, looks like we forgot something.Something else is a bit confusing about this movie... it's set in 1903... so why does nothing about it feel like 1903, at all? It's so incredibly anachronistic it's appalling. But see, we're not supposed to focus on any of these things, we're only supposed to feel happy and lovely that everything works out in the end, or something. It's dated escapism; very little of it seems really appealing or even important theseadays. I'm sure if you're looking for a way to "fall in love all over again" or something, this could be a good movie to cozy down to, but then again, there's a lot better out there for just that same purpose.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

Judy Garland was totally a young woman preparing for her first tryst with a young man. i am sure she impressed Vincent Minelle with her high stepping dancing at the party. truly, Judy was showing that she was no longer a child but ready for more mature rolls. Mary Astor showed that she could handle her husband and the family adroitly. Lucille Bremer made Rose out to be redheaded vixen when it came to keeping Warren Sheffield. i totally enjoy myself watching the machinations of the Smith women.</fullReview>

I enjoy this movie every time it is played on TV. The younger generation is missing a great deal in not being able to see such innocent,and lovely movies of the Thirties, Forties and early Fifties. They were were much more romantic than the current movies. An imagination of some of the action in the old movies was far more romantic than seeing it all played out in the open.

		<shortDescription>A Classic Receives A Memorable DVD Release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics consider MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS the single finest Hollywood musical of the 20th Century. Produced by Arthur Freed, directed by Vincent Minnelli, and sporting a flawless ensemble cast led by Judy Garland, the film was immediately hailed when it debuted in 1944--and time has only added luster to its name. Now, after several home market incarnations, it at last receives the edition it deserves on DVD. Given its stature, it is ironic that both MGM and Judy Garland originally fought the project.Based on a collection of autobiographical stories by Sally Benson, the script is little more than a series of domestic adventures in the lives of the Smith family of 1903 St. Louis. But it became a thing of wonder: a careful balance of sly but gentle humor, a collection of memorable performances, an understated score shorn of the usual movie-musical affectations, and at the center of it all Judy Garland, one of Hollywood's most memorable talents.The transfer is excellent, capturing every nuance of the film's meticulously and beautifully designed sets in full Technicolor; the sound elements, remastered in Dolby 5.1, are equally fine and Garland's unique vocal skills are undimmed by time. All in all, it seems safe to say that not even the original 1944 theatrical release could surpass the quality of picture and sound offered here.Although the bonus package would have better without the awful pilot for a failed television series based on the film, by and large it offers a superior collection. Previously available on VHS, the Roddy McDowell-narrated "making of" documentary is worth revisiting, as is the TCM-produced "Becoming Attractions." While a number of later documentaries surpass it, "Hollywood: The Dream Factory" has never before been widely available and offers an inside glimpse of the famous 1972 MGM auction. The Martins' performance of "Skip to My Lou" a reconstruction of "Boys and Girls Like You and Me," and a collection of Vincent Minnelli movie trailers round out the offerings, all of them entertaining.The notable audio commentary is led by film historian and Garland scholar John Fricke. I regret to say that I have several issues with Fricke, who seems to rely excessively on Vincent Minnelli's autobiography I REMEMBER IT WELL and who has a tendency to perpetuate certain myths about the film--chief among them the idea that Garland did "The Trolley Song" in a single take. (Garland prerecorded the song, the overall sequence involves at least seven unique camera set-ups, and although Garland performs most of the solo in a single take there is a change in camera set-up toward the end of her vocal.) Even so, Fricke offers considerable insight into the cast, crew, and production of MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, and the commentary is laced with remarks (some of them archival) by the likes of Margaret O'Brien, Hugh Martin, and Irving Brecher; in spite of my occasional misgivings, it really is everything one could wish an audio commentary to be.These aside, the bonus package contains one significant and unique prize: the short film "Bubbles." Long thought lost, "Bubbles" is one of several shorts made in the early 1930s that include The Gumm Sisters, the youngest of whom would become better known as Judy Garland--a true rarity indeed.Given the beauty of the transfer and the generally exceptional bonus package, it is difficult to imagine a better edition of this uniquely American classic. I strongly recommend it.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're in a mood for nostalgia and idealization of family life, take a look at this charming turn-of-the-century musical now famous for its classic songs and the brilliant performances of Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien. The "boy-next-door" theme has never been played out with such satisfying results, due in no small part to Judy's "crush", played in bland but true-life style by Tom Drake. Their tender moments together after the house party scene (where they dim the gaslights together) is one of the most truthful moments of budding romance ever expressed on screen. Garland is in complete command of her role and at the peak of her vocal abilities. Watch as she sings 'The Trolley Song', artfully darting her looks among her girlfriends and brushing her hair back as the tempo of the song becomes catchier with each phrase. A true artist at work here. And the simple storyline structure that takes us through the various seasons is sprinkled with other musical numbers that stay in the memory--none more so than "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas", a gem given tender treatment by Garland. Everyone is seen to advantage, including Mary Astor and Leon Ames as the parents, Lucille Bremer as the older sister and wonderful Harry Davenport. A joyous treat for the whole family! Anyone who claims to detest this movie has no appreciation for a genuine, classic bit of Americana.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judy Garland stars as Esther Smith, the girl at the turn of the century with practically two motives; go after "the boy next door" (John Truitt, played by Tom Drake), and keep the family from moving to New York before the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis because Alonzo Smith, the father of the family, has been accepted in the company's head office in that city. Esther's older brother, Rose, (Lucile Bremer) is after a man who she really never met before, Warren Sheffield.Judy sings 3 of the songs that would appear on her concerts 10 to 25 years after the movie was made in 1944, The Boy Next Door, The Trolley Song, and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, which were made by the famous Hugh Martin, which would become even more famous a year later in Ziegfeld Follies.The movie was an instant smash hit, when it premiered in St. Louis in Movember of 1944. Little Margaret O'Brien was given a special Academy Award to the best juvenile actress of 1944, similar to the one given to Judy Garland in 1939 for her work in The Wizard of Oz.Judy did not want to do the movie, but after lots of persuation from producer Arthur Freed and director Vicente Minnelli, she finally did it. As filming progressed, she began to like her role and later admitted that Esther Smith was the character she loved playing best. Also, as shooting of the movie progressed, the star Garland and the director Minnelli fell in love, marrying a year later and continuing the legendary voice by giving birth to Liza Minnelli in 1946.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a life-long fan of Judy Garland, I think it's safe to say that her performance of Esther Smith in MMiSL is one of her best (next to Oz) ever. I was surprised to hear that Garland didn't want the role of Smith, simply because she was 22 at the time she was cast in the movie and her character was 17. Garland was naturally sick of playing "little girls". I am so thankful that she didn't turn the offer down, for I cannot imagine anyone better suited for the part of Esther Smith.All in all, I'd say in the 200 plus times I have seen this movie it has gotten better and better each time I see it. I first saw it at the age of 12 and as I have grown older I have grown to appreciate the magic of this classic. MMiSL represents what great movies should have been made after and what happened to a great era gone by. Ahh, the good old days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the most beloved of the M-G-M musicals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Smiths lives in St. Louis. Esther (Judy Garland) is in love with the boy next door (Tom Drake). But the sad part is that they got to move on to New York before the great World Exposition.This must be one of the most beloved of the M-G-M musicals, and it's obvious. The Technicolor is one of the most beautiful i have seen, Judy hasn't lost any shape and sings beautifully. O'Briens as Tootie is lovely and Drake is incredibly handsome. The songs and the numbers are unforgettable not in it's spectacle sense, because of it's simplicity and how they get so near to the "home" feeling. Besides, "The Trolley song" is mythical.A timeless movie you must watch again and again. A 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic MGM Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) **** (out of 4)Classic musical about a family living in St. Louis who have the perfect lives, although a fair amount of drama starts to build up when the father (Leon Ames) announces that they are moving to New York City after the holidays. The two oldest sisters (Judy Garland, Lucille Bremer) are hoping the men they are in love with asks for their hand but even this is up in the air. I've read a lot of great reviews about this film and I've also heard some rather negative ones. The negative comments talk about how the movie shows the perfect family having the perfect issues in their perfect lives but everything is so perfect only perfect things will end up happening. Well, I think there's a lot to be said there because this film is somewhat corny in how perfect everything is but that's just the type of movie it is so it's kinda unfair to criticize it for that. The word perfect could be placed anywhere but I'll call the acting, directing and music all perfect. Minnelli does a terrific job with all the material here and while the story itself is quite corny, you can easily overlook that because Minnelli paints a wonderful picture and just takes the viewer along for the ride. I really enjoyed the rich, beautiful Technicolor, which perfectly captures the wonderful costumes and really brings them to life. The outdoor scenes during the snow looks incredibly well and the cinematography is top-notch as well. "Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis", "Skip to My Lou", "The Trolley Song" and "Home Sweet Home" are among the best musical numbers here but we've also got Garland doing a terrific version of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", which I'm sure many have heard even if they've seen or even heard of this movie. Garland and Bremer are both very good in their roles but I thought Ames and Astor were the real keys to the charm of the film. Especially Ames who never seems to get enough credit for what he does in the film. Harry Davenport, Tom Drake and Margjorie Main are all great as well. Child star Margaret O'Brien is the one thing that didn't work for me as I found her quite annoying and her character fairly creepy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the finest US films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>what---a movie without guns, murder, dysfunction? if that's what you "like", this is not for you. Granted, it is unrealistic. But who watches a movie for reality? And how many truly realistic films are there?This movie is delicious on all counts, even as history. All the technical aspect of film-making (in 1944) are first rate. The music is among the best of all musicals (and do NOT overlook "You and I" and "Over the Banister", two undeservedly unknown beauties)."Look" especially for the lace curtain across Judy's face after "The Boy Next Door", the light thru the dining room windows as it changes in the telephone scene (gorgeous lighting throughout the film), the props and clothing through the whole film.Never doubt that film companies had access to real history. Many of the people involved were alive in 1903, including Sally Benson the author. Read the book. Under the light exterior lives some deep truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At one level this is what any Andy Hardy film would have looked like had they thrown a budget at it and shot it in colour - an impossibly perfect Americana that existed only in the rich imaginations of serial nostalgics. Like most, if not all, of the great Hollywood movies I missed them first time around and caught up with them years later via TV or Revival houses. All I really knew about this was that it was the movie with 'The Trolley Song' so when it played for three days only at a Revival house I went along on the first night not expecting too much. I wound up returning for the next two performances, completely blown away by EVERYTHING about it. Okay, put it under a strong light and it may look just a tad twee, we might even apply the Two H label - Homey, Heartwarming and squirm awkwardly as we do so but in the darkness of the cinema and a willingness to surrender to its irresistible mixture of Charm, Sentiment and Craftsmanship/Professionalism it's unbeatable. In retrospect it's easy to see that Judy Garland had two 'Esthers' in her uneven career that bookend it perfectly, Esther Blodgett in the definitive version of 'A Star Is Born' and Esther Smith in the screen adaptation of Sally Benson's memoirs of her life in St. Louis at the turn of the century. Minnelli's painterly eye has seldom been better than in his Currier &amp; Ives set pieces of the four seasons and Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin contributed what has to be a very strong contender for the PERFECT musical score to ANY film, brief though it was, from the wistful The Boy Next Door and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas to the exuberant Trolley Song. It's doubtful if a better cast has ever been assembled from the Head (Judy Garland) down to the toes (Chill Wills as Mr Neely, the Iceman). In between we have the wonderful Mary Astor, limning a stereotypical 'mom' a scant two years after her femme fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy in 'The Maltese Falcon', complemented perfectly by Leon Ames, the 'temporary' villain of the piece by virtue of not only thwarting a romantic phone call but also planning to uproot the family from St. Louis to New York. St. Louis itself is equally important and THIS St. Louis is light-years away from the one that Tennessee Williams would immortalize only one year later (1945) in 'The Glass Menagerie' when, in complete contrast to the Smith family the Wingfields could't get out of town quickly enough. This HAS to be not just one of the best Musicals but also one of the best Movies ever and a 10 out of 10 if ever I saw one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland is Terrible, But The Film Has Redeeming Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year before the 1904 St Louis World's Fair, the four Smith daughters learn lessons of life and love, even as they prepare for a reluctant move to New York.This film took me a while to warm up to. Judy Garland, the star of the film, is dressed horribly with awful hair, and frankly I find her singing voice quite atrocious. How can this be? In others films ("Wizard of Oz" and "A Star in Born") she sings so nicely. Of course, the songs in general are pretty awful in this one... not fun like other musicals (e.g. "State Fair").I would have rated the film lower, but the Halloween scene redeemed it. Kids starting fires, dumping in old furniture, and smashing people in the face with flour? Priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great memorable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will always be remembered as the greatest Christmas Classic of all time but IMO, it is the greatest of all time. Judy Garland sings very good and acts very good. She is superb as Esther. Also good in a supporting role is Lucille Bremer. She starts her career out with this movie. I liked her performance as a strong woman. But Judy's performance really caught my eye. She sung well, photographed in the perfect angles. I am glad she decided to do the movie because the film wouldn't have been a success with the talents of Judy. this is one of my favorite movies bu her because of her acting. if anyone else had dome this movie, it wouldn't be a success. Her best song in the whole movie was "Have Youself A Merry Little Christmas". Her voice was so strong in that movie. This movie really captures the main things about Christmas: Togetherness and Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Me in St. Louis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the leading actress's then husband and Liza's father, director Vincente Minnelli (An American in Paris, The Band Wagon, Gigi), I knew this featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I had to see why. Basically the story is set in the four seasons of 1903 in St. Louis, with the well-off Smith family, with father/husband Alonzo 'Lon' (Leon Ames) and mother/wife Anna (Mary Astor), four daughters Esther (Judy Garland), 'Tootie' (Margaret O'Brien), Rose (Lucille Bremer) and Agnes (Joan Carroll), and one son Lon Smith Jr. (Henry H. Daniels Jr.). Starting in spring and some of summer, sister Rose is expecting a telephone from Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully) to be proposed, while Esther has fallen in love with the boy next door John Truett (Tom Drake). Esther finally gets to meet John properly when the Smiths throw a house party for many guests, and it is only after everyone has left that she gets to woo him as he helps her turn off the gas lamps. On Halloween, Tootie returns injured from knocking on the door of a large man and throwing flour in his face, and Esther initially labels John the "bully", but she apologises and they share their first kiss when Tootie confesses. After Esther and John have a trip on the trolley, father Lon has a big announcement for the family, he has new big business opportunity in New York, so he has arranged the whole family will join him. While he is looking forward to it and has put his foot on the decision, the rest of the family are devastated, particularly Rose and Esther with their romances, missing the World's Fair, and friendships and education plans will be spoilt. So Christmas time approaches, and Esther is upset when John cannot get a suit to attend the ball and dance with her, so she initially takes Grandpa Prophater (Harry Davenport), but thankfully John does turn up eventually. When Esther returns home, Tootie is upset at the idea of having to move away from St. Louis, and Lon spots them consoling each other, and after a song Tootie expresses her feelings knocking the family snowmen down. In the end, Lon makes the decision that he nor the family will go to New York, knowing how much their lives will be affected, so Esther and John alongside Rose and Warren are still together, and the happy family attend the beloved World's Fair. Also starring Marjorie Main as Katie the maid, Hugh Marlowe as Colonel Darly and Chill Wills as Mr. Neely. I remember seeing this film once before, as it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and not really getting or appreciating it, so I am really glad I gave it a second chance. Garland is beautiful looking and singing, the supporting cast all do their parts well too, the dancing is glamorous, the costumes are interesting, and the five songs featured are great listening, all in all, a great classic musical. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music for George E. Stoll and Best Writing, Screenplay. Judy Garland was number 82 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" was number 76, and the Oscar nominated "The Trolley Song" was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 10 on 100 Years of Musicals, and it was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Watch if You Gag Easily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a couple of touching moments in "Meet Me in St. Louis," most notably the scene where Judy Garland sings a little Margaret O'Brien "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" to soothe the girl who's upset about having to leave the only home she's known to that point. To a war-weary audience, I'm sure this song sung in this context struck quite a chord, and I can't hear it to this day without thinking of this scene.As for the rest of the musical, it's typical MGM frothy stuff, sticky sweet and wholesome, filmed in garish Technicolor. It doesn't have the same sexy humour of some of MGM's other musicals, like "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and opts instead for a bland family-friendly approach. There's no denying the talent involved, but if you find yourself gagging easily on sugary family entertainment, this movie may not be for you.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Louis Isn't Missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie that transmogrifies the word ?trite' to ?involved'; cornpone to gourmet; that directs itself; that mis-remembers days of youth; that on the Eighth Day God created Margaret O'Brien; that makes you wonder if anyone ever existed that disliked it; the movie that enraptures so artfully even the Louis of the title song isn't missed. Why? Well, because Judy Garland was so preoccupied with the boy next door, Margaret O'Brien with Mr. Braukoff's ?haunted' house, and the entire Smith family with the grave decision of whether or not to move to New York and miss the 1903 St Louis Fair- nobody noticed. And from 1944 onwards moviegoers have lapped up every sentimental, rouge-lipped moment of it. Outside in the real world Americans fought and died in the Pacific and every other part of the globe. World War II reached a critical point. Soldiers celebrated Christmas on a thousand jeep hoods, in dugouts, jungles, submarines and aircraft. When Judy Garland sang ?Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.' they knew what she meant. Because every last one of them were raised in a St. Louis in 1903.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the most overrated film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've already written a review for Meet Me in St. Louis, and I apologize for having to repeat myself. But given the extreme obnoxiousness of this film I think I can be excused for voicing my opinion twice.Meet Me in St. Louis tries to make its audience feel good. It tries to be optimistic and idealistic and nostalgic. You're supposed to watch it and feel better for a while. Unfortunately the film completely fails to achieve any of its goals--this supposed ideal vision of heartland America is nothing but a nauseating, racist nightmare. How can so many reviewers say they wish the real world could be more like this? Do you really wish the world was so saturated with color you could barely look at it without going blind? Do you really wish everybody was white and looked like everybody else?All of the characters are bland and uninteresting, all of the songs are lifeless and completely incidental to the rest of the movie, and the movie's color scheme made me feel like throwing up. The plot is nothing but silly mix-ups, a completely random Halloween bonfire, and bratty girls trying to get indistinguishable men to like them. It's all formulaic drivel. I've never seen a movie as dead as this one.There's nothing worse than a supposedly cheery movie that just makes you feel bad about yourself. I'd rather be run over by one of those St. Louis trolleys than watch this film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very insipid film with only 2 remarkable points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very, very boring film. But it might be enjoyable to those who like musicals (I just wonder why). The songs are silly, banal and not particular inspired. I don't stand the whole fuss about Judy Garland. She wasn't pretty and didn't have a great voice. The only reason why, for some people, she might look pretty is all the sof-focus close-ups she gets (and we know who was behind the camera) and also the unprettiness of the rest of the female cast. Not just the songs and music are uninspiring but also the plotine, and the characters are mere stereotypes . The camerawork is rather dull (especially in the scene where Garland and O'Brien sing &amp; dance together). Anything positive about the film? Well just a few points. Margaret O'Brien steals the show in the mention dance sequence with Garland. Just look at where the rest of the cast pose their eyes on. She's also got the best lines: how she buries dead dolls in the cemetery and has to dig them up to take them to New York. Her song I was drunk, is probably the best as is a flow of fresh air among such a sugary and revolting collection of songs, and coming from a little girl like that is such hilarious. It breaks, with her constant interest in necrophilia, the strenuous idyllic, romantic and nostalgic view of an American city at the beginning of the century. It hints to a darker side of America to come (highlighted in the scene where she destroys the snowmen and also when she "kills" Mr. Braukoff by throwing flour at him).Another hilarous moment is when Garland and Lucille Bremmer are getting ready for the ball by tightening up their corsets. The sounds that Garlan emits as her sister is tightening her corset up from behind suggest to some kind of lesbian sexual intercourse (I'm just been sardonic here). Especially funny is their conversation on being able to handle 20 men between both of them. Garland actually says if her sister can handle at least 8 she could handle the rest... just hilarious.So hints of necrophilia, nymphomania and lesbianism in a very overrated film that are superb as they contrasted radically with the main themes of the film: Family unity, nostalgia for a bygone era, falling in love, marrying, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family in St. Louis and their lives in the time span of a year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has put out quite a few musicals, and during this time frame there seemed to be plenty to choose from. This movie states it is a musical, but it's more like a drama trying for comedy with some musical numbers tossed in for good measure. And all of them too long too. Tootie, played by Margaret O'Brien, is so over-acted as to be annoying, and Judy Garland, in the starring role of Esther, looks positively awful. Actually, weird. At times she's cute, but other times, depending on how her hair was styled, she looked comical. Like a caricature of herself. The wardrobe, though, looked good, as did the indoor scenery of the Smith home, but that was about it. And here we have Mary Astor, one of the Grand Dames of the time, being totally wasted as the wife. And if there was a plot it was well hidden. Was this a movie about the St. Louis World's Fair, about 2 young women falling in love and all the drama that goes along with this issue, the antics of some 5-year old, a family upset because they have to move? At least with some other musicals we get an actual solid storyline. For example, The Music Man, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Singing in the Rain, etc. This movie I just could not pin down any solid plot, therefore, the movie was boring and I did not care for any of the characters. Yes, Garland has some pipes, but even her fantastic singing could not save this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A relic with little to offer modern audiences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read other comments, I am well aware of the affection in which this movie is held. That said, I feel that the reviewers are treading very carefully given its status as a classic. The truth is that modern audiences would be baffled and bored by this film. Unlike Judy Garland's other classic, the timeless Wizard of Oz, it does not convince in any way. The songs are appalling with the exception of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and the acting of the whole cast consists of exaggerated gurning and absolutely no subtlety. Now there are obviously scores of people who disagree with me and I'm happy that they enjoy this film, but for everyone else I would say set your expectations as low as possible and you won't be far wrong!</fullReview>
