		<fullReview>Not too many tv movies provide the sheer entertainment value that SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS delivered. It was definitely campy, but that added to the fun. Fans of Shannen Doherty will appreciate her stepping out of her bad-girl image to be the good girl for a change. And the rest of the cast did quite well, especially the three pretty friends Shannen meets that definitely prove that beauty is only skin deep. The tongue-in-cheek writing was better than I expected, and the 70's style special effects fit the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shannen Doherty seemed a little old to be going to college (even if it was to investigate her sister's "suicide") - but my friends and I sure had fun watching her battle everyone from Goth girls to Kate Jackson. There were more twists in the plot than I expected, and several of the performances were good - i.e. the lead Goth girl, Julie Benz as the head Satanic girl, the guy from 90201 who played Shannen's boyfriend, and yes, even Ms. Doherty. On the downside, the special effects were pretty cheesy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satan's School for Girls is not one of the slasher films that seem to be gathering box office money. In fact, if it were released in theatre's, I am sure it might not do that well. But as a TV-Movie, it really attracted an audience. When Shannen Doherty's sister commits suicide, Shannen (Beth) is positive that she was murdered. To find out how or even more, Beth enrolls herself into her sisters college, where she finds out secrets she wished she had never known. Being a huge fan of Shannen, I found this film a must-see, but I found that her character was a lot alike to Prue Halliwell, the witch she plays on Charmed. She even has powers in this film. But, like always, her performance was good, just similiar to her previous work. You might recognize Kate Jackson in this film, as the colleges head mistress. She even starred in the original film, yes, this is an Aaron Spelling remake. Julie Benz also turned in a great performance as Shannen's unsuspicious room-mate. The middle of the film is where the climax really begins, when you start to unravel the basic plot of the story. The ending may leaved some shocked, I didn't suspect it at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This updated version is overall predictable but otherwise excellent and suspenseful. However, a few "plot holes" and unanswered questions remain in my memory. For instance, how and to what extent did the character Lisa Bagley fit in with The Five? What was her relationship to the cult? Was she being used as a front to lure Karen/Beth to the group? By the climax of the movie it was obvious that Lisa and her friends were not directly involved with The Five, yet Lisa was killed by them. As far as the film editing was concerned, the practice of using slow motion to emphasize many key scenes was overused, as was the annoying "crow calls" and overhead views of Karen/Beth while she was being observed by some of the shapeshifters.Both Shannen Doherty and Julie Benz delivered standout performances, as did Kate Jackson. I found the character Paige(the black girl) very annoying. Her forceful and heated delivery of her lines contributed nothing to the film and would have been better left out. Jenny Hammersmith was also repulsive and in terms of looks and wardrobe truly needed a major workover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know everybody likes to rag on Shannen Doherty and Aaron Spelling, but I have to say I was pretty impressed with this tv movie. Doherty plays a girl who goes to an all women's college to investigate the supposed suicide of her sister. Judging by the title, you can guess that this isn't your average university. It's full of pretty girls who just happen to be Satanic, and the Dean of Students is played by none other than ex-Charlie's Angel Kate Jackson. It's campy, funny, and even scary at times - and the supporting cast (including a great Julie Benz as Shannen's roommate) do an admirable job.</fullReview>

They didn`t even bother to add a plot...until the end (like "hurry up...come up with a plot, the movie is almost over...awh, this will do")But hey...it is so incredibly FUNNY! I want this in my DVD collection, to watch over and over again! Laugh at the bad bad bad lines, lack of plot, as mentioned, and the actors who are doing their worst effort ever. Not that former 90210 actors usually says quality, but they are far more talented in anything else they ever did! And what is better then a bad bad bad bad movie? except a good one off course. Nothing!Trust me...see this movie, if you dont like scary movies, this is the movie for you ( I am easily scared, you can take this) you will laugh and laugh.So, Aaron, you are kidding, right? Because, if you are...BRILLIANT! If you aren`t...go back to teen soaps!If there are anything you would like to say to me, please contact me, I like discussing movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not like Doherty, but this TV movie was right up her alley. The only minimum requirement to get into this girls' college is that you must have a rack and be a hottie. Do all girls' colleges have a boy's college just across the river? I laughed out loud at a lot of this, the coincidences are so bad they are hilarious. I give this a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Blessed or cursed, whichever way you want to look at it, with supernatural powers far beyond those of man or woman young Beth Hammersmith, Shannon Doherty, made it a point to get herself enrolled in the all woman Fallbridge Collage and solve the mystery why her kid sister Jenny, Irene Contoglorgis, a student there committed suicide. Using the fake name of Karen Oxford Beth got herself involved with a number of fellow students headed by blond bombshell Alison Kingsley, Julie Benz. These girls are members of a secret witch's coven on campus that's been in existence since the beginning o the 20th Centuary. A sorority that over the years included some the most powerful and politically connected women on earth! like I would guess Margret Thatcher Hillary Clinton &amp; Angela Merkel! As it soon turned out Beth since birth was destined to be the fifth member of this selective club of modern day Amazons or Women Libbers! And it wasn't an accident, like the death of he sister Jenny, that fate or evil brought her there!Sexy and computer enhanced remake of the 1973 film of the same name with Kate Jackson who was a student in the original playing the part of the mysterious collages Dean Olivia Brutis. As for the girls in the movie actress Shannen Doherty had them all beat in the gorgeous department which made them very envious of her. This lead to her rival for the attention of the collage's hot and swinging history professor Nick Delcroix, Richard Joseph Paul, Alison to get jealous of Beth. Alison instead of doing Beth in she settled to put an end to Prof. Nick's sex life for good by zapping him as he was about to bed her down,in a final good-by, in the collage auditorium. As for Beth she gets some information about Jenny from what seems like the only male on campus, lucky stiff, Mark Lantch, Daniel Cosgrove, who woks in the collage record room. This leads Mark to become a permanent stiff when the girls lead by Alison get a whiff of what he's been doing in exposing their secret club.****SPOIERS*** By the time that Beth as well as we in the audience finally realize what's going on it's already too late for her in that she perfected her supernatural powers where even Beth can't control them anymore. When the film is finally over with Beth married with a young infant the power that destroyed the club, including Dean Brutis, that she was a member of comes back to her with a vengeance! which showed a shocked and confused Beth that all her efforts to put an end to all this insanity that she just suffered through was all in vain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love cheesy TV movies and this one had everything it takes to be an unintentionally hilarious gem. Implausible scenes and characters like Shannen Dougherty's boyfriend wanting to cuddle and talk about their feelings? Who is really into his dark, brooding girlfriend who never smiles or goes anywhere but the library? Yeah, that's what every college guy is looking for. A professor saying he didn't think anyone at their school had ever committed suicide, but actually it's the 2nd leading cause of death? (What's the 1st I wonder?) A dean who lets Dougherty walk out of an office with someone else's confidential files and only gives her a dirty look for it? Of course we find out why in the end...*SPOILER* The thing that really got me was I was waiting to see who the shape-shifting 4th member was. Her sister with a different hairstyle maybe? No, it was some sorority chick who had only been in the movie for like one 10 second scene. That was the big shock? Did I miss something? I did miss the beginning, so I guess the sorority girl was a very important character who simply didn't factor at all into the hour and a 1/2 that I saw. The end was totally anticlimactic. Over the top camp is the only thing a movie like this has going for it and the ending didn't deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair to middling TV movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title pretty much gives away what the movie is all about.We the viewer know the death of a young student at a prestigious female private school has been induced by demonic forces although the official verdict is suicide.Her friend (Shannon Doherty) resolves to enroll in the college and conduct her own investigation where she soon finds herself embroiled in a seething cauldron of Satanism ,with shape changing students and satanistic rites in the woods not to mention priapic faculty members. The key is the existence of a secret society who wish to recruit her for the psychic powers she possesses. TV movie restrictions ensure a low gore quotient and the acting is pretty routine but as a chill out no brainer after a long day it will pass muster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliched and Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Satan's School For Girls" never came on tv here in Australia- It was a straight to video movie...and I wouldn't watch it again. I can't believe I paid $7.50 for this "movie"- a title it does not earn, because I am under the impression that films are art...this is *not* art of any kind. I watched this flick with two girl pals and my boyfriend, and we spent the 82 minutes(or 84, whatever it is)pulling apart everything from Aaron Spelling (yeah, I like to rag on him) to special effects. It was full of cliches, and things so coincidental that you just had to laugh- things like having a boys college right across from the girls' one, smashing lightbulbs with telekenisis etc. It was predictable right to the bottom line- it took us about 15 minutes to realise that the gothic girls were really harmless, and that the "good" girls, the sorority types were the truly evil ones.The special effects are pretty lame- alot of zapping here and there, setting people on fire- real cheesy stuff. Most of the cast lacked true talent, except of course Shannen Doherty, although I don't feel she's really doing herself any justice at all by having her name connected to this piece of "art". I also think she should steer away from anymore occult or witchy/supernatural themes- she's molding herself into these kind of characters, and generally that isn't a good thing. See this if you're totally desperate, otherwise don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Beth's (Beth is a witch, but a good one.) sister, Jenny dies, the police think it's suicide. Beth knows that Jenny would never do such a thing, so she decides to go investigate the death by herself. Beth then enrolls at Fallbridge College, the same college where Jenny attended. Beths goes under a different name though, Karen. Whilst Beth is there, she finds out some dark secrets, including one about a secret cult group who call themselves, The Five, who want Beth to join the group as there fifth member. Satan's School For Girls stars, Shannen Doherty, Julie Benz, Daniel Cosgrove and Kate Jackson. They all give pretty good performances here.I expected to like Satan's School For Girls. as I usually always like these kind of movies and as expected I did enjoy it. The movie had a good plot which kept you interested all the way through and it didn't get boring at all. This is a good TV movie. It's a shame it didn't make it to the big screen though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent TV horror starts mysterious but unravels by the third act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released to TV in 2000, "Satan's School for Girls" is a remake of the 1973 TV movie of the same name. The story revolves around a young woman (Shannen Doherty) who enrolls at an all-girls college in Massachusetts to investigate her sister's supposed suicide. She befriends some girls (Julie Benz, Taraji P. Henson &amp; Mandy Schaffer) and becomes involved with a dude (Daniel Cosgrove) while investigating the witchcraft of some Goth chicks (e.g. Victoria Sanchez). Kate Jackson plays the Dean and Richard Joseph Paul a girl-crazy professor.While this is better than the underwhelming original version, it has its own flaws. Despite the TV budget, it starts out good and mysterious, which goes on for the better part of an hour, but then unravels into cartoony TV horror. Doherty is fine as the dispirited protagonist. While people complain about her dismal disposition it goes with the role. Sanchez stands out amongst the girls at the school, not to mention Schaffer. Despite this, the filmmakers generally drop the ball on the female front, considering the resources at their disposal (and I'm not talking' bout nudity or porn). The semi-sleazy professor is the creepiest character while Cosgrove is amiable as Doherty's boyfriend, but their sexual union seems premature and forced. Another thing I liked is a certain plot twist: You think the story's going one way and it suddenly changes. Of course, this is so common now it's no longer surprising.As far as the last 35 minutes go, it's tough to pull off satanic ritual sequences with a straight face, which is why Roman Polanski limited the satanic sequence in his "Rosemary's Baby" (1968) to a mere two minutes at the climax (not that I'm a fan of that one-dimensional movie in light of it being 99% drama in an old NYC apartment and 1% horror). Filmmakers have to be careful with these kinds of scenes or they become more laughable than spooky. So most of the first two acts rate a solid "B" or, at least, "B-", but the final act is weak. Still, it's worth seeing for the positives.The movie runs 87 minutes and was shot at John Abbott College and Montréal, Québec.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aaron Spelling + horror = cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ostensibly a remake of the 1970s TV witchcraft classic of the same name, SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS in reality turns out to be a cheesy variant on the usual CHARMED storyline. Indeed it could be a feature length version of CHARMED and nobody would notice the difference, especially given the ultra-cheesy CGI effects and the presence of leading actress Shannen Doherty.The film opens promisingly with the apparent suicide of a young woman who's a student at an exclusive girls' school. Her older sister subsequently enlists at the same school in order to investigate the death, and she soon becomes a member of a witch's circle where great magic power is wielded. Sadly none of this power translates much to the screen, where everything seems subdued and laboured.The film is dull and cheesy, the worst kind of TV movie cheese there is. Incident in the storyline is limited to a couple of minor characters dying bloodlessly, and it all builds up to an ending chock-full of hilariously bad effects. It's fair to say that the acting is hardly remarkable, with a young Julie Benz (RAMBO) particularly irritating as a fellow student. Still as this is an Aaron Spelling production, the producers are happy to sit back and film the female students in (and out of) various figure-hugging attire, so they're happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more entertaining than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Satan's School for Girls" is an incredibly enjoyable and entertaining film.**SPOILERS**After her sister's suicide, Beth Hammersmith, (Shannon Doherty) learns that she had a dark secret from her college, and goes under an assumed name there to find out more. Meeting up with Allison Kingsley, (Julie Benz) Paige, (Taraji P. Henson) Hillary, (Mandy Schaffer) and Mark Lantch, (Daniel Cosgrove) other students at the college, she starts to question the student body about the incident and learns about her involvement in an occult group on campus, but a series of dreams tells her that not all that she's being told is true. Digging deeper into the mystery, she gradually realizes that the cult has been manipulating her life to get her into their organization to complete a sacred Satanic ritual, and tries to get away before succumbing to their dangerous powers.The Good News: There was some really good stuff to this one. One of the best points is that the mystery is built up rather well. While it's quite cliché stuff at times, from the rather well-done and entirely fun suicide scene to open the film, which gets a little creepy at times, there's also the strange behavior of those on campus and their reactions to it all which make for some really good times, and then the gradual shift away from the suicide into the occult and their witchcraft-like ways is done really well and keeps the suspense up which is a nice touch. That these are done through a series of really well-done supernaturally-influenced scenes makes for some really good times, and that they're all good scenes as well is really good. The three big sequences at the big tree are really good, as there's some pretty nice sequences there. The two major ones are the scenes of them practicing their rituals in the middle of a pentagram are a lot of fun, and that there's a fully-fledged transformation during them is even better. Even some of the dreams, which aren't that big but actually quite well-done, manage to serve just as good of a purpose. From the dawning realization of the dangers to the cult to the rather convoluted ones detailing the supposed suicide, there's some good points to be had from these moments. There's also a couple rather well-done attacks that are quite fun, from the enjoyable opening where the malicious spirit is shown crawling along the frame of the house to get inside and take out the victim to a rather atmospheric attack during a raging thunderstorm that is a lot better than expected, this one manages to get in some suspenseful moments when it wants to. The best part, though, is the fun and entertaining finale which is the best part of the film. From the grand church that has a Gothic flair to it that really works to the use of the occult paraphernalia strung around to make it look even more intimidating and imposing, there's a great setting for the action to unfold. The action itself isn't that bad, mainly based around the occult ritual that must be performed, but is nicely aided along by the rather impressive finale which has a lot going for it, from the fire that makes the others burst into flames in an impressive set of visuals, and then the final confrontation with the main head of the group as well manages to be a lot of fun. Coupled with a higher-than-expected body count, this one is a pretty entertaining entry.The Bad News: There was a few problems with this one that hold it down somewhat. One of the main problems here is the fact that there's just way too much editing during the attack scenes that really serve to neuter the film so it's not as outrageous or violent as it could be. This is mostly prevalent during the later half, when there's more action, but it's still something to contend with, when it manages to either cut away before the main kill can be seen or just shown from such an angle as to make it hard to figure out what really happened. That it's just during the attack scenes, causing them to be severely edited down, is where it scores down due to the very fact that there's hardly anything to be seen in them. Another problem is the fact that the relationship between the two, which is so cliché that it had to happen and is eye-roll-inducing for merely being included, surprises no one and really serves no purpose other than to get her nearly-naked and nothing else, and easily could've been dropped in favor of lengthening some of the attack scenes, which is the last flaw here. A couple of them, either due to editing or other factors, are quite short and could've used the time the film uses building up a cliché romance into making them a little more fun. Otherwise, there wasn't much wrong with it.The Final Verdict: Far, far better than expected and actually with a lot of rather good points to it, beating out the few rather insignificant-if-noticeable flaws. This one is definitely recommended to those who enjoy these kinds of films or fans of the creative cast, otherwise go in with extreme caution.Rated R: Violence and some Language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off it starts like any teenager horror flick, some one is running from something and dies. The people in it are also horribly cliché, pretty big boobed airheads who secretly (gasp!!) have a satanic cult and a girl with special powers try to stop them! Oh but her parents also died because it wouldn't be a misfit pretty girl if her parents had not died. The movie takes place in Boston yet they mention that the tree was where victims of the witch trails where hung. Am I the only one who knows that only one person was hung in Boston because they where a 'witch' and that it wasn't even in the witch trails?! Love how they misuse the pentacle yet again saying it's 'the devil's mark' its a sign of protection in pagan faiths. Then of course she turns the girls down (all I want is one horror flick where the person doesn't turn them down Jesus! Teenage girls are not that noble!) and she kills them with her super duper powers that set them on fire with horrible special effects. What would a low-budget horror movie be without the end where you think they are safe but 'oh no!' here comes the big bad cliffhanger promising a sequel that makes the first movie look like Shakespeare. This movie is crap don't see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, for personal reasons, I don't like Shannen Doherty at all. Believe me, she is nothing like the people she plays in these television movies and series. So, that was the first problem with this movie. Type casting is very important to movies ... and the casting was screwed in his case. However, I did enjoy seeing Kate Jackson, but she was miscast also. Personally, Kate is a very nice person ... even though it is believed that she is bi-polar and manic-depressive. Kate has the "IT" Factor and most of her fans were a case of love at first sight.The special effects left a lot to be desired, and the last 20 minutes of the movie was a huge letdown. So, basically, if you want to see a good movie, watch the original Satan School For Girls ... that one is a classic as far as I am concerned. Yes, it had a few problems too ... but the casting was a huge improvement over the remake.LadyShalene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake that doesn't try to be that much different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Satan's School for Girls starts in Seattle in Washington where the distraught Jenny Hammersmith (Irene Contogiorgis) arrives at her sister's house, when Jenny's sister Beth (Shannen Doherty) returns home she finds police everywhere &amp; her sister dead lying in a pool of blood in her kitchen. The cops put Jenny's death down to suicide but after attending her funeral &amp; reading a mysterious card from 'The Five' of Fallbridge College Beth decides to enroll there &amp; investigate Jenny's last movements. Flying to New England &amp; taking her place at the private all girls school Beth uses the fake name Karen Oxford to snoop around &amp; ask questions without raising too many suspicions. Then, shortly after she arrives another student Lisa Bagley (Victoria Sanchez) is also found dead from an apparent suicide attempt. Beth begins to believe that supernatural forces are at work &amp; that her presence there is no coincidence...Originally broadcast on the 13th March during 2000 in the US by the ABC channel this was directed by Christopher Leitch &amp; is in fact a remake of the early 70's made for television film Satan's School for Girls (1973) which was also produced &amp; broadcast by the ABC channel in the US, there have been lots of classic horror remakes of late from The Hills Have Eyes (1977, 2006) to Halloween (1978, 2007), Friday the 13th (1980, 2009) &amp; A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984, 2010) but surely Satan's School for Girls is one of the most obscure &amp; one of the most unlikely (it hardly has a huge fan or cult following, does it?) films ever to get a remake &amp; I would seriously doubt the majority of people who have actually seen this know it's a remake. Well, I have to say that I only saw the original Satan's School for Girls a couple of days ago &amp; am wondering if anyone else can claim they have seen both versions within a couple of day of each other? Probably not many, if any. So how does this remake compare to the original? Well to be honest I thought both films followed each other very closely &amp; the basic plots are exactly the same with a few minor tweaks here &amp; there, notably there's more reason given for Beth to be suspicious &amp; enroll at her sister's school, the character's are fleshed out &amp; the girls are seen acting like girls with boyfriends, going out &amp; actually studying in class while the Satanic rituals are moved from the cellar to an abandoned building &amp; an old tree stump. None of it changes the story significantly at all, in fact all it does is pad the running time out from 73 minutes of the original to 87 minutes here &amp; those extra fifteen minutes don't offer up anything of much interest. Like the original it's a fairly predictable film, the title gives it all away from the start really. The character's are alright although they do feel like rip-offs from the teenage supernatural horror The Craft (1996). Would I have liked this Satan's School for Girls more or less if I hadn't seen the original only two days ago? I don't know, but the fact is I did see it &amp; both films feel remarkably similar in plot, pace &amp; blandness. I've seen worse but I've seen better too.As expected the major changes come on the production side of things, obviously the film looks a lot more modern with new cars, contemporary fashions &amp; a proper school setting along with a lot more special effects shots. In the original we never saw what killed the sister at the start as she is just found hanging there but here in this remake an evil bird morphs into some black mist &amp; then turns into a ghost with sharp teeth that stabs Jenny to death, there are other morphs as people shape-shift &amp; more bad CGI birds of evil flying around. There's a little kissing but nothing explicit as this is a made for television production that also shy's away from any real scares or gore.Although set in New England this was filmed on location at the John Abbott College in Montréal in Québec in Canada &amp; it looks quite good although a little dull. The climax in particular is rather underwhelming although there are a few decent CGI fire effects. The acting is alright, Kate Jackson who appeared in the original Satan's School for Grils back in 1973 has a small role here as the headmistress.Satan's School for Girls is an alright way to pass an hour &amp; a half if you can watch it on telly for free but don't bust a gut to track a copy down as it's fairly tame, predictable &amp; much like the original just a bit bland. I have given both this &amp; the original Satan's School for Girls four stars out of ten &amp; really don't think there's much to choose between them, not that I'd particularly recommend either mind you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film on Cable in Sydney here we have Foxtel and when I saw that Shannen Doherty was in this film I thought I'll watch it as it might be interesting, well it was Shannen Doherty makes you feel like she takes you in the film and you feel quite involved. She takes her acting seriously and does a good job and has proved to be an excellent actress. Not like the days of 90210 (which I enjoyed) which she got bad press for and charmed but I also liked her in Charmed it suited her. I hope to see her in more films as she has great potential. She has a natural beauty that most other actresses would need to get under the knife for. And so what if she does a lot of this types of films, series, they cast her she makes it she must be hot and it pays the rent doesn't it. Shannen - You Go Girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jawbreaker meets The Craft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very good movie. Shannen Dorhety is always a good actress. It is a must see teen movie. Julie Benz was also performed a good role in this movie also although she still had that dense but dangerous personality like she had in Jawbreaker. I felt the mixture of the Jawbreaker-Craft relationship because witchcraft was used and the girls who were in the movie had the attitude the girls had in Jawbreaker. FLAWLESS!! Hopefully they will make a sequel because of its suprising ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I woke up this morning to find a note from my younger sister asking me to tape the movie because it was on while she was at school. So I did.I didn't think it was too bad, but it would have been better if thy had done it with a different ending.Shannen Doherty plays your seemingly average girl, Beth Hammersmith. However, after her sister apparently suicides, she receives a message saying "Our Deepest Sympathies--The Five". And out of curiosity, she enrols at her sister's college. On her first day, she gets a note saying "Join Us--The Five".She meets the Dean (Kate Jackson). And her roomate allison (Julie Benz). And her roomate's friend Paige. And "Sabrina the teenage b tch"--a girl named Lisa (along with her four goth "droogs", if I may use that term).I'm not going to reveal anything more about this movie in the case that you the reader have not seen it yet.However, I will tell you that the ending is a little too saccharine for this kind of movie. Had they changed it, the movie would be a lit better (and yes, I do understand that this movie was based on a 1970s TVM that also featured Kate Jackson)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie! For once, a tv movie that doesn't pretend to be any more than it is: light-hearted entertainment. I felt that the actor's and actress's portrayals of their characters were right on. They all knew the movie was just meant to be in fun, and it looked as though they honestly enjoyed themselves while making the film.Aside- I would consider this to be the second in the Everyone Wants To Be Shannon Doherty series of movies (The first was the often rerun on VH1 flick Friends Till The End).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing I can say about this movie would be that they didn't fall into the "witch's are evil" trap by calling the girls "satan worshippers" (even though I doubt the general public knows a difference)...And for the bad... I could go on forever, but I just finished watching Ninth Gate, and, the story, in comparison, well, is extremely lackluster... It's nothing but a teenage (..) romp of culturely-defined beautiful women (who act fine for a TV movie) surrounded by bad script writing, cheezy clichés, and special effects that just didn't need to be there.I feel bad for knocking a made-for-TV-movie, since we aren't expected to have a wonderful movie, but why does ABC have to push these clichés in our faces? They could have just replayed Rosemary's Baby if they wanted to show a movie about Satan.. (I've referred to two Roman Polanski movies in this review, is that a good thing?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this movie as I normally don't from made for TV movies. But at least I expected an above average version of "Charmed". And sadly I was wrong. The plot ( Shannen Doherty investigates her sisters apparent suicide ) was disappointing and there are no words for the poor special effects. A few minor twists in the movie couldn't prevent me thinking why I even bothered. Stick with series like "Charmed" and "Buffy,the vampire slayer" or the far better movie called "The Craft". And if you see this movie at your local video store,stay away !!! Say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost, but not quite, one of the great crappy horror flics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had everything going for it as far as being a one of the awful horror movies that is so bad it's funny: it has a really horrible storyline, an even worse script, cheap special effects and some of the worst overacting I've seen in years.The only downfall of this movie was Shannon Doherty, who, though extremely hot, wretched the entire "crappy movie" experience for me with her unnerving indifference. It's like she knew that this was a bad movie to begin with, and so she didn't even try, she might as well have been reading her lines from a teleprompter (which I think she was.As I said, this ruined the experience for me, nothing is more funny to watch then people trying to make serious horror films and failing miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When people say they don't like or watch "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," they think it's like this nonsense. (It's not. Honest!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking TV shows as big-screen movies is one thing (what makes a TV show a less justifiable source of material than a book or play or something? That's snobbery for you - as Lily Tomlin said, when you read a lot you're well read, but when you watch a lot of TV you're not well viewed), but when you start to remake TV movies, it's hard not to wonder if someone's pushing it.Not having seen the original I have no idea if it's an improvement over the new "Satan's School For Girls," but I wouldn't be surprised if it was - much-maligned though TV movies are, you can find some gems there like "The Jericho Mile," "Son of the Morning Star," "The Day After," "The Night Stalker," "The Executioner's Song," "Pursuit," "Brian's Song" (which was just redone for TV) and "Duel" (which as long as Steven Spielberg is around will probably never be). But this tale, which like the original was made by Aaron Spelling's company, is sadly a lot closer to tosh like "Amazons," "Manhunt," "Fer-de-Lance" and "Detour To Terror.""Sleeping with your history professor is so cliched," one of Shannen Doherty's friends says of the Julie Benz character in a pot/kettle/black moment, since she herself is a loudmouthed African-American student at the college around which the "action" revolves. With writing one step up from "Scooby-Doo," a hole-filled plot, chintzy effects (like the red eyes symbolizing that the crows, dogs etc are from the devil), acting that won't give the cast of "The West Wing" any sleepless nights and the worst disguising of locations since "The Frighteners" failed to convincingly pass off New Zealand as California (the movie's supposed to be set in Washington State, but it's all too obvious well before the end credits that it was filmed in Canada - Montreal, to be exact), this movie is everything people who hate "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" think that fine show is - silly, cheesy, and laughable. In truth, barring cast member Benz the two have nothing in common, including quality.Watch "The Craft" instead. Or "Charmed." Or "Bewitched." Or "Sabrina the Teenage Witch." Or even a Winsome Witch cartoon. Or, even, the original movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this at 4:00 a.m. when obviously, there were minimal options to watch at SKY.To be honest, I didn't know the title of the movie until now because it was translated as something involving cupid. Well, I recognized Shannen Doherty and I was immediately hooked in the movie.The plot is simple to follow and deals with witchcraft but it's displayed in such a manner that it's almost comical and makes you wonder if it is an episode to any teen comedy or drama.The performances are cheap but likable. Doherty demonsrtrates that she is a talented actress. Once again, I convince myself taht Doherty had chances to become a huge star but her attitude makes her lose more than she gains.Anyways, this is a movie for fans of direct for t.v. Horror low budgeters. Although don't expect much Horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satan's School for Annoying Girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Satan's School for Girls (2000) * 1/2 (out of 4) Bland made-for-TV remake of the 1973 movie has Shannen Doherty playing Beth Hammersmith, a woman who checks herself into a college soon after her sister commits suicide. Beth doesn't believe her sister would kill herself so she goes to her old school to try and see if anything was going on and sure enough Satan has some evil deeds. The original 1973 movie really wasn't all that good so a remake could have fixed some of the problems but that doesn't happen here and what we're left with is something that makes the original look a lot better than it actually is. Very little in regards to the story has been changed here and while the setting has been updated that's pretty much it. If you've seen the original movie then you're going to see all the twists here coming a mile away and this includes everything at the end of the film. The biggest problem this time out is that it's one of those made-for-TV movies that try to come off "cool" instead of good. I say that because there's no question this movie was trying to appeal to teenage girls and since I'm not one perhaps some might feel I have no business judging the film. I personally don't buy into that and it's really not my fault that the filmmakers thought it would be better to appeal to one group and not to everyone and try to deliver an actual good movie. There's no atmosphere to be found here, the scares are non-existent and the CGI effects are some of the worst you're going to see. Doherty doesn't come off too well as she sleepwalks through the role and none of the supporting players leap off the screen with the exception of Taraji P. Henson. Kate Jackson, who appeared in the original, has a cameo here. SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS features annoying people doing annoying things and the movies just not good enough to sit through all of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was in Sweden 3 times 2001 an 2002. I don't think it was good. First, the whole "The Five" story was totally screwed. The acters were so bad, and the end was the most stupid ever. Not even the very good actress Shannen Doherty could save this pointless thriller...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only one of the worst titles for a film, but actually complete nonsense all round. Shannon "annoying actress of the 90's" Doherty reprises her annoying Beverly Hills type teenager role as she tries to find out what happened with her sister's suicide.The phrase for this is predictable rubbish. Don't bother.</fullReview>
