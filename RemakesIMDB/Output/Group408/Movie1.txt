		<shortDescription>The bad parts are pretty bad, but the good parts are creepy as hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This made for TV horror thriller is a lot better than it's ridiculous title would have you believe, which is really saying something since the title is actually a pretty apt description of what goes on in the movie. It starts out with a girl acting really strangely, running away something that isn't identified and then turning up dead. Her sister doesn't accept the police's quick decision to label it a suicide and close the case. Surely there is plenty of evidence to suggest that they are right, but then again, they don't take supernatural explanations into account so her sister Elizabeth decides to take the investigation into her own hands.Suspicious that the girl's school that her sister attended at the time of her death may have had something to do with what happened to her, Elizabeth enrolls into the school to do some investigating of her own. I don't know how fresh the idea of that premise was in 1973, but it works pretty well here. There are some slip-ups, like when Elizabeth meets the Head Mistress for an interview and spouts some nonsense like "Picasso was a realist painter before he was an impressionist." Not that I don't accept that someone her age would have any knowledge about that (it is, after all, not exactly the kind of knowledge reserved for geniuses), it's just that it's so out of place in this movie. I guess I should respect such an attempt at three dimensional characterization though. Horror movies are, after all, historically lacking in this area.I got Satan's School for Girls on a 10-movie collection that I bought for $15, since I have something of a love of old, crappy horror movies (and you can't beat that price!), otherwise I would never have seen it. To be sure, this is one of those movies that is actually worth watching but has a title that is incredibly efficient in making people want to see it. Who would want to watch a movie with a title like this? I imagine that's part of the reason that the remake with Shannon Dougherty came and went instantaneously with little to no attention. And this really is unfortunate, because the movie certainly has some tense moments. The scene where Elizabeth goes searching the basement for the room where the painting of her sister took place is wonderfully creepy. Even that painting itself is a great prop.The psychology teacher in the movie is a little too obvious. I think it's safe to say that no character should ever act as evil or nutty as this guy did. When he's not threatening girls with a huge knife he's making rats go insane in his lab. This guy can NOT be well balanced. It actually is a pretty clever technique to have designed the cavernous basement like the rat maze in his classroom, but if the person acting insane turns out to be the bad guy then the movie is too predictable, and if they turn out to be completely innocent then it becomes too clear that the movie was trying to deliberately lead you in the wrong direction, which in turn requires a Scooby-Doo ending because they need to explain why we were wrong the whole time in thinking exactly what they wanted us to think.The movie takes something of a downturn in the third act, as the cheesy acting starts to tip the scales against the creepy atmosphere, which is no longer creepy enough to justify overlooking how bad the acting is. There is a ludicrous scene where the professor can't get out of a pond because there are girls all around him poking him with sticks. If they had established earlier on that he can't swim, fine, but any warm-blooded human being, man or woman, would have simply grabbed onto the first stick that poked him or her and yanked the girl holding it right into the pond. It would not be hard to do, obviously. But there I go nitpicking. I just have a hard time with scenes like that. It's like when someone takes a person hostage, holding a gun to their head while the whole police force stands with their guns aimed, and they all drop their guns like incompetent morons. In all my years of movie watching, only twice have I seen anybody acknowledge how effective it would be to just shoot the guy (one was RoboCop, and the other was Charlie Sheen in Navy Seals). You wouldn't even have to kill him, Shooting the gunman in the arm would usually not endanger the victim at all and would completely incapacitate the gunman from being able to fire. There I go nitpicking AGAIN. Stop me next time, will you? I don't remember there being any shooting in Satan's School for Girls (although there is a gun), and there is little to no gore either, the movie is almost solely driven by its atmosphere, which most of the time is not very effective but a few times is VERY effective. For 70s horror, this is definitely one of the better ones (excluding the giants, like The Exorcist, which are, of course, in a class all their own). Certainly worth seeing for horror buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another movie which I have looked for over the years to see on latenight channels but is no longer available I believe. I really liked this because it had an overall scary plot running throughout the movie. Both of my kids, (Nate and Ryann like these types of movies and they are at the right age to spot good quality. I hope if anyone knows if this is still being shown around the country to let me know because I can't find it for anything. If you get a change to watch it, by all means do so. It will not let you down and is a little above a B grade movie. Look at how young all the pre Charlie's Angels are in this flick... Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale Of Two Jacksons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can someone take on the challenge of restoring and preserving all those 'made for TV' movies from the 60's and 70's? Here we have a curious masterpiece... a young woman goes snooping at a spooky American private girls' school in 1973, and gets more than she bargained for.Pamela Franklin plays like a prototype Winona Ryder, short and short-haired amidst the tall, long-haired 'California' girls. Having spent much of her career playing skewed or disturbed British girls, here she is the 'straight' heroine, years before all those current Britishers took on the dialogue coach.She confronts not one but TWO Jacksons, Kate and Jamie Smith-. Both were striking and imposing, both tall and long-haired... and when contrasted with poor Cheryl Stoppelmoor, both quite fascinating. Jamie is quite captivating playing the freaked and frightened Debbie. Kate is a mess of contradictions - beautiful yet straight-laced (check the night-gowns - Jamie sports a slinky red number, Kate is buttoned up in high neck and frills)... one Jackson sadly retired (as did Franklin - why?), the other unwisely shyed away from unsympathetic roles and found fame as a glam' detective (in polo-necks and neck-covering scarves).Ultimately not the best entry in 1973's TV movie offerings, yet in the 21st century it's worth a look for the fantastic casting choices!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this on USA while I was home sick with the flu. Even though I was half awake and in a daze, I enjoyed it. Pamela Franklin was likable as a young woman who enrolls in the exclusive Salem Academy under a false name, in order to investigate the strange death of her sister Martha, who had gone to school there. Once she arrives, she meets up with strange faculty and students, and eerie occurences. There are great shots of Pamela crawling the hallways at night with a lantern in her hand as a storm rages outside, and there is an eerie climax. Catch this one if you can. I haven't seen the remake yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the mysterious suicide of her sister, a young woman enrolls herself in the girl's college she was attending to investigate what really happened. This 70's telefilm can sort of be looked at as an earlier, far less extravagant version of "Suspiria". After a strong opening, emphasis is firmly placed on the investigation aspect. We get a solid cast, as was often the case in these old TV efforts. Pamela Franklin, so good in "And Soon the Darkness" and "Legend of Hell House", plays the lead role of investigating sibling. Also present is the lovely Kate Jackson, as well as Cheryl Ladd under a different name. It's interesting seeing these two together before they would later go on to star opposite each other in "Charlie's Angels". Not too surprising when you consider that both this movie and that show were Spelling productions.There are some good moments here, but a few too many scenes of exploring dark corridors slow the film considerably. The ending is predictable, but I suppose that's to be expected given the title. It's worth a look, but don't expect one of the better TV horrors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Disappointed With Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another of those flicks inspired by the success of 'Rosemary's Baby'. When that movie came out, the nation developed an obsession or preoccupation with the devil or the whole concept of evil in general. I even remember seeing a '60 Minutes' segment at that tender age which reported that while many people were less religious or didn't believe in God, many others believed in the Devil. At least, that was the synopsis given by Mike Wallace's opening segment voice-over.'Satan's School For Girls' is one of those ABC titles that can be easily found today compared to, say, 'The Screaming Woman'. Sometimes you pick up a bit of trivia by watching these old television movies. When I watched it a few years ago, I didn't realize that Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd, who was using her old surname of Stoppelmoor, had acted together before 'Charlie's Angels'. Kate Jackson is superb in her role as the level-headed, innocent Roberta, who appears to be the only person Elizabeth can trust. I have a problem with the ending, though, which gives the viewer the impression that Roy Thinnes, as the cult leader, not only has special powers but isn't of this world at all. But hey, it's a movie about the devil, black magic, satanism and the disturbing reality that good doesn't always win - at least, not totally. That was another thing which became common in entertainment: allowing evil to win. I guess this was a product of the nation's loss of innocence and disillusionment with events like the Kennedy and King assassinations, Vietnam, and the Watergate scandal. We all sort of 'grew up fast' after those events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mediocre 70s late night horror show has its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TV movie (Aaron Spelling co-produced) delivers chills roughly along the lines of contemporary drive-in fare. We get a bevy of satanic schoolgirls, led by Thinnes as the visionary art professor who turns out to be Satan himself. We even get a wannabe Sacey Keach in the supporting cast. No nudity, actually a minimum of catfights, but surprisingly good suspense is generated a few times (though not at the film's conclusion, by which time everything is pretty much clear and obvious. Notably bad editing. The DVD from "Platinum Disc Corp" is from a very bad print.</fullReview>

I truly miss this whole era of these sort of stumble upon a Satanic cult movies.I am a fan of Kate Jackson's horror work, so I may be biased... But, I really like this movie, it's simple yet effective. Satan's School For Girls is your typical Satan school movie but it has a clever storyline, along with creepy atmosphere, and great cast that actually acts rather well. This may be my favorite Kate Jackson horror flick. I have viewed this movie several times and I actually own it. So, if you like old creepy occult films, I would recommend you give this movie a try, it fits well in that category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of my all-time favorite made-for-TV movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, everybody is always ragging on made-for-TV movies because yes, more often than not, they are really cheesy. But keep in mind made-for-TV movies are made-for-TV, so they are, of course, made on a much smaller budget. However, this is one TV film that rises above its low-budget status. This, for the most part, has to do with the supremely talented cast involved. '70's Scream Queen Pamela Franklin, fresh out of Richard Matheson's nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, stars as a young woman who enrolls in a distinguished all-girls' school to probe her sister's mysterious suicide. The plot reminds me of Dario Argento's horror classic SUSPIRIA, but this TV movie was actually made four years before Argento's film, so perhaps Argento pilfered from this little seen gem. Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd, before they became 'Charlie's Angels', co-starred as two of Franklin's fellow classmates. Incidentally, Jackson later played the Jo Van Fleet role of THE HEADMISTRESS in the 2000 remake. Aaron Spelling produced both versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off with a bang, ends with a whimper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the whole problem with this film. The opening scene is fantastically done with Terry Lumley as Martha Sayers on the run from some unseen but clearly deadly menace that it seems can get to her no matter where she runs and/or hides. It's too bad this level of suspense and thrills could not be maintained when it was star Pamela Franklin's turn (as Elizabeth Sayers) to be terrorized at the school for girls her sister had previously attended. Sure a nice effort is made by a very talented cast including Roy Thinnes, Kate Jackson, Jamie-Smith Jackson and Lloyd Bochner to keep the excitement going but in the end this falters and loses that hard edge it had when it opened. Perhaps some of this is the fault of the limitations inherent in this appearing on television in the 1970s but honestly I feel the real reason is that they reveal too much in terms of clues and visuals making the previously terrifying and mysterious menace seem much less threatening when it is finally revealed, in fact it proves somewhat anticlimactic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With good intentions and a title that's impossible to live up to, this early-70's movie of the week finds its strength in scattered moments of suspense and performances that give the hammy material every chance to transcend its lower tier. A pre-"Legend of Hell House" Pamela Franklin (cute as a button, a dead ringer for Thelma from "Scooby-Doo") infiltrates a girl's school to try to find out why her sister committed suicide; she is aided in her quest by a pre-"Charlie's Angels" Kate Jackson. The adults are, like, squaresville, and the student body seems to be harboring some far-out secret, which leads to a totally unsatisfying climax. The restrictions of network television show throughout?despite being set in an all-girls school, there is no flesh on display (not even skimpy negligee), and instead of throat-slashings, we have to make do with death by bamboo sticks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes,even the angels once had a dark side. I saw this movie 35 yrs. ago on ABC Movie of the Week when I was 11 years old. I thought it was pretty scary at the time for a TV movie. Of course,TV horror movies back in the 70's had a way of scaring people without being gory. It did for me anyway.This movie is about a woman named Elizabeth played by Pamela Franklin(The Legend of Hell House)who wants to find out why her sister died.(She won't believe it was suicide)So,she goes to the all-girl school her sister attended appropriately named "Salem's Academy".(That should tell you something)There she meets two girls Roberta and Jodie played by Kate Jackson(Dark Shadows,The Rookies,Charlie's Angels,Scarecrow and Mrs.King)(Did I leave any out?)and a young(unknown at the time)Cheryl Stoppelmoor later would change it to Ladd and rejoin Kate Jackson on "Charlie's Angels". Well back to the movie.Elizabeth tries to find out what happened to her sister, but no one seems to know nothing or do they? Why is everyone she talks to seem to be clueless about what happened to her sister Martha or too scared to say anything? Still,she's determined to find out what happened to her sister and she may find out more than she expected.This movie also stars Roy Thinnes(The Norliss Tapes,The Horror at 37,000 Feet)as Professor Clampett. Also,Jo Van Fleet and Lloyd Bochner.Speaking of Charlie's Angels, there was an episode where Sabrina and Kris went undercover at an all-girls school. I've always wondered if that episode was a tribute to "Satan's School for Girls"? I guess I'll never know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you miss Charley's Angels, then this is the movie for you. It's got two out of three angels in this campy witchcraft flick.Poor SALEM! The town just can't live down that unfortunate witchcraft hysteria from 400 years ago. So here's another Devil film for Salem. This movie was pretty goofy, but I liked how the students called the administror "Dragon Lady" and never referred to her as anything else.I only ever saw two teachers in this film. The animal psych teacher was a mad sadistwhile the art teacher was a lecherous hippy. The headmistress (aka Dragon Lady) was a useless old drunk. The Salem School seems to have been a pretty big place and yet they seemed to have about 30 students (evidenced by the use of only two transport vans when they evacuated the school). I've also never heard of a college that uses alarm bells to signal the end of various classes. It's a shame that no effort was made to restore this film. My biggest beef with this film is just how bad the DVD transfer was. It had vertical lines all over the place, very muddy color, and more pops and hiss than a winter hearth full of wet wood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- A young girl seemingly commits suicide for no reason. Her sister Elizabeth (Pamela Franklin), feeling that something was terribly wrong, takes an assumed name and enrolls at the all-girls' school her sister attended. In short order, two more girls commit suicide. With the help of her friend Roberta (Kate Jackson) she is determined to get at the bottom of what's going on.- Most people I know do not care for this movie as much as I do. Oh, I certainly can see the problems with the movie, but I tend to overlook them. There are a few creepy scenes and I always get hooked by the story (what little story there is). It's kind of like a poor man's Suspiria. Most of the real plot points, however, can be seen a mile away. For example, do you really have to stretch your imagination to guess what might be going on at a 300 year old school in Salem, MA where eight of the former students were accused of being witches? I know it's a toughy, but just try to guess. Still, this doesn't take away from the fun I always have with Satan's School for Girls. Also, it's a real blast to see future Charlie's Angels Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd before they became famous.- For me, though, it may be more of a nostalgia thing than actually enjoying a good movie. I can remember seeing this when it originally aired in 1973. I was 9 years old when it aired that September. Satan's School for Girls scared me so bad I couldn't sleep. I really wish they still made TV movies like they did in the 70s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Terry Lumley. Driving around in a frantic state, trying to reach her sister by phone, and feeling like she's being stalked like some rat caught in a trap with a cat lurking nearby. Approached by some unseen creature of darkness, she begins to scream, and all of a sudden, she turns into what looks like a Dali painting, her thin face becoming as equally horrific as the fate she is about to meet. This sets up the rest of this somewhat silly 1970's T.V. movie which has a cult following and includes such familiar faces as Pamela Franklin (as the poor victim's sister), Kate Jackson (as a student who becomes Franklin's pal when she enrolls to try and find out what happened to her sister), Roy Thinnes (as a new wave thinker and art professor), Lloyd Bochner (as another eccentric professor), and in a rather campy part, Oscar Winner Joy Van Fleet as the headmistress nicknamed "The Dragon Lady". Van Fleet isn't exactly a dragon lady; In fact, she seems an unwilling participant in the mayhem and macabre goings on, and having given a few camp performances, she is far from as melodramatic as some of those past performances. Certainly, something terrible is going on in the school as half a dozen girls are found dead in the sinister looking basement, and nobody can figure out why, whether it was suicide or murder, and if murder, what kind of motive lead to it. To be honest, I frankly found it dull, and having seen it years ago at a more impressionable age, it doesn't hold up all that well. Many T.V. movies did better jobs with equally horrific tales, most memorably "The Devil's Daughter" and "The Initiation of Sarah", but frankly, they are all rip-offs of "Rosemary's Baby".</fullReview>

The pace is slow but steady and enjoyable if you're not looking for a lot of spooky, creepy, eerie developments. I do wish they had added some more supernatural goings-on. If it weren't for the horror-ish ending, this film could be categorized as a straight mystery as a young girl goes to the school her sister attended to try to discover if her death was really a suicide or something more sinister. Shannon Doherty played the lead character in the remake of this movie made for TV in 2000. If you're a fan of good low-budget, made for TV 1970's movies, try this little flick.

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by the title or the sanguine cover art. This is a moderately suspenseful movie that probably wouldn't make a 10-year-old lose any sleep. As a result, it's not a bad "spooky" movie to watch with the family. Although it's unrated, it would be at most PG for some mild violence. The only people who might be offended by this would be those who find the whole concept of witches and devil worshipers offensive and they probably aren't looking at this comment anyway. It's also not a particularly outstanding film and the main attraction, I think is the chance to see Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd pre-Charlie's Angels.

I've told many people about the movie over the years saying it was one of my favorite horror movies. I liked the setting, actors and plot. It's a great combination of elements. There are not a lot of movies that have stayed in my heart as long as long as this one without having seen the movie in over two decades. I just recently discovered Kate Jackson was in Dark Shadows and I checked her credits and that is how I found the name of the movie I have cherished all these years was Satan's School for Girls. I had thought Kate Jackson was in this movie but it was hard to be sure since I was just a child when I saw it. I can't wait to rent or buy Satan's School for Girls now that I know the name. I'm proud to be a Kate Jackson fan from before her Angel days with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie managed to slip by. It should, at the least be a cult classic, but unless you accidently see it on cable, or someone tells you about it, you never hear of it. This is a lively, interesting movie, that works better than a lot of movies that cost much more to make. You also get to see Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd before Charlie's Angels. If you get a chance watch this movie, if you like occult horror, you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you would think... In fact a perfect 666</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This horror "masterpiece" has gone unrecognised and forgotten for so many years, but in fact it's an UNFORGETTABLE MOVIE! It reminded me of 1980 movie Friday The 13th, which is quite well-known as a "classic" horror flick (so to speak). But this movie was made seven years before, and is a lot better. If only this movie hadn't been ignored for so many years, then it may have been a "classic" today, with Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare On Elm Street.A definite for horror lovers. It's a perfect 666, not any more, not any less. Not 665 or 667, but 666.I would give it a 9.5/10. Well worth watching...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy 1970's Made for T.V. Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 12 years old when this made for TV movie came out in 1973 and I remember watching it with my twin sister. We both loved watching all the t.v. movies of the week, especially the scary ones.This one stars Pamela Franklin as Elizabeth Sayers, a young woman whose sister Martha allegedly commits suicide. Elizabeth doesn't believe that her sister would kill herself, so she goes to the Salem School where Martha was attending to try to uncover what really happened to her sister.The movie has some truly creepy moments, such as when Elizabeth is roaming around the dark school grounds with a lantern during a storm. There is an underlying sense of doom throughout the movie.Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd, both future stars of Charlie's Angels, are in supporting roles as student's of the school, as is Jamie Smith-Jackson, who was in several good made for t.v. movies in the 1970's, for example, Go Ask Alice. Whatever became of her? JoAnn Fleet plays the headmistress of the school and Roy Thiennes is a creepy professor. Without giving too much away, Elizabeth discovers that there is a satanic cult at the school, hence the title of the film.Of course the movie has it's cheesy moments, but hey, this was a made for t.v. movie after all. I think it is one of the better ones, and the ending was a surprise to me. If you love 1970's made for t.v. movies I highly recommend this one. It's much better than the remake starring Shannon Daugherty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even campy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pretty dull. I usually love getting old TV movies on ebay and watching them many years later (examples: BORN INNOCENT, DAWN PORTAIT OF A TEENAGE RUNAWAY,BAD RONALD) Usually it makes for a good campy trip down memory lane. I had seen the re-makie with Shannon Doherty and decided it was high time I saw this much-buzzed-about Kate Jackson flick. Well, it started out promisingly enough, but then it got dull. There really arent shockers or coming-at-ya grabs to the flick. In fact, a lot of the "murders" take place of screen, and the "death methods" arent original at all. The biggest downer of all is the ending, where...Not a whole lot happens. we already have been shown who members of the coven are so we're not surprised, and really all the Witches do is wear white robes!!!! Even the "satanic presnece" isnt all that menacing. A real let down of a movie, although I DO wanna give the poster verna55 her due credit: yes, this movie IS similar to the much better SUSPIRIA. Now THATS a flick you should check out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pre-"Charlie's Angels" gathering in a devil's den...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Campy title for a rather mundane Aaron Spelling spook show has the sister of a suicide enrolling in a private school for young women to uncover the truth about what occurred there. Two of the students are Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd, future TV detectives (too bad David Doyle's Bosley isn't around to referee the cat-fights). If you're yearning for a "Charlie's Angels" episode about witchcraft and devils, this may be as close as you'll ever get. Unfortunately, the film is given such a blasé treatment, with listless direction and uninspired writing, that even one surprise about a character's true identity goes almost unnoticed. Purely from a filmmaking standpoint, this seems awfully undernourished, though it is interestingly cast and has moments of lowbrow fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lowell Rich's "Satan's School for Girls" is an atmospheric,early 1970's horror/mystery which has plenty of atmosphere and some reasonably suspenseful moments.The film is completely bloodless,so fans of gore will be disappointed.The acting is pretty good with familiar TV cast to boost.So if you like horror movies from early 70's check out "Satan's School for Girls"-still it beats most of the crap being put out today.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some chilling moments without much else going on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Satan's School For Girls' really looks like a cool vintage seventies satanic horror-thriller, but regardless its über-cool title, that doesn't necessarily make it a great movie. When Elizabeth Sayer's (Pamela Franklin, delivering a decent performance) sister commits suicide, she works her way into the private school her sister went to. It doesn't take too long for her to discover other girls have been dying too. The concept is nice and it's not a boring watch, but the mystery is a little weak and the denouement is underwhelming. Features a bunch of good-looking seventies beauties, but no skin and no blood. Some ladies do die, and those scenes are pretty much the only shocks this film has to offer.Interesting trivia: during the '70s, legendary producer Aaron Spelling ('The Love Boat', 'Dynasty', 'Beverly Hills 90210', 'Melrose Place',...) produced several made-for-TV horror movies, and with having watched at least one more of them (the amusing 'Cruise Into Terror', 1978), I strongly suspect they all might be enjoyable watches. So is 'Satan's School For Girls' to some extent, even if it's a quite forgettable film. Makes me curious to see what the remake from 2000 (also made-for-TV and produced by Spelling) might have turned into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not bad, made-for-TV movie from Aaron Spelling and co. Although predictable for the most part, it has engaging lead performances and a sense of straight-laced melodrama that offers up a few surprises intermittently. Fans of "Charlie's Angels" will be interested to see Jackson here before she went on to bigger things, but the lead performance from Pamela Franklin is just as noteworthy (whatever happened to her career?). Moderately successful atmospherically, but hardly ground-breaking, it nevertheless isn't the worst of the wave of similar films from the same period, and it certainly has its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This review has no spoilers. They are all in the movie's title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got no spoilers here, the movie is already spoiled.A fairly standard, run-of-the-mill, sexy-70s-chicks whodunit. And who dun it this time? Satan, of course. Says so in the title.Funny thing about movie titles, they often either intentionally mislead you or they give you the mega-spoiler straight away. Why this title was chosen, I really don't understand, because with a non-Satanic title the end-twist would have been a genuine surprise.The spoiler-title as a means to get you to buy the ticket - only to realize you'd been cheated out of an end-twist for the exact same reason why you paid for the ticket in the first place. Talk about irony. Except that, of course, this is a TV movie hence there is no ticket to sell. But whether TV or big-screen, the goal is the same, and the same effect of not offering the viewer that much in the "grand finale".A few suggestions: "The Horror-Ridden School For Girls", "The Girls That A Person Whose Name Begins With 'S' Likes To Mess With", "The Weird School For Girls That Might Be Dabbling With Things That Girls Would Normally Not Dabble With", "The Girls, Their School, &amp; A Man Whose Name Is Similar To 'Stan'". Etc. All those titles are spoiler-free.Two-thirds of the original "Charley's Angels" are in this one (the cute blond and the forgettable gangly brunette). This might give you some indication of the cheese levels in SSFG.However, some types of movie cheese can be enjoyed. SSFG has that nice 70s feel, an attractive cast of females, and it runs under 90 minutes. Last but not least, it has Pamela Franklin, and that alone is reason enough to throw a glance at this obscurity. For some reason they cut her hair very short for the role, AND she didn't take her clothes off, but you can't have everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh...What was I thinking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read through the other user comments about this film and was astounded. I can't believe that people actually liked Satans School for Girls?!?! A made for TV lamefest. Great title/concept and stars 2/3rds of Charlies Angels - but the film just can't get going. Not scary, not interesting, terrible pacing. Not even really a movie, more like a fluffed-up episode of Six Million Dollar Man - or some other 1970's Sunday evening pablum.Taking the commercials out of TV movies exposes how truly empty they are. A 90 minute TV show minus the commercials does not magically become a movie. The spell just isn't complete without having your brain erased every 12 minutes by ads for Alka Seltzer or All Temperature Cheer. One of the most empty films I have ever seen. There is absolutely nothing compelling about Satans School for Girls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler As far as TV movies go, this has to be one of the worse. There are a few scenes that can be remotely considered good, the scene where she first enters the wine celler. That scene actually held my attention, as for the rest of the movie I laughed at it, and not in a good way. As for everyone else who says this movie is great, they must have been stoned while viewing it, the acting had me staring in disbelief in my own stupidity for purchasing it, and the directing had me throwing up. Everyone who watched it with me said about the same thing "What the hell is that", I had to quietly slink away to avoid the embarrassment. The movie did have some promise, with the woman that kills herself(supposedly), but it is basically downhill from there. I give it a 2/10. 2 points for the 2 good scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hold on to the edge of your seat! This is one exciting ride!The story finds a young woman creating an alias so that she can attend the same school her sister did because she is convinced that her sister did not committ suicide, but was murdered instead. One of those rare excellent made for television films of the 70's with a cast of raising stars. It is not the best film plot wise, but the film starts out strong with a lot of momentum and it never slows down to the point where it is ever dragging. It is exciting and fun from the very beginning to the end.Not Rated, but would probably earn a PG. It contains some violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satan's School for Girls (1973)** (out of 4) Made-for-TV flick about Elizabeth Sayers (Pamela Franklin), a woman who checks herself into a college under a fake name after the suicide of her sister. Elizabeth doesn't believe her sister would kill herself so she goes to the college to see what's really going on and sure enough other girls have killed themselves or is something much darker going on? Yes, the title pretty much tells you what's going on in this Aaron Spelling flick that has some good performances and nice atmosphere but very little else. At 78-minutes the film seems twice as long and the main reason why is that every single scene just keeps dragging on and on to the point where you simply stop caring about what's going on. It also doesn't help that the director seems to think that you're going to come to the film scared and that he doesn't need to do anything except having strange looking actors playing male parts and have scary music constantly going on the soundtrack. Just check out the opening scene where we get a couple males who just look creepy and yet this is supposed to make us scared. This trick happens throughout the movie as every male role is either played by an elderly man made to seem weird or of course there's the one good looking guy and you know what that means. There's a nice music score here but it gets played to death so much that you really can't help but roll your eyes and wish someone would hit the pause button. Even though it's not creepy at all, the film at least contains some nice atmosphere but I've found most TV movies from this era, no matter how bad they are, to have this one quality. Another good thing are the performances with Franklin doing a nice job in the lead role. The supporting cast includes strong performances by Jo Van Fleet and Kate Jackson as well as a very good turn by Cheryl Ladd in an early role. SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS offers very few shocks, no scares and there's really not too much going for it. In a decade full of Satanic films you can find much better ones to spend your night with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satan's School for Girls starts as Martha Sayers (Terry Lumley) arrives at her sister Elizabeth's (Pamela Franklin) house looking for her, Elizabeth is out but the gardener lets her in but soon hears screams coming from inside. Elizabeth &amp; the police arrive &amp; the cops break the door down to find Martha dead, having seemingly committed suicide by hanging herself. Elizabeth refuses to accept the suicide theory &amp; since her sister Martha's time at the Salem Academy for the Performing Arts is rather vague she decides to enroll at the Academy herself &amp; play detective in order to find out the truth behind her sister's death. Elizabeth befriends several girls &amp; starts asking questions, then some of her classmates also turn up dead having apparently committed suicide which Elizabeth refuses to believe is a coincidence. Elizabeth discovers some dark past secrets about the Academy &amp; it's dark cellar that involve the occult &amp; Satanism as no-one is quite what they seem...Originally broadcast on the 19th September during 1973 on the ABC channel in the US &amp; subsequently released on various budget DVD editions this has a great title but unfortunately not much of a film to back it up, directed by David Lowell Rich this has one or two good moments &amp; passes the time I suppose but overall I didn't think that much of it. The bland &amp; rather routine script takes itself very seriously &amp; is more of a creepy mystery thriller with supernatural aspects but the title, the one thing that may draw you to this in the first place, gives away the films big secret! To be fair the twist is fairly well sign posted, the school is called the Salem Academy, stories of Witches being burnt at the stake in the cellar &amp; various pupils turning up dead hint at something Satanic anyway so there's no great surprises when everything is revealed at the end. Actually when I said everything is revealed at the end I exaggerated, it's never revealed why the girls were killed or even if they were killed or it was suicide, who killed them &amp; the mystery surrounding the locked doors where they find Martha hanging &amp; just who the hell is Abigail? That old Headmistress keeps talking about Abigail for no apparent reason other than she's slightly crazy. Motives &amp; actions are unclear while there's something about Mice stuck in a maze which might have meant something back in 1973 but now seems odd. The character's are alright, at only seventy three minutes long at least it's short &amp; as I said it has a few decent moments.Since Satan's School for Girls was made for television there's no blood, gore, profanity or nudity so it has to be said the film doesn't really live up to it's fantastic title. Obviously filmed in the early 70's it's a product of it's time with some very ugly fashions &amp; interior decorating but it probably looked good at the time. There's not many scares here, there's a scene in which a guy is drowned &amp; there are some nicely shot scenes of girls wandering around the dark school &amp; creepy cellar but nothing that will give anyone sleepless nights.Filmed in California future Charlie's Angels (1976) Kate Jackson &amp; Cheryl Ladd appear here, the rest of the cast are alright but a bit bland like the film itself really.Satan's School for Girls is an OK way to pass seventy odd minutes but don't expect anything surprising, in fact the exploitative title gives the entire plot away &amp; renders any attempts at mystery redundant. Amazingly this was remade as Satan's School for Girls (2000) for US television &amp; again for the ABC channel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, if not too spectacular TV horror outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made for television horror films, especially those of the 70's are an odd bunch. Usually lacking in significant budgets and hampered by having to be tame enough to appeal to a wide audience they sometimes came up with great moments to make up for these issues. Trilogy Of Terror had its awesome final segment, Horror at 73'000 Feet had its constantly mounting strangeness and Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark provided very good reasons to be afraid of the dark. Satan's School For Girls, with its enticing name and excellent opening looks like its going to be every bit as good as its companions, but it falls short. The cast is variable, with Pamela Franklin (The Legend Of Hell House) on fine form, very appealing and supported by the cute Kate Jackson. Roy Thinnes is reasonable as a popular teacher and Loyd Bochner good as a seemingly shifty one. The film is fast paced and fairly short but, whilst always watchable does not make too much of an impact. The title gives the game away so the creeping around and mystery that take up a lot of time is really not mysterious at all. Also, the acting,aside from the main roles, is a bit weak and the ending is abrupt and a tad disappointing. There are good moments though, one pretty creepy kill, some fun jolts and a good spooky atmosphere at times, helped out by the dramatic score. Its all easy going, time filling stuff, recommended to oldie horror fans who don't like anything too strong or indeed that strong at all (this film probably rates about a PG13 certificate or a 12A in the UK). Its never boring or tedious, it has a cetain appealing zip to it and should provide perfectly adequate entertainment, it just won't blow any minds. Mildly recommended.</fullReview>
