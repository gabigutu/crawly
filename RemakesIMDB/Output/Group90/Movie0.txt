		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of the late 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many comments written about this movie, I almost don't want to write anything - but here I am anyway :)Though everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it disturbs me to read negative comments that WOD is 'too slow' or that Wenders should have been a still life photographer. I think that some people are missing the point of this movie. Wenders filmed this after having been part of the Hollywood machine for several years, and had grown sick of the cookie cutter films that were (and still are) being made in that tradition to produce ticket sales. Yes, this movie doesn't have loads of action and car chase scenes and guns and sex. It does offer some interesting perspectives. The consistent third person view and 'objectification' of the viewer is one aspect. Watching WOD, you don't feel the typical draw into the movie as so often is the case, but rather are a bystander, looking through a window, with your own thoughts and ideas a part of the movie, not the other way around. WOD doesn't allow you to become a subjective part of the film; it 'pushes' you away from empathizing. Even the camera angles and shots motivate this sentiment. The goal and direction of the film are presented without struggle or thought; you know that Damiel wants to be with Marion. He tells Cassiel this, and the only question is - how will he achieve this goal? WOD belies a sense of traditional film-making. Peter Falk is presented as perhaps the 'idea' of history as fans call out 'Colombo!' The angels are bound to Berlin, existing in a purgatory neither heaven or hell, unable to communicate. The trapeze artist from a traveling circus representing freedom - not only freedom from an everyday lifestyle, but also the key to Damiel's freedom. This movie contains so many interesting ideas and perspectives, that when watched with an open, curious mind, it is fascinating, mesmerizing, calming and inspirational. Filmed entirely in Berlin, the city is not a traditional definition of beautiful. But the industrial, modernist, post WW II reconstructed Berlin is stunning and diverse, providing the perfect background for this modern classic. I cannot recommend this movie enough. But please watch it with open eyes. In the same sense you cannot listen to the music of Schoenberg or Stravinsky as you would Mozart, you cannot watch Wings of Desire as you would a Spielberg movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&amp;#65279;human life has value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&amp;#65279;In the first scenes after the opening credits, we see an aerial view of Berlin, but this is a Berlin that doesn't exist anymore. It's a city divided, between East and West, that still bears the scars of the second World War, and can't rebuild where the Wall stands in the way. There is a vast vacant lot where the cultural center of pre-war Berlin stood, with the facade of an old station, and nearby stands a bomb-shelter and the tower of a bombed-out church.It is from this church where an angel stands looking out over the city, and then we see the people going about their daily lives. All this is shot in black and white, and we realize that we are seeing the world through the angel's eyes, seeing the same colorless world and hearing the same thoughts of the people around. As the story goes on, we realize that this is not just one angel in Berlin, for he goes to a car showroom, and compares observations with another angel. Then we go to the library, which is filled with angels.The first library scene is my favorite scene of the whole movie. It is here where we see many different people studying, and their thoughts reverberate around the space until they are just a murmur, which becomes music. Because there are so few distinct voices, it doesn't matter that they are in German, which I don't understand. However, there was one young man studying the creation story of Genesis in Hebrew, which ties in with a later point where the two lead angels are discussing how they witnessed creation. First they saw the glacier recede, then fish and animals appear. They laughed when they saw the first biped, someone who shared their image, but they stopped laughing when the people learned how to make war.As idyllic as the angels' lives are, it is through the pain we humans endure that know we are fully alive. And this is what the angels miss, to see colors, to touch, to taste, to smell, the ability to love and affect others' lives. The children can see them, but the adults may at times only feel some vague presence. They lay hands on people's shoulders, to try to understand their feelings beyond mere words. This is illustrated by a scene on a rooftop, where a man is about to commit suicide; as he sits on the ledge, an angel lays a hand on him as if holding him back, and when he jumps, the angel shouts `no!' For these angels are observers, spending their time being a presence among the living, not just to primarily serve as ushers to the afterlife (where I was sorely disappointed after watching "City of Angels," the American re-make). They are not harbingers of doom, but benign symbols of a creator's concern for humans.Don't be turned off by the fact that it's in black and white, because one thing that really makes an impact is that it's only through viewing as an angel is it in monochrome, because when humans see the world, it's in color. A poem continues throughout the movie and ties everything together, repeating "When the child was a child..." and we realize that humans are the children, the ones younger than angels, just learning and enjoying life. The music adds a lot to the movie, since this film is more visual than verbal, which means that subtitles don't get in the way. I can't say enough about this film?it's wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most emotionally and spiritually moving film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A note to those of you who have only seen the bland, woefully wrong-hearted and half-assed "City of Angels", an unnecessary Americanization of this modern classic: this film leaves Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan in the dust. Co-writer/director Wim Wenders spins a visually stunning tale of angels living in Berlin before the wall came down. As they float through the lives of all they encounter, one of them falls in love with a beautiful and lonely trapeze artist. He soon must choose whether or not it is worth sacrificing the endless grace of being an earth-bound angel to know what it is like to be human, to "see at eye level."After having seen this film eight times or so, I can safely say that it is my favorite movie of all time. I have to watch it at least once a year and every time I do, I discover a new detail, while still being enchanted by the things that made me love this film in the first place. Although leisurely paced, every scene makes a valuable point about how our lives are touched by divinity every day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkable Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A visually beautiful film, which boasts one of the most poetic and literary scripts ever- the dreamlike poetry of the dialogue fits seamlessly in with the overpowering visuals. The acting is of very high callibre too, with Peter Falk adding a very welcome dimension to the film and Bruno Ganz proving a master at acting via expression and nuance. The storyline is nice and simple and is given much additional poignancy and depth by the way Wenders directed, Henri Alekan photographed and the choice of music for certain scenes- the use of Nick Cave's "The Carney" is especially perfect for the scene in which it was used, as was the music during the main scene where we get to see Marion's Trapeze act- the music, visual mastery and the act itself combine to stunningly entrancing effect. That 100 people have given this film a 1/10 mark is almost beyond belief, as it is an absolute joy from start to finish. Rating:- ***** (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Town for the Cold War Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If my grandchildren ever ask me what it was like back in the Cold War, I'll tell them to watch this movie. It is both frighteningly bleak and lyrically beautiful. It captures the spirit of the times (Western civilization immediately before the fall of the Berlin Wall) better than any movie I've ever seen. And it manages to be a love letter to those times while also showing the place and time in all its inescapable ugliness. The overall plot moves forward pretty nicely for a movie where plot doesn't seem to matter all that much, and there are some beautiful vignettes, beautifully photographed, acted, and directed. I'm not sure how anyone can make it through the movie without falling in love with Bruno Ganz's angel. I think the movie's lyricism holds up well on multiple viewing -- as long as you liked it the first time. If the self-consciously art-house form bugs you, however, or you find the screenplay's "poetry" to be too facile, you'll probably find this movie grating. I, however, have never seen people reading silently in a public library without thinking of this movie . . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lyrical and haunting work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two angels named Damiel and Cassiel are onlookers on the lives of people in Berlin. Damiel longs to become human mainly because of a trapeze artist he has become drawn to. Both dote on how the world would look if they could see it with color, feel of things, and breathe air. The angels in Wim Wender's "Wings Of Desire" are separated by the rest of the world and see this world in black and white. They look upon the many sad happenings that occur, how people go about their daily lives. The angels take notes and share lifelong memories of people they have looked upon over the years. They can hear people's thoughts and how they feel about their lives. Damiel is the one the movie focuses on more. Cassiel understands Damiel's desire, but doesn't long for humanity iname way. The film isn't coy about the fact that being an angel could be quite lonely and sort of exasperating. The film's dialogue(mostly thought)from the people across Berlin are more lyrical. It's as if their thoughts are a daily constant of Shakespeare..a long tragedy of loneliness among other emotional longings. The trapeze artist, Marion, is quite a thinker and always feels as if someone has always been their to guide her through the paths of life. Peter Falk(Yep, Columbo)appears as himself playing in a film in Berlin. Many address him as that famous detective. He, like the children, can sense the Angels' presense around him..and there's quite an interesting reason why he can. The film is very pondering and haunting. Life is quite bleak. Berlin is a fascinating setting for a film like this. We often see what history has done to Berlin..the scars show such devastation, yet this brings an element that reaches out to you. We see that life goes on around the ruin..the devastation. The angels have seen that ruin first hand. The film has Cassiel following an old dying Jew. There's a particular scene I love which has the old man walking down ruined streets. He says to himself,"This can't be Potsdamer Platz." He continues to walk and remember the places that use to exist where only ruin reveals. This scene, among so many, define the film's elegant melancholy. The film really is an unforgettable gem. Towards the end, our angel Damiel makes a decision to accept a life as a human. This adds to the film's overall dilemma. I asked myself,"Are we taking things like smelling coffee, touching an apple, or simply watching the rain as it slides from a gutter for granted." The opportunities to exist and live should be appreciated somewhat. What if we are on the otherside of the spectrum? What if we had to look at others living and breathing and smelling? *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the first time. This film is simply amazing. So subtley powerful. The climaxing scene at the bar, is like seeing the world in a grain of sand. There, just now. Did you see it? There it is again. And again, over there. You didn't see it? Watch and you'll see. This film has just made #1 on my favorite films of all time. The way they use Peter Faulk to trancend the boundry between art and life, or perhaps erase the line all together, wonderfully creative. We are guided gently in to a world full of fallen angels, and then brought full circle back home again. This is simply a must see movie. I find it hard to imagine anyone not getting something out of this movie.</fullReview>

Look carefully and you will see its influence in the most unexpected places.I always thought that one masterpiece is all that anyone can aspire to in life. Wim Wenders has made several but for me this one stands out above all others. My favourite film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can never be a film-maker because of Wings of Desire. It is such a stunning work, I know I could never match it, much less exceed it. I have never seen a film that spans such great heights (pardon the pun) of the spiritual, the social, emotional, political and existential. It's the most gorgeous love story I have ever encountered and its anguish and exilaration is unparallel. But enough of the Critic-Speak. This movie shows the loneliness and wonder of being alive and if you remain unmoved by it, you must have no soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poet re-discovers life, love and beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing that any non-German speakers can even appreciate this movie. True the basic story is universal and beautiful, but it's Peter Handke's poetry that makes it breathtaking. Wenders had done other Handke works in film - Alice in the Cities, The Lefthanded Woman, The Goalie's fear of the Penalty- but this one is very different.This movie is about giving up the ethereal life of the observer and actually living it. Handke had lived as a hermit after his wife's suicide and raised their child alone for 10 years - claiming all he needs of a woman is a good prostitute every so often. This movie script marks his turn to the pure love of life that this dreary Goth never really displayed, even in his youthful writings. It's the wonder of the child within discovering life in all it's beauty -- in even the most mundane and everyday things.************ PLOT SPOILER ALERT ***********The job the angels that nobody seems to have noted here is this: They can exist in all times flowing through one spot (Berlin) and must record instances of Humansexpressing "Spirit".A damned rare thing, it's true, but they must record it whenever they can.Hollywood chose to leave that notion completely out of that horrible Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan "Vehicle" remake.(Worth it for the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Mick Harvey's Crime and the City Solution alone)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophical, Beguilingly Poetic and Spiritually Significant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Digging deep into the thoughts and dreams of mortals and the angels who look after them, WINGS OF DESIRE is a masterfully-made work of art and Germany's finest. It matches lavish cinematography, flawless direction by Wim Winders, impressive performances and a simple plot told with such brilliance, symbolism and will.The first half of the film resembles more like a beautifully-painted mosaic or an avant-garde film showing empathy for every character brought about by the screen even showing traces of the Nazism era. Here, the idea of supernatural beings that indirectly assist humans in day-to-day life is introduced. The mystifying beings are unseen to everyone except to the young-at-heart. Hovering atop statues or wandering inside public libraries or apartments, they see and know everything as Winders etches the black-and-white world of the angels. The story evolves when one angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wonders what it is like to be human, how it is like to be able to feel, to hold or to be seen. Once he comes to the aid of attractive trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he feels a spiritual devotion he has never felt before.Winders' slow-but-steady rate gives time for the viewer to contemplate on the questions a child asks ("Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here and not there? When did time begin and where did space end?"). He allows the audience members think what they want to think in a new light instead of manipulating them. The scenario of a ghostly being falling for a human may seem overworked now (GHOST, JUST LIKE HEAVEN) but WINGS OF DESIRE is a fresh, innovative piece of cinema with remarkable photography and unbelievable performances. Henry Alekan's cinematography is both insightful and visually dazzling. Every camera angle takes on a new connotation. Ganz and Dommartin are equally irresistible as two different "people", who worlds apart from each other; both characters are looking for love, no matter how close Damien is from Marion. Peter Falk, playing himself, is an amusing attribute to the cast being "Columbo" in the popular TV show. Being a mysterious character himself, he metaphorically adds a little color to the film amidst all the spellbinding drama and discloses an entertaining revelation that helps the film progress.This revolutionary masterpiece of craftsmanship is considered by many as the greatest non-US movie ever and it deserves all of its praise entirely. WINGS OF DESIRE breaks new ground in romantic and dramatic film making. Every scene in this movie offers a chance for hope, understanding and compassion. Unbearably creative, outstanding and poignant, this superbly-made motion picture is not another art-house flick. Astounding.WINGS OF DESIRE was remade in Hollywood as the sleek yet disappointing CITY OF ANGELS(1997).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that addresses German before the Berlin wall fell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the Second World War the continent of Europe was divided not only by political beliefs and economic strife but the continent was also physically divided by a wall that was constructed through Berlin. This wall built by the satellite communist countries under the orders and pressure of Moscow to keep the ideals of the capitalist west out of their city and the minds of their people. The wall was to instate this `out of sight, out of mind' mentality in to the hearts of the people that the communist were trying so hard to control as their system was failing in the post war world economy. The wall remained intact until 1989, but during this time period a dramatic era of film was created that begged the main questions of the time: Where do I belong? What country do I call my own? Do I turn to others?Wings of Desire uses the idea of an omnipotent force that watches over the world from the beginning of time and records the actions and thoughts of man, a creature that amazes and bewilders them. This force of angles know the world and mans mannerisms through and through but yet does not truly know the extent to what man experiences and feels in everyday life. To show a stark contrast between the living world and the angles, the angels are portrayed in black. This same black and white footage is used to show East Berlin as a collection of persons who are not really living life either. They are instead people acting out the basic image of what modern life should be. As the main angle falls in love with a French circus tumbler her image switches between black and white ( as she discovers the clam feeling he brings her) to one of vibrant color after he falls from `grace.' The West side of Berlin is also shown in this collage of vibrant color as he discovers this grand new existence that he was missing.The main angle also has several interactions with an American film and TV star Peter Falk (Colombo) for the actor senses the presence of the angle. He entices the angle to give up what he has and come to earth by being one of the first actual persons to talk directly to him. The audience later is presented with Peter Falk being a previous angle that fell from `grace.' He represents temptation of what can be found when one crosses from one life path to the next. This idea is also the pressing idea of crossing from the East Berlin side to the West, of crossing from a world that is limited and controlled to one where there is unending possibility. Where man can discover all that he wants to know on his own, for it not to be feed to him.Through voice-overs, where the character does not participate in the common dialog that a script would have, the audience experiences life in this torn city through the thoughts and feelings of the people that live there. The voice-overs continually address the complex and intriguing questions that all persons could not audibly ask, for no one knew the real answer. The difficult questions of longing, unplanned futures, anxiety filled the hearts and minds of people all over the world but the people of Berlin embodied them. `History is ours, and the people make it' ( Salvador Allende 1973) is a fitting quote for the people of Berlin as they were the leaders of the world as the guided and survived such a torturous time. Wings of Desire is a film that leads the audience on a narrative that is gripping and induces thought and discussion of the world's social issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully beautiful -- handle with care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie playbill for the American version of the movie (the one you see on the site) is quite misleading: a naked woman in the background with the title "Wings of desire" -- it almost looks as the movie should have some erotic content. But there's nothing here which will try to appeal to your immediate senses. This is a poignantly beautiful metaphysical excursion on what it means to be human. Wim Wenders has recognized the metaphysical nature of the movie by dedicating it to Truffaut, Ozu and especially Tarkovskij. And everything -- the bleakness of the landscape, the ubiquity of the Berlin wall, the anguish in which the characters are immersed -- acquires a deeper meaning when we see it through the eyes of two angels. And the sky over Berlin, with its angels, is the only thing that keeps together two painfully divided sides of the city, and the only perspective from which to see it as one.But handle with care: if you're looking for a movie with an enthralling plot, a clear language and a reasonable pace, you'll be disappointed. The first time I saw this movie with a friend we laughed all the way. I've seen it more 5-6 times now and I've stopped laughing. I sit there and I'm mesmerized.The movie was born without a script and it is a melting pot with dialogues by Peter Handke, improvised monologues by the actors, connecting material written by Wim Wenders. In one example, Wenders indulges too long in a scene just because he regrets removing it due to all the work the actress has made for preparing to be a trapezist. This is clearly against all rules and all common sense.Despite all this the movie works and the reason is, the movie somehow manages to touch deep strings all the way through, because of its beautiful imagery (thanks to director of photography Henri Alekan), its eerie soundtrack, the disorderly collection of truly poetic dialogues/monologues, very inspired acting, and the impredictable combined effect of all this -- surely beyond what was planned by Wim Wenders himself. Should I add that the movie has created its own language for making its point?The film has also become an incredible documentary on Berlin just before the fall of the wall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin, allow me to say that I am not some blockbuster-movie junkie who only watches action movies with a lot of special effects, where the main character beats all his enemies, manages to win one million bucks and a beautiful lady by the end of the movie. I am no stranger to long and slow-paced movies. My favorite directors include Andrej Tarkovski, Luis Bunuel, Aki Kaurismaki, to name a few.But "Der Himmel über Berlin" is a pure horror. As you probably learned by now, the movie is about two angels wandering the streets of Berlin and listening to people's thoughts. This is amusing for few minutes, all right, but goes on for more than 90 minutes. And the thoughts the angels are listening to are pointless, hold no message whatsoever. One of the angels falls in love with a mortal woman and wants to become a mortal himself and spend a life with her. Clearly, the main message of the movie is: spiritual love alone can not fully satisfy even an angel.In a desperate effort to add a dramatic character to this movie, director places it in Berlin; a city torn in two pieces with the wall and city which suffered great destruction and tragedy by the end of WWII. OK, the history of Berlin and Berliners is dramatic, but it should not be present in this movie, where central point is supposed to be the internal conflict in one of the angels, caused by feelings toward a mortal woman. To my mind, placing this movie in Berlin only proves that director was aware that his main story is to weak on its own. I really had to put a big effort to last through this movie. But I said to myself: "Don't give up, wait and see what will happen when the angel finally becomes mortal and meets the love for which he gave his eternity. But even that was pathetic. He met her 8 (eight) minutes before the movie ended, and it was one of the most pathetic and naive love scenes ever filmed.The only good point in the movie are the main actress' legs. That is the reason why I give this movie two stars: one for each of her legs.Wings of desire leaves certainly a lot to be desired for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing! To be honest i was really really sleepy coming into class today and when i found out that we couldn't watch it in the preview theatre, i thought to myself, "Great, time to sleep". Plus when i heard that the horrible "City Of Angels" is a remake of this film, i felt that i was in store for more of "City Of Angels"' type of love, angel-ish crap.I'm glad that i was totally wrong. Never doubt a film until you've watched it for yourself.Wings Of Desire is a thought-provoking movie. The type that makes you stop in your normal, day-to-day routine and think of the things we rarely pause to think about. For example, the poem at the start of the film where it begins with "When a child is a child" part; i felt that it made me think about how we were the most curious when we were very young. How innocent that age was and how idyllic it would be to stay that age. Alas we all grow up. Some turn out alright. Some turn out to become Hitler.Which brings me to the point of how this film really seems to be a commentary of Berlin and perhaps, post-World War II Germany in particular. There is a scene whereby the 2 angels are in a care and they are exchanging notes about the time of sunset and sunrise as well as what happened 10 years on that exact day. Then Cassiel is about to talk about what had happened 50 years ago, during the World War II, when Damiel cuts in and motions him to move on. It is as if Damiel is the voice of Germany and he is too ashamed to talk about the past. In fact it is suffice to say that all those flashbacks of WWII is to show the horrors that Germany had seen and endured throughout the years.As for the how the story is shaped. I agree that it is similar to Italian Neorealism or French New Wave due to the fact that the story lacked a strong goal. Again we can say that we cannot really tell what is going to happen from one scene to the next. And while one may feel that the less-than-normal structure is too complicated. I feel that it is good that we can watch and then try to understand the many layers of storyline that is within this film. To me, it sure beats watching that dumb "City of Angels".If there is a scene that stood out the most, i believe that the library scene is the most powerful one of all. First of all, the camera movement was breathtaking. It would dolly from one side of the second floor and then using a wire overhead, it would go to the other side. This gives us a sort of floating feel. And although one may argue that it is part of a distanciation effect. I would feel that the main purpose that Wim Wenders did that is to give us a feeling of how the angels would move around. They could walk like normal human beings but if need be, they could float as well. And then there was the thoughts that emanated from all over the library. One thought would echo and then another. In the end all of the murmurs would drown each other, as if to show the hundreds of thoughts that go on in the library. Simply said, this scene is magical.This film has so many layers one would feel that it would not be boring to watch it more than just one time so that all the layers are uncovered one by one. Yep, better than Citizen Kane. Wings Of Desire ist nummer ein!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have a good flick through the quotes page before considering watching this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd read a lot of good things about Wings of Desire, so when I finally got around to buying a copy of the film expectations were high. I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens.In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout.There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying.If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 1987 film by Wim Wenders was intended to be a paean to Berlin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1987 film by Wim Wenders was intended to be a paean to Berlin but ended up as a romantic expression of hope. It has a number of distinctive elements that make it transcend mere romance, though.Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander play two guardian angels who oversee much of the actions and thoughts going on in the divided city (the film was made in 1987). These two actors are excellent. Ganz and Sander had worked together as actors for 20 years before this film was made, and their camaraderie is obvious. Much of the film was shot in black and white by Henri Alekan, who did the cinematography for Cocteau's "Beauty and the Beast." Ganz's and Sander's roles in great part are merely watching and reacting to the streams of consciousness of Berliners, and they are masterful in passively listening with their hearts on their faces. The use of black and white brings their faces into subtle, shaded relief, mirroring their inner feelings. Cinematographer Alekan (you will notice that the trapeze artist is in Circus Alekan) was born in 1909 and died in 2001. His work here reminds me of the cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa in "Rashomon." The camera work and tracking are intricate without ever being obvious, bringing focus on the actors and their faces.The score is by Jurgen Knieper. He wrote an angelic score without being campy or heavy handed. The music is understated and perfect. He uses strings and a choir to make spoken words into music that fits the scenes.The frail elderly man that wanders in and out throughout the movie represents Homer, the original story teller. Homer frets about losing his touch. He's played by Curt Bois who was born in Berlin in 1901 and who had a short scene in "Casablanca." This was his final role; he died in 1991. The use of Bois is bittersweet, as he was a famous actor in Berlin in the Twenties and Thirties before he was forced by the rise of the Nazis to leave the country.Wenders surprises with his juxtapositions. In black and white we see an old man in modern Berlin get into a classic Thirties car and drive down the street. Then we see a view from within the car looking out onto a color film of 1930s Berlin full of Nazis and red flags with black Swastikas in their hearts; a cut and we see black and white film of Berliners digging out of the rubble with rows of corpses lined up beside the street as we drive by in that car. Then we arrive at a movie location in modern Berlin with actors in Nazi uniforms and Peter Falk waiting for us, and we realize we've seen what the car has seen during its life. We have a sad scene of Bois as Homer wandering near the modern Berlin Wall looking for Potsdamer Platz as it was in the Twenties and Thirties, when it was the heart of Berlin and the busiest intersection in Europe. In 1987, it was a desolate wasteland of refuse and weeds, and Homer collapses into a junked chair, weary from his fruitless search.Wenders also introduces subtle tension by giving us the thoughts of characters, showing their depression or anxiety. Then Wenders puts them into positions where we have the possibility of "accidents" or intentional acts. Each scene is played out slowly, without dramatic music, realistically as we watch and wait to see the outcomes. It's very nicely done without melodrama or histrionics, but like the "lives of quiet desperation" quote we all know.The movie seems to be best known for its soaring hope - in spite of all the wars, death, and destruction, we have guardian angels looking over us. We find that the angels envy us, and Ganz's angel crosses the river and becomes human, reveling in the human senses, seeing in color for the first time (black and white shots represent the world as seen by angels bereft of our senses), and finally finding love, the most human condition of all."Wings of Desire" reminds me of a few movies. As I said earlier, "Rashomon" is comparable in cinematography. If you treasure the cinematographer's art, I recommend "Wings of Desire" and of course "Beauty and the Beast." I was also reminded of Truffaut's "Fahrenheit 451" in the scenes where people learning books walk around giving lengthy quotations as snow fell - a condition existing in "Wings of Desire," as well. Finally, I have a reaction to "Wings of Desire" that I had to "Donnie Darko": I think the director left too much to the audience to fill in. There's no real story to "Wings of Desire," just a series of interior monologues, which we the audience have to string together into our own coherent whole. Some people are put off by the lack of action and plot, while others take full advantage of the opportunity to vest the movie with their own plot and feelings. "Wings of Desire" is definitely a movie for adult contemplation.The American film "City of Angels" with Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan was loosely based on "Wings of Desire." The two movies do not bear comparison; do not avoid "Wings of Desire" because you found "City of Angels" to be a sappy Hollywood romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When judging a film, I use different criteria: The story, the acting, the soundtrack, the cinematography,... Only in exceptional cases I find films that score high on all criteria, and this is the case with this absolutely brilliant film. The story is most original and refreshing: the metaphysical tale of the angels is a great way of confronting the viewer with the universal aspirations and dreams of mankind in a way that it remains simple and direct. The acting by Bruno Ganz (Der Amerikanische freund, l'éternité et un jour, Der untergang) is as usual terrific, and the role of Peter Falk is most amusing. The last scene of the film, with Nick Cave singing in the back, is just awesome, especially the final monologue. The nice soundtrack accompanies images of a rare beauty. The black-and-white shots of Berlin keep hanging around in your mind for days, this is actually one of the films were the cinematography is so terrific that you could print posters of every single screen shot. What can I say more: Wim Wenders is a genius, and this is art in it's purest form! Philosophy, poetry and film blended together in a unique and ever-lasting masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Der Himmel uber Berlin has unsurpassed moments of poetry and clarity. It also demands a lot of attention and patience on the part of the viewer. Even after seeing it a number of times I find new, interesting and moving things in the movie.Some vignettes from the movie astound me as I see inside someone's experience or see things freshly through them. The framing poem by Peter Handke gives meaning to the whole movie. It's one of the things that I respond to most strongly.There are very minor choices in movie that I think could have been made differently, but at the same time they do not significantly detract from my enjoyment. Wim Wenders gives a lot of screen time to Solveig Dommartin as she works the trapeze and thinks to herself in her trailer. She certainly needs time to get audience's sympathy and attention among all the other characters, but some of her screen time seems a little indulgent. Also, some short glimpses into people's lives are not as effective as others--especially the later more non-specific "noise of humanity" sequences. The noise of humanity is well established in the library scenes and other sequences towards the first of the movie and the later less concrete vignettes do less for me than the earlier ones.The movie is more of a visual and auditory poem than a traditional plot-driven movie. Plots do exist, but they are not relentlessly forwarded by everything shown on screen. You'll do a lot of people watching and find both grimness and despair as well as joy and beauty. It's a movie about experience, humanity, and both the joy and the pain of life. If you view it receptively, there are many entire worlds within the movie that you'll be able to enter momentarily and perhaps get a better view of your own world.Watch this movie. It can be an amazing experience. You will need energy to pay attention, patience with the pacing, and a willingness to deal with some confusing aspects of the movie. If you don't have these things it might be better to come back to the movie at some other time when you feel more receptive. It is well worth the payoff, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never really takes flight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviewers here fawn over this film and dismiss anyone who does not share their worship as being juvenile or a philistine. I've watched enough films to know whether a film is truly profound or whether it is pretentious. Wings of Desire sways towards the latter.It has a great premise- angels (not winged creatures but men in cool black coats, similar to the portrayal of the dead in Orphee) watch over late eighties Berlin, observing the humans they see around them. One angel (Bruno Ganz) falls in love with a mortal trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin). You would think that this would be a winning formula and therefore a brilliant film. I was disappointed to find out that although it may not be a bad film, it is by no means a brilliant one.The cinematography is great, although the monochrome angels and technicolour humans had already been done 40 years previously. We get some great shots of urban Berlin, which gives the film an interesting cultural context. It almost acts as a time capsule, and had Wenders concentrated on this aspect of the film, the film would not seem as unfocused and vague as it does.The worst part of the film is the dialogue, which is pseudo-philosophical naval gazing. I don't mind introspective dialogue but when every sentence is some vague existential musing, I tend to tune out, which is fatal for this film as the action is essentially in their internal monologues. The trapeze artist's final monologue could have worked had the whole film not been composed in that way but the monologue is basically a repetition of what has been constantly repeated throughout the film. Some arty types might forgive this because they see it as some universal truth but for most, it is simply repetitive to the point at which it becomes meaningless.I forgot the love story! Seems that Wenders did that too because it only makes an appearance in the last half-hour or so of the film, although there were tiny hints earlier on. Because the romance is so unprominent for most of the film, when it finally comes to it, you wonder why the film was two hours long and not one hour. Apart from the misjudged monologue by the trapeze artist, it is quite a romantic scene. Her dress is stunning.Potentially a great thought-provoking film but self-indulgence on the director's/writers' part causes the film to feel unfocused and vague. The film tries to deny its artificiality by adding in lots of 'profound' dialogue but there are many points in the film where it comes off as very superficial. It's a bit like a New Romantic pop video.</fullReview>

Should have been a short art-house movie of some sort - 20 minutes max.Oh, and the cinematography was incredibly annoying. Almost all of the movie was shot in a hazy brown and white, with an irritating angle lens that made everything seem distorted. The dialog was an attempt at intellectualism that got old after about 5 minutes. The acting... well, let's just say these weren't the most challenging roles to perform, with the main actors playing either robot-like angels or themselves (Peter Falk).Take my advice and don't waste your time on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In West Berlin, still surrounded by the Berlin Wall, angels Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) spend their time observing human life and comforting those in need of it. They compare their observations, and marvel at the joys, quirks and special moments that are experienced by humans. When Damiel overlooks lonely trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he falls in love, and the desire to leave his observational duties behind overwhelms him, and he ponders the idea of 'taking the plunge' and becoming re-born himself. He and Cassiel have also taken a special interest in visiting actor Peter Falk (playing himself) who is in town to shoot a World War II movie.The opening half an hour of this film is simply one of the most beautiful openings to a film I've ever seen. It is incoherent, and drifts seemingly randomly from person to person, as we hear their inner thoughts and experiences. Damiel and Cassiel drift around a busy library that is full of fellow angels comforting those studying and seeking answers. Even those in distress seem to please Damiel, as it is one of the things that makes us human. His life so far has been full of mere observation, and he longs for pain, worry, or fear, or something that will finally allow him to actually feel something. As much as this film is about humanity, it is equally about war.As Damiel and Cassiel walks the streets of the still war-scarred Berlin, they discuss how they witnessed the First Days. They saw the first river reach it's shore, and the very first animals appear. They talk about they both laughed when the first human appeared, being born in their image, and opening it's mouth to say its first word. Was it 'oh' or 'ah', they try to recall. But then they stopped laughing when the humans discovered war. The Berlin in Wings of Desire is still full of rubble and half-destroyed buildings, and the inhabitants are still very much effected by the war. Cassiel takes a special interest in an old man named Homer, who is looking for Potsdamer Platz. Laid to waste during war and still lying desolate, the man only finds a chair in a field and graffiti-stained walls. He wishes for an 'epic of peace'.But as well as portraying the dark side of humanity, it also celebrates the best of it. When Damiel comes across Peter Falk at a coffee stand, Falk feels his presence. He talks about how when he is cold, he rubs his hands together to warm up, and how good it feels. Damiel watches him in awe, and longs for the taste of coffee and a cigarette. When Damiel finally takes the plunge, the film turns from beautiful sepia monochrome into fully-realised colour. It's the same effect done in A Matter of Life and Death. It's a simple yet beautiful statement about how we can miss the things that are right in front of us, if we fail to just open our eyes.It's a sentimental film that if anybody else's hands may have come across as patronising or whimsical. But Wenders directs with such as beauty and a poetry that it never feels preachy. He focuses on the basic human emotions and dissects them in such a complex way that is rarely seen in cinema - he also did a similar thing with his powerful Paris, Texas. An absolutely wonderful film that is truly one of the most moving and beautiful I've ever seen, and a true and a honest depiction of the human spirit. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, a man should be deemed crazy and out of his mind for even being able to watch this movie without squinting out of boredom. The movie depicts the life of angel who falls in love with a mortal woman. You get to hear their thoughts. Actually, that's all you get to hear throughout the whole movie - some guy muttering and mumbling something in a philosophical manner; it could actually have been interesting if it hadn't resembled Nitsche's words all the time. Nonetheless, kudos to the director for his superb use of the camera; I've never seen a single shot last so long. Seriously, sometimes I felt like like the operator was asleep during the filming or something. Did I note the gorgeous actors that vivaciously portrayed the characters in the film? Like, even my guinea-pig could have shown more emotions. And he's dead. So yeah. If you really hate someone, then buy them this movie for their birthday. Nothing worse than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Berlin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderfully shot, poignant record of Cold War-endgame Berlin. Wenders also creates a more-than-implicit parallel as his angel crosses over not only from eternity to mortality but also from West to East. These are quietly registered but affecting moments in a quiet, affecting film whose poise and gesture is as lyric as the Rilke poetry in its script and at its heart.For a seriously intended film there's lots of fun, not least on the playful, youthful face of Bruno Ganz. This is one of the two key roles of this film, the second being a stroke of genuine casting genius in bringing Peter Falk in to play himself. Falk's involvement seems tangential to begin with but the pungency of his characterisation is beautifully calibrated to fit his role in the story.The third character of first-tier importance is that of Berlin, grey and battered but robust, with scrawny youthful optimism growing like hardy flowers growing on stony ground. That biblical reference may be mine but Wenders' key scene of lover's connection, through a one-way mirror, is straight out of 1 Corinthians, "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face" The same text starts with: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love... it profiteth me nothing".The romance of the b&amp;w vs colour photography and the gigs, including that of Weimerish Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, seem as present now as 25 years ago. Surprisingly, its the interpolated verse that thickens the otherwise consistent lightness of touch elsewhere. But it is, generally, a lovely film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Wings of Desire for the first time yesterday. I am a thirty-year-old male in film/TV production and had wanted to see it for quite some time, having heard from so many people that it was a film I would love. Just my luck, it was playing as a double feature with 'Faraway So Close' up the road so I got to see it in a theater.I don't want to sound like some kind of a weenie, but I mean to tell you that it is quite possibly the most beautiful film I have ever seen (and I've seen A LOT of films). I wasn't fifteen minutes into it (when Marion was sitting on the vehicle after her rehearsal), when I realized I had tears streaming down my face. They barely abated throughout the course of the film, and by the end of it I was choked-up, calling friends to share my experience.How often does that happen in a movie theater?I've never seen "City of Angels" either, and am in no hurry, as I fear it may dilute my original experience. "Faraway" was an equally wonderful film, but more (pardon the expression) "down-to-earth", existential (in a fascinating way) and, finally, less "transcendent".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It scares me that Wim Wenders could make a movie this stunning after already authoring several other masterpieces (Kings of the Road, the American Friend, and Paris, Texas). Those movies, in their own way, are magnificent and, largely, spare--especially Paris, Texas. There is a verbal reticence in Wings of Desire (or The Sky Over Berlin, which is a better title and more appropriate), but this film is absolutely lush. That it's black and white makes this lushness all the more stunning. I've written recently about Les Enfants du Paradis and how luminous the photography was in that movie. That shimmer is gone here, but Wings of Desire feels metallic (in a good way). And then there's the story...pure romance, to be sure, but handled sincerely. And, what's more, it's not simply the romance between two people--it's the romance of the world. This is a movie in love with our planet and our people and, pretty much, everything, but it's not cloying. Wim Wenders, though sincere in his love for Earth and humanity, doesn't ignore our faults or the pain and suffering that occurs here. This is a film about humanity by someone who is both frustrated and amazed by the world, and that makes this film perfect, thematically. Of course, some may argue that the movie meanders for more than an hour, but that's the point. The lives of these angels are, to an extent, desultory. Only when Damiel begins to fall in love is a discernible narrative able to develop. It's really quite an amazing bit of screen writing, in my opinion.In addition, you have the wonderful Bruno Ganz, the inimitable Peter Falk, and the beautiful Solveig Dommartin. Their performances are immaculate and, frankly, help keep a gorgeous and esoteric film grounded. Oh, and the songs by Nick Cave are perfect. All in all, this is one of the best movies to appear during the 1980s and one of the best movies to appear in the last century. Its sense of affirmation, frustration, beauty, and sadness is utterly amazing. It's tremendous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often heard people referring to this movie as an "Art Movie", as if to say: be prepared, it's going to be boring, long, bleak and sad, but you are supposed to say you liked it because it is art. If you think along these lines, then don't watch this movie, because it is going to deliver what it promises.But if you have no preconcepts, a heart and a brain, then you will love it.It is a movie that stirs thoughts and emotions, and you will find yourself thinking about what you saw for a long time. It touches difficult topics, heaven, angels, the human condition, the power of will, hope, love, and it does so with a grace and sensibility that is almost painful. On top of this, add superb acting, inspired photography, the city of Berlin, and a lot of children.It is a little sad that 17 years have passed since Wenders shot this masterpiece, and nothing that followed (from him or anybody else) came even close to it.It is not a movie that you want to watch every week, in fact one vision lasts for few years, the same way you don't need to read War and Peace more than once every ten years, and this is probably the best analogy: Der Himmel über Berlin is a classic.One more note: I enjoyed the remake (City of Angels), it was somewhat good, but it never actually crossed my mind that it was intended to be a remake of this one, so far are the two from each other. It is almost offensive that Der Himmel sold itself to Hollywood and was saccharined into a romantic comedy, but I suppose that money rules the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this is what it's like, being an angel? Kind of wandering around the streets and in public buildings, listening to people's private thoughts, and occasionally placing one's hand on their shoulder? Where's the gratification in this? Being conscious of routine and commonplace inner dialogs? Is this what we've to look forward to? If so, I'd opt for physical immortality any day.Apparently this poetic film touched a deep emotional (or would it be spiritual) strain in many viewers. Critical reception ranged from 79 to 97/100 and Peter Handke's dialog (inspired by Rilke) was duly lauded.For myself, I appreciated the striking monochromes of then 77-year-old Henri Alekan, shot forty-one years after photographing Cocteau's classic "La Belle et la Bette" (1946).In the end, though, I couldn't see much point of such sleepy angelic agenda. No wonder some of them longed to become human again -- and apparently a few may have made it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful film. Quite a feat for a mostly B &amp; W movie; actually, the color segments are letdowns. It is about the angels who parade around among us, unseen, observing. They are all rather poorly dressed. As they travel, it is implied that children, in their innocence, can sort of see them. The angels hear all, feel nothing.Our main character angel, played by Bruno Ganz, becomes interested in a pretty trapeze artist, and wishes to become human to enjoy the breadth of that experience ... preferably with her. Peter Falk can sense him, and somehow knows what's up. Peter Falk is playing Peter Falk.The dialog, read by me as subtitles, is often powerful and poetic. Even the mundane is given a strange power as a part of the human experience. The cinematography is wonderful. Scenes are unhurried, sometimes too much so. The actors are dutifully Euro-sleek. Falk is a scene stealer without seeming to try.Worth a look. Just don't expect Nick Cage and Meg Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wings of Desire is a film that tries to make you feel like you are a part of it; trying to make you feel like you are one of the two angels in the film. What makes this movie unique is that the angels present in the movie are not your ordinary guardian angels but angels that are brought to Earth to look after human beings. In Wim Wender's film, the angels are invisible walking through the divided city of Berlin. Standing above the world on tall buildings, statues, or trying to comfort victims in trouble, they compare notes while they watch and listen to the people around them. The film presents a mood of meditation and loneliness as we see the patients of two angels: Damiel and Cassiel fighting to realize what it is like to only be able to see everything but not able to participate in the events. They listen to worried parents, victims of the past, passengers on trains, and frequent walkers. They were in Berlin back when the wall divided it; they have been there before Hitler and were able to witness World War II.This is a slow moving film, which has no plot but keeps you involved in its twisted turns and unknown facts. Right when you think nothing will happen, the movie takes a turn and angel Damiel decides that he wants to be human. Falling in love with a trapeze artist he goes ever night to a circus where she performs in the center ring. Damiel and the other angel Cassiel discuss how it would be to be able to feel things that humans feel, being able to get dirt on your hands and being able to peruse in life. Children are often times able to see the angels but the adults have that loss. The angels cannot directly affect their lives but they try to learn new things as the days go on. The colors in this movie are important. This movie is in black and white during over half of the movie. This is significant because to the angels, the world is a black world that they have watched everything about but know nothing. And after love strikes and Damiel becomes human the movie appears in color. It represents the humans and the happiness of Damiel. He finally can experience pain and joy and he has a chance to win Marion's heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I learned to be amazed by this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly every film I've rated as a masterpiece won its place in my heart for capturing Buddha's lesson- life is suffering, and, as Ofelia's mother put it in Pan's Labyrinth, the world is a cruel place. Wings of Desire is likely the greatest film that comes at it from an opposite angle, and is amazing in a whole new way. Yes, there are depressed characters, a prostitute, a suicide. This isn't a naive film. But the overall message overcomes it all- we can focus on the positive.As a story about an angel, Damiel, who longs to be human, Wings of Desire can open a viewer's eyes as to how the physical world is not a bad place to be. We see what the angels lack that we have- colour, touch, taste, freedom. We learn we can be amazed by these things, and should be. There is something mystical to the woman who folds up her umbrella and lets herself get soaked, to the child who describes how a fern grew from dirt to an astonished teacher, to the boy who listens to The Odyssey and stops blinking. The divine and the amazing are all around us, for anyone who knows where to look.Peter Falk, who plays himself as a former angel, lays it out in his companero speech, in my opinion one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema. It's wonderful to be here, he says, to have coffee, to rub your hands together, to draw. He offers his hand as a gesture of friendship- Damiel chooses to take it, indicating he has overcome his last bits of reluctance to "take the plunge." His fellow-angel, Cassiel, who earlier couldn't help himself from smiling at the thought of mortality, does not take Falk's hand.The feel of the film, as a whole, has an otherworldly, poetic tone, thanks to screenwriters Wim Wenders and Peter Handke, the latter whom contributed Song of Childhood, which runs through the film and helps tie it together. This contributes to the stunning, awe-inspiring feel of the film, only enhanced by the Criterion Blu-ray. It's particularly the black and white scenes that benefit from the exceptional detail, sharpness and texture. Even the circus and the music of Nick Cave take on divine meaning in this film.The film ends with a "To be continued..." which will nag everyone to see the sequel, Faraway, So Close! (1993). It disappointingly loses the whole tone and message of the first film; the message of Faraway, So Close! appears to be "Oops, turns out the world sucks after all. Stay away, angels." I don't blame The Criterion Collection for not releasing the two films as a double feature. Wings of Desire is only one film, unlike any other, and truly a stunning experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Angels have been frequently cast as characters in movies such as Heaven Can Wait, It's a Wonderful Life, Angels in the Outfield and the American remake of this one ... City of Angels with Nic Cage. Director Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas 1984) has always taken a poetic approach with filmmaking, even with his documentaries such as Pina (2011). His slow, thought-provoking approach is not to everyone's liking, but he has real talent for inspiring us to question ourselves, question others, and question life.Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two long-term angels who drift through WWII Berlin observing and listening to the internal thoughts and meandering of citizens ... the wishes, the hopes, the happiness, the tragic, the loneliness ... all emotions experienced in a typical day. The angels try to ease pain by offering a soothing hand on the shoulder, but they can have no direct impact and aren't always successful. Damiel finds himself drawn to a Marion (Solveig Dommartin), a circus trapeze artist whose line "Most of the time I'm too aware to be sad" could easily have been the words of the angels.There is an over-lapping subplot with Peter Falk playing himself as an actor in a German film. His character provides an instant infusion of interest and mystique, which the story later resolves. As Damiel gets closer to making the no-going-back decision to become human and bond with Marion, we see more of the fleeting moments that make up our lives. The angels see all, but can do very little. It's this existence that makes Damiel's decision understandable.Famed cinematographer Henri Alekam's floating camera and dramatic contrast of black &amp; white (angels view) and color (human view), add to the meditative effects of the film. There is a healthy dose of philosophy, metaphysics and spiritual questioning that goes on, including the three specifics asked by the film: Why am I me and not you? Why and I here and not there? When did time begin and where does space end? If such thoughtfulness is inspiring to you, then this Wim Wenders and Peter Handke (German playwright) script should keep you drifting with your thoughts for quite some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This beautiful film would have been better as a short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was truly captivated for the first forty minutes of this film. As the camera seemed to sweep around the city of Berlin taking in the internal dialogue of all it encountered. The crowning moment of the opening scenes was a section filmed in the city Library which was just breathtaking.After this I quickly became bored. Apart from a brilliant cameo from Peter Faulk and a great scene in a Nick Cave gig the film's themes had little more to offer me. The cinematography was excellent throughout however, with a memorable shot of a bus in the twilight and a few timely transitions from black and white to colour.I would like to see this film cut back to a nice little 20 minute short. My Mother in Law disagrees on this point and thought the film was just perfect.Worth a stab but prepare for tedium. (The film... not my mother in law)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wings of Desire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mix of satisfaction and disillusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first half, this movie is unique, distinguish, inspiring and poetic. However, it is let down in the second half, becoming just another random movie.This German motion-picture challenges personal beliefs, but one mustn't take that too literally. This is a story of invisible and immortal angels (well played by Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander) who populate West Berlin and have two specific missions. One of them, however, gets bored with immortality and always seeing and never sensing or experiencing anything, therefore he chooses to become a mortal.The vast majority is shot in an excellent black and white save for brief moments when the world is seen through real people's eyes. In other words, the reason why they use black and white is only to represent the world as seen through the angels's eyes (and it works!). Up to that point, the movie is a visual treat, because of the beautiful scenario and the black and white that suits it combines so well. The words and messages are often poetic, which results in something like food for the soul.Once one of the angels trades eternity for life, the movie becomes colored and to be sincere it looks horrid. The problem is more than just that: the movie itself becomes lame, although even before that it already begins to get inferior. Those bits with musicians singing those crappy songs, for example, are partially responsible for this ruin.Flawed as it is, nevertheless it is unquestionably much better than that rubbish 'City of Angels' with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan - and very different too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>poetry in motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compelling, ponderous, exasperating, enigmatic, demanding and beautiful: Wim Wenders' rediscovery of his native Germany from its most symbolic city is all this and more. His spellbinding portrait of Berlin, past and present, is poetry in motion: a haunting, hypnotic masterpiece that lingers in the memory long after its final image fades from the screen.From the opening aerial shots to the last (admittedly long-winded) soliloquy, the film is a provocative look at a world that has long since lost its innocence, as witnessed by a pair of benevolent guardian angels invisibly cataloguing human daydreams and emotions, and occasionally offering mute comfort in moments of private spiritual crisis. In the divided city of Berlin what they most often overhear are poetic expressions of longing and despair, but it isn't enough to stop one empathetic angel from trading in his wings for a chance to experience all the mundane, earthbound luxuries of mortal life, from something as simple as a cup of hot coffee to something as complicated as falling in love.In less sensitive hands the idea might never have gone beyond a simple romantic fantasy (as in the inevitable Hollywood remake, starring Nicholas Cage), but Wenders and co-writer Peter Handke are more interested in making the film a vicarious tour of the human condition, overheard in passing: an infant's first joyous observations; the final thoughts of an auto accident victim; the calm resignation of a man on the brink of suicide; and the recollections of an actor (Peter Falk, playing himself, but with a whimsical twist) on location during the making of a war movie.Wenders' typically moody soul searches aren't always easy to sit through, but the unexpected element of fantasy lifts the film completely out of the ordinary, and the soaring imagery (shot mostly in luminous black and white) goes a long way toward balancing the occasional clutter of repetitive prose-poetry during the sometimes protracted interior monologues. Viewers may find it either exhilarating or annoying, but behind all the angst and alienation is a stubborn, almost childlike faith in the benevolence of human nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Poetry and Spirituality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: "The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present." This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another "Homer": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal" when the child was still a child" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a "sing-song" voice, "Als Das kind kind war..." He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who would later star in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wings of Desire" is a strong candidate for my favorite film of alltime. I'm not terribly surprised by the number of negative reviews,and not even because I think hoi polloi are utterly devoid of taste. In fact, a person with a good deal of sense could find this film (atleast the first part) trite and overly pretentious, if they were tointerpret the angels' dialogues and the people's thoughts as bitsof Wenders' philosophy that he wants to impart to us. In my view,they're almost the opposite: an attempt to make present to ourimmediate senses the nature of real people and society. Yes, I'mclaiming that for the most part, our mental activity is tritenessposing as profound. Haven't you ever eavesdropped on lovers'banter, or on a job interview? Wenders has to take us to the placewhere the ordinariness is almost crushing, before we can reallyfeel the weight of Damiel's choice. What really makes this film stick with me, though, are twostartling scenes near the end that implant doubt in the feelingsyou're otherwise predisposed to accept. Pay attention to Marion'swords to Damiel in the bar, keeping in mind the kind of reasons hebased his decision on. And especially, realize the significance ofthe scene with Falk and Cassiel. When I realized it, I shivered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so emotional that it hurts. And after watching it, comes to mind that only a real angel could have put on earth a film like this; so, I'm pretty sure Wenders is one of them. All things are beautifully done. The story, the settings, the views, the perspective Wenders gives to the plot that puts us into every corner of the characters and their feelings, their needs, the things that they crave for and the elements that they live for. And despite the perfection reached in every little detail by Wenders, there's no craftmanship in Wings of desire, only art. Pure and simple.This is a masterpiece recommended for anyone with a soul connected to every emotion. The sense of closeness and deep desires is so exact, that the expressions in faces and bodies tell stories beyond those words they're using as a bridge between them and us. Wings of desire it´s such a marvelous love story, and one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two hours of German poetry - and that's a good thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie inspired me to go into the professional ministry. This is a film that, if you had to describe the human condition to an alien, would pretty much do the trick. We exist as humans on one level, but whether we're aware of metaphysics or not, there is a world we cannot see, or as this film posits, we choose not to see. The story is about angels hovering around Berlin, only visible by children, who meet to talk about the unique things they've seen that day, or to meet with other angels (in the beautiful Berlin library) where they can tune into the Divine Broadcast System. Two angels take center stage, one who decides to "take the plunge" and become human, in order to find what true love is in the eyes of a beautiful trapeze artist. The first half is him making a decision, and is filmed in black and white; the second half shows the aftermath of his fall to earth, and is filmed in colour. When I first saw this, I thought the film's fatal flaw was its anti-climactic conclusion. Now I realise that it may be the best part of my favourite film of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie long before I ever saw the remake, "City of Angels". I loved it so much, I didn't want to see the new one, but when I saw how different "City" is, I came to like them both.This is just a beautiful piece of filmmaking.The images are gorgeous, striking a nice balance between the ethereal and the gritty, as you'd want from a movie about humans and angels.The dialogue is based on the poetry of Rilke. Whether you understand German or not, it's about the most intelligent dialogue you're ever going to hear outside of a Shakespeare play.The concepts are weighty. Much more so than the newer version, this one stresses the infinite duration of time that the angels have been putting in on earth, how they wandered through before there were humans, when the earth was in previous geological eras. When they reminisce about what Berlin was like in the old days, they're talking about before the Ice Age.This makes the decision to become human seem far weightier ... because it focuses the viewer in on the concept of eternity.Peter Falk, so completely human and approachable, such an everyday man, is perfect as himself. He brings the right tone of humanity into contrast with the angels' aloofness to passion and emotions and feelings and senses. (I liked Dennis Franz in the remake, as well, but Falk is just magical in this setting)Get yourself in the right mood, with no distractions, and prepare to think about the great questions and the nature of humanity. Put this movie on and let it flow. It is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By the time it gets a little full of itself, you are so mesmerized and awestruck it doesn't matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wings of Desire (1987)The swooping, gorgeous photography (almost all of it black and white) and the feeling of movement throughout is enough to make this film utterly memorable. It could work as a silent movie, no words, just a stunning look at 1980s Berlin and some of its people. The words, luckily, are something rare, too. They are overtly poetic and profound, bordering on pompous, but uplifted and augmented by the photography so beautifully, you go along with all the deep thoughts, which are actually layered and subtle and interesting. Add yet again what you might call a plot--the visiting by angels and their listening in on the human condition, and indeed their questioning their own dilemma as eternal beings without the weight of being truly alive--and you have a scenario that matters. This isn't just an artistic tour-de-force. It actually matters, and it puts the point well, making the dogmatic ordinary.And that, for two hours, is the film. For me, I was mesmerized through the first half. Just when it might get repetitive, a twist occurs, like the film within the film (briefly), or the Peter Falk as Peter Falk element that recurs. Once or twice, color scorches the screen in a beautiful surprise, and eventually the meaning of the color (suspected early on) is confirmed. By the last half hour, there are times when the words, extended into long monologues, make you itchy. The movie seems a little long. But you have been so engrossed earlier, you don't completely mind, but watch it through, and see an ending that might, in a weird way, be disappointing on purpose. You'll have to see it to get what I mean. A completely original special film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only surmise that so many people here gave low marks for this film because there is a huge population of either very young users, who find it very easy to be critical of anything, or frustrated adults who find it fun to pass all the negativity that they can without fear of reprisal due to their supposed anonymity. What they don't understand, they despise. Sad. This is a terrific film and if you're not locked into an MTV or video game world, you will no doubt find this film both beautiful and thought provoking. Peter Falk is wonderful and the way his character sort of breaks the fourth wall (maybe a fifth wall?) is very interesting.Wow! I am usually accused of being too verbose for my own good, but I am apparently not allowed to submit this with less than ten lines.... and so I vamp, having said all that I cared to say. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and enjoy the introspection that is bound to follow if you like a good thinking man's/woman's movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only 3 years after the unforgettable "Paris, Texas" (1984), Wim Wenders presented us with another masterpiece: "Wings of Desire" (or "The Sky Above Berlin" in the original German title), a mesmerizing film about the joy of life, partially inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke's (1875-1926) poetry.The story of the angel Damiel (the excellent Bruno Ganz, who'd play Adolf Hitler 17 years later in the Oscar-nominated "Downfall"), who falls in love with a mortal circus acrobat, Marion (Solveig Dommartin, Wenders's then-girlfriend, who died last January) and wishes to become human is told by breathtaking images (cinematographer Henri Alekan's courtesy - he worked on Cocteau's "La Belle et la B?te") - the angels see in black and white, humans see in colors; philosophical, analytical observations about human life (and death); scenes of beauty in the simplest things in a masterful way that never becomes corny or boring. More than a film director, Wim Wenders is a film poet; his films are fabulous intersections of image and sound (dialogue, music) crafted in a way that only some other masters achieved. "Dedicated to all the former angels, but especially to Yasujiro, François and Andrej", "Wings of Desire" is a gorgeous celebration of life who should be seen by people aged 8 to 80. My vote: 10/10.P.S.: Avoid at all costs the ridiculous Hollywood remake, "City of Angels" (1998), with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolute stunning beauty of a movie. The dialogue, the writings of Peter Handke, are of a profoundness that is to be found in philosophy of the likes of Walter Benjamin. The movie and camera art of Wim Wenders is unique. The actors give a great performance and are all wonderful to look at. The way the movie is filmed, how you can hear all people think when the angels walk by, and the how and why this angel falls in love with the girl and being human really made me feel the worth of human life myself. Although the story is ageless, it is a beautiful time document of 80's Berlin.. Great to see a Nick Cave concert in some underground venue for example. All in all I'd recommend to see this one. That is, if you can stand the slow pace of the movie and can keep attention to the vast amount of dialogue at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is marvellous and unique film which, because it's filmed mainly from the perspective of voyeurs of the human race, in this case angels, has the ability to make you appreciate all the things we so often take for granted in the hustle-and-bustle of our daily lives. Colour, smell, taste, love, friendship, music are all such an integral part of human existence yet without films like this we could easily take them for granted and forget how they enrich our lives.I suppose the angels in this film could even be viewed as representing children slowly waking up to the joys of life. Realising that, even if time will eventually ravage them, there is so much to savour in the here and now.This also is a film to be prasied because it's not scared to allow multiple languages to be heard - just as in real life. It reminds me in many ways of the films of Andrei Tarkovsky - haunting, poetic images and words - and yet is undoubtedly much more accessible. With so many other postings available I don't feel any need to mention plot points, all I wanted to put across was if you prefer thought-provoking films (with marvellous cinematography, contemporary soundtracks and the ability to remind us of the gentle joys of life) as opposed to the more visceral and empty films that are currently mass-produced then "Wings of Desire" is well worth investing your time in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Der Himmel über Berlin (1987)****After working in USA and after winning the Golden Palm in 1984. with "Paris, Texas" Wenders decided to make a movie in his native Germany. Result was more than a brilliant work of Art, very unique and highly poetic modern masterpiece ? Wings of Desire (original title is Der Himmel über Berlin).It is following two angels ?Damiel (brilliantly played by Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) wandering through the streets of modern day Berlin and helping its citizens. One day Damiel, aware of his detachment from the material world and in love with a mortal girl, decides to sacrifice his immortality.This film is a testimony to the little things we (humans) take for granted like a touch of a close friend or having a cup of coffee in a cold day. It explores various forms of divisions (isolation, alienation) in a modern society (Heaven-Earth, Man-Woman, East Germany-West Germany; Berlin Wall was still on in 1987).Beauty of Wenders' visual poetry is beyond explanation. Very few films have this possibility to take the viewer into hypnosis thanks to the skillful mixture of striking cinematography, evocative sounds and deliberate pace. This film is capable to produce the unique felling you won't soon forget. It has my vote for the best cinematography ever in motion pictures (by then 78-year-old Henri Alekan!)Overall, Wings of Desire is a movie like no other ? lyrical, haunting, poetic. It's a beautiful and moving journey into the spiritual, emotional and political dualism. Most important of all, it reminds us how valuable is to be a human.Remade in USA in 1998 as City of Angels. Sequel: Faraway, So Close!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene just blew me away. The poem about the time when the kid was a kid, the music and the thoughts of all the people shown in the opening scene was just too good to be true. I just loved the way the two of the angels talk and although a lot of it was too sophisticated for me I just loved the parts that I got. The melancholy of this film is something I enjoyed, too, and Peter Falk as the angel becoming human was a gorgeous thing to do. I cannot praise this movie enough because it is probably the most poetic film in German cinema and it teaches us a great lesson, which is to value life, because even the little things, as bad as they might turn out to be, they are still part of a life that has many great things in store for us. The ethereal existence of an angel is nothing compared to real life which consists of reading the newspapers, caressing a woman's neck, eating a good meal, painting a picture or having a beer or a cup of coffee in a pub full of lowlifes. There was so much beauty in this film that it just knocked me off my feet. Go and see it, you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Early in the movie we see what it would be like to fly above the city. We float above the autobahn and we see a block of high-rise apartment buildings. Suddenly we are in those apartments, drifting through windows and walls, seeing the people who live there, hearing their thoughts.This makes clear one of the things that we normally take for granted about movies- that somehow we seem to be there, watching and listening. If we play dumb about this, or think like a little child, we might ask why the people in movies don't notice us watching them.A naive answer would be because we are invisible, because we are angels. Like the angels in the movie, we are unable to affect events. We are only able to emphasize with the characters, only able to smile to each other and compare notes.Knowing that we, the audience, are among the angels in this movie, and that they represent us, is a good place to start thinking about how and why this movie does whatever it is that it does so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't believe I have ever seen any film quite like "Wings of Desire." Furthermore, I don't believe I have ever seen a film that probes more trenchantly into the psyche of men and women, daring to speak in a dialogue that is not readily lucid and ostensible to most viewers. I have viewed this movie dozens of times and still I find the language is unfolding for meThis film is resplendent with exquisite music astutely paired with a subtle yet suggestive montage. The use of colour paints a moving and brightened aesthetic, one which drifts with the mood of the characters as well as challenges the mind and the emotions of the viewer. Furthermore, the acting is superb. One immediately is engulfed by a philanthropic warmth emmenating from the characters, notably Bruno Ganz who, I feel, becomes his character entirely. While his dialogue may be sparse, his body language and master of physical and psychic subtlety is brilliant and it becomes readily apparent that Ganz can tell a story with his entire being, not just the words that flow eloquently and effluently from him. To make a gross understatement, I was very impressed.One of the elements of this film, which I will admit I am ill qualified to discuss, was the subtle and probative examination of the modern German psyche as it comes to terms with its turbulent past, present and future and perhaps a historian should comment here. However, anyone can immediately sense that Berlin, a city that is as much alive and active as any character in this film, is a character that needs to be accounted for and a source of energy and inspiration as well as pensive recapitulation, that needs to be discussed.I could ramble on and on about this film but I should sententiously state that this is a brilliant artwork that demands full attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt those of you who have seen Brad Silberling's City of Angels with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage will want to go back and watch this original German version, directed with visceral style by Wim Wenders. Those who enjoyed the clear narrative style of the American interpretation will be jarred to find the original to be very different in tone and storyline than its descendant. Bruno Ganz plays a wistful angel named Damiel who wanders Berlin attending to the spiritual needs of people whose souls need a lift, all the while wishing he was human himself. Wenders' direction is absolutely breathtaking, with gorgeous black-and-white photography, poetic dialogue that is never too overdone and a score that is haunting to say the very least. The library scene is my personal favourite (and is copied very well in City of Angels). After you've seen Wings, rent the excellent sequel Faraway, So Close with Nastassja Kinski and Willem Dafoe. &gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I first saw this film it has been my favorite film. Seeing Wings of Desire is for me like seeing my innermost soul -- and the innermost soul of humanity -- exposed on the screen. The tone of this film and the insight it gives into human hopes and fears and the overall beauty of life (even in its ugly moments) is one I have not seen reproduced anywhere except in literature, and even then such portrayals are rare. This entire film seems to exist as an attempt to capture those fleeting moments of happiness and clarity we achieve in our lives, those moments when we feel in tune with the world, when we feel like we're floating in time, when we revert back to the days of our childhood and see everything for the first time.The topic of this film is not the only reason to watch it, of course. The acting is suburb and the CINEMATOGRAPHY is absolutely stunning. The way this film has been shot is quite unique and the way the vision of the angels has been captured, with the camera seeming to float about with its own wings, is miraculous. The music is also a big part of this film and I would strongly recommend the soundtrack, which brings back the feeling of the film, a film which is a very, very difficult film to get on video. If you can see this in the theater, I would DEFINITELY do that because the bigger this film, the more watching it will be AN EXPERIENCE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all-time favorite movies, and possibly Wenders' masterpiece. The one weak spot, which has come to grate on me more with repeated viewings, is the supposed climax, which is pretty poorly done. We, I assume, should be moved by this scene, and instead we are given the classic bane of foreign films--enormous, screen-filling talking heads spouting non sequitur nonsense. This shortcoming aside, the film is nothing short of magical. Lovingly shot in black and white, the tone of this film is one of truly inspiring love and sympathy for humanity in all of its beautiful sadness, futility, and quirkiness. A story I read once recounted part of an interview with R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, who, after seeing this film in the theater with some friends, rushed out of the theater afterward to dance in the rain with them. I tend to believe this story, because "Wings of Desire" has filled my heart with that kind of joy every time I have watched it, and I'm not done yet. Peter Falk as himself radiates such charm that his performance in this film is irresistible and unforgettable. Do watch this movie the next time you're feeling isolated, angry, or cynical, and every time thereafter--it's the perfect antidote. Also keep an eye out for the performance near the end by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds--great! What more could you ask for?</fullReview>

The sound mix is one of the best examples of layered sound that is not used as a special effect but as an element of the story.

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary film experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yearned to watch Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" since it made it to the top ten 'most important film of the past decade' (or two) by Premiere movie magazine. My curiosity was greeted by awe when I finally watched it.This is one of the few plotless films that I truly appreciate. Most of the film involves angels observing humanity in Berlin, and Damiel, a particularly passionate angel, is moved to the point of considering participation amongst mortals. There were film images that I do not quite comprehend, and unexplained parts in this fable, but the angel's face, and the inobtrusively voyeuristic camera angles spoke volumes.I admire this film for its metaphysical content: its a celebration of humanity through the eyes of celestial beings (Damiel and Cassiel). The main source of speech in this film is inner dialogue. The angles can hear our thoughts, and the "dialogue" in the film represents honest opinions. This is very interesting because instead of hearing people say what they think, the audience have the privilege of listening to unadulterated thoughts.The film is contemplative, melancholy, and moves slowly for over 2 hours. The cinematography is captivating. The camera floats through the city of Berlin, and observes events so calmly. There are many panning shots, and moving shots, and close-ups of the angel's face that truly define this film (I'm not sure how to explain this). The use of monochrome film for the point of view of the angels, and color for humans are done with such subtlety as to yield the perfect mood. I am especially awed by the sequences where B&amp;W is switched to color; from angel to human perspectives.The film works on one tone in its length. There are no moments of high action, nor micro seconds of heavy melodrama. "Wings Of Desire" remains pensive, and observing all the way to the end, and it still works. I have never seen anything like this, and it captures something wonderful about human existence (the work of God?) through sight and sound, rather than a coherent storyline. In this sense, I rank it among the most unique, original films I have seen recently (like "Blue", and "The Apostle"). I am very convinced that there is a German actor named Bruno Ganz who is a part-time angel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you eat a movie, sometimes a movie eats you. Either way it can be beautiful with same intensity but the nature has to be discretely different from each other. I mean when I eat a movie, I like to challenge it but when it happens the other way around; Well, I don't want to do anything except letting the movie engulf me gradually till it absorbs me entirely. At that point, when the magic starts to flow inside my vein, I feel nothing but gratitude for watching it. It feels so good. "Wings of desire" is one of those rare movies which had me long after I was done watching &amp; it still continues. In one word, it is just magical. This movie speaks a language of compassion, a language of everlasting companionship. At end of the day, we all like to be found which is an integral part of human nature. It has lots of significant post-effects on us. Because of this, we all are destined to fall for each other, hitting on each other?? to what end? Perhaps eternal bonding, companionship. We all need someone as an emotional outcome, a medium. Though it sounds bit cruel but in a way, this holds the society together. Now imagine if one movie could make you believe that there are plenty of angels floating around us all the time just to commiserate with us, wouldn't it be just wonderful!?, hell yeah.In Wim Winder's '87 movie, "wings of desire", it does make you believe that way. It's a story focused mainly on two angels, "Damiel" &amp; "Marion" out of millions who were there in Berlin after the downfall of the Third Reich. There were trying to find hope out of a catastrophe. Their jobs were basically pretty simple, just listened to us. But we, human race were unable see them. We only could feel them as some sort of soothing presence. But they were right here, just to share every moment with us. Sometimes they were there to give us hope as well but they didn't physically interfere. There were more like spectators of this earth-stage of human drama. They laughed with us, cried with us but didn't not get involved personally or rather emotionally until "Damiel" {aka Bruno Ganz}, one of two angels started to envy our mortality &amp; fell in love with a human girl. He found us so intimidating that he bet his immortality just to become a normal human being &amp; later, almighty approved that.This movie has an indescribable epic sense of beauty within. At least I look at it that way. The substance is so magical &amp; the way it is been depicted into screen deserves only one word, hats-off.Director used black &amp; white very efficiently. It dominates almost the whole movie. To show the infinite waiting of the angels, he uses it &amp; it's a story told from their perspective too, not us. So, it's quite natural that it's in black &amp; white mostly. But sometimes, like after a relentless raining, how a glimpse of sun light speaks of beauty, hope, the color comes into play &amp; makes the entire journey even more beautiful &amp; lyrical. Yeah, so to speak; I like to describe "wings of desire" as a journey or rather combination of journeys. This movie is about the journey of "Damiel" who finally finds peace on himself &amp; the true meaning of living. its also about the other angel, "Marion" who can not afford to put his desire in first place in front of his reality but most of all it becomes our journey to realize that we are never alone in this beautiful world, we can't feel abandoned no matter how worse the situation turns into. This movie gives a ray of hope to each of us that however thick the darkness seems to be, "it's never too late to get back" &amp; by doing it so, we have got friends who are always here.</fullReview>

Of course, it is not the typical Hollywood movie, and therefore I suppose many people -those who would prefer the one made with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan- would find it slow and fail to connect to its beautiful simplicity. This is a poetic movie. Both Ganz and Sanders are such wonderful actors you are able to feel their empathy with the people they "listen" to. When Ganz finally "falls" (literally) and becomes a man, you realize what a wonderful gift life is and all the beautiful things that we take for granted. Cinematography is absolutely brilliant in this film. The way it uses black and white to show the angels' perspective and the change to color when Damiel (Ganz) becomes a man and realizes what the world really looks like, is the exact contrast needed to symbolize the transition between angel and man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The absolutely fantastic cast, setting, music all partook in the perfect concoction which became this superb film. It was an homage to Berlin, its glorious architecture, its deliciousness and at the same time desperate atmosphere which for so long ruled that city. Once a center of Art and Culture, it deserved an appropriate Monument. Wim Wenders achieved just that, in this movie, as a recording of this city prior to the collapse of the wall. The day the wall came down in 1989, I happened to have watched it right before we went to become part of this historic moment, live, in Berlin. The contrast is still apparent every time I watch this movie, invoking deep emotions. Well done Wim Wenders!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time when it first came out back in '87 (I think it may have been '88 by the time it got to my town), and was stunned. I am not one to use superlatives, but I have yet to see a better film. Certainly 8 1/2, La Strada, La Dolce Vita, La Notte di San Lorenzo, Wild Strawberries, and maybe ten or so others come close, but they do not quite get to this level.What is so good? The cinematography, the language, the integration of sound and music, the character development, the pacing... in short, everything.Now, it is easy for someone raised on a diet of Bruce Willis films to think that the pacing was too slow. Art is supposed to slow our pace, to put us into contemplation, to shatter, or at least to fracture, our perception of time and space. Der Himmel uber Berlin does this in a way that is analogous to taking a long, hard look at a painting by Diebenkorn or Matisse. Like a Matisse, the viewer can experience joy at various levels, from the first, superficial glance to prolonged and repeated viewings. Perhaps one can get to a point where there is nothing more to glean from it, but that indicates a failing on the part of the viewer, not on the part of the film. However, anyone who has difficulty understanding this film should realize that it is okay not to. It is a difficult film. Perhaps it is better for the confused viewer to put it aside for the time being, to see other films, to read, to think about other things. But it would be a terrible shame not to try to come back to Der Himmel Uber Berlin. It is too great a film to ignore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If cinema can ever aspire to greatness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...it surely is to be found in "Der Himmel über Berlin" (or "Wings of Desire"). The great painters like Da Vinci or Vermeer teach us that there is something spiritual in the lighting of a scene: the images in this film achieve this, as they do in Dreyer's films or Tarkovski's. Yes, spiritual, not only because there are angels in the film (with, interestingly, minimal or no mention of God or religion), which would be too obvious, but because of the dialog, the poetry (R.M. Rilke and Peter Handke), deep feelings with a touch of humor, the music, the all-encompassing verbal texture, a perfect use of B/W vs color, even a perfect use of architecture, and, why not, those angels that respect, value and cherish every human life, however lonely, despaired or miserable.If you have lived enough, this film could act on you as a mystical catalyst. If it does not, wait until you get tired of films full of explosions, car chases, deaths and nonsense. Then you will discover that you can still watch "Wings of desire" and enjoy a motion picture.Wim Wenders pays tribute to Ozu, Truffaut and Tarkovsky. Surely in the future others will pay tribute to him.A perfect experience of a movie.</fullReview>

Tale of loneliness, heartache and joy has the fervent spirit and imagination of movie magic, but the film's beauty is nearly eclipsed by lengthy, wordy sequences and the languid pace. The evocative cinematography is dazzling and the cast (including Peter Falk, playing himself) is very fine.

		<fullReview>I have a hard time writing this after reading the last comments. Maybe I've not refined my understanding of film greatly enough but I came away less than exhilarated by this film.I did like it but couldn't help feeling it dragged sometimes unnecessarily. For example, the trapeze scene that lasts forever (ok, it was a bit interesting because she looked like she was going to fall), and while Nic Cave may be cool, it's really boring to listen to an entire song when you're not a big fan. I was too worn out by the end of the movie to be overly effected by it. I know, this is such a simplistic uneducated review :-)Don't get me wrong here. This movie is definitely better than the majority on the silver screen today and I do give it higher marks than "City of Angels". Even though I hardly disliked CoA. If you haven't seen it, don't try actually comparing the two movies. They are totally different movies. CoA is obviously not trying to make an "easy to understand simplified american" version of Wings of Desire. It's a completely different movie.So, I do recommend seeing this movie but not to attempt it unless you are completely awake and ready to think. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long (TOO long) story of two angels (dressed in black) walking among the people of Berlin--hearing their innermost thoughts and desires. Most people can't see them--only children and the young at heart One of them falls in love and wants to become human again. Of course that doesn't happen until 90 MINUTES have elapsed!Obviously, this film takes it's sweet time even setting up a plot. For a full hour and half you see the angels walking around and hearing what they hear. It's all somber and shot in black &amp; white which makes it all the more depressing. After 90 minutes I was bored and very depressed. As other posters have said it DOES have some incredible imagery--but it's not attractive imagery. It's all bleak and desolate. Also the slow pace makes this very difficult to sit through. It seems director Wim Wenders believes a film has to be slow and bleak to be art. Well, that doesn't make it art...it makes it slow and bleak! The acting is also pretty bad...but the director is obviously more concerned about images than acting. And the nonstop thoughts you hear make little sense and NEVER stop! The only bright spots are some beautiful color photography and Peter Falk who is obviously enjoying himself...but damned if I knew what he was doing in this!I'm giving it a 4--and that's just for the photography. This is basically a very overrated, pretentious film that THINKS it's making an artistic statement. The late Pauline Kael nailed it in her review of it in the New Yorker back in 1988--she said a friend of hers didn't want the movie to end...but couldn't wait to get out of the theatre! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine a world in which a man falls in love by listening to, and actually hearing, the words of a woman.How far our planet seems to have come from this fundamental situation: A man who focuses, hears, cares, loves. Swiss actor Bruno Ganz literally soars as the angel Damiel, roaming Berlin in the late Eighties along with his fellow ethereal companion Cassiel (Otto Sander). This pair listens in on the thoughts, anxieties, and aspirations of human beings as they ride the train, sit in their apartments, and trod a cityscape divided by the graffiti-covered Berlin Wall. Invisibly, they lay a hand or rest a head on a beleaguered person's shoulder, and, imperceptibly, sometimes, the person begins to see another way and feel a little renewed.It's a beautiful and comforting vision. I don't think I'm the only viewer who has come away from this film feeling a little less alone, a little more buoyed in the sea of life.Director Wim Wenders has created a work of love here -- love for his fellow, struggling man and woman, each of whom is living his story, such as it is. As stunning and original as this tale is, I think it goes astray somewhat by allowing Damiel to assume human form and woo the trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin). We go from a theme that is exquisitely unique to something far more conventional.This movie shows the newly earth-bound Damiel observing Marion in two dusky bars where rock acts perform. Watching Marion drink and dance on her own, Damiel finds his way to a bar to which his lovely lady finds her way. It is there that the magic reignites in what must be one of the most romantic lead-ins to a kiss ever filmed. I had never before seen Ganz in a film, and he's still working today, according to TCM announcer Ben Mankiewicz. Ms. Dommartin died of a heart attack at only age 45. Immortality and mortality paired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinda great movie, but rough abound the edges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Der Himmel über Berlin" (1987) (or best known as "Wings of Desire") is definitely a movie created not for mainstream audiences. While it's first 30 minutes didn't blew my away to say the least, after some 30 minute mark i got the overall mood and most important feeling for this movie - after i finished it i can say - it's kinda great one. Kinda - because it is rough around the edges: it is not superbly paced (it drags here and there), you can clearly see when many extras are staring at the camera or crew behind it or even some bad "acting" from them and it kinda lacks a more strait narrative during it's first half hour. But then this movie got better, a lot.Overall, "Wings of Desire" is surely not for everyone. It's more like a poetry movie about the ideas, and there are many, deep and haunting ones. Acting by lead actors were very solid. Directing and screenplay are inspiring. And there is a very special appearance by Columbo himself Peter Falk as ... Peter Falk. This is a one very special appearance. And one unusually rough but kinda great movie overall.</fullReview>

But watching it now, almost 30 years later, it still feels like one of the most beautiful and haunting movies ever made.It was a stroke of genius to cast Bruno Ganz as an angel, with his aging boxer's face. The angel smiles at a child, and we can't help smiling with him.There are many unforgettable scenes in there. The two angels sharing reports on ordinary people doing ordinary things. The suicide who jumps off a building, while the angel cries "nein!". The lonely trapeze artist proclaiming her love for life. Pretty much every scene is magic. Even the silly ones.I don't believe in angels, but I do believe in this film. It's about kindness and love and the chaotic minds of people. It once made me realize that German is a language of poets, not of goose-stepping thugs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wings of DesireI picked up this movie because City of Angels is inspired by it.What I like the most: a general idea of spiritual entities around human beings; the name of the movie. What I dislike: pointless angels hanging around without any particular goal or idea.The Wings of Desire might have been an enjoyable movie for the 80's, but it doesn't look that great anymore. The general dynamics of the movie is pretty slow, with over extended scenes and angels who seem to have nothing to do. Of course, then there is something to do in the sinful human world and? one of them falls! The end of the plot is quite disgusting ? a pensioner is picking up a woman 35-years younger than him. He doesn't even have a single word to tell her - just an action.in my opinion, the lightening and camera-work are artistically done and I add a credit for that. I have to admit that the remake, City of Angels, is developed much further as a spiritual awakening movie. But BIG thanks to W of D for innovation, which helped to create the remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is good and bad critique around for this film, some people have problems with the pace at which the film runs, others take issue with the Director himself saying he might have been better as a photographer not a film-maker. But in my opinion these people completely miss the purpose of this movie. The Director Wenders, wanted to make something different, something alternative to the guaranteed ticket selling films.This film doesn't feed adrenaline junkies with high speed car chases or gun slinging shoot outs. Nor does it have oodles of sex.What this movie does have is a wonderful storyline but one that doesn't draw you in like some movies in this one you feel like your observing the events almost like a witness - from a distance what you feel what you think they are part of the interaction between yourself and the film.The camera angles and the choice of shots from the director are presented naturally so you know the two main characters want to be together. Some of the background scenery set in Post WW2 Berlin are just perfect Berlin is a wonderfully diverse city so suits this movie well. The film itself offers up so many different ideas and different perspectives you simply must watch it with an open mind so you can allow your own thoughts and curiosity to interact with the film.Wonderful film, but I guess not for everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetic, beautiful and with great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Der Himmel über Berlin" is probably my favorite Wim Wenders movie. It also helped that Bruno Ganz is one of my favorite actors. And so is Peter Falk. Really enjoyed his many Colombo references as I am a great fan of the show. This movie is a thing of beauty, never pretentious and never drags during its roughly 2 hours of runtime. Awards shows all over the planet, including the BAFTAs agreed and Wenders won a Palme d'Or in Cannes for directing it. I really liked how the world was black and white for him when he was an angel and in color when he was a human. Some of the quotes in this film get mentioned several times, by different characters. That's not a problem at all though, as the approach and backgrounds are truly interesting when each of the characters say these quotes. For example I liked the part said by Ganz' character a lot when he talks about "the child who was a child" and he is that child in this metaphor as he was basically just born as a human being.Another thing this film is worth a watch for are the many contemporary references, such as the Berlin Wall, the Nick Cave concert or just the many known places in Berlin in general. It's especially interesting for people who live (or have lived) in this city. I am not sure if this is my favorite Bruno Ganz performance as he has many great turns and here the script is also a highlight. Otto Sander I was never a great fan of. Maybe that is why I did not like the sequel (after the Fall of the Berlin Wall) as much as this one, but he gives a decent performance here. Solveig Dommartin (who died far too young) is also great as a trapeze artist. I liked all the ways in which they could hear the people's thoughts and the scream of shock when one character commits suicide. That's the most tragic scene of the film perhaps.There are just so many details which make this movie as good as it is and I could write a whole novel about these. But I won't, you just have to experience it yourself. One early example would be how the central character stands atop of a church and looks like a statue from below. The people watching this scene are wowed, but they don't see Damiel, which we don't know yet at this point. They are simply stunned by the beautiful church. If you know Rammstein's song "Engel" this is maybe the poetic beautiful film version of how the central character does not want to be an angel. I have not seen the US remake, so I cannot say if this is better or worse. It has to be extremely good though to top Wenders' work here. Highly recommended, although this is certainly not a movie for everyone I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second film for which I hinted in the previous post. Film, with clearly defined idea surrounded by many dissolving in the absolute under topics. The place is Germany, and that we are looking at is humanity. Often forgotten fact is that the German title of the film translates in The Sky Over Berlin.Modern in the way of shooting and framing, as well as posting the shades of post military discourse. Themes of alienation, withdrawing and loss of sense. The transition of life from eighty years ago, the appearance of the first two cars in Berlin, devastating destruction that follows the subsequent development of technology and to the construction of the wall (which fall the director anticipates two years earlier).Here again we see where lies the spirituality of humanity and who are the people who have a relationship with her. Despite the existence of all these people, misfortunes and accidents occur. And the last time the echo is huge.The task of the angels who protect us is to find sense in every human being, in every touch on a subject, inhalation of cigarette smoke, feeling of cold, especially the element of love, which transmits the whole world in the life of two lovers, providing continuation of the flight on the wings of the desires of the human race.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER************** BE AWARE OF A SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER******The film `Wings of Desire' was a film that had many different ideas in it. The lot of the story is that two angels are in the city of Berlin watching the citizens of West Berlin. Their job consists of listening to the thoughts of these people, and watching and recording what happens. Life if you can call it that, for these angels is much different than it is for us they cannot see colors, feel wind, or anything that we can do. They are trapped in a limbo one could say without pleasure or pain. However, one angel decides that he needs to be part of this world and gives up everything for a woman he falls in love with. One of the major film styles used in this film was the film was in black and white. The reason that this was done was to show the audience what these angels were truly seeing in their eyes. This film does have color in it, but the creators wanted us to get a feel for how the lives of these angels were. Another way in which the creators of this film had us feel the lives of these immortal beings was to make many of the scenes purely of these angels watching the people in the real world. At times this became boring, or annoying, but I believe this was done to show us that this is all these angels do for eternity and we needed to know how boring their existence was. Next, to the different scenes were black and white mixed with color. Most of the time the film only switched to color was when one of the two main angels was in the presence of this girl he loved so much. The reason that I think it changed during these scenes was to show us that this angel was starting to feel things for this trapeze artist. Most of the film the these two angels were fighting over which world was better: to live for eternity and have no sense of feeling, color, or love; or was it better to take a chance and become human and risk all of the negative aspects of being human these being: pain, sadness, hunger, fear, etc. It appears based on what these angels do is watch over people and record. However, it also appears that they give support and help people feel better when they are not feeling well. For instance, the one angel kept making the girl feel at peace and have no worries. This is interesting because the film takes place in a time where things are very bad in Germany. The whole film has children in the streets without parents just keeping themselves entertained. This film probably gave some hope to the people in Germany when it first came out. It would make them feel that someone is watching them, and if they ever get a feeling of peace it is probably because of an angel. Hope is a very powerful instrument, and in the world that these people where living in it seems to be very good idea to let these people feel as much hope as possible, for the circumstances of which they have to live in. This film was very long and drawn out, but I feel it was meant to be this way to prove a point. This film inspires hope that there is someone out their watching. A great film way better than its copy `City of Angels</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An angel (Bruno Ganz) gazes along the streets and city of Berlin, ruminating, being romantic for... something, anything, or for an actual person. And meanwhile, a famous actor (Peter Falk) ruminates about the ways of the world, of acting, of cinema (if not directly then in the subtext), and we follow him for a bit. Whether there will be direct interaction, who knows. But the angel makes a decision, and falls from the sky to try and become something else. Ultimately, the Angel is all about romance - whether he finds it directly is another question.Such is the thrust of Wim Wenders Wings of Desire, a film that many have touted as one of the greats of the 1980s. I think this is the kind of movie you either go for, or you don't. I mostly went for it, and the poet in me liked a lot of the words that came out in the voice-overs. It's a very humanistic movie and if nothing else it can be praised by that... actually, it's the visual scope that dominates and triumphs (I'd like to take this DP out for a beer).If only Wenders could back off just a little from his super-mega-sumptuous-Berlin-poetry and get back to the story a little more, it would really be something fully magical (rather, a marriage of the two). I have to recommend it strongly for its visual and usually aural beauty, and Ganz's touching performance too. But I didn't find it to be quite the masterpiece most do. I apologize on behalf of my brain not taking in all of the supposed awe-inspiring words spoken by people (almost everyone has the poetry of a master, and many of them just sound like they're reading as opposed to naturally speaking), but it's just how I took it in.Oh, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds makes a prominent appearance in the third act. Reason enough to see it alone, and it makes the final act have a stronger impact than you might expect - there's poetry AND rock and roll combined!</fullReview>

And second, that it features Peter Falk as himself, musing over his hats, drawings and other mundane things. Why Falk was chosen is unclear, but he fits in perfectly.But more importantly, this film is beautifully shot, a work of art, and it goes above and beyond whether the narrative is interesting (it is) or if the actors are good (they are).

		<fullReview>Artsy foreign film about two angels that come to Earth and spend a lot of time walking around listening to people's thoughts. When I say a lot of time, I should stress over half of the film's length. Eventually one of the angels decides he wants to be human because he fell for a trapeze artist. But it takes a very long time for the film to get there. There's also a subplot about Peter Falk (playing himself) shooting a movie in Berlin. Falk's part is probably the most enjoyable part of the film. Other than the beautiful photography. Look, it's a very pretentious movie. Obviously how much you will enjoy it depends in large part upon how you feel about films like this. It's the kind of movie you feel like you should be wearing a scarf while watching it. There is some good stuff here but it also reminded me of an episode of The Simpsons from years ago where Barney Gumble made an art film called "Pukahontas" that was pointless drivel yet the film snob phonies all praised it as a masterpiece.</fullReview>

You could watch both version so that you can understand the 'miracle works' of (bad) Hollywood. :p I think all the words in this film are quotes, gosh they're so beautiful, and real, so true.

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Poetry and Spirtuality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: "The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present." This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another "Homer": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal" when the child was still a child" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a "sing-song" voice, "Als Das kind kind war..." He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angel Comes To Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Must try to keep this brief. Ganz is an angel who comes to Earth to have a look around Berlin in 1987. Not clear at first. No one notices him as he wanders about. Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like "Ulysses." Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes.Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, "How do I look in this hat?" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- "Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is, after all, worth living !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this motion picture is no entertainment. It has more to do with art. The German title "Der Himmel über Berlin" (The Sky above Berlin) is a better fit than "Wings of Desire". Unfortunately some translations convey some different ideas than the original authors first intended.It's a movie about angels flying over divided Berlin (1987), almost totally shot in Black&amp;White. As the Angels in the movie can't have a feeling of life, only an abstract perception of it, the directors have wisely taken away ours colors, so in a sense our experience is closer to theirs than otherwise it would be. There are some moments in full colors, but they don't add much to the watching of it.It all it starts out with our angels listening to people's thoughts, which can range from the most trivial -if I buy 10 tickets I can save 1 mark ? to some very existential and persisting question as the "who was I before I was me", or "why am I me and not him ?".From all the angels shown, all in long coats and ponytails ? men and women alike ? the focus lye on two. Domiel (Bruno Ganz ? Der Untergang) and Cassiel (Otto Sander). They walk, listen and observe, and it's learned they have been so doing since the earth has been earth, from the very beginning.Once they meet up inside a car in a car dealer for a rendezvous. Marion is first in sharing his "experiences". Here he doesn't mention Government decisions, political affairs, his concern is "regular" people and what they do that somewhat break expectations. One example is, IIRC, is a woman who folds an umbrella in a storm. And so their chat go on and so it is first revealed Domiel's desire to become to feel? simple stuff in life, like newspaper ink in the tip of the fingers. He wants to feel. Feel the good and the bad in life, all of it ! This will grows the more he observes. It is a movie about observing. Don't wait for a big plot. It all goes slowly for us, but lighting fast considering what the main characters are.Domiel wants to make the plunge. And a person falling has some special signification in this movie; A man falls to death. Marion copycats this suicide, though he feels nothing. Marion (Solveig Dommartin) is a trapeze artist whose charm and thoughts eventually led Domiel's to coming to life. She is flirting with falling, and if in her last circus appearance she fell ? she thinks. There is a stunt falling in the settings of movie Peter Falk, as himself in a solid display, is an observing actor at.Falk an angel himself 30 years prior is also observing. His acting only appears on a TV screen. He is an observer in life. Even though his appearance in this world is still much angel-like, he invites angels to life.It feels like a very, very pessimistic movie. The history is the history of the losses, physical and spiritual ones. An old writer desperately looks for the Potsdamer Platz, for the lost experiences. People are, more than ever, isles of isolation or "states as the many states there are in Germany. The many lives Domiel and Cassiel observe seem pointless, hopeless or helpless. People feel the vacuity of life and its desperation, and it shows through their thinking. Cassiel remains aloof. Domiel doesn't.Domiel, after observing all this, decides to live. And that is where it gives us hope. The two ways to redeem this miserable a existence have been long been paved in the history of thought, however. The first is the idealization of childhood and animal life. Both are pure, and refer not only to an earlier and purer stage of existence in one's life, but also in human history. It somewhat follow the steps of some old schools in philosophy blaming development for the corruption of the being. Rousseau had already written about that as early as 1750 at least, in his then infamous turned classic "Discourse on the Arts and Sciences". Their talking over a bridge about some happening involving animals, and the circus sequence, the presentation for kids are symbolic of these two. One can live without that.The second is love. But this love is deeper and more meaningful. It is a physical and spiritual fulfillment of the self. And that is where , although not new on any account, is yet the most alluring aspect of this whole picture.You don't have to understand every dialog in the movie, every drifting ? which here are part of the stream ? to like it. As art and a movie first conceived without a plot, it is not like everything part makes a full puzzle. And it doesn't have to it. Maybe it is part of its worth.Life is, after all, worth living. A good lesson in these times of deep "desillusion".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My German should have been better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I have been watching U2's "Stay" video-clip without realising it was based upon this dense deep slow paced German film about the meaning of life. It is quite a lot of material to handle and I want to see it again. I wish I could understand German better, because I noticed the subtitles did not match with what was actually being said. For example "Gebrauch mich" means "Use me" instead of "Need me". I guess I have to see it with different subtitles, maybe one which is in my native tongue.It was a great surprise for me to see Bruno Ganz playing the lead character in this movie. He is a marvelous actor and was magnificent as Adolf Hitler in Der Untergang (Downfall). I have read other reviews and the comment that Peter Falk (Columbo) actually played the devil in this, didn't occur to me. I feel stupid for not noticing it myself, because Lucifer is of course a fallen angel himself.This film is no doubt a classic. City of Angels is obviously based upon this movie, although that movie is much more romantic and not as philosophic as this one and should therefore definitely not be compared with each other; they have each different objectives.I feel I have to see this classic once more again before I am going to write anything else about it. For now 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced but elegant drama from Wim Wenders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wings of Desire" focuses on of a pair of angels who roam Berlin, overseeing the activities of its denizens as they've done for countless years. However, one of them, tiring of this existence, fervently longs to experience life as a human being. This longing is intensified when he encounters and falls in love with a beautiful but lonely trapeze artist.Probably the main thing that will turn people off about this film is the languorous pace. A large portion of the dialogue is in voice-over as the angels eavesdrop on the thoughts of humans and the film shows very little trace of a plot until nearly three quarters of the way through. If you can hold on that long you'll probably forget the film's seemingly endless rambling but that might be a bit too much to ask.That's not to say that the early stages of the film are a waste of time, though. The stunning black and white photography of Henri Alekan, combined with Wim Wenders' continually interesting direction, create a memorable viewing experience. The actors are all solid throughout but it's tough to get involved with the characters when they're not doing much of anything.Ultimately, "Wings of Desire" is exceedingly well made but too ethereal for it's own good. While this was no doubt the intended effect it's guaranteed to translate into boredom for some people. I recommend sticking with it but the film's sluggishness and apparent aimlessness do not work in its favour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all time favorite movie. So what is it about? For me this movie is a celebration of life. How beautiful with all its small histories and experiences.In the movie we get to listen to peoples thought and how the reflecting. All through two angles that are that observe people's joys and sorrows in Berlin. The movie have beautiful shots of the amazing city Berlin. The story that goes through the whole movie is a love story between one of the angles and a human/mortal, but also the angles desire to be a human and feel what humans feel. If you are looking for action or a thriller, this is not the movie to watch. It is moving slowly and philosophical.But again, it is all celebration to life. Have nice it is on a cold day to rub your hands together and how the heat spreads through your hands and it feels good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Experience with Wim Wenders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a touching, quiet movie about the way people waste the greatest gift they have, their lives. As the two angels look at the pain in the world, they are powerless to really stop it. They also are bored and see that while they have eternity, the don't have the passion and joy that comes from occasional suffering. As they attempt to find a way to bring love into the world, they can't really experience. When they see joyfulness in the young lady, they see her as having made the best of a bad situation and one of them desires to be human (which he does). The idea of angels is one of those myths (I'm sorry) that people created to connect with what they cannot fathom, the idea of a God. These guys are the intermediaries. They put human form to the spiritual. When we survive a difficult time or we gain some sort of favor or accomplishment, it's easy to place our reward in the hands of an angel. He is us but not us. The film is ethereal and sad. Funny and tragic. It's quite well done in that European way: stark images, magical black and white contrasts, and subtle presentation. I hope to see that sequel soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wings of Desire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German director Wim Wenders' filmography includes acclaimed and popular films like Paris, Texas (1984) and Buena Vista Social Club (1999). The accessibility of his work varies, so it is perhaps surprising to notice that one of his most widely seen films is the slow-paced 1987 romantic fantasy art piece Wings of Desire. I would have imagined some of his more eventful titles would have gained bigger audiences, but in any case, the film is well worth seeing for those with a thing for unhurried narratives.The story, originally written by Wenders and Austrian writer Peter Handke, was reportedly inspired by poetry which is easy to believe as the plot slowly unwinds. The focus is on two immortal angels called Damiel and Cassiel (Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander) whose job is to walk on Earth (or Berlin, Germany to be exact) listening to people's thoughts and often discreetly consoling them with their special powers, although they are not there solely in mankind's service. Though the angels look like ordinary men, only children and other angels can see them or sense their presence. Certain three humans catch Damiel and Cassiel's attention: an old man called Homer (Curt Bois) who likes to read and tell stories, a lonely and financially struggling trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin) and the famous actor Peter 'Columbo' Falk (playing himself) who has come to Berlin to shoot a movie about the Nazi era and turns out to have a surprising past himself.Even though the premise of two angels secretly helping out people may sound excruciatingly cheesy at first, Wings of Desire fortunately avoids naive heavy-handedness; the angels are seen as existing per se as opposed to being mere servants of gods, if any. In the end the film is largely about love and humanity: Damiel is unhappy with his eternal, omniscient existence and longs to become flesh and blood in order to taste the love of Marion whom he has been observing in his invisible angelic form. Besides the romantic plot, a lot of time is spent on listening to other people's worries and thoughts, philosophizing about the nature of human life and generally wandering around the big city.Children's way of thinking and perceiving the world around them is mentioned and admired several times (indeed, starting with the very first shot), so many of the ponderings are admittedly childlike. This is not a bad thing at all since it makes the thoughts and dialogue more easily accessible than they would otherwise be. Of course, accusations of pretension and boredom are to be expected from many viewers and I don't want to dismiss such opinions altogether, but personally I enjoy slow meditative films even if I don't always understand all the ideas behind them. Still, Wings of Desire is rather long at over two hours and I feel it could have benefited from some trimming especially in the middle parts. The final quarter is the one I think I enjoyed the best, as it is when the world of the angels finally starts gaining new shades and colours, both literally and figuratively.The distinction between the always stylish black &amp; white cinematography (as seen through the angels' eyes) and the colours of the mortals' world is a major charm when it comes to technical aspects of the film. Besides the photography, I enjoyed the sweeping camera movements and aerial views of the streets and other locations of Berlin, such as a big library and a rock club where Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are playing their haunting music. Marion's trapeze acts are good-looking as well; some grainy archive footage of mankind's past traumas is also utilized at points.Basically I appreciate the whole outsider's perspective the film provides into human life and consider Wings of Desire a pleasant cinematic experience, but the excessive length and the slightly overly artistic monologues keep it from resonating with me with full power. For Wenders beginners I would recommend at least Paris, Texas, The American Friend (1977) or even the Yasujirô Ozu-themed documentary Tokyo-Ga (1985) before this one, but if the director's slow, atmospheric and philosophical style hits home with you, Wings of Desire is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An angel tired of earning its wings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wim Wenders rose to fame in 1970's by making films that are now regarded as the greatest representatives of the new German cinema such as Alice in the Cities and In The Course of Time. After the latter he started making more international films with French and American cast. In 1977 Wenders did his international breakthrough with The American Friend starring Bruno Ganz and Dennis Hopper. After seven years he made Paris, Texas which is usually considered to be his greatest achievement. If these two films represented his international - American period - Wings of Desire meant a return to his home country Germany. Wim Wenders always has made two kind of films; films with a direct script (Paris, Texas) and also films which have no script at all in the beginning (Wings of Desire). The script builds up during the filming and this style was familiar for Wim Wenders from Im Lauf Der Zeit (1976), whose script got written during the road the characters drove.Wings of Desire meant the return to Germany for Wim Wenders and he has said that: "The film couldn't have taken place in anywhere else but Berlin. It is the only city where one can realize what it mean to be German. The history of it is so emotionally and physically present." Wings of Desire is a film about Berlin and history. It deals with a common theme for Wenders; one has to come to terms with one's past to accept one's present which he already brilliantly showed in Im Lauf Der Zeit but in Wings of Desire he has taken this theme to another level.One cannot miss the connection between Frank Capra's classic It's a Wonderful Life and Wings of Desire. In Capra's film the angels have to earn their wings by lending a helping hand for desperate people; one angel saves the character of James Stewart by showing what life would be like without him. In Wings of Desire the angels are depressed from listening all the worries of desperate people and one angel, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) gets tired of earning his wings. He wants to feel the emotions of common man; pain, love, sadness and happiness.Berlin is perhaps the most important milieu of European history; its place in between of the east and the west, but for Wenders even more interesting is its place in between of past and present. The city has truly suckled the history to itself. Berlin could've easily been the gorgeous central of Europe, but unfortunately got divided by the horrible concrete wall. Wings of Desire describes Berlin of 1987, but also in the early 1940's - a film within a film side plot. It's clearly structured around certain eras and that's why it could be an antithesis for Wenders' timeless masterpiece Paris, Texas.Wings of Desire is both an essay and a romantic love story. It's a story told by an angel tired of earning its wings. It's a film about two angels Damien and Cassiel, who guard above Berlin and lend a helping hand for desperate people, lonely seniors, unemployed and angry wives. The people they help all ask the same questions, the same ontological riddles. It is no coincidence that the library seems to be an essential place for both the angels and the people in Berlin - it means once again a clue to the theme of coming to the terms with one's past. People read history books, while the angels help the loneliest ones the library means a concrete figure of history - it's a constant reminder of the history that will always be present.An elderly man teaches Damien the wonders of secular life; and instantly he falls in love with an aerialist. All the regular people are angels for Damien but they cannot see him. He has to turn into a regular human being to be in love. Usually in films the use of colored and black-and-white scenes are used to divide flashbacks from present but the chose Wim Wenders has done in Wings of Desire is astonishing, beautiful and sentimental.Wings of Desire is like a huge mural, if there is such a thing as Louvre syndrome, there could just as easily be a Wings of Desire syndrome. It's a huge painting which is a reflection of its time. It's a film made just a few years before the Wall was dismantled. It might just be the most challenging film by Wim Wenders and a film one can watch more than ten times and getting something new out of it on each view. It's an unforgettable angel tale, a deep film about loneliness and the lack of love that can actually change lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie on Love, Life and Berlin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Der Himmel Über Berlin is a fairy tale set in the gloomy atmosphere of Berlin, the meeting point of history and modernity, East and West and separation and immigration. Filmed two years before the demolition of the wall, the movie has the quality of a documentary. Filming locations such as the Potsdam Square, which entirely altered in the last two decades together with the enormous change the city experienced after 1989, increase the movie's value as a historical impression from the sky. The plot is fantastic because the main character is an angel. However the nature of angels is not really investigated deeply and what matters about them is that angels are immortal and passive observes of the life on the earth. The children, as the most important metaphor of innocence are the only ones to see the angels among mortal humans, whose thoughts are heard by Damiel and Cassiel, the two angels accompanying each other. Nonetheless the plot's supernatural character does not intervene in the realism of the movie. Strengthened by the objectivity of angels (only such an ideal being can be truly impartial towards life) what we observe in the film is not disturbed by the problematic relationship of the observer and observed, which is even scientifically formulated by what is called the Copenhagen interpretation in quantum mechanics. The use of black-and-white scenes later to be complemented by coloured ones is a smart way of distinguishing the worldly from the heavenly. The human characters Marion and Homer have also their own angel-like qualities, which attracts Damiel and Cassiel to spend time with them, respectively. Peter Falk's ironic role as himself but also as a former angel and the subsequent decision of Damiel to switch to mortality lets the audience question what they would do if they were to choose between the life of an omnivoyant angel and the finite but real life of a human full of both joys and sorrows. Damiel has been existing since the beginning of the time and he witnessed the whole past of the Earth, the living beings and finally the entire history of humanity. So, why does he choose to become human exactly in 1987 AD? I guess this is the optimistic perspective of Wenders who considers our time as one to be desired for living, even by beings which saw everything what came before and have probably a better idea for the future prospects of humanity. However Damiel is not necessarily tempted by such cosmological questions. After all he is in love and that already makes him human. We cannot know whether he will regret his decision or even if his relationship with Marion is going to last for their entire lives. Nevertheless we are all humans and don't have to decide for anything. Death is a certain part of life and until that happens one should better enjoy each cup of coffee just like Damiel does it.</fullReview>

A guardian angel (Bruno Ganz) watching over Berlin falls for a trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin), and expresses a wish to become human.Wings Of Desire is a swooning metaphysical fantasia, filtering director Wim Wedners' keynote existentialism through the heightened aesthetic of the then-ascendant cinema du look; it strikes such chords in places that one can forgive it its longveurs and pretensions everywhere else, and its use of the pre-unification Berlin is always resonant.

		<shortDescription>God's Eye Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More people believe in Angels, than in God, its a curious fact. It may not be true, or be a fact which has just followed me. I polled three difference classrooms over the years, high school through college, same every time. Maybe its something to do with people liking nurses more than doctors, an immediate helping hand, to a distant voice of authority, a nurse with a smile and medicine, instead of the doctor with the bad news and the bill. "The Sky Over Berlin"(Wings Of Desire, is the hookey US title, not translation) is the only film I have ever seen to give a truly 3rd person view, a Gods Eye POV. The story is of two Angels, who observe(from always elevated camera angels), the lives and thoughts of human beings. Most of the film is from this first person black and white POV(the humans perceptive is in color), a camera floating over random people, listening into their thoughts(reminiscent of REM's "Everybody Hurts" video, except no one disappears, and this came out first). If your okay with the ultimate form of people watching, being both disembodied and an intimate psychic voyeur, this is great. If you want to see something where a lot of stuff happens, watch the Happening, it's okay too. What does happen is few and far between, the angels talk a little, their conversations are like poems, they stand next to or press their hands against miserable people making them brighten and become less narrow for a moment(it doesn't always work), and become enamored with mortals. One angel makes repeat visits to a small circus to watch an acrobat, who may have to quit working at the circus soon and go back to being a waitress til same time next year. She loves being on high and is afraid of falling in a number of ways, her thoughts have a quality similar to the way the angels speak to one another. The Angel is afraid/excited with the idea of descending to the world as well, his fascination with her makes sense. If this is beginning to sound familiar its because this was remade in the 90's with Nicolas Cage as "City Of Angels", but is otherwise a completely different movie, and besides this one has performances from Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, and that one has Meg Ryan. As for why there are so many musical performances, well the last song, he plays is called "From Her To Eternity' I had never heard it before, but the chorus was loud enough for me to hear that phrase, again and again. I got the message, ya know the expression, music is the language of the soul. The structure is basically linear though, we follow the angel around, his thoughts are the thoughts of whoever he crosses, there is a subplot involving Peter Falk, playing Peter Falk as an actor in Berlin shooting a film, strangers call him Columbo, he thinks about Colombo's lack of wearing a hat, maybe he shouldn't wear one in this new movie too. He seems aware of the angels presence, as we are made aware he is an actor in a movie. He tells a boy his book about their being two Hitlers is absurd, when the boy tells him his detective movie is silly to, he responds "yeah but people will bend over backwards for a detective story". Some fantasies, however silly, we want. This movie is one of them. The themes of the beauty the most trivial moments of life, is cleverly and clearly displayed. But to me this made just as much sense as a movie about loneliness, and being an observer, a person always on the outside of things looking in, and deciding to take a dive into the imperfect world of other people, as it did anything else. There's a children's book called the Shy Creatures, about a little who never speaks in class, tells her teacher she wants to be a doctor, to big foot, loch ness and other imaginary beasts(should they stub their toes, or catch colds), who are not really monsters at all, just incredibly shy like her, which is why they always keep out of view, and in the shadows. The Sky Over Berlin, is basically that story for adults. The Sky Over Berlin is a beautiful, funny, original, and adventurous movie, thats fascinating to think about, and a joy to watch. Warm, fuzzy, and meditative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmmaker's Purpose.Wim Wenders purpose in making this film is to share and express the heart of existentialist thinking. As often widely categorized existentialism is, its foundations are predicated upon the nature of existence?finding meaning in a potentially meaningless world. The existentialist discovers the authentic self through countless permutations of angst and despair while simultaneously investing in Socrates, "life examined." No film is perhaps more invested with these concepts than Wings of Desire. It reflects an intentional obscurity through its character developments but more so its script. Ambiguous phrases and inner-monologues challenge the viewer to create meaningful structures and patterns in their own life. Such is the director's purpose when allowing the viewer to read the thoughts of the characters alongside the angels. These obscure thoughts are supposed to mirror that of life itself. They are often short, vague, and lack any definite description?much like the thinking of most mortals. One scene that powerfully demonstrates this idea is during a subway tracking shot. As the camera sweeps by several individuals sitting anxiously on a subway train, their thoughts, as depicted on screen, reveal the inner despair that most of them are feeling. "Why am I here?" "How will I have enough money to pay my pension?" "Why did my wife cheat on me?" The core of all these thoughts revolve around the existentialist attitude: the search for why things are the way they are.To heighten this type of thinking, Wenders relies heavily upon symbolic imagery in order to allow viewers to extract multiple meanings. Rather than fixing a certain meaning or establishing a definite interpretation on these symbols, Wenders allows the symbols to speak for themselves. One symbol used consistently throughout the film is a library. Libraries are symbols of places of learning and knowledge. The angels spend a significant portion of their time in a library, studying alongside certain people in order to understand the human condition better. Progression hasn't stopped for them; in fact, it has become enlightening. They understand that to live life effectively, one has to embrace life in its fullest?that includes both good and bad times. The realization that life must be lived forwards but can only be understood backwards causes them, in ways, to regret not having taken more advantage of the time given to them while in mortality. As they reminisce over the paradoxes and idiosyncrasies that bugged them during their mortal life, they look upon those times with fondness; wishing in ways they could experience it all over again.Another symbol used to demonstrate the heart of existentialism was an extreme close-up of an eye. Man was given eyes that he may see beyond them. In other words, those having eyes to see, as Jesus put it, are better able to understand the deeper implications behind the myriad of symbols/material objects that they are surrounded by. In the beginning of the film, the sun is shown vaguely shining behind a sea of silver clouds, when suddenly the shot cross-fades to an extreme close-up of a human eye. Quickly transitioning to the next shot is an aerial perspective of a city. The implications behind these four symbols?sun, clouds, eye and aerial perspective of a city?suggest several things. The light from the sun is what illuminates all forms of perception, whether empirically speaking in the exterior world, or spiritually speaking in one's understanding. The fact that the sun is shrouded with dense clouds seems to suggest that sunlight is not able to effectively penetrate human perception. Much like the existentialist, he too seems to have trouble finding spiritual light, if there is any, in a world of clouded confusion. The cross fade from the clouded sun to the human eye seems to suggest these ideas?man's struggle for meaning in a potentially meaningless world. The shot then cuts to a bird's eye perspective of a city. This objective (far removed) point of view suggests the existentialist angst and isolation from real human contact. From this shot fades a closer perspective at ground level with the camera moving in through an open window of a house?suggesting that the existentialist is taking the journey into the subjective/personal realm to discover human relationships and the meaning of life, or as Kierkegaard (the father of existentialism) put it, the "sublime journey into the potential of semantics."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't ask too much about the plot, just sit back and absorb the story and images of this film. Unlike a grossly overrated film like Harold and Maude, this film really explains what it means to be human to love and to suffer. Peter Falk makes a surprising appearance sort of playing himself, but it all works out and adds to a truly interesting and emotionally rewarding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! In some ways Wings of Desire (1987) is a very explicit movie. We know right from the start that the main character, the angel Damiel, is in fact an angel. Very early on, a conversation between Damiel and another angel reveals that Damiel tires of his existence and envies the ordinary, transitory lives of the people he watches over. But Wings of Desire is not just about the gulfs between humans and angels, but about the chasms between everyone. However, Wenders certainly doesn't downplay the differences between Damiel and his compattriates and humanity. The angels don't just watch people; they watch everything. They've been doing it since the dawn of time. It's all they do. They don't sleep, they don't eat, they don't even see in color. They `live' a sort of horrible existential nightmare, where they exist but nothing they do really matters. The most powerful thing they seem to be able to do is impart a sense of hope or other positive feeling, but it seems to be luck whether that feeling has a positive effect. Damiel is obsessed with the simple, physical nature humans seem to enjoy. Even something as mundane as reading a newspaper and having the ink run onto one's hand enthralls him. When Damiel becomes human, he is struck on the head by his cast off celestial armor. He notices the pain, but seems to revel in it, and the blood caused by his injury is equally fascinating because he's never seen blood in color before. However, many of the other characters are as isolated as Damiel. The old storyteller is as isolated by time as much as Damiel is by his divinity. The old man cannot understand why things have changed from his youth. He worries that no-one will be left to tell stories, wonders why the peace he loves is so unappreciated. He wonders around, accompanied by the angel Cassiel, but Cassiel is unable to help, only observe. There is another man that Cassiel watches. This young man jumps off a roof, causing Cassiel great grief. Just before he jumps, we can see that he is wearing some sort of headphones. Actually, Cassiel is not the only one watching. There is a small crowd shouting at the young man, urging him not to jump. The young man wonders why everyone is yelling. The headphones are a kind of symbol, showing how he cannot understand, both literally and figuratively, the people who don't want him to come to harm. The film is set in Berlin and several scenes feature the Berlin Wall in the background. The wall is a blatant symbol of separation between people and the film does focus on peoples separation, not just physically but spiritually and temporally. But perhaps the one of the most interesting aspects of the film is the angel's ability to listen to the thoughts of the people around them. These people are all isolated, but all share the same, mundane, boring thoughts: they worry about their families, their money, their lives and about who they are. In the midst of the profound gaps between people the film highlights, the film also emphasizes that there is little difference between the motives and concerns of most people. In the midst of a story about an angel who feels isolated and wants to be human, the film asks those of us who are already human why we view other humans as different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wings of Desire, is a film that focuses on the aspect of angels and how they are among us watching and learning from us. The film focuses on two main angels who describe what they have learned and what it would be like to cross over as a human. They talk of this because angels are unable to experience any of the five senses except to see and this is only in black and white. One of the angels decides to take the fall and become a human so that he will be able experience what humans do also because he has discovered feelings for a woman. Throughout the film, the angels are able to hear the thoughts of humans. A majority of the thoughts are from grownups in which none of them are happy thoughts. They all describe how life is crappy and how they wish things would change or become better. The film distinguishes the fact of how children and angels are completely opposite than grownups. The main angel constantly repeats the saying `When a child was a child,' then goes off to explaining something. The angel explains how a child looks at the world in a completely different way from older individuals and how that they see things as good or not having feelings about it at all. The audience only hears the thoughts of children a couple of times and only one of those is remotely negative. Grouping the angels with the children is significant because of the fact that in the film the children seem as if they can see the angels where as the grownups can't. Also the angels are to looking at the world with a different perspective and they don't have feelings or are unable to concept some things like a child would be unable to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sky Over Berlin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wings of Desire, is in a way, Wim Wenders' tribute to Berlin. He attempts to create something beautiful and different out of the city, while at the same time addressing its mottled past. The film focuses on the walls that separate us all, such as age, geographic location, openness of mind and, in the case of his angels, spiritual and physical planes. At the same time, the original German name for the film translates as 'The Sky Over Berlin,' and this portrays the shared conflicts and also physical space that unite everyone in the city. In addition, I argue in this analysis that the film also deals with the outcomes of facing or denying your fears and the past. In many ways the film depicts Berlin as a very haunted place. Both people and angels are haunted by the specters of events past, and this is brought to life by Wenders' use of found footage. The angels, like the history of the city, are perceptible yet imperceptible in their omnipresence. Both carry with them a great sadness and primordial memory while at the same time delighting in the reality of human experience and life. The angels are the consciousness and the conscience of the city, bearing witness and moving around on both sides of the wall, as humans are unable to do. What Wenders considers to be the "one perennial question" in the film is that of 'how to live?' How to live, how to die, or in the case of the angels, whether or not to live a mortal life. In the film, the dialogue talks about the splitting of Germany into "so many individual states," and in this postwar city people become as a state unto themselves: isolated yet created by the existence of so many others. Perhaps this is why Wenders calls Berlin the 'city of conjurers' and follows a female trapeze artist and a film director. Perhaps the focus on these characters symbolizes the inherent conflict of Berlin as to whether or not history should try to be examined, explained or recreated, or ignored and downplayed for the time being through the escape of spectacle and entertainment. In the remainder of this analysis, I will examine the characters of the trapeze artist and the director with examples supporting these premises. In the character of the trapeze artist, we see a large desire to feel love for others (which she voices), and also the fear that she will no longer be able to perform with the circus (a wall keeping her from her dreams). At the same time, she continues to perform and party with friends to take her mind off of this. In one scene, the circus is performing for a group of children, and there are so many things happening that it is difficult to tell whom to watch. Everyone performing looks a bit lost and each tries to direct the children's attention. The trapeze artist herself represents the precariousness of refusing to deal with inner demons, and in many scenes she looks ready to fall willingly to her demise. On the other hand, the filmmaker represents the ability to live life to the fullest and face past demons head-on. He is filming a movie about World War II, yet he chooses to focus on life's pleasures rather than sorrows. He encourages the angels to come down to earth even though he cannot explicitly see them. He encourages them to face and to leave their sorrows and uncertainties in order to celebrate in the richness of human life. He encourages the angels to take charge of their destinies instead of remaining passive bystanders to the sorrows of time. Wings of Desire focuses on what separates and unites everyone and also on the precariousness of denial or apathy in the face of tragedy.</fullReview>

Not all filmed art has to mimic Hollywood. I liked the fact that each of the principal actors spoke in their native language. I especially liked the cameo by "Nick Cave &amp; The Badseeds". He's such a Cool Dude! This film probably isn't for everyone. I know alot of people don't like reading subtitles. But, at least, give it a couple of viewings before you judge it.

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film i was fascinated by the concept,Angels in"Wings of Desire"are away from religion,to me is more philosophy than theology a little bit controversial,this angels seem more"doomed" than "blessed" they suffer not only because the world is falling apart,their real pain is envy they want to be human,falling in love,feel things,see the world in colors... the melancholy is there. The city is Berlin then divided by a wall similar to the visible and invisible world of human and angels.If we are the blessed one why we are so apart from each other?this is the question the film ask and the answer is so simple and powerful:Damiel(Bruno Ganz) decides to become human because he want to love someone and make a difference in a very cold and solitary place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful film about love, spirituality, and loneliness, Wings of Desire is a great work of art. Bruno Ganz gives a typically great and sad-faced performance as an angel who considers leaving his "job" after he falls in love with a human. That description just doesn't do the film justice, however, as one has to sit back and be spellbound by the stunning photography, wonderful acting, and poetic voiceovers. It's a film that really captures Cold War Germany quite well, though it has a resonance that crosses all boundaries, geographical and spiritual.</fullReview>

Told in a very complex manner, through the thoughts and experiences of a multitude of characters in late Cold War Berlin, this film follows an angel who is no longer satisfied with watching the world of mankind ... he longs to become a part of it, to feel as we feel, to connect with other human beings. Photographed mainly in stark black-and-white, with images alternately grungy and fantastically beautiful. One of the opening shots shows an angel standing atop a skyscraper in the heart of downtown Berlin, wings rising twenty feet overhead.

		<shortDescription>Something i will never recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My rating for the wings of desire would have to be two stars out of five. This movie overall is entirely too confusing and unattractive when you first start watching the movie. The director could have fulfilled the image he saw for the movie and the message he was trying to relay to the audience more enjoyable than what he actually did. Overall, when watching the movie you feel like you have to guess at what is really going on or what is trying to be understood in the underlying message in the scene. What makes the movie unenjoyable is the transitions, the bad acting, the direction the movie went, and how boring it actually was. The transitions of the movie were very choppy and boring. When changing from scene to scene it was not smooth and eased its way, it looked as if they had a new idea and without giving us some type of cause they just jumped to that specific scene and/or person. Then when transitioning from character to character you couldn't keep up with who was who, or what was significant about that person or if anything was significant about them at all. Just that alone would deteriorate someone from finishing the movie and just bring the the movie back.When watching the movie the theme was really easy to spot out without a challenge, which made for a pretty standard and mediocre movie. As soon as I started watching I figured the movie was relaying the message that no one or nothing is too great to not desire something they want. When watching this movie it takes less than an hour to figure out the theme, which made the movie less interesting. Whenever someone watches a movie, it is better for the audience to try and figure out the theme which keeps the movie interesting. Once you lose interest in that movie it is not worth the time and effort to sit there and keep watching a movie you already figured out and that's how I felt when watching Wings of Desire.The acting in the movie was very amateur. It felt as if the actors/actresses were reading a script. The actors acting was so poor that any random person off the street could have played the character because the characters felt like regular extras in the movie who had no significance. Whenever they acted the scene it did not flow. It felt like they were forcing the emotions and did not tap into the character they were supposed to portray. When comparing them to another movies acting they looked like new comers. The actors that were chosen did not fit the script. Throughout the movie, the camera shots were poor quality for the time they were in. When comparing to another movie, the camera shots were very amateur. The close ups were at awkward times. They also got too close up on their face and should have gave them a more profile view, and the angels they chose throughout the movie were very poor choices. The lighting in the movie in some of the scenes was very poor lighting and made the characters very dark. Overall I did not like the experience that I received when watching this movie. The movie was really boring and exhausting to watch. While watching this movie, you notice the poor choices the director which made the movie a huge downfall. To me, I think the movie could have used a lot of more work before they released it to the public. This movie was something I would not recommend to someone else as a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wings of Confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all want something in this life, a burning desire for more or what we cannot have. Even someone who has everything still longs for more. Much like, in the movie "Wings of Desire". Therefore it came as no surprise when the main character Damiel, an angel, longs to be human, in order to be with the mortal women he falls in love with. Though this movie sounds like it has great potential, do not be conned into thinking it's something worth seeing. The story line is amusing, but overall it is two and a half hours of confusion and disappointment. The viewer would assume the overall plot would be very predictable if the story was simply an angel who falls in love with a mortal, but that is not the case in this film. The director of this film wanted it to go more in depth. In order to do that,t the movie has over ninety plus minutes of black and white commentary of the thoughts of everyday people. Through this, adds emphasis to what the angel's go through and observe, this portion of the movie is extremely dragged out. Most of the commentary is irrelevant to the plot of the movie, and it confuses the viewer as to what the story is. Even when one of the main character in the movie, the trapeze artist, appears the film continues to go off subject. This makes the viewer wonder what their main focus should be on.As for the acting in the movie, this should be rated as decent. Decent in the sense that the parts in this film are relatively easy to portray. Majority of the characters in the film, are simply standard by passer, which can be played by anyone. As for the two main angels, their parts were played well enough, but even a majority of their character is emotionless. The overall all look of the angels being dark and mysterious was chosen well in the appearance of the two men. The look for the main female actress was also matched well with the character being portrayed. She gives off a look of youth and innocence and when speaking her dialog she does well in seducing the audience with her eyes and voice. The combination of her looks and the look of Damiel, is an awkward combination. His appearance being much older and more mature than hers, makes them an awkward pair for the audience to connect to.The setting choice for the movie, works for and against it. Berlin being chosen as the city the story takes place, makes you wonder right off if the movie is based on what's going on at the time. Though that aspect adds more interest in the thoughts and emotions of the everyday people the angels observe, it only add to the confusion on what your focus should be on. If the German title for the movie "The Skies of Heaven over Berlin", would have been kept, the viewer would immediately think the movie had everything to do with what tragedy was taking place in Berlin at the time and would draw attention away from the actual plot of the movie.Another major point of confusion in the movie is the question of who's, what? When the Damiel transitions into a human, we find out that the English actor Peter Fauc is also a former angel himself. We know this because he can sense their presence when the angels are around him. With that information, who's to say the main female actress is not former angel herself? There is no evidence in the film that says she not, but there is evidence that says she could be. For instance when she knew she was looking for a man but did not know who, and when she spoke alone in the movie it was as if she knows someone was listening. Same way Peter Fauc did when he sensed the presence of an angel around him. Also, towards the very end of the movie she knew exactly what man to go to in the bar, and her closing speech was implying she knew who he was all along and that they were going to meet? This is all evidence that supports that she could have also been a former angel herself, which leaves the viewer with even more confusion as to the characterization in the movie.The overall rating for the movie Wings of Desire would be a three out of five stars. The acting and overall story of the movie is not a complete lost cause. The main downfall for the films is its pacing and pointless scenes, which leads to much confusion and loss of interest throughout the very beginning on.

		<shortDescription>a love letter to the city of Berlin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently seen Wings of Desire again. Apart from the obvious artistic merit and grinding slow tempo, it struck me how it had historical importance that hadn't been perceived at the time of filming.Probably no one in the crew believed that Germany would unify a couple of years after the premiere and that Berlin would become whole again. I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire.With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin.The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujir&#x14d; Ozu, François Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky. This might explain the slow tempo, which is in my opinion the only thing in Wings of Desire that didn't stand the test of time. This, in turn, deducts two stars from the perfect note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Introduction to Bruno Ganz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie more than 3 years ago at a free screening at the USC film school, and this was the first time I saw (or came across the name of) Bruno Ganz on screen. This was prior to his glory days as Hitler (in, The Underground). His acting fascinated me the way Toshiro Mifune did in Seven Samurai. Since then, I have seen a few other movies with Ganz in it, but this is the movie that I always associate with Ganz, in my mind.Needless to say, this is a very good movie. The theme is probably not as original as some would claim (Lord of the Rings has a similar episode in it: Immortality vs. Love. Neither is the story of a fallen angel is something truly original; Leo Tolstoy had a short story, or a novella, about a fallen angle working with a cobbler in a remote, poor village), but the execution is superb and so is the restrained acting. This is a very humane movie, just like Steinbeck's books are! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wim Wender's "The Wings of Desire" may be the best film of the '80s, if not the later 20th century. Poetry put on screen, the wings of desire Wenders depicts are not desirable at all. Never before has a movie so dull been so fascinating and full of life.Set, and filmed, in Germany before the collapse of the Berlin wall, "The Wings of Desire" follows two angels on Earth, sent to observe the details and events that come with being human. Coffe with cigarettes,the wonder and mystery of death, being full of joy and harboring in the pits of depression: It's all here. Wender's use of color stock film and black/white scenes are a major part of the film's theme. It might be the most prominent theory explored in such films: to experience is more important to know. The division of East and West Germany is crucial to the film (part of what made 'City of Angels' fail in my mind), as it shows the moral of a society dying, the failures that come with being human, the need for love and compassion.The concert scene may be the best use of foreshadowing and reference to a social happenings I've ever seen. As the punk and rebellious group Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds play to a crowd of a mostly stereotypical crowd, he sings to the people who later helped tear the Berlin wall down. As an angel finds love, a people are educated in their failures. It's funny, I was so sure this movie must have been made after the fall of the wall. Perhaps Wenders is an angel himself, or just a great film-maker who knows the effects of hope, humanity, and compassion in a fragile world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are very few movies that appeal to my spiritual side and this is certainly my favorite. There is something remarkable about this film which I can't quite put into words. It is what I can only define as cinematic poetry. Like a long piece of prose poetry translated into moving images that are both stark and brilliant, this movie works upon you deeply on the inside. The dialog is often beautiful and at other times quite funny and the scene near the end of the film in which the fallen angel is at last able to be seen and touched by the woman he loves has a piece of dialog that leaves me breathless every time. What an expression of genuine love!I have taken several friends to see this movie with mixed results. Some are fascinated and others frustrated by its length and non- Hollywood structure. If I were only allowed one movie to watch for the rest of my life, it would be this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I queued up for at least an hour to see this film when it first came out and it didn't disappoint. There are so many good things to say about it, I hardly know where to start. The acting is one place, Bruno Ganz is superb and the two angels are so believable in their angelic and his human guise. The next huge thing for me was the music. Whilst part of the reason I wanted to see this film was for Cave and Bargeld, I was mostly moved by the cello music particularly in the library sequences. I think it's maybe hard now for new viewers to have the understanding of the Berlin Wall that was so real for us when the film was first released. Some years after I saw the film in the cinema, I bought the video, and showed it to many friends who scoffed at German cinema but were converted by watching this film in my home. Recently, due to the death of my video, I have found a DVD and now can't wait for a free evening when I can watch and listen to this wonderful piece of cinema again. Sadly, I don't think Wenders has ever done anything as good again. But I stand to be corrected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wim Wenders always makes movies that are pure poetry. This is one of them. It's about an angel who decides to become a man when he finds love, but it's not sappy at all. The writing is a poem; the music is a poem; the direction is a poem; and the performances are a poem.This movie is very subtle and of rare beauty. It has a dreamy atmosphere, and at the same time very dark. You can feel something wrong is happening: you can see the Berlin Wall, a lot of people contemplating life, and the black and white makes everything look like it's happening elsewhere. Wim Wenders shoots beautifully, with the camera always moving softly, making you feel the characters. A great example is the first scene in the nightclub. The voice overs are an original way of showing feelings, and, in this case, very rewarding.You have to like slow paced movies to enjoy this one. The first hour is just character development, and the angels walk through the city, helping people and thinking about life. Then, Bruno Ganz's character decides to become a man, coming into this world to live and feel, and suddenly everything gains color for him. His entrance in the world of living is a beautiful metaphor, and the dialog between him and Marion is brilliant.The performances are great, too. Bruno Ganz can express all of the emotions of the character without speaking, most of the time. The look in his eyes, his body language, and the way he delivers his few lines is amazing. Solveig Dommartin has a good delivery and body language, and her voice overs are very touching. Otto Sander is fine, too, and all the people that appear in just one scene perfectly capture their characters.This is very involving; it gets you in another world and touches you deeply. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ideals of Wender's West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it was the last major Berlin film to come out before the fall of the wall, Wim Wender's "Wings Of Desire", 1987, exists in a state of transition where one thing is 'on the verge' of becoming another. To a certain extent, the world of the angels can be looked at as a representation of the east, blanketed by a veil of idealistic monotony (communism). The desire of the angel, Damiel, to transcend this, comes from a longing to experience the world through a new material based physicality (capitalism). The film achieves this in a technical sense through a number of factors including the use of black and white in certain scenes, while resorting to color in others."Wings of Desire" is an exceptionally beautiful looking film. Much of its artistic quality stems from the legendary cinematographer, Henrai Alekan, and the unique techniques he employed. Alekan's use of his grandmothers stocking as a filter, provides an additional, as well as thematically appropriate, barrier between the viewer and the medium. The camera-work floats from one location to the next, letting the audience view the world through the eyes of an angel, while the ambient music, composed by Jurgen Kneiper acts as a textural bridge between heaven and earth. The films aesthetics ultimately end up supporting its quest for material immediacy There are many other examples of how the film addresses westernization and consumer culture. The role of the film-star, is played by Peter Falk, who is most noted for his role as Columbo, a popular and well known American symbol. When Damiel 'falls from grace' he is quick to adapt to the capitalist system, as one of his very first acts involves him selling his armor. (the only object which connects him with his past) Even in the black and white scenes, a certain sense of materialism is achieved, as the angels are chicly clad in long black coats and scarves, with matching ponytails. It would be somewhat amusing if heaven were to actually exist in the form of a Calvin Klein commercial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I initially saw "Wings of Desire" some ten years ago on video. I have seen it since on DVD. It is a unique and magical film which captures everything that Wim Wenders has achieved as a director, before and since. Wenders has many Hollywood influences, including John Ford and Sam Fuller (who was in "The American Friend"), but he also takes in the best elements of international cinema. The performances here are genuine, and the cinematography is breath-taking. I also like the sequel, though it has more detractors. Wenders would have made a great photographer, musician, or a novelist, but those of us who love movies are glad he chose cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a film I saw when it first came out, and at least 5 times since then. Each time I feel the same emotion at the unreal storyline, as if it had been written for me. Each time I watch it as if it was a painting, or as if I was listening to one of my well known old favorite pieces of music: you know what's coming, but each time it does the trick! A few people I have recommended it to have not liked it, and I fear have missed the point, but fortunately most have taken off and enjoyed it as much as I have. I'm not one for "artie-fartie" stuff at all, but this takes you somewhere else, probably because of the pace of the film itself, and the fundamental questions it raises. I love it. It's just beautiful and everyone should watch it with open eyes and an open mind. Let yourselves be taken in, don't resist the irrational and unrealistic style, this film complements life. It has been a spiritual experience every time I've seen it, I just hope my children will like it as much as I do when they are a bit older, and don't think I'm a batty old hippie!!

I don't believe in angels, but this film made me want to believe that there is always someone watching over you in your time of need. I have never been to Berlin, the cinematography makes the city almost stand out of the screen as if you could reach out and touch it.

		<shortDescription>This movie is poetry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wim Wenders likes making slow movies - as "Paris, Texas" or the "Soul of a Man". (This is important to know this before seeing the movie, because nobody is all the time in the mood for this kind of cinema.)The movie tells the story of two angels, living in Berlin; they are enjoying the beauty of god's creation, noting curious and particularly beauty events in a diary. However, they are always some kind of distant, cannot be seen or touched, have no possibility to interact with humans in a physical way, only in a spiritual one, giving them some psychological support. One of them falls in love with a handsome french woman, and - by her - with time, with taste, with touch, with all which belongs to human perception. He decides to become human. This is the essential of the story; the rest lies in the fantastic pictures, in one of the best soundtracks I ever heard, and in those beautiful words. The unconnected and unfinished thoughts of the human beings form a floating and fuzzy fog, which make of this movie an unconventional and surprising one - with a bit of an experimental taste. This is also a movie about Berlin. With its people, its history, the Nazis, the bombs, the reconstruction, the wall.Mixed with some sparse "pointillage" of humor, Wim Wenders has achieved a Master piece with this movie ... even if I prefer the less ambitious Paris, Texas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in '88 and have seen it 3 more times since then. In my opinion it is Wim Wenders magnum opus, drawing on mythology, psychological archetypes and the primary mental states we all experience at some time in our lives. Who hasn't felt lonely and wondered whether there are guardian angels watching us and what 'life' might be like for them, listening in on our thoughts, yet not really empowered to change anything we do.The transition from black-and-white to colour is indeed a rebirth and simultaneously, a coming to earth. How much more profound a juxtaposition can one get than that!?The use of Peter Falk as himself only adds to the authenticity of the events as they onfold. And Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds appearance, with it's depressing lyrics, only serves to emphasize the female lead's state of mind before the moment she has waited for her entire life..."As das kind, kind wa..." (When a child is a child...) the movie narrative begins...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humans need to be reminded how being a human is precious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you ever think about why would an angel decide to give away his immortal life and start living like a human being? Because,being a human being , living among other humans, drinking coffee, feeling love , scenting smell, bleed, and seeing colors are the most precious things, not only on Earth but in Heaven also, among angels who are not capable to do such things. The problem is that people need to be reminded of all that beauty, because, unfortunately, they seem to be forgetting it. It almost like health- we feel the preciousness of it only when it has been taken away from us, and replaced with disease. I am just sorry , because it has passed 14 years since this masterpiece was created, and yet, nobody seems to care starting enjoying small, precious details of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful journey through the eyes of two angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a beautiful journey through the eyes of two angels, Wenders has crafted one of the most original love stories ever to be put to celluloid (and like everything foreign and beautiful, an American company buys the rights, dumbs it down for our audiences and reproduces it without giving any credit to the original?ie ?The City of Angels'). After always being invisible to people: only capable of hearing their thoughts and comforting their souls, one of the angels longs for the touch of another human; especially after he falls for a circus trapeze artist. He longs to do the things we enjoy, smoke a cigarette or drink a cup of coffee, experience all the emotions we take for granted. The cinematography is great, the dialogue is thought-provoking yet approachable, and the acting is superb. I have not yet seen the sequel, but am very excited to see what Wenders does with the second half of the story. As a last thought, I think it is great Peter Falk (TV's Colombo) was able to do a little tongue-in-cheek acting here, I like seeing Hollywood stars who are willing to poke fun at their established images.

The film has a very etheral quality, like a dream, and it truly is Wender's "love letter" to his beloved city of Berlin. It is a film that stays in your thoughts for days after you view it; its imagry, its poetic dialouge, the questions of mortality that it raises. "City of Angels", the remake, is quite good, but the original truly qualifies as a masterpiece.</fullReview>

It took me a while before I realized that Bruno Ganz was playing an angel which put me in a complete blur how he interacted with other people. As a photographer I noticed how the film wasn't really BW but had strange colour effects over it enhancing the mood of the different scenes.When he falls in love with the circus artist and the film changes to this exaggerated colour it's mindblowing. It adds an intensity that's unreal.Add the performance of Peter Falk (who's being recognized in the streets of Berlin all the time as Columbo) as an angel who has descended to earth to be with the woman he loves and starts coaching Bruno in his descend you're dealing with one of the most awesome films all time where reality, fiction, love and hope are playing a weird game with the spectator.Another performance worth mentioning is Nick Cave (who I really disliked up untill this movie) who plays an underground artist singing in clubs being visited by the circus artist. I think it was the first time I actually liked his performance as a singer and I've had a soft spot for him ever since.A must see for anyone who loves film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've had this film recommended to me by several people and I finally got around to watching it and like a few others on here I could only suffer about ninety minutes before I gave up and switched it off.The cinematography is excellent although the mixing of monochrome and colour was a cliché even in 1987 (only good use is in 'A Matter Of Life And Death') and it was for that alone that I gave the film the time that I did. In fact, that's really what this film seems to be, one long exercise in camera and lighting technique. There is no plot as such, the acting doesn't exactly stretch any of the players and the script is juvenile and gets tiresome after about ten minutes. At best the film was making obvious points about life and at worst it was deliberately obscure and inaccessible.I get the impression that this piece has a touch of 'the emperor's new clothes' about it; that to say you think it's rubbish labels you as a philistine, but the truth is that it isn't very good and a classic example of style over content. I'm just glad that there are a few other brave and intelligent souls using IMDb that felt the same way that I did. I'm sure a lot of pseudo-intellectuals will pore over this film for years finding all kinds of meaning in it, but it just says nothing to me except 'pretentious nonsense.' This sort of exposition on life works well in print, but just isn't suited to cinema, so I've been generous and given the film three stars for the cinematography, but that really is about it. Others have said it before and they are right, this is the sort of film that gives art-house cinema a bad name. Better to watch 'Lola Rennt,' an accessible piece of German art cinema that manages to say something tangible and have a lot of fun at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the very high ratings I went to see this film expecting something wonderful. Now after reading the rave reviews I am compelled to write about how different I felt. I had a very hard time sitting through this one as did several audience members who actually left the theatre. I really wanted to identify with or understand what these "people" were thinking or doing but felt totally uninspired which is I guess what the director wanted me to be. For the most part this film was dreary and for the the first half much too elongated with the characters going into great detail about their feelings. Do most people go through that much highly advanced thought processes about such deep issues or did these angels just get lucky to find special subjects. Being a big Peter Falk fan I was delighted to see him as the only great thing about this movie as he turned in a terrific performance. Even for one in the top 250 there's got to be someone who thinks it's mediocre!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are only two movies that I've ever had highly recommended by others which were so dreadful as wonder whether my friends were in fact abducted by aliens and replaced with identical replicas with poor taste. the first example would be the dreadful "Meet the Parents"; the second, "Wings of Desire".Talk about a film of existentialist navel contemplation, and you've got it with "Wings". I'm not sure how the film turned out - it was so over the top laughable in its hokey greeting card sentiment that I couldnt finish watching it; actually, my girlfriend at the time did the mercy killing.Hey, I love movies where the foibles of humanity and life are considered and ruminated over, from "2001" to "The thin red line". But folks, this movie is like the guy you know who lies to girls and tells them they are pretty when they aren't: if you see through his maudlin sentiment, you're left wincing. If you don't you think he's the sweetest guy alive. "Wings of Desire" is that guy in celluloid form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's the best word to describe this piece of cinematography? BORING. This might actually be one of the most boring films I've ever seen!! I could hardly keep my eyes open and watch the whole film. It is so pretentious I want to cry!! Like "Oh my God think!! Think, of how great life is!!" So annoyingly romantic and hopeful, it's plain sappy. Seriously, I recommend this to anyone with sleeping problems, just let it play on the background and you will sleep like a baby. Also great for hipsters and anyone who wants to seem thoughtful and intellectual. If you think this movie is oh so meaningful and beautiful, oh well I hope your guardian angel will help you with your taste in films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wings of Desire (Der Himmel über Berlin)- Germany 1987This is #5 on the list.Wings of Desire. It's great, I have to open this with the amazing versatility of Bruno Ganz. I may start to check his movies out more, he is a great foreign actor. He and Max von Sydow have become some of my favorite foreign actors. I understand that this movie is filled with sub-plots and branches, which usually would leave some plot holes for me and my purely-tunnel-vision-American-mind. The sub-plots only made this film easier to understand and better comprehensible. The plot; great. I would've changed a few things, most likely being the ending, but the film was still great. At first I thought this movie was legitimately from the era of black and white due to the great coloring of off-tempo sepia and the Fritz-Lang-esque camera angles. It wasn't until half way through the movie, when I researched that this movie was made in '87. The film asks every question that should be asked, and answers very few. But the answers are beautiful. Also the reoccurring little phrase throughout the movie only adds to the great narration. The beauty; is amazing due to the fact that nearly 80% or more of the dialogue, is narrated, and the emotion of the character on screen has to match the narration. This is amplified, the story telling through narration; being the fact that the narration is matched by dull and blank faces. It's beautiful. Also, I am a true sucker for movies that are 'reborn' or a movie in which the main character has a revelation to the wondrous world. And the humor only adds to the greatness, contrasting color, and change in tone of dialogue. I don't know why Nick Cage had to go and remake this.Lastly, the hardest decision, rating this movie. It isn't at all a 7/10, it is so much better than that. But I can't say it is an 8/10But; just for Bruno Ganz's happy revelation, I will just give this a-SilverRating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films I have had the pleasure of viewing. Possibly the only secular Angel movie to never mention even the existence of God. The film is absolutely brilliantly poetic and so beautiful to look at and marvel at. Quite honestly after just the first viewing back in November this is one of my all time favorite films. Bruno Ganz is his usual self in it; sublime. I strongly believe that he is one of the greatest actors on the planet. I cannot begin to describe the beauty and poetic-ism of the premise of an Angel wanting to lose his wings just so he can live a normal life and know what it is like to come home and feed the cat, have his fingers turn black from the newspaper, say "ah" "oh" and "ouch" instead of "yes" and "amen," to lie through one's teeth, and to love another person and have them know you actually exist. It's perfect. The use of black and white for the Angel's perspective and color for human perspective is absolutely genius. Seriously if you have even the chance to see this film do NOT hesitate; just see it and marvel at it's wonder. I love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great Wenders explores the realmic transcendence of love with the delicateness of an artist toying seriously with the visuality of the medium.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Influential German director Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire is perhaps his greatest known film. It is a towering achievement that blends the aestheticism of film art with fantasy storytelling grounded in reality. The result is a unique work that delves into the primal human need for love, and finding purpose in one's existence through it. The film takes the age-old idea of forbidden (or impossible) romance between two parties and gives it a one-sided twist.In Wings, the lead character Damiel (Bruno Ganz) is an angel who perches atop the Berlin Victory Column every day, looking down at Berliners and hearing their thoughts. Many of them seem to be struggling to cope with life's multitude of problems, but there are a few who appear optimistic that their lives are getting better. One day, Damiel sees a beautiful but lonesome trapeze artiste performing and falls in love with her. He contemplates giving up his immortality to come down to Earth to be with her.Wenders' choice of using black-and-white cinematography and sparsely intercutting it with color images gives the film a visual style that is indescribably poetic. The black-and-white imagery suggests a time of the past captured through the lens of the now such that it feels like it is an elongated fleeing moment that seems to last for eternity, as if trapped in historic time that has profoundly changed the city of Berlin and its inhabitants. The color imagery, on the other hand, suggests the moment as it is passing, a breath taken in, and the smell of fresh scent lingering in the air.The contrast is meant to be jarring, unlike "the girl in red coat" sequence in Spielberg's predominantly black-and-white Holocaust drama Schindler's List (1993) which is more subtle in nature. The jarred effect would heighten the aesthetical senses of the viewer, leading him (or her) to ponder about what reality means, and more fundamentally, how reality shows itself. Color, as real as it could get, could symbolize a fantastical construct of someone's hopeful dreams, whereas, black-and-white images portray poetic realism that borders on the unreal.Combining with an aural soundscape that is distinctive as it is peculiar, Wings becomes like a mystical song of sorts ? a song that blends the repetitive voice of someone reciting a poem, the collective "thought-sighs" of Berliners, the slow strings that accompany the balletic aerial shots, the psychedelic beats of a sub-culture German band, and the lazy, drifty jazzy sound that gives a dangerous trapeze act a measure of elegance in its motion.I quote from Wenders: "My story isn't about Berlin because it's set there but because it couldn't be set anywhere else. The name of the film will be "The Sky Over Berlin" (a translation of the film's more evocative German title) because the sky is maybe the only thing that unites these two cities apart from their past of course. Will there be a common future? Heaven only knows." (Criterion DVD booklet, p. 15). And indeed heaven does know, at least in the context of Wings. Wings of Desire is very much a colorful ode to the beauty of Berlin, its people, their struggles and hopes, and above all, their desire for normalcy. The great Wenders explores the realmic transcendence of love with the delicateness of an artist toying seriously with the visuality of the medium. The result is pure visual splendor, a filmic poem for the ages, and a recommended experience to behold.SCORE: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious and highly artistic German film that very much takes a step back and observes the human condition, as well as Berlin as a space these people inhabit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anything, Wings of Desire is a really interesting and engaging life affirming piece, delivered with an odd aesthetic which jumps from grounded realism to extravagant, swooping camera shots and compositions of a high-art nature. Here is a film that blurs the lines between reality and non-reality; realism and fantasy, but never comes across as a piece talking down to you, nor jumbled or misguided. Its documenting of those of a different universe that have all the power in the world in terms of telepathy and eternal life, but never feel as if they are really able to 'exist', is certainly very humbling as they ponder the prospect of what they deem proper, or real living: to have goals, a life, to feel love towards another of your 'kind', and to ultimately, have an expiry date.Wings of Desire's narrative revolves around transition. It takes time over the establishment of an order or a lifestyle, complete with rules and conventions, and the want to break away and break out of that mould in order to become something else ? something you've been observing your entire existence, feel as if you understand, but have never quite had the chance to fully engage with. The setting of West Berlin, in the late 1980s, and right towards the end of The Cold War as two 'warring' sides that are The East and The West inhabit spaces right next to one another, comes rather timely and helps 'place' Wings of Desire.One might say the film looks at Berlin as a real-life city in its contemporary state. If you subscribe to this, then the angels of the piece might be supposed to represent those in The East or what those in The East of Berlin represent. The popular belief from The West might have been that those in The East, indeed Communists or Communism in general, were mysterious; that they could see and hear you but you were not able to return that favour; that, essentially, despite these characteristics which supposedly makes them superior, most of them wanted to be in the West a lot more than you might have wanted to be in the East. This echoes Damiel's scenario and his general goal. Additionally, if you saw or met one of them, you'd be a little frightened despite the fact they very much represent you by way of pure, physical appearance. The conventions might also apply to the angels of the piece; as mysterious beings that most certainly posses a position of power and long to be more like those in The West, like 'us'.In terms of narrative, the film is primarily about an angel named Damiel (Ganz) who talks, ponders and muses with Cassiel (Sander) in an array of initially rather maddening voice overs that come accompanied with swooping camera shots. They seem to long for direction, feeling and some sort of vulnerability despite being these all powerful, wing-clad beings whom are invisible to anybody over the age of about eight. They walk the streets of this city trying to do good, just as they have been for many, many years. Damiel wants to be 'normal'; he wants to fit in and he wants to have direction. His whole plight might be compared to New German Cinema as a movement, something director Wim Wenders was involved in at its beginnings, as this film movement that wanted acceptance and an identity amongst the already established. Another reason Damiel wants this mortality is that he is in love with a trapeze artist named Marion (Dommartin).Wings of Desire is full of ideas. Its notion that one such immortal being has been around for so long and seen so much good and bad; pain and suffering; joy and retribution before finally settling for the time in which he does to become a mortal gets across the real sense of fondness he has for Marion, someone he stumbles upon as she practises her circus act with the rest of her acquaintances. The film also hits upon the notion that boundaries between this world and supposed others are thiner than you think and that those random bursts of reassurance we might feel in life are the results of angels of some sort desperately attempting to instill us with positivity.Additionally, Wenders gives us, as an audience, the viewpoint of these immortals which further distills certain issues of spectatorship within the film. If Bazin wrote about cinema being a 'window' into the lives of others, the angels in Wings of Desire are some sort of visualisation of this window: an ability to watch others, often at their darkest times as some commit suicide; others find themselves involved in car crashes; and others suffer clinical depression as they miss male companionship. Despite it being rather ironic that it is a form of pain and suffering in a human that ultimately leads Damiel to jump sides, the film is a celebration of life, or why life is worth the effort. It has its characters pay meticulous appreciation to the colour scheme of the walls in some locations and has also has them honour the taste of certain things at certain other times. The manner in which Wenders only slightly uses colour in the early part of the piece makes the film feel more colourful and more joyous later on when everything is seen as it should be. As a love story and as an ambitious fairy-tale, Wings of Desire works rather well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson in how we take our lives for granted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film as centering around three distinct themes, all of them very detailed and well thought out. The first of these would be the innocence of children, which is brilliantly displayed by the fact that children are the only ones who can see the angels. The angels are a sign of pure good, and since the world is so full of evil they can't see this symbol of purity. But children are still innocent and pure, so they can see the angels before they get older and become corrupt by society.The second theme is the age old saying "The grass is always greener on the other side." As mortal beings, most people would love to become an angel. To become an infinite, invulnerable and immortal being is a dream for a good portion of society, and they would give anything to escape from society's flaws and evil. In Damiel, we see the exact opposite in angels. They want to escape the never ending life of hovering above the world, watching as they go about their days. They would love to become mortal beings, to live their life enjoying the trivial things society mistreats.This leads to the final theme, which is the overlying message of the entire film. This message is that we take our lives for granted. When Damiel is talking to Cassiel in the convertible, he makes a monologue that details all the things he would love to do if he were a mortal. This is put into further detail by Peter Falk, a former angel who escaped his life as an angel and wants to express to them the joys of becoming a human being. We see in these two men that we take our lives for granted. There are so many trivial things that we completely ignore and act like they are just everyday things that mean nothing. But when you think of what your life would be like if you didn't have these abilities, you realize how much of your life you mistreat. In the end, Damiel is a mortal and couldn't be happier and that really puts some final closure on the message of the film. It helps us to realize how much of life we take for granted.I also want to mention the beautiful color contrast that Wenders uses in the film. The fact that angels are a sign of pure good, and in such all they can see is two extremes; pure good or pure evil. Wenders displays this by having the angels see in black and white, while the humans can see in full color. They can see the joy and happiness of an actual being on Earth, and in such Wenders has their vision in full, vibrant color. I thought that was a brilliant idea that Wenders displays flawlessly. I really adored this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Floating eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the project great makers undertake without exception from Welles to Iwai; if those things which you can't touch with the hand can be felt to exist, yearning, memory, thought, if right now you can recall an image, it means this space extends around us and is a part of us, so how can this be surrounded with the camera, acknowledged beneath the story and allowed to float as life?It's a great joy to have this, Wenders repeatedly tried. He knows Buddhism, how narratives of the mind obscure a true perception, how dust settles on mirrors. He may or not know that both Buddhists and contemporaneous Greeks early on identified liberating wisdom as the right use of appearances, the link is Alexander's travel to India. And he must know that since the Greeks divinity in the West, apprehension of god, has been implicitly woven with the mind that attempts to transcend itself.So Wenders here is at his most ambitious about this, liberation in life, about death and (literal) god we can only have imaginations anyway. One of these imaginations is used here, the notion of angels in the heavens, but this is only the tool though for floating observation of life unhindered by story, to swim into narratives of mind, then see if we can push beyond and transcend.So an angelic eye swoops down into murky life, the place is Berlin as it contemplates wounds and walls. What do we see there?Our eye floats from one life to the next, one person to another, on one level the film offers a contemporary tapestry of German anxieties. On another the device lets us see more clearly into the nature of these anxieties - as we approach characters we're flooded by that extended self lost in thought, nothing but disappointment, vexation, desire. Parents fret about their son's loud music in the next room, a young acrobat worries that her circus dream may have amounted to nothing.Internal narration. This is typical Wenders, that side of him that keeps me at bay - Chris Marker in Sans Soleil playfully unfolds ribbons of remembrance, Tarkovsky rich clouds of appearance as they calmly empty out, Wenders can be as evocative as both but chooses to plod in rumination. The monologues grate as in previous films, they're too long. But he also reaches out for more.The higher ('angelic') view that brushes with earthly despair but flies off again finds no purpose or solace and only cyclical suffering - what the Buddhists call samsara. All considered, Wenders offers a powerful rendition of mind. Mind as the view that fleets from one thought, one story, to the next. Suffering as rumination and as inability to escape narration.Good, so far. Wenders being German can only feel the burden of history pressing on him, silly zeit and sein. But then finally we have the return to things as one of the angels decides to enter time and mortality. So how does Wenders enter this shift?If we could somehow only know this ethereal life of pure spirit in eternal peace that we've always yearned for, a disembodied mind that hovers above things without ever getting tangled up with them (all our notions of an afterlife converge on this), what would we think? Touch would be a profound mystery, having a body that feels wind or heat. I can't stress enough the importance of limits, it's what energizes life, that I don't know all, that I can be surprised and curious, that I can travel from here to there and discover, that it's all in flux and changing, it's why this whole circus matters.So I can see him stressing all the important realizations. Touch, being free to tangle with things and love. Spontaneous appreciation.I find myself rooting for this German as he shucks off the worry about meaning to be able to find it in the tremendous richness of things as they come to be and vanish again, what Herzog for thirty years had to travel to the most absurd corners to witness and pilgrimage, wash logic with doing. What Tarkovsky meditated inwards in memory, Marker in bemused preoccupation with revolution (never attached like Godard), cats and Tokyo.But Wenders meets his own limits once more. Whereas all these guys could transcend, Wenders only limps. A bit of wandering but without real wonder. In place of any of the small possible encounters he could create around Berlin, he gives us a Nick Cave concert again - style. The camera tracks forth and back in a crowd - style. The two lovers finally find each other - but swap monologues again of stale profundity.More dust. Now the Buddhist achievement of The Passenger becomes apparent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For an amazingly simple story about love, the execution is horrific.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have an open mind, I love watching films in general, I love watching films I've never heard of, I love blind-buying films. I love all kinds of films. If you look at my DVD and Blu-Ray collection, you will find animated classics like Pinocchio, Beauty and the Beast, then see films like Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, dance films like Make It Happen and Step Up 3D, dramas like The Runaways and Deep End. I would like to think I have an open mind for many films, I am also excited to see foreign films, with Let The Right One In one of my favourites along with the Fritz Lang's Metropolis.My lecturer put this film on during one of our classes, and I was feeling like "Yeah, this might be cool, let's give it a go." Ten minutes it with the camera wandering around from seemingly pointless character to seemingly pointless character I felt like grabbing my bag and walking out. I didn't have the head space, which, admittedly isn't the film's fault but I found the film as it went on to be tedious and extremely hard to get through, and am genuinely surprised I didn't fall asleep.The film is a love story. There you go, I spoiled it. But the way it's told is so complex and you don't really get the fact that it's a love story until the angel is turned human to find Marion, and this doesn't happen until the, let's see, fourteenth hour of the film (okay, maybe 2/3rds).The editing is atrocious, I felt like I was watching a rough cut or work print.The concepts in the film are fantastic and universal: of course we all want to break through and fall in love with that one person who has ignited something within us, that's as universal as you can get, but the way it's told is so locked-off and so *not* universal that those who may find enjoyment in the point of the film are invited to walk out as soon as they want to.I will say this again: the film has an amazing story. It's the execution of the story that is troublesome. It meanders, and for a film that lasts just over two hours it genuinely feels like you're watching something as the entire day passes outside.I know there are people out there that love this film (otherwise Criterion wouldn't have done it for their collection, but then again they did the appalling Armageddon for their collection as well, so maybe they don't *really* know good movies), but unfortunately (or fortunately, however you look at it) I am not one of those people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deception not Key</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deception Not Key in Wings of DesireFrom the opening frame to the credits, this movie was blunt in its tone not to try and mislead the audience. Wings of Desire, directed by Wim Wender in 1987 is a romantic comedy that has a more popular remade English version entitled City of Angels. The plot was not needed to be spelled out in order for the audience to understand Wender's concept that life's simple pleasures and the inherent beauty in everyday occurrences should not be overlooked. This was portrayed through the character Damiel played by Bruno Ganz. Damiel was an angel whom longed for life's simple pleasures that he could not have, included were the five senses with resulting emotions such as love. By the end of the film, Damiel finally got his wish and was able to experience them all including love with the trapeze artist Marion played by Solveig Dommartin. Through the contrasting images of a black and white screen associated with the angels, clashed against the usage of color when dealing with the rest of the world the film was able to draw out the dullness that life would pertain if one was lacking. In this scenario lacking the experiences of everyday life. The film kept a comedic edge through Peter Falk. The scenes with Falk were intended to keep the audience from being beset by their own ignorance in ignoring life and becoming depressed. After all, Wings of Desire is a love film and with too much melancholy with in the self, love may be over looked or considered insignificant. Falk did a tremendous job humoring the audience with his frightening paranormal conversations and Columbo persona. The only aspect of the film that temporary removed it from its lofty pedestal was the concluding love seen. I agree that it was very crucial for Marion to express her love thoroughly because quite frankly it was Damiel's first true experience. However, by about the sixth line it was becoming blatantly obvious what her intentions were and the continuation of cheesy and meaningless lyrics were unnecessary and to drawn out to be fully enjoyed. The succeeding lines of childhood and life were ample and heart-felt. These put the audience into a trance of thought about self-reflection and mended the film to its original stature.Although the concept of angels may seem far fetched to some, this film had a much deeper and more abstract meaning. Angels may or may not exist, but the truth is that there are people with physical handicaps who may never be able to experience one of the above mentioned aspects of life. This especially hits a little bit harder home if someone in particular is in the audience's mind. The majority of the audience including yours truly will go home and enjoy aspects such as touch and smell for nearly a week or so before it slips their mind and face-paced society overwhelms the heart once again. However, if for this time period the audience enjoys life a little more than they would have by taking the time to notice nature and enjoy the community they surround themselves with then the film has justifiably served its purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many moments of stunning beauty in this film that it's impossible to resist. The plot is ultra-simple: an angel falls in love and wants to be human. So simple that Hollywood turned it into a vapid, swooning weepie. But Wenders had something else in mind here, and so his camera follows a wealth of characters, from Peter Falk (playing himself) to an elderly historian, to a French trapeze artist across a desolate looking Berlin, reading their thoughts as they speak to themselves, clumsy and eloquent, about the small details of being alive.Of course it doesn't really jell into a narrative, but that's far beside Wenders' point here. Certainly a caveat emptor for anyone who doesn't care for slow moving art films, but rich trove of beauty awaits those who are willing to conquer this film. It has all of the usual Wenders problems, of course. For all of the thinking that these people do, our insights into their emotions is quite murky. Perhaps that is what Wenders is trying to say, but in building to a denoument that seems intended to release a highly charged emotional catharsis, this lack of clarity seems restraining. For that reason, the finale is strangely muted and a bit contrived.Wenders directs like an impressionist composer, focusing on feeling rather than development. It's both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. It keeps this film from being the classic that it occasionally seems like, but it's worth watching more than once. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the reflections I have about our own lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie in itself is nothing remarkable one might say. Yet, it does oblige someone to reflect about one's fears and secret wishes. To escape the everyday reality and hope for a better place where one can truly be himself and not have the feeling of being a "lost soul" dropped into a reality becoming more surreal with the moment. A temporal misfit. The angel is a symbol for the divine we're all eager to discover, either in ourselves or in someone else. What IS divine remains a question essentially unanswered of course. But it does transcend personal believes, philosophical views or morality. Amoral objective intelligence. Could it be that the complexity of our thoughts hidden behind a simple message of love or compassion is one aspect of the true genius of the human mind? Couldn't this be a taste of that secret divinity in all of us?</fullReview>

The angels watch and record the human existence, and they will ease the suffering of the mortals they study. Of course, some of them wish to cross over into mortality and experience human emotions. Wenders blends romance with philosophy against the stunning backdrop of Berlin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wings of Desire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German filmmaker Wim Wenders and his company Road Movies Produktion need to make a movie or else they will go bankrupt. Wenders decides he wants to set a movie in Berlin that tells the story of the people of Berlin. The movie follows the existence of angels as they follow humans around and influence what they think, how they react, and sometimes what they do. The angels are able to listen in to people's thoughts through an ingenious cinematic trick where they merely lean their head against a man or woman's and the thoughts begin to flow like rain. We hear their internal pleas for help, their self-doubts, their inner monologue, anything they might be thinking at the moment. Wenders shoots the majority of the film in black and white, but when an especially touching moment occurs, the movie switches to a beautiful and vibrant full color, almost Technicolor with extremely strong emphasis on reds and yellows. His camera is in constant motion, a sort of camera entfesselte or literally unfastened camera that moves about space without hinges or blockades. This unfastened style of cinematography seems to stick with Wenders throughout his career and becomes somewhat of a trademark for his films. Overall I thought the idea of this movie and its angels and people of Berlin was excellent, but there was something unsettling in the lack of focus in this movie. Picked this up at the University library.</fullReview>

Some very subtle humour that came along Peter Falk gave the extra warmth to go way beyond "artistic crap" of say, Lars von Trier's or some wannabe-visually striking experiments of Moodysson's (well, they're the colleagues in the neighbourhood..). A very humane story with a poetic storytelling in it. And thus, much more closer to Art than most competitors. I have to warn that you have to give some time to this one, though.I'm a little shy with full 10's but out of the films I've seen, this is one of the few that do deserve the extra attention.</fullReview>

The are content just to live in their Grey Shadows, not lifting a finger to prevent Virgiania Tech, Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, or Sandy Hook. Sure, once in awhile one of Wim's Voyeur Angels (they hardly can be labeled as "Guardians," can they?) elects to emerge from the Grey Realms like Mr. Snowden. If they are savvy from their eons of spying, they may prosper in our human world, as does the "Peter Falk" fallen angel played by Peter Falk in WINGS OF DESIRE. If they are naive, like Mr. Snowden, they get confined to Purgatory in some Russian airport. Wim tells us Cassiel's fate from this story is "to be determined."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, this otherwise very well-crafted movie was totally spoiled by the self-conscious, heavy-handed performance of Solveig Dommartin, who unfortunately had way too much screen time. The awkwardness of her performance reaches a painful apogee in the scene in the club. I found her egoistic style of acting very embarrassing, and it ruined the movie for me. Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else.

The use of language was also quite striking, although mostly in German; I found that the use of both French and English throughout made for an interesting mix.I know this film may not be for everyone, it's quite stark and the performances are quite downbeat, however, I did find it quite enthralling. There is a delightful twist near the end that I never would have guessed and it left me with a pretty good feeling. I can see why the critics liked it so much, it is very different to almost everything else I've seen and it certainly made for a refreshing change. As far as the narrative goes, well I need not have worried, it was a little slow, but it all tied up neatly in the end. Over all, if you're a fan of art- house cinema then this is a must-see, if not, then I'd probably give it a miss, but over all, for me?

		<shortDescription>Emperor Wenders got away with it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by placing my heart on my sleeve. There are things to enjoy here, but more I see of his films, the more I become very skeptical of Mr Wenders. First of all it's toooo long. Very little of any real consequence happens in the first HOUR. That first hour should have been cut, by at least half. Too many ponderous repetitive scenes with exactly the same function to describe: the wonder of being alive, the majesty of the microscopic. Yes, it's sometimes great when a film takes it's time, I'm an admirer of many works like this, particularly the fiercely conceptual films of Andrei Tarkovsky, whom Wenders dedicates this picture to (although does not merit comparison with), but when a film lulls you into a coma at four o' clock in the afternoon through directionless pontification, that's a problem. Any illusion of profundity comes from the poetry that accompanies the beautiful photography of french master Henri Alekan. I think these elements deserve a solid ground to rest upon, and a film centered around such themes requires at least a modicum of genuine spiritual insight, the same amount say, that Tarkovsky had in his little finger. Frankly, Wenders fails to provide that here, so much of the film appears as mere whimsey. Perhaps it is worth seeing for a few choice moments (Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk are good value) and the photography alone, but what are you left with when you remove the spectacle? For me it's a simplistic, faintly immature idea about an angel falling (literally from the heavens - yak) in love with a girl and turning human, so that he can experience LIFE with her. So then they hook up at a Nick Cave gig and live happily ever after.NB: The lyrics of the Nick Cave tracks (of whom I'm also an admirer) 'The Carney' and 'From Her To Eternity' are uncomfortably 'on the nose' in this context, despite Cave and his Bad Seeds looking uber cool during their performance.I admire his readiness in finally admitting it on the recent DVD release, but it doesn't surprise me at all that Wim Wenders considered ending his film with a slapstick pie fight (he actually shot that scene) between the two (now human) angel pals. In fairness to Wenders, he states himself that he made the film very quickly, occasionally stopping to ask himself what the hell he was doing, but to me, that shows. The whole film, though not failing to occasionally dazzle, to even stimulate existential thought, or to raise a smile or two, is ultimately pure artifice. It is unfocused, unbalanced and missing a sure hand. Emperor Wenders hid his painfully slight premise behind these pictures and poems and hoped no-one would notice that he isn't wearing any clothes. Trouble is, no-one did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>took Wenders in a new direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about angels in Berlin who can hear people's thoughts but are powerless to offer any advice, it addresses the solitary nature of humanity especially that of Berlin, with one scene where an angel sits helplessly as he listens to the last thoughts of a suicidal man just before he jumps to his death. The image of the two of them on the ledge is quite an idea. When one of the angels (Bruno Ganz) falls in love with a trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin), the situation seems to pick up some momentum, but the slow to non-existent pace, which can be referred to as absorbing or boring, depending on the viewer, enervates this possible angle. One positive attribute is the soundtrack. Hailed as Wender's masterpiece, this is the turning point for him from those great films he did prior.</fullReview>

Listening to random thoughts is somewhat interesting for a while but then comes the frightening realization that the whole film is just that...listening to the thoughts of one person after another after another...and no one thinks about anything even remotely amusing. Most of it is filmed in black and white, randomly becoming color now and then. This self-indulgent nonsense is unbelievably boring. And what is Columbo doing here?</fullReview>

He starts to fall for trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin) at a rundown circus. There is also the elderly Homer who recalls the Berlin of old. Another is Peter Falk who is shooting a film taking place in the Nazi past but he's also hiding a secret from his own past.The best way to describe this is a German meditation. It's digging into the Nazi past in an artistic way. I personally don't see anything compelling about that. It is so slow and Damiel is so passive. It infuriated me more than appealed to me.

		<shortDescription>Best Movie You'll Ever Read?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you know this film, I don't have to explain the title of this review. In case you don't, let's just say that in a lifetime that has encompassed its fair share of foreign films, I have never had to do so much reading to keep up with a film and redeem some kind of sense from it. (I might not lodge this complaint if I was absolutely sure my investment had been returned. --Not that I'll be checking that out with a second viewing...)Wings of Desire looks, feels and smells like Art. Not a bad thing. And because the photography and imagery are mostly in a sumptuous, duotone-rich B&amp;W and all the words are poetic and pretty, you can view Wings of Desire legitimately as a writer's film or a cinematographer's/photographer's film. (I wouldn't consider it an actor's film, for example.)The film "dialog" is mostly the interior monologues of ordinary people overheard by angels, on which we get to eavesdrop. It's pretty dignified, for that, and amazingly clean to boot. Most the films people are equally burned out and poetic in their musings. This is where you may run into trouble, beyond the mundane level of trying to keep up with subtitles. After awhile, you may start thinking something along the lines of "Hey, wait a minute: people don't talk to themselves this way, not unless they want to be novelists or scriptwriters or poets." Of course they don't. --Not that that's a ringing condemnation in and of itself. But if you wanted something that feels a little more everyday real than Brecht or Beckett-- or even Maxwell Anderson, for corn sake-- and a little less studied, this film may leave you flat. Wings of Desire seemed to me to invite the viewer to feel deeply, then to turn stingy, passive and ultimately opaque with its dramatics; its a dry, low-yield experience, emotionally.I'm sad to say I can't enthuse over this film as have most the people who feel moved to comment on it. I'd heard so many great things about it and waited years for a chance to see it. It gains a ten of ten for its superbly drawn look and feel, and for the acuity of observation of some of the words the characters think. But it rates about a six, very generously, for its emotional component. Maybe I am too long out of art school to be in the mood for this particular game. Heresy, perhaps, but there it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ponderous Angels in Berlin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wim Wenders Wings of Desire is a ponderous film about angels who observe the people of Berlin. Wenders use of black and white photography in this film shows that the angels world is constricted to black and white while those that they watch live in the world of color. The main angel in the film has grown weary of simply watching and wants to experience that which humans take for granted. Angels have no concept of taste or feel but they do have a concept of desire which the angel is experiencing. After nearly half the film has passed this angel finally becomes human, and the film makes a switch from black and white to color. As stated earlier this is one of the most ponderous films I have seen. The pace of this film is so deliberate that I do not think that it could possibly be made in the U.S. It was remade in the United States but the end product was so far removed from the original that it really shouldn't be considered a remake. Wenders staging of events, the camera movement and the actors performances all mirror each other in the deliberate time they all take to make their points. The main character mentions his desire to become human but the actual change comes at a glacial pace and the viewer has to take his word for it because the desire seems so internalized. Wenders sets everything up and lets the story unfold at a pace that many Americans would find too slow. The only criticism I have of this film is the intermittent use of color earlier in the film before it switches to color permanently. Wenders would have had a more dramatic impact is he had held off on using any color until the angel became human, much like the effect of watching The Wizard of Oz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I prefer City of Angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a word, comedy, drama's indispensable companion. I can see 'Wings' -- much shorter -- as a setting of Rilke's poetry of divine alienation, and a meditation -- for certain gloomy Germans -- of the post-war years, as nights_dream_paradox writes on the Message Board, but as an American I can only picture my younger self in a typical audience: frowning in intellectual ostentation in the Theatre 80 Saint Marks, trying to impress my date with my knowing appreciation of this dour brood-fest.(I'm guessing the poetic dialog is better in the original German; here the subtitles only mock the American lack of 'worldliness' -- I bet the original audience -- who remain mired in top-down old-world socialism -- didn't get any subtitles for the English and French spoken.)There is a blessed but brief leavening of levity (which doesn't go so far as to rise to comedy) 40 minutes in, with the entrance of -- a Hollywood actor! Peter Falk (here actor and character) is like a ray of sunshine for a few moments, even recalling 'Columbo,' before he resumes dark John Cassavetes mode: Himmel forbid he be remembered as an entertainer!Of suspense there is none: Marion's flicker of the wrist during a slow-motion trapeze procedure accompanied by a sharp intake of breath patched onto the soundtrack doesn't rise to the name.But with the American remake 'City of Angels' Hollywood bats it out of the park -- Nick Cage is perfect: outwardly dour but inwardly droll. Seth struggles mightily in deciding to 'fall' -- not so Damiel in 'Wings': he announces his intention to Cassiel during their shared pronouncements, his inner turmoil apparently later expressed by closing his eyes and tilting his head back and forth. (And please -- what's with the ponytails?)When Hollywood brings its A-game it can't be beat, with intelligence, comedy, suspense, finely honed drama, and a flair for doubling down on clichés, making them fresh again."Mortal Maggie: Why do you wear the same clothes all the time? Why won't you give me your phone number? Are you married? "Fallen Angel Seth: No. "Maggie: Are you homeless? "Seth: No. "Maggie: Are you a drummer?"Real life has intelligence (sometimes), comedy, drama, suspense -- and clichés. And Hollywood at times makes it pretty. Take the Hollywood convert Hitchcock, widely considered one of the greatest directors. His American movies are always stylized, at times into luxurious travelogues, but with compelling dramas at their centers. And entertaining. There's nothing wrong with entertainment; it is not mutually exclusive with profundity. There are few outside of self-conscious 'intellectuals' who have anything to say against Hitch -- and many of them are on his side. Woody Allen gets it.I tried hard with 'Wings,' but these thoughts kept distracting me. I need to go watch some Werner Herzog now.</fullReview>

I even took breaks, but fell asleep again and again. However, later in the movie when Peter Falk began talking to the angels even though he could not see them, I had no trouble staying awake because this was VERY baffling. Up until then, not one of the mortals (except for very young kids) could sense the angels BUT Peter Falk (as himself) could!

		<fullReview>Since when exactly does poetry make for existential realism ? I mean even the decadent greats (Rimbaud, Baudelaire), they weren't very close to real life were they ? It was more like middle-class artistic pretentiousness. Here, let's try:"It is you, it is you, poor better thoughts! The needful hope, shame for the ancient blots, Heart's gentleness with mind's severity, And vigilance, and calm, and constancy, And all!--But slow as yet, though well awake; Though sturdy, shy; scarce able yet to break The spell of stifling night and heavy dreams.." (Paul Verlaine, it is you)Not very good, is it ? Well imagine now 2 hours of people mumbling incoherent faux existential "poetic" thoughts. That's how Wings of Desire is, and it's just too pretentious, unrealistic and doesn't really say anything. It says that people feel a bit crap in the industrial age, and that love is nice. Big deal.It just doesn't cut it. Even Wenders' directorial style (so good in, say, "American Friend") is patchy here. It has this feel like he's showing off. It's austere and elegant the way a museum piece is austere and elegant. Boring. And what is this thing with the angels exactly ? Is there supposed to be some symbolism there ? It really is a nasty business when artists think so highly of themselves as to present a work hardly anyone byond the art-house elite understands.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, the love affair isn't as important in this film, and the characters aren't as likable IMO.My husband could only sit through half this movie before giving up.

Well, Wim Wenders probably spent too much time reading Thomas Mann or Sartre while taking in some Wagner because none of the philosophical meanderings makes much sense even to an elitist intellectual, but I digress.Bruno Ganz is a tall angel that wanders unseen amidst the citizens of Berlin. It's the eve of the Velvet Revolution. The wall is still there, almost in every scene with its Jasper Johns-like-graffiti. The citizens think aloud sad sophistry's on the disappointment that life presents. Not one says anything remotely Christian as though the main religion of Europe never existed; rather, Existentialism just seeps through their pores as they contemplate the destruction of Berlin during Allied bombing raids ? these shown in old newsreels.Then Peter Folk or Colombo (hard to say which) shows up to be in a concentration camp movie with Nazi uniforms and Jewish prisoners. The angel is a movie fan. Does Falk add to the film in any way? He is humorous, but he mumbles the same Existential pap as everyone else.This one is an art house film, beautifully shot without a standard plot. I'll give it that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that timewarps/bending exists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most boring film ever made. Dont let the cover of this film fool you, it might only say that the movie lasts 3-4 hours. This is not true, if you watch it the clock may say that only 3 hours passed between beginning and end but this movie has the property to bend time so it feels that it lasted an eternity.No one dies, no guns, no rockets, no "I always thought you were left handed" "headshot is the only true stopper".Really, unless you like incredibly boring art-movies with no dialogue or action, only weirdos having really quasi-intellectual monologues in b/w and with post war berlin as background then you will hate this movie. Only people with minority complex with a need to be different would like this movie since it allows them to say "well I watched all 10 hours of the movie, it reflects the blah blah blah"Short: the movie sucks more than you can imagine. Really. Order it as gifts to all your relatives immediately before the UN declares forcing people to watch it a crime against humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of Angels did it better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyway, I am incredibly ashamed to say, that at about one hour or so into the film, I...turned it off. I had a lot of stuff to do today, and there were a lot of factors that contributed to my turning it off, but mostly it was because the movie was completely uninteresting. I'm all for beautiful cinematography, and poetry, etc etc (for example, I recently enjoyed The New World, which was very similar in that it consisted mostly of beautiful scenery and poetic, inner thoughts), but it really wasn't working for me here. First off...why was every single person in Berlin so damn depressed? Honestly? ...and why would an angel have any desire to become human after listening to all those depressed (and ridiculously 'philosophic') inner-thoughts all day? It was turning out to be this quasi-intellectual, 'art' film that I've come to despise. I love art. Yeay art! ...but when it comes to film as art, the artistic vision needs to blend with something called...a story; and ideally, an interesting one...perhaps, with dialogue, or at least some rational, 'normal' people inner thoughts (the inner-thoughts of David Spritz in The Weather Man, for example). Grrr, I don't know...I'm angry by the fact that so many people find a movie like this good just because it is 'artsy'. Anybody can make a really pretty, 'intellectual' movie...just spend all your time framing nice shots, lighting the set just right, and adding giving your characters dialogue straight out of a philosophy book...nevermind the plot, or acting, or, dare I say it...entertainment value? WHAT?! A movie can be artistic AND entertaining at once? You don't say?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst movie ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen!!! Boring, way too long, and lacks any good plot line. I recently saw this in a cinema class and was bored out of my mind with it. Some of this movie, such as the angels listening to everyone's thought for 3/4 of the movie, could be cut out entirely. The movie doesn't really begin until it turns color! "City of Angels" was much much better. I'd recommend watching emergency broadcasting tests before "Wings of Desire". The character development was very poor and I could not attach myself to any character in the movie. What the heck was "Columbo" doing in this movie?? Peter Falk should be embarrassed he's name is associated with "Wings of Desire"...yes, it was that bad!</fullReview>
