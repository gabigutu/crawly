		<shortDescription>Very Romantic ... Very Good ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought City Of Angels was very good. I'm usually very critical towards movies, but City Of Angels got to me. Meg Ryan usually plays in Romantic Comedy's (Sleepless in seatle, You've got mail) but this time, City Of Angels, admittedly a Romantic film, but it isn't a comedy. Far from it, it's a drama in all of its aspects. And Meg Ryan converts to that change very well. She acts great in this movie. It wasn't an easy part for her, there is a lot of crying involved, and a lot of dramatic moments in her characters life.As goes for Nicolas Cage's character. Oh my god, he plays Seth with such excellence. Really, i don't think that anyone else could play the part as great as he did. The way he looks, the way he moves .. so cool.Ok the storyline is a little unbeleivable, but you musn't be held back by that fact. Just beleive the unbeleivable. Just go with the plot, and follow the movie closely.I'm not suggesting that City Of Angels is the best in it's sort. It won't win any oscars, but what i am saying, is that it's a nice movie, with great actors, great music and a good storyline which rolls towards very emotional ending.You won't be dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie again for about the 3rd time. People say the movie is depressing, unoriginal, and boring. I'll bend on the depressing part, but the other 2 are completely un-true. Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan give pretty good performances, nothing oscar-worthy, but it's not the acting that makes this movie great. It's beautiful. Pure heaven to the eyes and ears. While you see the wonderful scenes, and backgrounds, with wonderful color and beautiful art direction, and hear the perefectly performed and selected score in the background (with contributions from U2, Sarah McLachlan, and the surprise hit "Iris" from the Goo Goo Dolls) it doesn't really matter what kind of acting is happening. The screenplay is pretty good, but somewhat lacking, which is why I give it an 8.25 on a scale from 1-10. Its a love story, yes, and can get cheesy at points, but none the less, it's still worth seeing once or twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good heavens, this is by far the best lovestory I've ever seen. A perfectly carried out movie about this angel (Nicolas) that gives up eternity in Heaven to be with a woman (Meg) on Earth. This movie really touches your soul, so don't go destroy it by watching it with a bunch of friends. As a matter of fact, It made me cry like a baby... City of Angels actually makes you reflect about life/death and you'll know it touches your soul. I've never before been so affected (in a good way though =) by a lovestory, but this one; it's hard to describe you have to see it! // a gracefulness</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that touches the heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. I have seen it several times and it still never ceases to bring me to tears. Nicholas Cage does a wonderful job portraying Seth, an angel who falls in love with a workaholic doctor, convincingly portrayed by Meg Ryan (in a definite departure from her usual kooky, girl next door role). The movie is beautifully photographed, and the love story, although a little far fetched, (angel gives up being an angel to become human to be with the woman he loves) it is still incredibly moving. Without giving away all the best parts of the movie, you had better have plenty of Kleenex on hand...it's definitely a tearjerker. The ending of the movie is a testament to the power of love and life...powerful stuff. This is definitely a "chick flick", but is just wonderful on all levels. I have always believed in angels, but after seeing this film it gave me a different perspective of our guardian angels. A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is worth falling for.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is worth falling for ,when u really want to hold the hands of Magi,feel her,touch her and really leave the eternity to just be with her. The theme was so wonderful that u really want to live with the characters and just hope to be one of them, that proves why man is afraid to die ,because he know that he will lose all the sensations for what human being is really crafted by the god, to live in pain leaving the eternity,but to feel love.The characters are excellently played,even the scores following were just letting you feel the theme and live with the characters. I really can't understand the harsh notes of critics and there sharp views but I can feel that this movie is worth falling for, even if you have to loose your eternity.This is my first comment on this site but I feel may be I delayed it only to give my first one to this one only.(24-12-05)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet film, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected to love this film, since my favorite actor and actress are in it, and I was not disappointed. Meg Ryan is great as ever as the surgeon with serious issues, and Nic Cage plays an unusual part as the sensitive angel who falls in love with her. Since Nic is an angel and Meg a human, Nic has to become human so he can touch, smell and love her. The power of this film is the chemistry between Nic and Meg , and the atmosphere created by Brad Silberling. The romance is very sweet and believable, played into perfection by the leads, and the atmosphere of the 'city of angels' is captivating. The only thing else a film like this needs is a suitable ending, which simply wasn't there. The fist hour-and-a-half was mysteriously uplifting, and the ending was downright depressing. It didn't work for me. Still, it is much better and definitely much deeper than your usual romantic drama and it never fails to entertain. Let's hope the DVD has an alternative ending.

		<shortDescription>Artistic vision and commercial gloss that works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hesitant to see this movie for the longest time. Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan in a romantic drama would seem to spell a movie filled with forlorn looks and sweet nothings whispered to each other. Upon seeing it, this movie proved my suspicions true.However, I was astonished at how much more this film had. The sheer amount of interesting concepts, combined with the ability to look at humanity from some distance, made this movie well worth the watch. If this film succeeds, and I believe it does, it is precisely because of the mixture of Hollywood gloss and original Wenders magic. Something for everyone, if only you give it a little thought.Touching date movie, nice discussion piece, and filled with attractive people, City of Angels is wonderfully shallow and surprisingly deep at times, making it well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumbed-down, cheesed-up remake of a truly great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing in film upsets me more than a dumbed-down, cheesed-up remake of a truly great work of art.I cannot understand what would possess anyone to commit such an atrocity, and I cannot recommend that anyone waste their time on this piece of trash when they could instead be watching the original, "Wings of Desire" (1987), and its sequel. The remake may employ better-known actors, but it adds nothing of merit while stripping away most of the original's emotional depth. Had I not first seen the vastly superior original, I might have enjoyed this movie enough to sit through more than the first half and give it 4/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Romance Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, this is a nice love story that I enjoyed the first time I saw it but decreasingly so with future viewings. After three, it was enough, but that's two more than I usually watch of Meg Ryan films.Since it's Hollywood, you know there is going to be misguided theology, in this case the subject is angels and heaven. None of the "sermons" in here are Biblical, believe me. it's really more of a love story than anything else. Plus, it's an interesting story with good visuals.Nicholas Cage plays a likable guy. There are actually a few good messages about God and angels - mainly that they exist - and another good message being that all of us should appreciate more what we have here on earth, starting with our senses (smell, taste, touch, etc.) Anyway, if you like a good romance story, you should like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are You in Despair?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very different look at the world of angels and their interaction with human beings. If this were a story about the devil, IMDB would have plenty of comments so I am not surprised to read so many negative ones.I don't believe that angels wear black, but I do believe in the premise of this movie: "sometimes things are true whether you believe in them or not."Meg Ryan, a very unlikely choice, was thoroughly believable as an obsessive-compulsive doctor who never sleeps. When she loses a patient for the first time, she cries bitterly and cannot understand how it could have happened--all witnessed by Nicolas Cage as Seth, an angel who was sent to escort her patient to heaven. Cage allows himself to be seen by Ryan in a hospital corridor and sweetly asks, "Are you in despair?" This entire conversation sweeps the women in the audience into their evolving relationship. Yes, I guess this is definitely a woman's movie.Others in lesser roles were quite good. Dennis Franz nails the part of a former angel who has "fallen to earth." (I do not watch his television show so this was the first time I have seen him act--I was impressed.) Andre Braugher, formerly of Homicide (a show I did watch), was terrific as Seth's closest angel friend, although he had very few lines, as usual Braugher was effective. His smile at the end of the movie stays with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somebody Please Give Meg Ryan a Bicycle Helmet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of Angels (1998): Dir: Brad Silberling / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Meg Ryan, Dennis Franz, Colm Feore, Andre Braugher: This film raises many questions. Why is Meg Ryan able to see angels when she does? Why is he visible to only certain people? Why would an angel wish to become human? What does the title represent since Heaven is hardly considered? Why is the film so damn stupid? Meg Ryan plays a surgeon, depressed after losing a patient. Nicolas Cage plays an angel named Seth who falls in love with her. Dennis Franz plays a patient who can also see Seth and says that he was an angel but gave it up for earthly living. This idea appeals to Seth who sees it as a way to convey his love to Maggie. Lame plot that concludes with a complete moron riding a bike with their eyes closed and hitting a truck. That is about as swift as drunk driving. Directed by Brad Silberling with muddled spirituality. He previously made Casper and proves to know nothing about spirituality. Cage as Seth is a feather brain idiot if he prefers earthly life over Heaven, and Franz is obviously in the hospital for the same mental disorder. Ryan plays a hopeless idiot romantic who needs brain surgery and a driver's test. Colm Feore is underused and probably underpaid just for appearing. Andre Braugher plays another angel with nothing better to do. Story is a big traffic accident that doesn't fly. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-So</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm about the easiest person in the world from which to jerk a tear, and this movie left me completely dry-eyed. Yes, it was a very Hollywood story, complete with quick, convenient character transformations &amp; plot discoveries &amp; a very predictable plot-line, but a well-done Hollywood tale can often reduce me to big, blubbering sobs. I think the main problem with this movie was the total miscasting of Nicholas Cage - I agree completely with those who say that had they met him in the hospital corridor as Meg did they would have been terrified &amp; called hospital security!! There was no warmth or wisdom or charisma or anything in his portrayal - it was as though he was hiding everything that normally makes Nicholas Cage sexy &amp; compelling in a mis-guided effort to appear wise &amp; ethereal. Had an actor like John Travolta or Jeff Bridges or any number of independent film stalwarts been cast, some charm &amp; a sense of humor could have shown through, I could have understood why he compelled her, and perhaps the story would have moved me, in spite of the Hollywoodish-ness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you take the art from an artistic film with a weak plot you get...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... right, a weak film with a weak plot. I love "Der Himmel über Berlin" (Wings of Desire) but I always felt that the plot was very weak compared to the emotions and the art in the film. I thought, City of Angels might have improved on the plot aspect so I was intrigued to see what they came up with. Well, they did improve on the plot but in the mean time they managed to get rid of everything that touched me in "Wings".The nice little stories of the humans they are watching and also the dialogs between Cassiel and Seth were completely dumbed down. The former angel who tells Seth to become human is some kind of gluttonous hedonist and stuffs Ben&amp;Jerry's inside of him instead of enjoying a simple cup of coffee. And I almost burst out laughing when Seth said "red... COLOR" after he became human even though the whole film was shot in color and nothing hinted that he couldn't see colors.I'll stop lamenting now! Go, see the original and NOT for the plot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITY OF ANGELS (1998) is a soppy, sentimental, super, supernatural movie that I absolutely love. I think you can call it supernatural when you have a screenload of angels much of the time, all tall, slim, and wearing the same dark raincoats. I guess they don't have designer outlets or Kentucky Fried Chicken in Heaven.Dr Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) is a surgeon in a hospital and when she loses a patients, she is all cut up about it! She doesn't realise that the hospital is full of angels watching over patients, keeping a heavenly eye upon things and walking away with the bereaved once they have shed their earthly shells. Seth (Nicholas Cage) is one such angel and when he witnesses the grief that overcomes Maggie when her patient dies, he becomes drawn to her, falls in love with her, but the only way he can be with her is to give up his existence as an angel and become mortal. Determined to be with Maggie, he permits her to see him.It's all very mushy but easy on the brain and the eye and a refreshing change from action thrillers. I think that Ryan and Cage are well cast in this one. I guessed how it would all turn out. I hope you don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie lacked that UMPH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about an angel, Seth, who falls for a human doctor named Maggie. He can listen to her thoughts, but try as he might, he can't feel her.First of all, I didn't give this movie a low grade because of the way it ended. I am a fan of tragic endings. "Titanic", anyone? But this one was just too sappy. The plot was good, but a bit cliché and it seemed like the emotions Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan wanted to convey to the audience were a bit over the top. I also think it would have been better if Seth and Maggie's new relationship was more expounded on. It all just happened so quick. If you watched this in a movie theater and had to go to the restroom, you would have missed it.I've heard about this movie many times. One of my old favorite songs, "Iris" was associated with this movie, so I was naturally curious. This was many years ago, though. I only thought to watch it after seeing it being recommended by "You've Got Mail". I thought this would be a great movie. It started out interesting. But when Seth began falling for Maggie. That's when it got boring. Surprisingly though, I found this to be a fast film. I couldn't stop watching it, even if I found myself not really enjoying anything.I felt like Nicholas Cage's performance was very stiff and cardboard. He was always whispering and talking in a quiet voice. Maybe that's how the directors wanted to portray angels, so I don't really blame him. But hey, Cassiel (Andre Braugher) seemed pretty good to me.I liked the ideas that this movie gave off. Not the general idea that you should give everything up for the one you love, but the idea that there's something bigger than all of us out there. The idea that beings that aren't like ourselves, might exist. It all seems very interesting to me.I can see the appeal of this to some people. Unfortunately, it just wasn't IT for me.Viewed on: April 18, 2011</fullReview>

And this movie should work far better in the cinema than on the small TV format at home.As for the story, it concentrates on one small aspect of the original - and, according to about half the viewers, pulls a "dirty trick" on them, altogether unfair.I left the movie house cursing the director and promising to punch his teeth in if I saw him.

		<fullReview>Angels are everywhere, on highway signs, building tops, and in libraries. Dressed in black trench coats they hang out, unseen, eavesdropping while waiting for people to croak so they can escort them to the hereafter. No wonder angel Seth (Cage) gets the hots for a perky surgeon (Ryan). He meets her in her operating room, which apparently is a good place for picking up angel-business, i.e., the newly deceased. This also explains why angels like to hang out on interstate highway signs...but libraries? Anyway it turns out that angels can "go human" if they wish. Now this is not at all as good a deal as skipping college and going straight to the pros for the big payday. No, this is irreversible and earns the changeling angel such human features as hunger, aging, pain, and death. Why would an angel do it? For Meg Ryan? For the munchies? If you like this kind of stuff (and I generally don't) instead rent Wim Wender's original movie, Wings of Desire, of which City of Angels is a remake.</fullReview>

I noticed one person posted a comment about it being a good original movie, but it is a remake of the German film "Der Himmel über Berlin," or more often referred to as "On the Wings of Desire." City of Angels took an incredible movie and turned it into a typical entertainment/romance film. Meg Ryan did an incredible job, and I'm still a little shocked at how well Cage portrayed the angel. This is a film I can stand to watch; however, I do not enjoy it as much and beg you to at least give "On the Wings of Desire" too.Best wishes in finding which movie you enjoy more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what an amazing piece of yuck. here is a textbook example of how to take a project that has everything going for it and somehow still produce a movie that made me mourn the time i'd lost watching it. it's an interesting idea (based on Wings of Desire by Wim Wenders, a movie i haven't yet seen), with respected actors and great cinematography. and yet this movie is truly terrible. it should have made me think about the nature of life and death and love, but all that really happens is that nick cage talks for hours about how he'd really like to know what it's like to touch an apple. whoop-de-doo. if i'd felt that the central romance had any validity or passion, or that the movie was interested in any question more interesting than how to style meg ryan's hair for maximum effect, i would have given it points for trying, despite the terrible script, complete lack of continuous tone, and wooden performances. unfortunately, i can only say that i was truly disgusted with myself for having sat through the whole thing. here's a hint to help you decide whether or not to rent this one. look through the comments on this page, and count the cliches. if you're really looking for a movie that can only be describe by its fans as "hearwarming" or a "tearjerker" than go right ahead and shell out the 4 bucks. if you'd prefer a movie that has any spark of vision at all, skip it and rent, well, basically anything else at blockbuster. anything. rent bachelor party, for godsakes. at least that has a donkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Pop Translation of Wenders' Classic Turns Lush Film into Romantic Whimsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1998 romantic drama is as fanciful as fantasy movies come, and John Seale's beautiful cinematography goes a long way toward creating the dream-like quality essential to pull this type of movie off. Director Brad Silberling and screenwriter Dana Stevens have decided to amplify the romantic elements of Win Wenders' wondrous 1987 classic, "Wings of Desire", but stick to the basic plot elements. The transatlantic adaptation is not altogether successful because the greater themes of immortality and human fallibility in the original film have been submerged in favor of more individualized needs like sensuality and love. The thematic change trivializes the film into little more than a piece of romantic whimsy.Now set in Los Angeles, the plot focuses on an angel named Seth who walks freely among the living and remains unseen unless he so desires. He gets drawn to Maggie Rice, an exacting surgeon who loses her first patient on the operating table. In the middle of her personal crisis, Seth comes into her life filling an emotional void, setting the stage for the pivotal decision he needs to make - remaining immortal as an angel or becoming human to experience the passion he feels for Maggie. Luckily, in probably her best dramatic performance, Meg Ryan is especially resonant as Maggie as she mutes her natural sprite-like manner into a palpable sadness that fits the character.With a part that risks skirting parody during the first half, a steadily unblinking Nicolas Cage plays Seth in a plaintive, child-like manner until the story moves toward its inevitable climax. I still find it difficult to believe that Seth's discomforting, Norman Bates-like manner would provide such a powerful attraction to Maggie at the outset. I also think the ending plot manipulations are a botch, a contemptible attempt to twist the viewer into thinking a greater point has been made when in fact, the viewer has been sucker-punched. Andre Braugher's becalming manner is used to good effect as fellow angel Cassiel, and Dennis Franz is appropriately ostentatious as a junk-food-addicted hospital patient who is not what he appears to be. By the way, the interiors of the San Francisco Main Library (opened two years before) never looked better than under the guise of LA's in this movie.There are a surprising number of extras for such an early release DVD (1998) with three separate commentary tracks, the first by Silberling, the second by Stevens and co-producer Charles Roven, and the third by composer Gabriel Yared. Seale and production designer Lilly Kilvert contribute select-scene commentaries on the other side of the disc. There are two featurettes - a half-hour making-of documentary called "Making Angels" and a ten-minute short focused strictly on the visual effects. Seven deleted scenes, two music videos (including the Goo Goo Dolls' then-omnipresent MTV hit, "Iris"), and the theatrical trailer round out the major DVD extras.</fullReview>

Then I saw the original from Wim Wenders and every thing became clear. It is strictly necessary destroy a wonderful movie, in order to make it "acceptable" for the american public? Anyway, there are some nice things like the photography, and some production issues (clearly plagiarized from the Wim Wenders filmography) which make the movie acceptable for the people who had not seen the original or any of the Wim Wenders' angels series.A last comment: Why on earth American movies need to explain everything in the ending?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"how to spoil a classic": a handbook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched "Wings of Desire" and "Faraway, so close" two or three times -yes, I LOVE those movies. In my opinion, "City of Angels" is a bad copy of "Wings...", a bad copy between the obvious and the disrespectful.First, the acting -all you have to do to be an angel is lift your eyebrows (as Nick Cage enjoys doing the whole movie). He wanders through the film looking as if he's about to cry; he's no angel, just a good-looking guy trying to play the innocent-and-loving character. Meg Ryan -well, why bother? She's the standard actress for this kind of romantic journeys -maybe because she always performs the same way.Then, the photography. No spoiler here: remember when Cage and his angelical companion Cassiel, standing on a skyscraper, mention the beauty of the view -which we are carried to see; and there, all over the screen, stands this awfully big Marlboro ad. Oh, how lovely! Also, those unavoidable pieces of every simplistic romance movie: the "character ponders it over" with its score of incidental music, and the "great slow-mo" moment of ecstasy.And last, the plot. Plenty of cliches ("love conquers all", "the wages of sin is death", "the materialistic who starts to believe again"...), absolutely predictable, flat characters, clumsy lines. Love is far more complex than this -and so is death.Looking at this picture I ask: why is it that nobody thinks of re-writing "Romeo and Juliet" or repainting Van Gogh's "The sunflowers", but everybody thinks it right to remake "Psycho" or "Wings of Desire"?Look for the best-seller: "How to spoil a classic: The Movie!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie overall. I'm not a film critique, hence my layperson rating is perhaps not so valuable. But I enjoyed it a lot. I love Meg Ryan in other movies ("You've got mail", "Sleepless in Seattle", "Kate and Leopold"). Now that this latter movie has been released, I see that there's a lot of similarity between it, and City of Angels, in plot and characters. Anyway, I was amazed at how the filmmakers conveyed the idea of being unable to touch, smell, and taste, and feel the pleasures (and pains!) of life. And the transition to being a living man, who can feel fatigue, pain, and physical desire in Seth is pictured really powerfully. A straight 10 out of 10 for that! I also liked the moment when he is taking a shower in her cabin, and she is pedalling the bike and waving her arms like if she were an angel herself, or a bird. It's kind of surreal, you don't really know until her crash if that's actually happening, or it's just a metaphor. Moments such as this one make this movie really subtle. I like that. I also like the answer that another angel gives Seth when he asks: "Why did it happen? Am I being punished?" - "You know better than that. It's because you are living now." Fragile and unpredictable as human life is, the film has depicted it masterfully. Since then Russian filmmakers have tried to create a remake of this film, but it's not really as good. Anyway, I think this movie is one of the best films on this theme ever made, but as the viewer I feel a little dissatisfied with the abrupt ending after the angel's fall. I realize this is part of the overall plot, and otherwise we couldn't feel how swiftly their happiness had to end, but I felt that my hopes were betrayed. I wish I could see Maggie become an angel too after her death (I realize that a living woman, or man, cannot become an angel, that angels have never been human as stated in the movie, but still), or his dying and meeting her in heaven. But that's just me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a priceless work of art: the script, cast, soundtrack, cinematography.. everything! It is also likened to an Aesop's Fable; there is a definite moral/lesson to be learned! "City of Angels" opens up the doors of possibility while reflecting upon the realities of life. Every day we walk upon the earth, and most of us move about oblivious to the higher powers that guide us. In the movie, angels are everywhere, mostly unseen. One of the most profound aspects of this film is the portrayal of every range of human emotion, from laughter to grief, love to desperation.I love the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage in here. She plays a Dr and he's an Angel who sees her in the hospital where she works. She can see him but he doesn't let her know his secret. The only way their relationship can grow is if he leaves his 'life' as an angel. He can leave the life of no death, pain and sadness, and trade it for a normal life that humans experience. They both act really well in this and it was good to see Meg in a more serious role. I cannot go into more depth without giving you the ending, but I have to stress that this is such a beautiful movie (ok a little depressing in parts) but overall so good. You will most probably need tissues; it never fails to make me cry. It's such a beautiful romantic story and an under-rated movie for sure.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another OK film. The concept is interesting. The shots of the black clothed angels all over the City Of Angels are cinematically impressive.I used to actually get the quinzies just watching Nicholas Cage but, I have learned to at least not hate him. It was difficult tho' because of all those extreme closeups of his carefully non-blinking eyes and non-smiling mouth. Romantic leading man ? Not quite ! Meg Ryan is her usual cute as a button self with a pretty nice curly haircut. It's a bit of a stretch to see her as a driven heart surgeon with personal issues.Best of the bunch character wise were Dennis Franz (he was the most believable and appealing character in the whole film) and Andre Braugher as another angel, friend and confidant of Cage.If you have not seen this one and have a spare couple of hours, it's worth a one time watch, imo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucked ass because there was no fun. It also had bad acting. I hated the settings and the character plot. And I thought it was stupid to have angels come to life. It needs more bang to it. There was no fireworks. And I hated the bad storyline. The director needs to do better. I give it a 1 star. Not bad. But needs work. I think it needs Seth is an angel who accompanies the spirits of the recently dead to the ever after. Seth has never been human and so has has never experienced touch or taste. When in the hospital however he comes across Dr. Maggie Rice, a brilliant young heart surgeon who is devoted to her profession and her patients. Seth has the power to let himself be seen but Maggie finds him far too mysterious. Seth also meets a patient, Nathaniel Messinger, who has news for him - he too was once an angel like Seth but chose to fall to Earth and become human. Seth makes a decision on his future, which does not turn out as he had expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review for City Of Angels(spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 90s everything was about angels. We had Angel the spin off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer,Touched By An Angel,songs about Angels and of course this 1998 underrated flick City Of Angels. Nicholas Cage(Ghost Rider)plays Seth,an angel who is sent to earth to help those who are dying move on. But of course problems arise when Seth falls for a heart surgeon named Maggie Grace(Kate &amp; Leopold's Meg Ryan who was our all time American Sweetheart back in the 90s before she gave up acting).So we as the audience have to wonder whether or not these two are gonna end up together. Of course Seth does turn mortal later on by jumping off a building and he falls and produces lots of blood and of course he gets to be near Maggie(even though she can sorta see him before he turned mortal. But there is a risk factor of course since Seth became human as for those who has seen the film Maggie dies in an accident while cycling in her bike and a lorry crashed into her causing her to die while Seth came on her(yeah Meg Ryan's first flick where she literally dies in).I haven't seen this film in a long time but from what I can remember from it I thought it was an OK film. Pretty much like The Lake House and Just Like Heaven if you love those two movies then you will definitely be liking this film. Cage and Ryan had great chemistry although I do prefer her chemistry with Tom Hanks though more and I suppose her co star in Kate &amp; Leopold Hugh Jackman. But still if you are like me a fan of Meg Ryan then check it out. I might see it again in the future who knows. And the song Iris by Goo Goo Dolls is the main theme song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gentle supernatural romance with sad end. In a few words, I would describe this movie as "human world vs angels city." An excellent implementation of the story, with intangible matters and thin entities in the movie. Great play of the main actors - Nicolas Cage, Meg Ryan.The plot is based on the concept of Free Will, which allows any spiritual entity to make its own choice. Such a choice is done by Seth. Originally angel he started to desire to become a human due to his love for a woman. Seth got what he wanted, but his happiness wasn't long lasting. The love story ends tragically, revealing the non- perfect humans world for what it is and pointing out the big risks of having a human' existence.PS My dying husband was staring at something behind my left shoulder in the same manner as dying Meggie was watching behind Seth's shoulder. I was talking to him and he always looked at my face, but not that day. It was several hours before he was gone. I was curious what the entity was looking like, but I didn't ask. My intention was to encourage him for the transition to another world, but I was afraid that the entity had an awful appearance and I would spoil the last moments of his life by emphasizing on the matter. However, if "it" was looking like Seth- its not terrible at all and this gives me a release :).Thank you for the wonderful movie helping us to clarify a reality beyond the border!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an... interesting little film, and certainly a curious one. While many consider it to be a dumbing down of the movie it was based on, the 1987 art-house film called 'Wings of Desire', there still are a few touching elements to this film that keep it afloat. But at the same time there are a lot of things that really don't do it any justice.So what's the sketch? Nicolas Cage plays an Angel named Seth, who, like the other Angels, watch over humanity and act in many different ways to protect them. In one of their many roles, Seth plays the Angel of Death, taking the spirits of those who have passed and guiding them to everlasting paradise. Whilst overlooking the desperate attempts of a surgeon named Maggie (played by Meg Ryan) to give a man life-threatening surgery, he is amazed by her determination to keep the man alive, even though her efforts are ultimately in vain. Seth soon forms an attachment to her, and makes himself known, soon desiring to give up his Angelic stature to become human so he can live his life with his new found love.First, let's talk about the bad stuff. Nicolas Cage, although a very good actor, wouldn't have been my first choice. He doesn't really look or sound the part, my preference being to him in action movies such as the Rock and Con-Air. His scenes come off less romantic and more, well, creepy. Meg Ryan plays her part well though as the determined surgeon, pulling off her lines and role in a way you can find believable.The next big problem is the story, which is quite literal and not particularly subtle. Although there are quiet moments and subtle scenes in it, these are offset by Seth taking a literal fall from a tall building to denote his Fallen Angel status, truncated moments later by a brutal mugging. The ultimate goal of Seth is also a bit more 'shallow' to my mind, with his motivation to be with Maggie not being based on a long lasting and loving relationship, but immediately with them losing their clothes and making friendly under the covers. Indeed sex is one of the most serious commitments to any relationship short of marriage, it does seem like a bit of a rush to that particular finishing line, which I found rather jarring.But what about good stuff, of which there is quite a bit. The emotional scenes are played really quite well, especially the death of a young girl at the beginning and her guidance to Heaven by Seth, as well as a tragic but somewhat predictable passing later in the movie.But for me the best part of this entire movie is the soundtrack, with the absolute gem that is Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls being well worth the price of admission!So, to summarise, this movie is really a movie with its heart in the right place, but some of the routes taken to that particular heart being a little, well, risky. Whilst Nicolas Cage, the unsubtle nature of the story and some of the predictability can take you out of it, the emotional scenes, human interaction and that fantastic soundtrack was enough to see me through this film!Definitely a brain-disengaged movie, but a good film for a rainy Saturday afternoon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so this is a movie made on the backdrop of our guardian angels and yes I believe in them. Nicholas Cage plays Seth who falls for Maggie played by Meg Ryan, yes the astonishingly cute Meg Ryan. For all I could remember, Nicholas Cage is all about action roles but this shade is a must watch too. A fantasy story, an angel falling for a beautiful soul on earth and it ends with the most unexpected of endings, the lady dies in her angel's arms.. As sad and teary that sounds, I kinda have my peace with it. For true love is not always about the years together but sometimes that one tiny out-of-the-world true moment is all that is enough to cherish an entire life with someone's thoughts. That was the learning and it was delivered to perfection!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a teenager, I loved this movie. I thought it was romantic in a tragic way, the way that only true love can be real love. As an adult I see this movie differently. Meg Ryan is flat and shows that she doesn't have a wide acting range. Cage and Ryan have no chemistry together, there was no real depth or emotion from either of them. I was they had cast Braugher as Seth (he was the only character I wanted to see more of, that smile!) and someone else as Maggie, left out the artsy flyovers and angels hanging out on road signs, then it might have been a decent movie. Dennis Franz was another character that brought the movie up a notch, the rest phoned it in.Something else that bothered me, some of the music must have come from "Elevator Music: Greatest Hits", it didn't fit at all. The soft piano melody was sad, but the rest awful.Good idea (I realize it was based on the German movie), poorly executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of Angels is a classic love song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of Angels is that rare movie that taps into the same emotions as the best pop songs. It's not a deep movie. It's sentimental and it hits all the right emotional buttons.Like many great pop songs it celebrates the power of romantic love. In this instance, it celebrates the fantasy of the perfect love and lover as an angel. Because angels are divine and don't tell lies and make promises they don't intend to keep.Both men and women find this movie romantic, and that's unusual.Now, this movie is nothing to do with 'Wings of Desire', the film by the German auteur Wim Wenders - except for the original concept. It's definitely not a remake and implying it is sells both films short. They could not be more different: one is Coke and the other is Champagne.A lot of people were disappointed by this movie because they expected to see an adaptation of a European Art film without subtitles. Lovers of art films need to learn to read subtitles.For me, City of Angels is simply that one unforgettable summer. It's a glorious night of slow dances under a night sky full of stars. An ode to that one incredible impossible love and how close a dream came to being real.</fullReview>

But Franz carries the movie and brings much needed warmth and love to the whole film, because if he wasn't included, the film would feel very sterilised and machine like.Seeing the film years later though did get me asking questions I wouldn't normally such as, what will happen to Seth? The guy has no financial stability, qualifications, or skills. I know its petty, but see the film with this in mind.The other thing is that Seth can be a little creepy at times, literally getting in Ryan's face and just following her about, the stalker angel if you would.But all in all, its a love story given the Hollywood spin, Wings Of Desire is a much better film, but this is still good stuff, even if its by the numbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched a lot of movies in my life and seen some good ones and bad ones. Actually, I know every year what picture is going to win the Oscar for best picture. Well, I read the reviews along time ago about City Of Angels and decided not to watch it. However, nothing was on TV the other night that interested me, and City Of Angels was on Starzs, so I decided to watch a little. I ended up watching the whole Movie. Then watched it again when it came back on. This picture was way under rated. Meg Ryan was brilliant. Nicolas Cage was the perfect person to play Seth. I don't think it was Nicolas''s best picture, but he was cool. I think they could have did the story line a little better, but the music made this movie even better. A class singers! It is a tear jerker, chick flick, but well worth for any guy to watch. The part that really summed up this whole movie was when Nicolas Cage was asked by his counter part Angel "If you knew this would happened, would you have done it. Nicolas quoted, "I give up eternity just to have touched her, held her, for just one day." Meg Ryan's acting made that very believe able. This could have won an Oscar if they changed the story line a little in the middle of the movie; However, kept the beginning and the end. Beautiful Movie, Excellent love story, Great cast, Wonderful music. I recommend watching it. It hits your heart and reminds me why I married my wife, she is an Angel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the German film "Wings of Desire" (1987), Seth (Nicolas Cage) is an angel. They can't feel, taste, be touched, or seen. Their job is to bring the dead to the afterlife. Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) is a sharp young heart surgeon who feels there's something more going on after the death of her last patient. One day, Maggie sees Seth. At first she thinks he's simply a patient at the hospital. But soon she realizes that he is much more mysterious than that, and she quickly falls for him. Nathaniel Messinger (Dennis Franz) is Maggie's patient, and surprisingly a former angel. He tells Seth his choice to fall to Earth.This is a very slow movie. Nicolas Cage is doing his empty look, and his tired speaking voice. Meg Ryan does her best to inject chemistry into this film. It's a very slow romance and it works on that level. When he finally falls to Earth, he does a complete 180. Subtlety has never been Cage's strong point. It's too jarring, and too late.The problem is the lack of humor. I think a few well placed jokes early can enliven the whole film. For a movie about life and death, they need more life in it.</fullReview>

It's very simple, predictable, even vacuous, if you're a bit skeptical.The brilliant female surgeon, who spots an angel, was made to renounce all her scientific beliefs, even training. She was reduced to asking what her roles or actions meant if people died on God's schedule.The answer may have been glossed over a little, but the movie did not offer any alternative. The answer was most emphatically not much.That's the kind of attitude that you need to enjoy this movie. Otherwise, stop after the first half an hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loose remake of Wings of Desire that goes less for the artsy approach and more for the romantic drama. Nic Cage plays an angel who falls in love with pretty surgeon Meg Ryan. Cage, as always, is an acquired taste. His usual half-ham approach to acting is on display here. If you are familiar with him and don't like his style, then you will hate this so don't bother. Ryan is adorable and pretty and can cry on cue. So she's perfect for this kind of schmaltz. Dennis Franz appears in a reworking of Peter Falk's wonderful role in the original film. Falk was the best part of Wings of Desire for me. Franz is OK here but not particularly memorable.Despite its flaws, I was actually enjoying it for the most part. Not loving it, but enjoying it. It was pleasant enough. But the downbeat ending killed the whole thing for me. Look, you don't want to make a pretentious art film like Wings of Desire -- OK, cool, I'm with you there. But if you're going to make a mainstream love story, then stick with that and don't give me some depressing ending. It made me feel like I wasted my time with the whole thing. It had nothing profound to say and certainly didn't have the nice visuals of Wings of Desire, so it really needed to make the love story work. Instead it makes an attempt at the last minute to become something more than it is and it fails. Nice soundtrack though.</fullReview>

First of all why all the angels are a bunch of 40 years old man dressed in black? Seems so wrong. The general idea about angels: androgynous looking characters and young. I understand that they wanted a new idea from the general notion of angels but still...Cage with a huge amount of chest hair is not a credible angel. Sorry. Also I don' t want to see some funny looking people like Ryan and Cage making love on screen. Too gross! The angels were supposed to be much more specialized on different areas. What kind of angel was he, the guardian angel, the angel that helped people who just died? Why all the angels were loitering in the library, what logic is in that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to make it clear that I'm not against representing the concept of angels in movies... It's just laughable the way it's done in this instance - Cage walking around, perma-brooding, dressed all in black, acting stoned to convey his 'otherworldliness' and constantly speaking in hushed tones... and then, to contrast, you cast Dennis Franz as the 'happy' angel who's crossed over into human existence (See? He must be happy because of his ruddy complexion and physique... so we'll make sure that he's eating when the viewer sees him, just so we can hammer home the point... )The crisis that provokes the climax of the movie is utterly ridiculous, in the way that it's shown. I mean, what do you expect when you're riding the bike with your eyes closed, and a "Look ma, no hands!" expression?! ... and why would you do this? Joy is not an excuse for stupidity.When you've seen movies such as "The Seventh Seal", which contemplates the realities of human existence, then movies like "City of Angels" just seem manipulative, you know? I have yet to see it, but I have no doubt that "Wings of Desire" (of which this is apparently a pandering remake) will bear this out, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, look! It's one of those typical Hollywood remakes that no one actually cares about! Who would've thought? To sum it up: your time will be better spent doing something else. This movie reeks of tear-jerking, prototypical love scenes and particularly cheesy effects. Even when Nicholas (that stupid angel) takes off his shoes at the beach you can tell something's not right. You really have to wonder if anyone's supposed to take this seriously with all the flaws that it has. Also, if you're not in on the whole "angel" thing this movie won't do for you. There's really nothing else to say here. It's the epitome of blandness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small comment from an unconditional fan of meg Ryan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is not the best however through my subjective eyes, I got to say that meg Ryan is wonderful as always... :-) However, the movie miss a bit of dynamism and the discover of feelings and of the new world for cage should have been a bit more complex as I guess it would be really complex to got all of that after years without feeling anything! The storyline is not really interesting and should have been more deep, dealing with more the concept of death and life. But it is still a love story fresh and simple.To summarize I love meg Ryan. but beside the whole love story I rather see a deeper perspective on life and death and I think that we can still find this kind of thought even though it is a love story.</fullReview>

I like both Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage but not in this movie.It was supposed to be a love story b/w a human and a Angle but I must say, it had a poor story and a lot of flaws.I didn't like it.The only good thing in it was Meg and Nicolas Cage.4.5/10.

		<fullReview>The lack of quality in this film is unbelievable. People rarely expect anything from huge Hollywood blockbusters, but in general, the amount of money invested makes for a picture that is acceptable if you can get past the clichés that have to be thrown in there to please everybody. But this one IS a huge cliché from start to finish. As far as Hollywood dramas are concerned, this is the worst film I've ever seen.I did have a bad feeling from the start. Films with "interesting idea" for a plot are usually extremely poor in everything besides this "idea", which in this case is the whole angel bit thing. Ooh there are angels all around dressed in black jackets. He falls in love with a girl and now wants to be human. But if you're smart enough, you know that this is just a very shallow way of making a film. Anyway, even with the lack of expectations after this, I was amazed at how extremely boring and predictable it was. No humor whatsoever and even the acting sucks, but I guess there wasn't much to work on with a script like this.Whoever made this should be ashamed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The singular achievement of this film is inspiring the forth great comment I have ever read. That comment is: "It's as if Ed Wood were given a $50 million budget." That comment was left by the trenchant fubared1. This complements the three previous great comments I have read on IMDb. The first and perhaps greatest is: "This is what happens when your mother owns a production company" left regarding the horrid Dungeons and Dragons. The second great comment was about the second sequel, The Bourne Ultimatum. A woman rightly noted, "Get a tripod and some lights." The third great comment was "We get it!" observed about the heavy-handed treatment in Snow Falling on Cedars.After reading the Ed Wood comment about this film, I promptly downloaded the Johnny Depp flik, "Ed Wood". With that as background I watched Plan 9 from Outer Space and then the much more lyrical and subtext-laden Glen or Glenda. I had to disagree with the comment. I think Ed Wood could have made a much better movie than this with 50,000 dollars. I noted that the sound and music in both Ed Wood films was far superior to this film. No, lets not insult Ed Wood by comparing this film to his milieu.I expect Hollywood movies to be scientifically implausible, heck this one is about imaginary beings called angels. But this movie is also technically implausible, socially implausible, and dramatically implausible. It just reeks badness from every pore. I did like that Sarah McLachlan song, Angel. Indeed, after hearing it on that PBS commercial for the ASPCA, I found her, then the whole song on YouTube, and then finally was led to this movie. I should have stopped while I was ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Meg Ryan will flock to see the Queen of Romance in yet another role where she wins not only your heart, but the heart of the world and a fan favourite Nicolas Cage.While the story in City Of Angels is romantic and completely pulls you in with interest, leaves you with inspiration and tears in your eyes, the film will ultimately be a let-down for most people.City Of Angels takes you on a warm fairy-tale like story to meet an angel named, Seth (Cage) fall so in love with a doctor named Maggie (Ryan) that he will give up being an angel to become a human and be with her.It follows the cliché Hollywood movie guideline where the audience is tricked (doesn't work anymore does it?) into thinking Seth and Maggie won't be together. However, just when you think this movie will end with a Hollywood, happily ever after ending, you're shocked to your very core when they rip it all away.Not trying to knock this masterpiece of a story, but the movie ended on the wrong path. It's realistic, but it makes you feel like asking "what was the point of investing the last ninety minutes into this?" Don't second guess yourself, movies are built around story and characters and when it doesn't end with either of them continuing, it's just down right an error in film making. Maggie's sudden death would make you- if you were Seth -regret deciding to become human.On the other hand, Seth had to feel how humans feel when we lose someone who means the world to us. In that aspect, the movie is still a masterpiece and still good enough to be a seven out of ten.Seth and the other angels constantly asked humans (once they died) what their favourite part of life was. With Maggie not being around for the last fifty-sixty years of Seth's life, what would be his favourite part of life?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage plays an angel in Los Angeles where the world is constantly visited by angels that mortals can't see. One day in the operating room a surgeon, played by Meg Ryan, sees Cage while one of her patients is dying. Cage falls in love with her and after some inner struggle encounters her again. Cage eventually decides that he wants to be human in order to have a real relationship with her.This movie is OK but not great. I saw it in the theater with a date so maybe that is it's value. It seems too cliché with the notion of angels wanting to be real. Nicholas Cage is always worth checking out, though. Meg Ryan is as corny as ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic fantasy inept of charm or energy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`City of Angels' is a supernatural love story, which works on a rather unusual principle. But when you take away all of these layers of corny dialogue, you're left with your average cliché drenched `boy meets girl' fable. And `City of Angels' doesn't go far beyond that to make it anything spectacular. Either way, the film isn't much to recommend. While there are a few neat touches, there's also an unsettling sadistic edge to the movie. It seems more determined to go for heavy tragedy instead of pure entertainment.Perhaps it would have been better had it taken itself less seriously. The plot isn't something that you could easily believe, and maybe some light-heartiness or genuine wit would have livened things up a bit. On its own level of indecisive drama it is so-so at best. The constant reliance on a soundtrack of songs for emotional power is a turn-off. There's also plenty of plot holes that it doesn't even attempt to avoid. For example, if angels can't be seen, how come Seth (the angel) is noticed by almost every character he comes in contact with.As film couples go, Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan have that rare `easy on the eye' quality that make them a believable pair. Cage is quite good as the sympathetic angel, but doesn't have good dialogue to work with. On the other hand, Meg Ryan's performance is flawed. A performance of this calibre requires more oomph to persuade us that this is a character worth sympathising for. She looks the part but works better with lighter material. We don't get much of a chance to care for the characters though, as the plot's self-destructive motion takes over (big mistake).While it ends on a (kind of) happy note, what went before was not worth the two-hour wait. With A grade Hollywood Stars in the leading roles, the finished product should have been much better than this drivel. `City of Angels' is for fans only. My IMDb rating: 4.5/10.</fullReview>

But Meg did her patented cute Meg Ryan part and Nick did his usual psychopathic part even if he is supposed to be an angel. This made me question Meg's character's taste and sanity.I could also live without Dennis Franz's naked backside as the Colombo substitute of the original film, here named Nathan Messenger. (Both the word "angel" and the Hebrew word "malach" mean "messenger".) and also the contrived downbeat ending which I don't recall from the original.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

Cage is absolutely unbelievable as Seth, an angel who falls for a surgeon named Maggie (Meg Ryan). Seth is faced with the decision of whether or not he wants to give up his immortality as an angel in order to be with her. One of the stupidest romantic stories in ages.

		<fullReview>I borrowed this VHS movie from our District Library and was appalled at the oddity of its pairing. The dramatic "lead" really falters and the casting of Dennis Franz as the "fallen" one who has neglected to tell his family of his former angelic nature is unappealing to say the least. I also kept expecting the balcony-peeking angels to be less visible and not just seeming so voyeuristic. My advice is for videophiles looking around for this kind of "It's a Wonderful Life" meets "Ghost" to rent from the foreign language section the much more intriguing "W I N G S O F D E S I R E". You'll be much happier with the sense of strangeness than this star-crossed lover tearjerker can ever deliver you in the realm of the "senses." My Rating is 7 *'s out of 10. The casting of beautiful Meg Ryan is its primary redemptive value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big problem called Meg Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an imaginative fairy-tale about how angels live, and as such I must say it takes itself a little too seriously. But there are many lovely ideas and the system that exists in the movie is almost probable. Also there is a simple and beautiful message: life as a human being is something special and we should enjoy it more consciously. Why not? And a bit of pathos doesn't hurt, as long as it is expressed by pictures so impressive.The big problem this movie has is called Meg Ryan. She is absolutely not the right cast for the role of Maggie because by her reputation but also by her never-changing way of acting she stresses the romantic factor of the movie, which is the least interesting and least convincing of all. She seems completely displaced. A mistake. Nicolas Cage surprised me a little because I found that his motionless face and his sad eyes suit his character perfectly and make audiences understand his dilemma as an `angel in love'. On the other hand, I don't believe Miss Ryan that she is a surgeon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Meg Ryan doing in such a film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I watched this film because Meg Ryan was in it, but was extremely disappointed. Did she not read the script before agreeing to act in it?First of all, Nicolas Cage made me cringe every time he appeared. His acting was absolutely appalling. I don't think I'd ever seen him in a film before, and if his acting's always the same, I'm not sure I ever want to see him in a film again. That may sound a bit harsh, but watch this film (if you can bear it) and see for yourselves.Throughout the film I wasn't quite sure whether it was intended to make you laugh, or empathize with the characters. I certainly laughed.The idea of the existence of angels could be good if they weren't made to hang round in libraries and just watch humans all day long. Seth (Nicolas Cage) was not a loveable character at all, but a creepy stalker who just 'happens' to be behind the fridge door when Maggie closes it.The film seemed to drag on and on, and we could have done without the ending, which was placed there, in my opinion, to turn the film into a 'tragedy'.I'll give this film a generous 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

Can we ever imagine what it would be like not to enjoy all of life's pleasures, joys, and the heartaches?..how we all take that for granted. Maggie is a sassy no nonsense gal and isn't a quitter, losing "Tom" makes her see how vulnerable we are, and how vulnerable she becomes when meeting Seth, she takes a hard look at her life and where it's going. We know the ending..it's heartbreaking for both Seth and Maggie..What Seth experience in a few short hrs..we experience in a lifetime. Maggie's disappointment knowing she couldn't show him everything after coming so far to be with her..Do we not experience these things in a lifetime also. The message is: Life is short..use it wisely..love all that surrounds us..the ones we love the most let us not take for granted..We only cheat ourselves if we don't experience life that was given and what we make of it when death comes to us...Could we bare eternity like Seth?

		<fullReview>This is a movie with an excellent idea and very good actors. However, it is also a movie with a terrible script and a very disappointing performance by one of those actors (namely Nicholas Cage). There is no discernible story arc or character arc, leaving the viewer with a very pretty almost-was of a romance. There were several disturbingly implausible parts that really hurt the over- all credibility of the film. (Yeah, I know, what about the angels?, etc.) For an angel in a world where there really is a God, Cage seems much too eager to become human. He falls prey to lust much more quickly than you would believe a guardian angel could. His angel friend seems to be almost completely uncaring about Cage's feelings, except for odd moments like his sitcom laugh while watching Cage in the ocean. Meg Ryan's character adapts very well (and rather confidently) to this strange man who wears all black, knows her name, and pops up EVERYWHERE she goes. You'd think that, especially in a city, any woman would be VERY careful, if not outright scared of such a man. The moment when she realizes he cannot bleed cries itself into five minutes of ambiguity. What does she make of it? Is that a frightened, confused, or sad reaction? Why does a guardian angel, a being made to protect people, not have a clue how to handle this one person? This leaves the viewer to wonder if anybody (including the screenwriter) knows what's going on anymore. As far as Cage's acting, it seemed to me that the blank, staring eyes and toneless speech were not an artistic rendition of what he thought an angel would be like, but rather it was the bored look of someone who is getting millions of dollars to walk through a piece of trash movie. The one bright spot was the solid performance of Dennis Franz. Meg Ryan was her usual charming, otherwise unremarkable self.</fullReview>

Perhaps it's the impassioned story of Wim Wenders, nare-to-be-deflected in the mish-mosh of American remake. Maybe it's just that we love Meg Ryan pretty much every time she tees it up, and Nick Cage is fine when he stays out of the way, which he does here expertly. Maybe it's because one of our most beloved actors today, Dennis Franz, finally gets a movie role which complements our preconceived notion of the man, rather than playing against that type.The John Seale photography is right on target, as is the beautiful Gabriel Yared score.This film finely fits what I like to call?.'there's absolutely nothing wrong with it' type of movie-great for couples, or the man with an easily exposed ?sensitive' side.</fullReview>

Meg Ryan gives a great performance as a doctor who meets &amp; falls in love with an angel. And Dennis Franz gives this movie a touch of humor and a touch of heart. This movie is a MUST for all true romantics, so rent City of Angels on a night where you &amp; your loved one have nothing to do, kick back, and feel the love this movie brings out to you. Oh, 1 more thing, buy tissues &amp; put them next to you, trust me on this. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice try, but falls short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found City of Angels to be a disturbing film. Disturbing because while it did bring up some good points (such as appreciating things we all take for granted - like the pleasure of our senses of touch, smell etc), I felt as though it really fell short in other ways. I felt as though the movie portrayed the life of angels to be dark and meaningless, and I believe that to be an absurd concept. Granted, I understand the portrayal may "glamorize" Cage's character by making him a bit of a rebel angel by showing some actual emotion, but still - the concept of these angels being surrounded in God's love and looking so bleak is beyond me. I guess this movie would be more for the non-believers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, City of Angels is one of those "surprise movies", when you get more than you expect. It turned out to be one of my favourite 1998 movies. Meg and Nicolas look great together. It seams that Meg Ryan is born for those heart breaking parts. And Nicolas is showing that he is great as an angel as well as he can be an action man. Moving performances from both of them. Very beautiful and touching love story. There is no happy end which makes it even better. Photography is excellent, so many beautiful angles and pictures. Score is fantastic. I like Gabriel Yared more and more. It is a shame that there is no CD score. Those 20 mins on the album pass too quickly. Songs "Angel" and "Iris" are great too. When you put all those things together you get a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed the cool aerial photography and art design, but this movie was very pretentious. The point was delivered in a heavy-handed manner. Nicholas Cage was so mis-cast. The man can't just stand around staring at Meg Ryan and going ga-ga over her and expect to hold my attention. I got so tired of seeing the same look on his face. He needs something to do. By the last half-hour, the writing of the script had deteriorated to drivel. My husband and I were giggling during the closing scenes.

It also made me so very thankful that I have the sense of touch...I think I cried the most when I thought of how awful it would be to be in love with someone and not be able to feel it when they kiss you or hold your hand. Touch is such an important sense and I think many of us take it for granted (I know I did before this movie). Anyway, it wasn't just a great movie, but it really made me think!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a masterpiece just like the movie that it's based on 'Wings of Desire'. A lot of people think this movie is rubbish, it's plot is unbelievable, acting is wooden blah blah blah. People (myself included) love a film where an alien is left on earth and befriends a young boy!!!! why can't angels exist all around us listening to our thoughts, our fears and help us through our day simply just being around us? This to me is what makes this film work, what if? as the film states, some things are true whether you believe them or not. The acting is first class, Meg Ryan in a change to her normal comedy plays Maggie Rice perfectly, (the whole science and faith question is what she struggles with the most)Nicholas Cage plays he angel Seth to perfection as well so i really don't see how people can't like this film?! The main with this film is you really just have to trust where it's going to, believe me the end of this film angers me to no end but hey i'm a romantic and I weep like a child always have and always have.One of my all time favourite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off Im a straight guy who prefers movies like Die-hard, Star Wars and Pulp fiction but I have to say, this movie really knocked me back. Yeah, its a chick-flick, but its a perfect movie to curl up on the couch with your significant other. Make sure you watch this with someone you really like, otherwise you could be sending the wrong message and be in real trouble. As for the movie, I thought it was Cages best role aside from Leaving Las Vegas and Meg Ryan was her typical adorable self. The first scene is really disturbing but sets the mood for the rest of the film. As a Christian there were a few things that bothered me about the "angel" aspect of the movie but it was of little consequence to the overall strength of the movie. This is not a party movie, you will not walk away felling particularly happy but there is a contentment it portrays that will stay with you for a long time. This is a movie you will probably want to watch more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie so much. It's a favorite and I rarely watch a movie more than once, because you know what will happen. This movie I've seen several times. It touches my soul. This is Nicholas Casge's best movie in my opinion. He and Meg Ryan are such a perfect match in this movie. I also love how the angels listen to people think.The connection these two characters have is so amazing. I want to find a love like that in my lifetime. It exemplifies how a love can touch your soul and no matter how much or how little time you have together it's worth it.When you see the comparison of how empty the Dr's eye are (Meg's boyfriend) in comparison to the way Seth look at her, you can see the love there. I think this movie was so under-appreciated and I felt compelled to write a review. I've never written one before, but this is well worth a great review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cry now. They want you to cry now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most manipulative movies I've ever sat through. All it needed was a flashing red sign below the screen telling me when to cry. It's fine to evoke emotions, but they were trying way too hard. Granted, the movie opened it a scene of a child dying, so it was clearly indicated from the beginning that this movie was going to be a barrel of laughs. I suppose I knew what I was getting into from the fist scene.Sure, not every movie has to be upbeat, but this movie was so unnecessarily depressing that when the lights came up in the theater, half the audience had committed suicide. Okay, I'm lying. I saw it on Netflix. I was going to see it in the theater, but they outlawed it in my area because of all the suicides. Every other scene had something horribly tragic happen. Being needlessly depressing is not the same as being deep. This movie had nothing interesting to say at all. It was hard to feel very strongly about the end, because by the time that happened, I had become desensitized. In 2 hours. Because it was City of Angels. Of course something depressing is going to happen; it happens every time you turn around.Moreover, the characters were difficult to like. Seth (Nicolas Cage) came across as incredibly creepy. The man used his powers of invisibility to hover over people to read their minds so he could try to understand human emotion. That's not sympathetic. That's downright invasive. I mean, he sat in the bathroom watching Maggie character bath and I'm supposed to like him because he's depressive, even though it clearly explained in the movie that angels don't feel negative emotions? And, not to be mean, but the movie goes through great lengths to present Nicolas Cage as a sex symbol, which seems off. He is an average looking guy with no personality whatsoever. What is it about him that is so damn appealing?Maggie (Meg Ryan) is a big question mark. For one thing, I like to think that my doctor would feel distress if I died during a procedure, so that seemed realistic. However, it later becomes clear that this was the ONLY patient that has ever died on her operating table... So, to recap, she's an ICU surgeon who had never had a patient die before that. THAT'S realistic. She also comes across as very cold in some scenes. It was half way through the movie that I realized that the doctor she is sleeping with is her boyfriend, and not just a sex buddy. So, essentially, she is cheating on him with Nicolas Cage's character, and doesn't seem to see anything wrong with it. Even when he proposes to her, she seems more disturbed by the fact that he proposed than any of her own wrongdoing.On the positive side, it's a very aesthetically pleasing film. They especially had some wonderful shots of the mountains in the Lake Tahoe scenes. Also, if you are a particularly sentimental person, than the over-the-top tragic nature of this movie might not annoy you as much as it did me.As for me, I just found this movie to be to be over-the-top tragic to the point where it seemed unnatural and manipulative. I feel that a plot should unfold and if tragedy comes, it should come naturally; this film seemed to use story as a segue into the cry scenes, and it shows. The dialog is bad, the story is full of holes, and the characters are unlikable. Ultimately, it is for that reason that I give it 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first movie EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>previously the movie "Cast Away" used to be my best movie, but now that I've watched this movie long time after releasing, it has become the most favorite movie of mine, EVER! I felt so light and emotional after watching this movie...Thanks to Nicolas Cage &amp; Meg Ryan...Seth (Nicolas Cage) is an angel that appears only to those who are about to die, or those who are in the process of death. However, he is visible to other angels, has conversations with them, and spends his time with one in particular, making it obvious that angels, like humans, think, speak and have opinions. Seth, and apparently angels in general, always ask the humans what their favorite part of life was. (In the beginning of the film, a young girl looks at Seth and answers, "Pajamas.") Seth watches a heart surgeon, Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) try vigorously to save a man's life even though the man is already dead. (He is in fact standing with Seth watching Maggie try to save him.) Seth soon becomes enthralled with Maggie and finds that he is able to make himself visible to her. Soon their relationship turns from a mild curiosity in each other into a friendship, and eventually progresses into a quasi-love type of relationship, neither being especially forthcoming.Later in the film, Seth meets a man (Dennis Franz) in a hospital room who can remarkably tell when angels are present, much to the amazement of Seth. The man, now calling himself Nathaniel Messenger (as angels are God's messengers) eventually tells Seth that he was in fact an angel, just like Seth, but decided to become human. Seth is amazed and begins to think about undergoing this transformation for himself so that he can be with Maggie (who cannot be with him because he is an angel and who is eventually asked to marry a co-worker who she has been in a mildly serious relationship with for some time). However, once Seth makes this transformation (in which he falls to Earth, which might not have anything to do with the transformation, but is symbolic nonetheless), he finds Maggie has traveled to a mountain cabin to "get away".Seth makes the journey to see Maggie and appears cold and soaked from rain at her door step. In the cold air, she sees his breath coming from his mouth, illuminating her to the transformation he has made.The next morning, as Seth is in the shower, Maggie makes a rather extended trip to a small store by way of bicycle. On her way back, she lifts her hands off the handle bars, looks up at the sky, and enjoys the gentle ride down the hill. However, she does not realize the logging truck pulling out of a road ahead.The next scene shows Seth running toward the scene of the accident (apparently, Seth has also acquired humanity's intuition - an unexplainable ability to know when loved ones are in danger or trouble), the truck driver running for help, and Maggie lying on the road, waiting.Seth arrives at her side, and both know that this will be their last time seeing each other alive, though Seth refuses to speak of it. Maggie however, sees an angel by her side while a mortal Seth sees nothing. Seth does know that they are there, telling Maggie, "Don't look at them." Maggie tells Seth that when they ask her what her favorite part was, she will say it was Seth. Maggie then dies and Seth is left with the incredible sadness that follows the loss of someone one truly loves, an emotion that angels do not know. In a mere day, Seth had become a human, experienced physical pain and pleasure, the joy of true love, and the devastating loss of death. Seth is next seen sitting in a living room, and all of a sudden, his former co-angel and good friend Cassiel (Andre Braugher) appears. Seth is told that this is life, he is human, and that one day he will die as well. Cassiel then asks Seth that if he knew this was going to happen, would he still do it? Seth responds by telling him that he would rather have one instant with her, than an eternity without. The final scene illustrates Seth at the beach,with all the Angels including Cassiel watching, and after looking out at the ocean, he runs and jumps in, enjoying the water and realizing that his life will go on as well, and that he'll see Maggie one day again. And Cassiel is seen laughing, showing that the Angels are happy for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I only watched this movie for a reference for a short story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very bad movie and just about everything about it was not good. As long as it looks as if some care went into making the movie it turns out at least half way decent, but this entire movie seemed forced. They took an interesting idea and totally messed it up. It was not a good idea, but an interesting idea. They focused on the wrong character, which totally made the ending pointless and ineffective. They should have focused on Seth's character the entire time, but they switched focus which was not good. The ending with Meg Ryan's character dying felt forced and they could have done that much better, but it totally missed. The acting was not that good and only at moments was I slightly convinced that they could act, but I know both of them can act, but it seemed as if they were not invested in the material. The script may have been better and then possibly the director tried to change it, but something did not work in the transition (or maybe the script was just that bad). I watched this because I was interested in seeing how the movie would deal with the fact that these angels were more or less grim reapers and how they would deal with death and finality. I felt as if this had some potential, but it did not work because they barely even mentioned it. I am not going to lie, but I like a lot of songs on the soundtrack and "Angel" by Sarah McLachlan is a very moving song, but knowing what the song is about made it use a cheap forced move to get the viewer to feel emotional. I guess I could go on and on about how bad this movie is, but the continuity of the angel's behavior was one of the most agonizing parts of the movie. The one thing I liked, was the use of words that they used, but they totally did not use it enough. The scene when meg ryan's character describes the pear was fun and they needed more of that, but oh well. Don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A deeply dissapointing and schmultzy remake of one of the truly great films of modern times. Wenders' original navigates treacherous ground movingly, reflecting on the nature of existence, time, cities and nationhood as well as romantic love, with a backdrop that although grounded in Christian dogma resists evangelism. The remake debases the original, offering an overtly Christian (limiting the piece philosophically) and nauseating romance. Sugar-sweet performances from the cast leave the audience dissinterested and patronised, as the typically 'Hollywood' craving for closure is frustrating. This is another example of an industry that all to often thinks far too little of its consumer. We deserve better.</fullReview>

There are just some movies that you watch one time, like "Pay it Forward" and "Get Over It." At first they're not so bad. Once you give yourself time to stew over it, your outlook changes and you realize that the movie really sucked. This is how I felt about "City of Angels." If you find yourself crying during this movie, its probably because you can't believe you've wasted good money on it. In most cases, I would feel that the plot should be discussed, but here that would be wasting my time. Lets face it, this movie makes you want to soil it, literally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending *added* to the film, not subtracted (no spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: I will not give away the ending of this film, unlike some folks who have written about this issue. So read on even if you haven't seen "City of Angels!"A number of people have posted reviews where they complain about the movie's ending. Unfair, they shout, why have set up-conflict-resolution and then add a conflict? Why can't we see a story that ends all happy happy? Well, because that would have been BORING.Besides,the movie does in fact have another resolution, though it isn't as pedestrian as some reviewers would appear to like. This second resolution makes you think ... was it all worth it? ... rather than state smugly and uninterestingly, "Well, gee, yes, it was A-OK!" And any movie that makes you feel *and* think is an improvement over simply feeling (unless you are a kid or just want to turn your brain off, which all of us do at times). By the way, want another good example of this kind of movie? Try "Gattaca."I gave "City of Angels" a 7 as a rating. Without the ending, I would have given it a 4. Without a doubt, the slowest, most uninteresting part of City of Angels was the resolution segment in the cabin, and the too long set up of the ending.Look, give the viewer credit for having some intelligence. We all know where the movie is headed just 20 minutes into it. When it gets there, do we need to see a near slow-motion demonstration? The angel's line about trading it all for "one breath of her hair, one touch, one ..." blah blah blah was way more than was necessary. Simply stating that it was incredible, or that the smell of her hair reached into his soul, would have been touching enough to show us how the character felt. Fortunately, the movie adds additional conflict and then it *does* resolve it. At least, it leaves you wondering if the angel has resolved it, as he seems to enjoy a new sensation. Whether *you* think it is resolved depends a lot of what *your* values and desires are of life. But that is why the ending was so good. The angel has some desires, and seems to make up his mind to make the most of them even while in pain. Is that not noble and uplifting? And much better than a film that would have ended in the cabin.Check out "City of Angels" and see for yourself.</fullReview>

Anyway, Whispering Nicholas Cage, the guardian angel who's supposed to be taking the dying man's soul into the after-world is mesmerized by Perky Meg Ryan who, one has to admit, isn't feeling so perky. In fact, he watches her as she sits and has a good cry, which is all well and good, but shouldn't someone be doing something about that soul who's just wandering around the hospital?So Whispering Nicholas Cage, who frankly doesn't exactly scream--or whisper--angel, goes and talks to his Angel Buddy(tm) and they have a deep discussion on whether or not people see them, just as they hang around a convenience store that's being held up. Angel Buddy(tm) declares that no matter how despondent Perky Meg Ryan has become, she doesn't need to see him. But Whispering Nicholas Cage goes back to the hospital anyway to console poor Perky Meg Ryan. She sees him looking in on another patient, and they talk. His name is Seth, and he starts to meet up with her at random times. That and he watches her when she can't see him, too, which is just a shade too close to angelic stalking for comfort. So it turns out that the angels live in the library and listen to the sunrise. Great. Perfect sense. And the patient that Perky Meg Ryan has just saved is actually a fallen angel. Whispering Nicholas Cage takes this fallen angel out to lunch to pump him for information and learns the meaning of Free Will(tm) which God has given to all his creations, angels included. Perky Meg Ryan also learns that Whispering Nicholas Cage is an angel, mainly by stabbing him, but is totally turned off by this fact. She tells Whispering Nicholas Cage to buzz off, she's going to go marry her boyfriend in Lake Tahoe.SPOILER!!!This makes Whispering Nicholas Cage not so perky and he leaps off a tall building in a single bound. The only time, in fact, when he doesn't whisper is when he's ecstatic that he's bleeding. So he runs to the hospital where they tell him that Perky Meg Ryan has run to Lake Tahoe to get married. (Didn't she tell him that earlier?)Let's recap, he's been shot down by Perky Meg Ryan, fallen off of a building, ridiculed by construction workers, and then mugged of everything including his shoes by random guys. And he's still glad he's human. He wanders around barefoot in the rain for a while until a guy takes him to Tahoe. He finds Perky Meg Ryan once again not so perky because she's just dumped her boyfriend, and they have a night of wild passionate sex.The next morning, Whispering Nicholas Cage scalds himself in the shower and Perky Meg Ryan gets hit by a truck. Frankly, I'd say being a human has pretty much sucked for Whispering Nicholas Cage. He spends the rest of the movie sulking, and yet, just in time to deliver the moral of the movie, Angel Buddy(tm) reappears and asks him if it was all worth it. Of course he says yes, but I don't buy it. Sorry, but one night of wild passionate sex does not a lifetime make. Perky Meg Ryan should stick to fluffy romances that at least don't pretend to have a moral. And I don't know what Whispering Nicholas Cage should do, except perhaps get that nasty case of laryngitis taken care of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angels, a very romantic and overall decently done film, was a rather disheartening experience for me, since one of my "friends" was kind enough to tell me what happens to a critical character in the end. That knowledge ruined much of the plot for me. All that aside, Angels is a very...interesting film. We--at least I don't--usually think about the possible presence of angels. In the film, they're literally everywhere--in the library, in the park, relaxing on top of a highway exit sign. Nicolas Cage is perfect as Seth, the angel who longs to be human for Meg Ryan's character. See, angels can't feel anything, so love is a dead end road for them apparently. That was a peculiar point and seems even stranger the more you think about it. The movie was, really, leading up to the inevitable Big Romance Scene, and I don't think I'm giving much away by telling you one such moment exists. It is a romance, and strives to be as romantic as possible. In some ways it truly is. But the kitchen scene in which Maggie discovers Seth is indeed an angel is contrived. ("I cannot conceive of it!" is a prime example.) But of course the lovers need a fight scene to increase the tension between them. But from there it is a slippery slope and we know they'll wind up together. Perhaps with a little more friction we could have kept guessing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Wings of Desire instead, PLEASE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie took the Wim Wenders classic and drained it of humor, beauty and profundity. Unlike most American remakes this one was more somber and arching than the original, to its detriment. Though in true Hollywood fashion it did replace the simple pleasures of good coffee and Nick Cave with hot sex by the fireplace. I ask you ladies and gentlemen: Where's the joy? Where's the juiciness? In Wings, Solvieg Donmartin was a circus performer searching for a simple connection. In this one, Meg was a heart surgeon searching for the meaning of life. Which is more poignant? And which is more engaging? And Nicolas Cage just stared into the lens with those anguished eyes until you wanted to slap him! What made Bruno Ganzs performance so wonderful was the humor and energy he gave to the character. The whole point was that this angel was meant to fall to earth because he loved humanity, in all its messiness. If you want to see pathos, rent the sequel to Wings, Faraway So Close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie, 'City of Angels'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen! It was dreadful! I've never seen anything so predictable, unstructured and generally just boring in my life! The script is puerile and unrealistic. The whole film itself just left me with a feeling of total uncompassion for the characters, I didn't empathise with them whatsoever! This film lacks any real emotion and I found it all so laughably stupid! The majority of the (few - obviously the word had got round!) people in the cinema viewing this film also seemed to think so - bouts of hysterical laughter would spur up at the angels' attempts to look 'spiritual' and Cage's forced looks of 'lust' and 'sympathy', making him look more like a perverse bloke in an anorak who hangs about in libraries! This film creates it's own genre of 'pure, unadulterated crap'! Not meaning to spoil it for anyone else, but I was relieved when Meg finally snuffed it! It was so obvious what was going to happen though, a five year old could have written the plot. I was also surprised at what a bad job both Meg Ryan and Nicholasa Cage did in this movie, normally, they're both very good in their roles but in this, their acting was terrible, truly, the very definition of 'wooden'! They almost seemed embarrassed to be in this film, which is hardly suprising.I don't know much on the background of this movie, as to whether it was taken from a novel. Perhaps the book etc. was good, but this is just another example of Hollywood attempting to adapt a written text onto screen and failing miserably. My general advice for anyone contemplating the very notion of actually paying to see this film is: DON'T! Anyone with an IQ above room temperature will undoubtably detest this film. Believe what the acclaimed critics say about this movie: it sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie a few nights ago really excited and very eager to watch it. I had heard some mixed feelings about it from some of my friends who had seen it but decided that I would probably like it. I was sadly and entirely disappointed. The script is one of the worst things I've ever seen put to screen. It totally ruins the sweet (if somewhat off-kilter) concept. Not one of the scenes is believeable or all that interesting. Many are laughable ["We all fit together" (If you've seen it, you'll remember the scene)....etc., etc.]. Meg Ryan does her best fighting against the horrible script and lodgy, clumpy story development, while Nicolas Cage, who happens to be Hollywood's least expressive actor, simply crumbles, not once is his portrayal the slightest bit believable or inspired. Aside from "Armageddon", this has to be the biggest disappointment of the year, stay away from it. Unless you don't mind an awful story and atrocious writing, that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God-Awful Remake of a Fantastic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This horrendous remake takes a takes a clever, warm, ebullient film - Wings of Desire - and turns it into a big budget version of a Lifetime Original Movie.The plot of both films is simple : Angels are all around us, they are the invisible recorders of human history, they do not get involved in human life. But one angel decides he wants to become human, in this version it's simply because he falls in love with a woman, and falls to earth. It goes on from there...The ironic thing is that American remakes usually redo rather dark European films as big dumb action flicks and/or lighthearted romances. But City of Angels redoes a joyous, sweet film as the penultimate cheesy melodrama. Here the classic American overkill is not with more explosions and sex, but with more desperate, gaudy, manipulative solemnity and pretension.In the original, Bruno Ganz plays Damiel, the angel, with a kind of casual elation. He falls to earth not simply because he falls in love, but because he wants to enjoy human life, the simple pleasures - coffee, cigarettes, the circus, children, color, smell, singing, sex, etc... And he doesn't have to have a freakin' epiphany with each discovery of a small part of human existence, part of the point is that he becomes acclamated because he is already more human than angel to begin with. Nicholas Cage plays Damiel like a terrified alien, most of the time feeling very very sorry for us sad humans, and occasionally shedding profound tears of wonder at our potential for good. Honestly I felt like punching Nicholas Cage in his poignantly wistful face every five minutes.An even more blatent example of the needless overdramatizing comes in the form of the leading lady's role. In the original, the object of Damiel's affection is Marion, played by lovely and talented Solveig Donmartin. Marion is a trapeze artist who lives life to the fullest, but is dreamy and aimless, searching to find a true connection. In the remake, Meg Ryan is a *heart surgeon* trapped in the depths of a horrific depression over the meaninglessness of life and the pain of death. Can I get an oy veh? The love story in the original is quirky and fresh, the lovers spent the majority of time searching for each other, and when they do get together, it is one of the most beautiful and satisfying moments ever caught on film, totally totally devoid of shmaltz. The love story in the remake is ALL SCHMALTZ. Every moment they spend together is meant to be utterly profound, the height of joy and the height of despair - totally maudlin and manipulative. ICKY.All the problems with the remake stem from these misguided attempts to make the film serious and meaningful. It's bad high-school poetry.The real tragedy is that because Wings of Desire is a German movie, because it has a reputation for dealing with a lot of very profound and intellectual ideas, because it is very *complex*, people are turned off. I am here to tell you that, yes, Wings is more profound, more intellectual, more complex than City of Angels, but if you give it a chance, it is also lighter, funnier, more joyous, more entertaining, more beautiful, and more magical than City of Angels. Go see the original!!!</fullReview>

I'd wager our friend Seth does the typical Hollywood thing and dumps her for someone younger.I know, this film is supposed to be about TRUE LOVE. Whatever. Be realistic: if you were a brain surgeon and met Meg Ryan working at the local Cholesterol Death (aka McDonalds), would you be rushing out to buy her a ring?

		<fullReview>American reworking of Germany's "Wings of Desire" becomes an old-fashioned weeper...and how dispiriting is that? Meg Ryan isn't quite convincing playing a doctor being romanced by a strange man who is actually a lovestruck angel contemplating becoming human. Nicolas Cage has the showier role, performing it in a surprisingly low-key and with ambling charm. Far less intense and magical than "Wings of Desire", the picture takes a more direct approach which isn't as stimulating (the goal here seems to be star-crossed romance, which doesn't leave much room for thought-provoking, psychological asides). Still, for a corny, dewy-sweet affair, the handsomely-made drama manages some bracing, finely-wrought moments. The finale, engineered to be "ironic", doesn't provide much uplift however, leading to an unsatisfying wrap-up. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just absolutely love the premise of this movie, and the first thirty minutes or so (if you can take a fair dose of saccharine) is so damn good. Cage is one of many angels hovering over us folks, in this case he takes a particular interest in Dr. Ryan, who has left one of her cardiac patients dead on the operating table. I could have taken two hours of the same stuff we get in the first quarter of this movie, that was fascinating enough to me and Cage fits the role of caring soul. But I guess they had to move on from there and the remainder of the story is sort of a damned-if-I-do, damned-if-I-don't tortured romance. I don't think Ryan and Cage click when they exist on the same spiritual plane, so I think where this goes just doesn't work that well. But I still love the set up to it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Until "Van Helsing," the most unnecessary movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers, but you don't care, because the movie blows.The remake of Casablanca starring Pamela Anderson in the Bogart role ("Barb Wire") was a far superior bad film. Some rainy evening, check it out! This remake (of "Wings of Desire" -- great film!) is actually a complete rewrite. It omits everything that made the original worthwhile (its exploration of human consciousness, history, life &amp; death, and so on), and replaces it with a gooky love story between an angel that needs prozac (Cage) and Meg Ryan. He gives up being an angel for her, and then she dies. Boo hoo.This is not in itself a horrible film. A very bad film, yes. The perverse audacity, however, of this bad film trying to pass itself off as being in some way related to the original-- wow! The film ends up being the worst of both worlds. On some level, it's trying to justify its relationship to Wings of Desire, so it lathers on an extra layer of seriousness (but not artistry or understanding). In this way, it fails to be a good cheesy romance.Could it have been worse? Sure! Mentally recast it starring Robin Williams and that woman from "Alias". Or, Ashton Kutcher and the sock puppet from Pets.com. Whatever.I'll admit to a peculiar loathing for Nichalas Cage for his ponderous "acting" in movies like Leaving Las Vegas, and for his "fun" films like Alcatraz. This is more of the same: he may have talent, but by God he has no taste.If you do a shot every time there's a long, portentous moment of silent emotion, you'll be drunk off your ass after 10 minutes.This might not be the worst outcome, if turning off the film is not an option. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All opinions are not equally valid. If you can't talk intelligently about film, you shouldn't tell people what your favorite movie is, especially if that favorite movie is City of Angels. I could understand why someone might feel Wings of Desire is esoteric, but I promise, if you watch it multiple times, you'll see what an ingenious poem it really is. Wings of Desire expresses the desire for honesty and the desire to delve into the deepest and simplest goods and evils human beings are capable of.So, to help, here is a list of things about City of Angels and movies in general that should help you stop enjoying movies that are insulting to humankind:1) Just because your favorite actor is in the movie and he/she is cute doesn't mean the movie is good.2) Just because a film is slow or hard to understand on the first viewing doesn't mean it's bad. Maybe you just don't know enough about how to watch the film yet.3) It's OK to laugh at the ending of City of Angels.4) To fully appreciate Wings of Desire, it would help if you already knew something about 20th century German history--and a little bit about what's called the "German soul".5) JUST BECAUSE A MOVIE DOES WELL AT THE BOX OFFICE DOESN'T MEAN THE MOVIE IS GOOD! Case in point: Wild Wild West. There are such things as advertisements and public relations that use certain methods to make films look good when it fact they're c**p. Another case in point: Three Kings was a brilliant satire of U.S. power in the middle east--did it appear that way in the commercial?6) Watch movies with friends and develop consistent standards of "goodness" for everything you watch. Believe it or not, there are things in a movie that make it absolutely good and absolutely bad: creative writing, distracting and out-of-place acting, etc.7) Finally, be wary of movies that tug at your heartstrings when the ONLY motivation is to make a buck, via box office sales and deals with companies like fast-food joints. Remember, the same five companies (Time-Warner, Disney, Viacom, Seagram, and Sony) that make 90 percent of the movies and music in the U.S. also own most of the magazines, radio stations, TV stations, newspapers, and book publishers. It's very easy for them to publicize "blockbuster" movies and make them sound like quality flicks when all they want to do is exploit your wallet and make you think it's worth it to spend $8-$10 on tripe like City of Angels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What did you like best?""Not 'City of Angels'"It's really hard to describe how truly awful it felt to have to sit through this dreadful excuse for a film (it wasn't my fault, my boyfriend dragged me there). Even worse was the fact that partway through I realized it was a remake of Wim Wenders's much better (if slower) "Wings of Desire".I like Nicolas Cage a lot and love those times when he puts in a really good performance, but "City of Angels" was not one of those times. Cage plays an angel who takes people away when they die. He hangs out with the other angels and they do lame artsy things like stand on the beach together looking unhappy. Anyway, Cage falls for Meg Ryan (who personally can't stand, but who's lack of talent I can objectively point out) who hangs out in the library. Being an angel, Cage can't touch her (bummer) so he's all torn up inside.Ryan works in a hospital and is caring for a guy with a heart condition, Dennis Franz. Franz reveals to Cage that he used to be an angel himself until he "fell" (sadly it's literal) and became human. Cage sees his option to be with Ryan, but since it's a bad thing for an angel to fall, -once again- he's all torn up inside.The conclusion may bring more laughs or groans than the intended tears.This thing tries to be touching and to jerk tears and to seem "true" in an emotional sense. What "City of Angels" comes out as, is an artsy chick flick that fails to muster enough "heart" to compensate for its lack of brains. You won't feel sorry for the characters, but yourself for having lost two hours of your life that could have been better spent doing ANYTHING else. Meg Ryan fans might enjoy it... but then again, maybe not. Don't waste your time. See "Wings of Desire" instead, if you have the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another American flick made because a great foreign film didn't get proper distribution. "Wings of Desire", a lovely film, serves as the template for this bad attempt at a stylish, big budget remake. There's no reason to see "City of Angels", unless you enjoy watching foreign flicks then renting the American analogue to see how badly they messed it up, like "Abre Los Ojos" versus "Vanilla Sky" (shudder).A lot of folks seem to enjoy Nicholas Cage, and truth to tell, I've never thought much of him. He has his moments, but in general, I find his performances contrived and lacking in genuine intensity, though he DOES try very, very hard to LOOK hardcore. For example, in an interview after "City of Angels" was released, he said that his approach to the character in the film was very simple - as an ethereal, metaphysical creature, he figured the best way to show that sort of other-worldly gravity would be not to blink during filming. Way to go, Nick. You just blew away ALL of your dwindling credibility. Go back to making timewasters like "The Rock".And poor Meg Ryan. Forever trapped as the Doris Day of the new millennium, except for her brief stint as a badgirl in "The Doors" or as an action star in "Courage Under Fire", which I like to call "GI Jane Lite". She really needs to make something a bit more substantial, I'm getting tired of her sweet, squinty smile.</fullReview>

Gives up his immortal existence and becomes a man, just for Meg!This flick is very long, very slow, and very boring. Because its just so Hollywood, the cliches roll out thick and fast. To get through this flick without suffering from a severe bout of diarrhoea, it is essential you sustain all suspension of disbelief.Meg the (empty-headed) heart doctor is extremely beautiful and has an extremely successful, privileged life style. She botches up an operation and loses a patient and spends the first hour of the flick feeling sorry for herself. Scary-looking Nick Angel sniffs around her like an invisible stalker. (Hollow Man, anyone?) She is suffering such unbelievable hard ship, she needs an angel's intervention! Never mind the starving children and homeless destitutes! Angels only answer the prayers of wealthy, beautiful, spoiled brats! The sentimental side of this flick is dumb and just like eating stale marsh mellows, only stickier. The audience is supposed to feel for the main characters but they are played by the cast so shallowly it's like watching Mills and Boon instead of reading it. The ending (had to be coming!) is one of the worst I've ever seen! It is the biggest cliche of all - a TRUCK!!? If you don't know what I'm talking about, you will have to sit through this movie to find out! But it was a complete laugh! Soooo.... Hollywood!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeeeehhh, Hollywood ripped off another foreign movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had to see, folks, how much Hollywood would drag this to it's complete sappiness.I was fortunate enough to being able to see "Der Himmel Über Berlin" (Wings of Desire) from 1987 and it's sequel, "In Weiter Ferne, so nah!" (Faraway, So Close!) from 1993, both wonderful films by German director Wim Wenders, and believe me, when you see them you just don't see the time passing, they are very, very slow, but these movies keeps you so focused that you just feels like flying over Berlin with those angels.With this Hollywood mock up, it's the other way around. There's so much clichés and so much cheesiness, that you keep looking on your watch how much time is left for the movie to end.Seth is a complete sappy version from Damiel, the angel from the Wenders films. It just angers me thinking why Hollywood feels the need of having their own version of foreign movies, why they can't just let these movies alone? Despite some remakes that really respects the original flick and sometimes even tends to pay homage to them, this one is a total flop.It drains all the philosophical and elaborate lines from the original Wenders films and tries to get to our emotions with gratuitous cheesy lines and dialogs.Avoid this film. Watch Wenders masterpieces instead. Damiel and Cassiel in the originals are much better pals than Cage and Braugher. Plus in the original films we have Peter Falk, the Columbo to make us good company as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie grew on me about three days after seeing it. Initially when I left the cinema I would have given it a 1 out of 10. Now, I give it a 2 out of 10. The reason for this is the pathetic slump that Nicolas Cage performs towards the end of the movie. This horrible display of acting (one of many from Cage throughout the movie), had my friend and I laughing for weeks. A couple of years on and we still talk about it. How could I give a film 1 out of 10 when it has given me such great bagging material.Worth seeing so you can laugh at the slump, otherwise pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first accurate OR scene I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's just one point I want to make about this movie, and that's about the OR scene when they're doing a coronary bypass. This is the first time I've ever seen a correct movie rendition of it, it's usually a baroque farce, but not here. Every instrument I could see, the bypass machine, the aortic cannula, the headlamps, the ECG monitors (and the traces!), the orders given, the type of suture, were correct (except I suspect they chose a heavier suture than normal 7-0, since a 7-0 would be very hard to see, it looked more like 4-0 or 5-0). Even the tying of knots, the Joule strengths used for defibrillation, the lidocaine dosages, the body temperature during bypass, the kind of mag the bypass operator is reading, the music (except we had Bach, country &amp; western, Dylan or Cat Stevens, depending on surgeon and how the procedure was going), the time it will take to reprime the pump to get back on cardiac bypass again; I found not one single error! There's this one moment when everyone looks under the table, which is weird, but then Meg Ryan leaves the table, so even that is OK from a sterility point of view. I don't know if other people care, but this kind of care for detail makes a movie a lot more enjoyable for me.Oh, one more remark: the reanimation with internal cardiac massage is a bit short, they give up a bit too soon. But that's exactly what she blames herself for, later.</fullReview>

Both Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage were at the peak of their careers when this movie was made, and I'm sure a lot was expected putting both of these big draws in this movie. Dennis Franz was just beginning his big run on NYPD BLUE and his character brought the plot of this movie together. I felt it a terrific movie. It was expertly shot with beautiful scenery, great sound tracks, and a story line that held your attention throughout. I judge movies by criteria #1, Was I entertained? It met that criteria and more.

		<shortDescription>Why remake a classic when you don't know what you are doing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wim Wender's spectacular "Wings of Desire" was made into an unintentional parody by Brad Silberling. As his second film, he had the extremely difficult task of making an exceptionally well received German film into a palatable form for American audiences. Well, he blew it. Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan were not properly cast. Making her a cardio-thoracic surgeon (a heart doctor) is totally assinine and to be exceptionally beautiful on top of that? Yeah, right. What was Silberling thinking? Lord only knows but I have to say. Forget this one. It is a clunker beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It misses its mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss of her mouth, one touch of her hand, than eternity without it. One."Brad Silberling's City of Angels isn't a film that seems to have aged well and perhaps it suffers a bit from the Nicholas Sparks syndrome we've been exposed to over recent years. I'm not bashing on Sparks because I was a fan of The Notebook, but his stories seem to have been recycled over recent years and its hard not to find them emotionally manipulative. That's the case with Silberling's film as well, it seems as it is trying to force a chemistry that isn't really perceivable. The film is a loose remake of Wim Wender's German film, "Wings of Desire," which I haven't seen but heard is far superior. After seeing City of Angels I honestly have no desire to watch the original. I felt like something was missing from this screenplay (adapted by Dana Stevens) and perhaps it was simply the cast, but I never found the romance behind this story believable. Costner did a much better job than Cage does here playing the lead character in Stevens's previous screenplay "For Love of the Game" which is a film I still admire despite its flaws. There was something about Cage's performance here that simply didn't resonate with me. I found his character more of a creepy stalker than anything else and his puppy dog eyes didn't change my perception either. Cage is a talented actor and there are a number of films where I've really enjoyed his performances, but this wasn't one of them. City of Angels introduces us to a guardian angel named Seth (Nicolas Cage) who watches over the people of Los Angeles along with many other angels. One day as he is sent to pick up a dying patient at a hospital he falls for a heart surgeon named Maggie (Meg Ryan). He is captivated by the way she fights for this patient's life and how his death affects her. He begins falling her around and after giving it some thought he allows her to see him. He's never experienced touch or feelings before so he asks her to describe everything around her, such as the taste of the pear she's eating and so on. He is surprised when one of her patients at the hospital senses his presence. Nathaniel Messinger (Dennis Franz) is a man who enjoys life to the fullest and while he is being treated at the hospital he acknowledges Seth's presence. He confesses that he was once an angel who decided to give up on eternal life as an angel to become human. When Seth realizes this is possible he begins to ponder whether or not he too should fall to Earth to be with the woman he has become enfatuated with.Silberling's film isn't simply a love story, it is a film about living life to its fullest and learning to appreciate the small things in life. That is what it tries to say anyway in a rather manipulative way through Cage's character. I think that the film misses its opportunity to explore love and how it is much deeper than a simple feeling. Seth was the perfect vehicle to explore this considering he could not feel anything but somehow he felt attracted to Maggie. Unfortunately the film doesn't explore this and it lacks that emotional impact that I though a film like this could deliver. The lack of a stronger chemistry between Ryan and Cage definitely hurts the film, but at least Dennis Franz elevates the material. It's a shame this is the last film he made considering he went on to work in NYPD Blue for more than a decade and has retired from acting since. He showed a lot of potential here playing a very different role. Andre Braugher also gets to share some scenes with Cage as one of his fellow angels as the two philosophize about life. After having been released over 15 years ago the greatest legacy this film has left is its soundtrack, which is easily recognizable thanks to its popular pop songs. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am sweet- and soft-hearted about angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every morning at sunrise all the angels of Los Angeles are meeting on the Pacific Ocean beach to listen to the music of dawn. These angels are there to welcome and accompany dead people to the other side of this life. We can't see them, we can't hear them, but some of us can feel them, sense their presence because some of us are angels who chose to become human.We all love angels and we all have angels in our lives, human terrestrial life or eternal life or mental and spiritual life. What we don't know is that some of the angels we are in love with are real angels but it would change nothing in our minds because these angels of ours are soul friends, soul companions and soul mates. Sometimes it does not work both ways and the angels of mine do not consider me as an angel for them but it does not matter because an angel is a creature of the mind.So we live with those angels who inspire us and we must keep in mind they do not have wings and we do not become winged angels by becoming their angels and yet they can fly. They are right in front of me any time I ask them or summon them. They haunt my mind and my heart and I cannot live without them anymore even if they are inhabiting my soul.That's what this film is all about. A real angel decides to become human out of love but the woman he loves and loves him is so haunted by that angel face of his that she imagines she is able to fly, on her bike mind you. No one has a second chance. She will meet with her fate and he will have to remain human.Touching film though slightly romantic, sweet, mellow, close to melodramatic at the end.Remember you do not need to believe in angels because they do not exist because we believe in them. They exist all by themselves and they are happy when we know they exist for our sake, otherwise life goes on and an angel's life is eternal: he will see billions of dying men and women and children in his eternal life. And every morning he will come to the beach to salute the sun rising in the East, in their backs, over the Rocky Mountains.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An angel in black. No wings. No halo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I held on to this movie a long time before finally watching it. I was genuinely surprised by the refreshing take on parallel worlds of angels and humans and the fallout of a crossover. Some of the shots in the movie are uncanny, if not entirely different. They are unsettling but seam with the flow of the story that essentially dwells on an emotionally charged relationship between an angel and a human. Nicholas Cage starts off slightly jaded, his portrayal of an angel, more wooden than natural. But, the moment Meg Ryan enters the screen, he adapts to the story like a fish to water. Their chemistry is bang on! It is hard not to fall for them. The crackling freshness between the two sets the tone for the poetic end... It will stir your beliefs on love and afterlife, if not shake them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a sappy romantic movie in all the right ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Brad Silberling, it stars Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. "City of Angels" is based on a 1987 movie by Wim Wenders called "Wings of Desire." Wenders gets credit for the script.Cage and Andre Braugher play angels; in "City of Angels," angels haunt humans, watching them from above. They are messengers sent to retrieve the dying, easing their entry into where ever it is they go. Cage's character, named Seth, envies the five senses enjoyed by humans, and he falls in love with Ryan's character, a doctor. Seth trades in his wings for humanity, the two fall in love, and Seth enjoys the feelings, sensations, and physical experiences of being human. With Meg Ryan. Not a bad trade for many people, I'm sure.It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but I did enjoy it. There's no depth, nothing metaphysical, metaphorical, or meta-anything - just a straight romance. Cage and Ryan are great. Cage can do soulful better than any actor alive, and he lays it all out in his role as the angel. If you haven't seen "Wings of Desire," go along for the ride with "City of Angels." I'm not sure the two movies have any cross over, so if you like one you may dislike the other. Intensely. Or maybe not. Who can tell?I saw "City of Angels" first and enjoyed it a great deal. In my humble opinion, "Wings of Desire" is the better movie, but many disagree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes genuinely moving, sometimes overly sentimental!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do think this film is underrated. For one thing, it has beautiful cinematography that just adds to the appeal of the film. Another thing I liked was the very thoughtful soundtrack, that title song is very haunting, and we just know it is going to be very sad. Some of the film is genuinely moving, and the evidence is in the chemistry of the two stars Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage. Cage gives a very moving performance as Seth, a very unusual representation of an angel, and Ryan is very charming as always as Maggie. Of the minor roles, Dennis Franz is a scene stealer, bringing some energy into a rather slow-moving story. The script was very touching, though sometimes cheesy, and there are some overly sentimental scenes like the ending, that gets a bit hard to stomach. Though, in conclusion, a lovely looking, moving and well performed film. 7/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were a group of angels, that is the dead men, to escort the dying guys to their world! One of them in the angles' city, Seth (Nicolas Cage), had his duty to meet the man who were nearly close to be angel after an incidents taken on the operation table by a doctor, Maggie (Meg Ryan) But coincidently, Seth WEIRDLY fell in love with Maggie at first sight, and wanna take her out of desperate mood. Switching to Maggie, she seemingly had the same thoughts as Seth. At the moment Seth talked to regain her confidence and holy life-surviving job, delights and mysterious feeling aroused on her heart! With happiness was uphilling, torture was going underway. Touching, but no feeling, propelled Maggie wonder who Seth was, an average guy or a GHOST. A several weird matters ,including an elder Messinger who turned to be a man from an angle thru falling from high buildings with firm will, jumped into the scenes and gave Seth a chance to be an ordinary person to feel everything man can feel and save the love which is hardly reachable if he still was a NON-feeling angel. With great courage of revival and sweet future of reunion, he DEFINITELY fell in be a man, and then successfully went get her heart. Everything goes smoothly... end would be coming??? Nope, comedy has less strikes than tragedy. For that purpose, an UNEXPECTABLE car-incidents happened, then an UNIMAGINABLE death of Maggie made these 2 lovers parted again. An angle being a man, a woman being an angle, they wanna get together once more, waiting the next life. Can you imagine that concept, director? I think you can! One more thing, Seth's struggle to grabbing the union and his touching words impressed me a lot! RATING: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical with flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I heard this movie was sad and well done, so I took the time to watch it, and all I can say is blah! I must admit, the beginning was interesting, and there were a lot of little touches in this movie that were meant to make it special, but there were so many things I could scrutinize. I didn't like Nicholas Cage's acting, playing the "gentle angel," it came off so puppy-dog that I got sick of watching it. I didn't get why there would be this deep connection between the two, they hardly knew anything about each other yet they were so drawn; it's just that it seemed so much like typical Hollywood. The thing that I hated most about this movie was the ending. It was meant to be incredibly tragic and tear-jerking, but am I the only one who thought it was stupid? I heard so many people say they cried at the end, and I keep feeling that the makers of this movie wanted to leach all they could out of people who are into such faux sentimentality. People say this movie was beautiful and thought-provoking because of the ending, but I think the makers had no option but to do that in attempts to redeem it. I personally think the way they did it was dumb *****WARNING HERE COMES SOME SPOILERS***** If they had just made Meg Ryan's character die in another way, I mean after I saw that scene I thought it was sad, but then I realized it was her own darn fault! After she and Seth could finally be together, she has this little spiritual-one with nature thing where she's closing her eyes and sticking her arms out while.... riding a bike?! I mean out of all the times you pick to do that, you do that while riding your bike, while steering on the side of a cliff, and while in the middle of the road? And gee isn't it sad that she gets hit by that truck? I wonder how that happened?! And lo and behold her ex-angel boyfriend comes just in time to see her lying in the middle of the road, and holds her as she dies...How typical and stupid because of the way they did it. *****OKAY SPOILERS OVER***** I don't mean to over analyze this movie, and sorry to anyone who I've offended. If you enjoyed it because of it's good parts then great, but those are my thoughts on this film.</fullReview>

Meg Ryan was strong yet vunerable, and Dennis Frantz set aside his gruff NYPD Blue image to play a loving and amusing guide on Ms. Ryan's journey towards understanding.

		<fullReview>A super-natural fantasy love story with heart. This movie was well crafted in both Directing and script. Nic Cage's puppy dog eyes get a little old and Meg Ryan doesn't do too much to win us over but nevertheless we still manage to somehow care about what happens to these characters. A powerful soundtrack and a tear jerking ending help us love this movie even if the ending is somewhat predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, I found that Wings of Desire was a much better film, but you have to give this American film some credit. It did not end American, ie, Happily Everafter. Also liked that it spoke so unlike most Hollywood films in that in ways was a) not politically correct and b) did not propose again the theology of tolerance that forgets truth. The line where Seth says, "Some things are true whether you believe them or not." hits the mark. Agape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No words can describe the awfulness of this film. I watched with a friend, loaded with cups of coffee, and yet within thirty minutes we were out from the numerous awkward silences that lulled us to sleep. We snoozed until near to the end, but honestly think we didn't miss much. Nicholas Cage acts like a pre-Twilight Robert Pattinson. Creepy. He is so creepy. The way he obsesses over Maggie is quite unnerving and uncomfortable. He acts like a dumb puppy. The story line is predictable and disappointing, with the 'angels' always looking rather awkward and out-of-place. The characters were for the most part unlikable, though it has to be said that Meg Ryan was okay. She pretty. Overall, if you're the sort of person who likes soppy, lame romance or Twilight, watch it. If not, STAY AWAY. GOT IT? &gt;:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is worth falling for ,when u really want to hold the hands of Magi,feel her,touch her and really leave the eternity to just be with her. The theme was so wonderful that u really want to live with the characters and just hope to be one of them, that proves why man is afraid to die ,because he know that he will lose all the sensations for what human being is really crafted by the god, to live in pain leaving the eternity,but to feel love.The characters are excellently played,even the scores following were just letting you feel the theme and live with the characters. I really can't understand the harsh notes of critics and there sharp views but I can feel that this movie is worth falling for, even if you have to loose your eternity.This is my first comment on this site but I feel may be I delayed it only to give my first one to this one only.(24-12-05)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch this movie for the philosophy and emotion in it, you'll have a much higher chance of enjoying it. Forgive the unbelievable premise (existence of angels) and think of an extremely comfortable status quote that a man must renounce in order to be with a woman (if you need an example, think of a medieval prince in love with a peasant girl). Also overlook Meg not being spooked by a man who by all appearances is stalking her.Instead, enjoy the beautifully matched soundtrack: Sarah McLachlan ? Angel, and Goo Goo Dools ? Iris:And I'd give up forever to touch you / 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow [...] / And I don't want the world to see me / Cause I don't think that they'd understand / When everything's made to be broken / I just want you to know who I amMany have not appreciated the end of the movie. I saw three messages being conveyed:1. When you're about to drop everything and turn your life around in order to be with someone, understand the risks.2. If you decide to do it and it turns out bad, it can still be worth it. At the end of the movie, Seth/Nicolas Cage's angel friend Cassiel asks him, "If you knew what was going to happen, would you still have done it? Was it worth it?" He answered, "I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss from her mouth, one touch of her hand, than eternity without it. One.3. I think the ending has a very powerful meaning: Seth has lost literally everything. He is no longer an angel; he is a mortal, suffering from pain, hunger and despair. He lost the love of his life. He has no job, no home, no money.Yet he manages to pull himself out of mourning and depression, starts enjoying the simple things in life, and moves on, accepting his free-will choice of becoming a human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can accept the premise....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is watchable, at times. I agree with an earlier review, have not seen the Wenders movie, but this was certainly derivative of....something.Nicolas Cage as Seth (actually an angel, yes... don't grimace yet!). He delivers an okay performance which demands not very much of him, other than to seem mysterious.Meg Ryan in probably what is her last attempt at drama, her career from the 80's as Romantic Comedy Queen is long over.Dennis Franz is one of the cardiac patients (Ryan is a heart surgeon, Cage the Angel of death). This is meant to be light, religion and drama have no real bearing, if you can tolerate the premise it is watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can just see this film over and over and find new things in it that "GETS TO ME" every time. Some people find it "slow"...... do they listen to what is being said here? So many lines to think about..."Why do people cry?" "What does a pear taste like - to you?" It is a film like this that shows us, that everything is now going so fast that we miss the most important things in our relationships - listening to the other person and being together - when we are together.Like in the film "When Harry met Sally" you can find new things every time you see it. Yes,may be it is a " Womens film..." then be it...there is nothing wrong with that..is there? I love it..and I will go see it again - and again......and some of the time even with my husband...he likes it too, thank god!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. From the movies title, you can see it is based in the city and deals with angels.It takes place in Los Angeles, CA. Meg Ryan plays a doctor named Maggie. Nick Cage plays an Angel named Seth. He knows she is a doctor. She doesn't know he is an angel? When change happens what do you do? When life presents opportunities, what do you choose? Maggie and Seth have life changing decisions to make. Should he tell her about his true profession? Should he give up and walk away from her? It is similar to other movies like "just like heaven", and "Michael." What will come of their dreams, goals, and desires? This is a great love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All about love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find myself attracted to films that are somewhat predictable, but each and every time I still fall for the characters, for the storyline. This film, however, I fell for with the perception that it would be like any other romantic film. But it wasn't. The end threw me completely off balance and for one of the first times in a film, it shocked me. I thought the whole film was fantastic from start the finish. Meg Ryan always has been fantastic at doing romance films and this one is no exception. Her character is caring and loving and throughout nearly every moment you feel that love and care inside of her. Nicholas Cage portrayed the life of angel in such a way that made him seem unlike all the other angels. They were always there, whenever Seth was alone with Maggie, they were always with them too. But he looked for more than what they all had and he got it. Seth more than anyone knew that when your time is up, even if you don't want to leave, even if your family/friends don't want you to leave, you have to go...and his acceptance of the deal he was dealt after he fell was fantastic.The most memorable part for me is when Seth asks Cassiel if he took Maggie, then Cassiel asks him if he'd known, if he'd not chosen to fall. And he said: "I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss of her mouth, one touch of her hand, than an eternity without it." and that quote sums up the whole feel of the film. The need to be human, to feel the things that humans feel...the love that is there. Just love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of cinema's true treasures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been few films which have had such a touching story as 'City Of Angels'. With it's haunting music, lovely and tragic story, wonderful acting, and beautiful filming, 'City Of Angels' may just be one of the best films made in this past 20 years.The purity of Seth's love for Maggie was something I think everyone wishes they could have, even if it'd only be briefly there once in their lives. For Seth to give up eternity just to be with Maggie one time was just beautiful, even though it was really sad.The filming for this was wonderful. I absolutely love how it was shot; the angles, the lighting, the colors, the locations, everything was perfect in portraying the story and bringing out the real beauty within this film.I think a lot of people will agree with me when I say that the music really worked in 'City Of Angels'. "Iris" by Goo Goo Dolls and "Angel" by Sarah McLachlan were some of the main highlights, but even the instrumental music was breath-takingly beautiful. The soundtrack for 'City Of Angels' is one of those movie soundtracks that everyone should just get, it's wonderful and really worth a listen.All I can really say about 'City Of Angels' is that it's got one of the best stories, best filming, and best music in any movie from the past 20 years. This movie will have you wanting to watch it over and over, despite how sad it is. It's just too good to not enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not much of a sucker for waff or the sort, but I couldn't help but check this out, being a believer in these kinds of things. Although the plot was rather predictable (specially the ending, where she dies), I pretty much enjoyed the execution. Probably my favorite aspect of this is that the angels weren't your stereotype dudes in white robes and wings and stuff. The black coats were awesome. And the sunrise/sunset at the beach gatherings where they listen to celestial music give the impression that these guys are really devoted to their work. The scenes with Franz were my personal favorite. He was the bridge, so to speak, between Cage and Ryan's characters. The irony of the end was what really got to me. I love irony. So yeah... this one gets a 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I've watched the movie, I thought on the rating on IMDb and decided to make a comment. This is a story about a angel called Seth (Nicholas Cage)? And one day, he fell in love with Maggie (Meg Ryan), a doctor that wonders about the control between life and death. Would Seth forsake his immortality and become human ? to spend a life with Maggie. I recommend this movie because it shows a "touch" stronger than immortality. Would you wonder if there were angels around us deciding our destiny of life and death? This is completely underrated (I could bet how many fools vote on this site just for fun and don't take seriously that there are other people who are interested in films, and the ARE some people who like films but not all). Does anybody remember a movie made about angels in that way that a audience has never expressed before (maybe Ghost, he won two academy awards.) This movie for me, deserves at least 7.2 rating, because of the imagination and the beauty that life can have than immortality. Great acting, soundtrack terrific, the story ? wonderful. I recommend this movie to everyone who still believe that we are not alone (no U.F.O stuff) who walk among us, and wishing to fell?8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one film I wouldn't normally watch but being a fan of Nicolas Cage I decided to give it a chance. This is one of the most moving flicks I have ever seen and anyone with a heart would find this movie one of the most emotional.Based on Wim Wenders 'Wings of Desire', C.O.A. follows the story of an angel called Seth (Nic Cage) who falls in love with a heart surgeon Maggie (Meg Ryan). When she loses one of her patients, she finds it difficult to accept. During the failed op, Seth appears and Maggie looks right at him. This is when Seth falls for her and decides to make himself and his feelings known to her.There are some scenes that people would say that has happened to them on an emotional level, ie feeling of hurt due to rejection, losing someone close to you unexpectedly, knowing that there's a chance you can never be with someone you feel something for.Performance wise, there are two standout characters in the film. Nic Cage as Seth, who is soft and sympathetic and who you can genuinely feel for and the other is Dennis Franz who has some great secret.This movie is an emotional ride and is a great one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the movie. It's a nice tale, the fall of an angel, giving up immortality for love (no matter how brief that love may be).I leave it for the critics to say whether the actors were good, how was the plot and all that, but for my part, it is one of the most nicest movies I've seen. I advise you see it also. And if the story is not interesting enough, the two actors should make time pass more quickly. For my part, both actors were very credible (I found their acting very good and deep), and made the story seem more real, however fantastic it may seem. Another plus: great soundtrack. Gabriel Yared's songs are simply wonderful. Trust me, you will not regret seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tough movie to review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review is gonna be kind of odd. I didn't like this. In fact I didn't like it SO much I turned it off and never did see the whole thing. NOW-I am gonna RECOMMEND it to everyone. Confusing but-I recognized the superior quality of the film and frankly my dislike of it was my own personal taste and mood of the moment rather then anything about the film.Here are the negatives that turned me off about it: It was depressing and a tearjerker but I (love) dark movies and usually have no problem with depressing films. My problem with this is (WARNING-SPOILERS-DON'T READ ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW THE ENDING.)I already knew the story so I knew how it was gonna end. The whole element thorugh the film was sad and there weren't to many moments that WEREN'T sad. It is a tough movie to watch if your not in a good mood. However even when I turned it off I felt bad for doing so because it is a very beautiful movie, Meg Ryan(who I am definetly NOT a fan of) actually was good here and Nicholes Cage is just amazing-perfectly cast as the angel-his eyes in this movie say more about soulfullness then any dialogue needs to do.Although this is a movie I had a VERY hard time with(and I don't have a hrd time with many) I would recommend it-even though it was not for me. After all I'm reviewing the film, not my own personal tastes. The more you are into tearjerker love stories(think "Ghost") and movies about Angels and the better mood you are in when you watch this will add to your quality of enjoyment of it. AGAIN-I don't have a bad thing to say about this. I can't pretend to like it myself but think many would and would recommend it fervently even though I didn't get past half of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very interesting and enjoyable movie. I chose it because I like Nick Cage (and almost didn't 'cause I'm not big on Meg Ryan). It reminds me of a host of old B&amp;W movies I saw as a kid, but modernized and better done. I am surprised that no Commentors mentioned "The Bishop's Wife" (or its pale remake, "The Preacher's Wife"). Cage does a great job as an angel suddenly taken with a mortal woman. Ryan holds her own, but never really really engenders the kind of woman one would give up an eternally sublime existence for.SPOILER ALERT! Minor concerns:As an angel, being in the death business, would Seth not have some inkling that Maggie was not long for this world? And why are the angels so poorly dressed? I rarely see foreign films and tire of folks always insisting they are better than the American product. Take a look at this product, which is slick and professional, and elicits all the audience emotion it sets out to, with a cast that excel in their craft and beautiful cinematography and scoring. A good way to spend two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's amazing how frequently viewers confuse the romance with the message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems most of the peopole who commented on the movie were only aware of the romance and the tragedy of the Doctors death. The romance itself and the tragic situation were insignificant minutiae in this movie. The meat -- if you like to find a deep thought in you entertainment -- was in the fact that both Seth and Messenger made the choice to EXPERIENCE!! I can tell you from personal history that it's much easier to be uninvolved and "outside" when you can blame it on your state of being. It's difficult to make the choice to CHANGE YOUR STATE OF BEING. It's even more difficult (heck, harder than winning a gold medal you've trained for all your life) to actually overcome the circumstances that impose separateness upon you and join a society in which you have no family, support, contacts, or history. The nobility of choosing an uncertain existence in LIFE over the emotionless, safe, untouchability of being an Angel is extreme. To then overcome the all too human response to the sudden loss of the love you used as an excuse for taking the step is only evidence of strong character. The first step in becoming mortal ennobled Seth far beyond the ability of tragedy or heroism to augment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meg Ryan stars as Maggie, a cardiac surgeon who loses a patient on the operating table, and can't stop blaming herself for what happened. Nicolas Cage is Seth, an angel sent to take the patient to the other side, and when he sees Maggie, he immediately falls in love with her. The first problem I have is Maggie falling apart when she loses her patient. I have the impression that doctors loose so many patients over the course of their career that it's virtually impossible to become so emotional after loosing a patient. Angels, as it turns out, are everywhere. Right now, in your room (or office, or wherever) as you read this, there is an angel looking over your shoulder. Kind of a scary thought, but at the same time a somewhat comforting thought as well. But you can't see them, unless they want to be seen, or unless you're a child. Seth makes himself known to Maggie, but doesn't tell her he's an angel. She falls for him just as hard as he's fallen for her. They want to be together, and there is one way, but it would cost Seth his proverbial wings. The biggest problem with the movie is that it's overly predictable. You knew from the very beginning what was going to happen, and if you thought about it, you knew how it was going to end. But the best part of the movie was the heart and emotion that went into it. You could see true love between Maggie and Seth because Cage and Ryan are two incredible actors. Every character in the film served a purpose, and did a great job. Dennis Franz (who I've seen for the first time not being a cop) plays a fallen angel who truly acts as if he loves the life he's chosen, while you can still see some sorrow at the life he left behind. Andre Braugher plays an angel who's friends with Seth. He sees what Seth wants, and is there to help him in any way possible. I really liked the performances and the feel of the movie. But because of the predictability, it wasn't as moving as maybe it should have been. Still, what this movie is, is a good love story that really makes you treasure what you have. It makes you realize that every day could be your last, and that you have to live life to the fullest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of Angels is the essence of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of Angels"Did you ever get the feeling that there's something bigger out there, bigger than you?"'City of Angels' is about an angel who 'falls' in love with a 'human', but is bigger than that. Director Brad Silberling creates a movie about the essence of life. His tools are Academy Award winning director of photography, John Seale and composer Gaberial Yared to score the movie. Enhancing this movie are two American icons, Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan and a Grammy rich soundtrack which features; Alanis Morrissette (Uninvited), Sarah McLachlan (Angel),Paula Cole (Feelin' Love), Jimi Hendrix (Red House) and the Goo Goo Dolls (Iris).The celestial love story begins when Seth, Nicolas Cage, the angel, comes to claim the life of a heart patient. Maggie Rice, Meg Ryan, is the patient's doctor. The result of this loss to Maggie is devastating. She begins to question life itself, "We fight for people's lives...don't you ever wonder who it is we're fighting with?" Witnessing her heartache, Seth tries to comfort, console and heel Maggie, but he too begins to question things. "She looked right at me." He tells his friend Casiel. Leading us to believe he sees more in Maggie than her pain.Lovely lines of dialog exchange between Seth and Maggie throughout the movie, but few more powerful than their first meeting."Are you a visitor?"says Maggie. "Yes." "Well, visiting hours are over." "Why do they have that?" Seth asks. "What? Hours?" "Doesn't it help the patient to be visited?" "Are you in despair?"Seth. "I lost a patient." "You did everything you could?" "People die." Seth "Not on my table." "People die when their bodies give out." "It's my job to keep them from giving out, or what am I doing here?""It wasn't your fault, Maggie." "I wanted him to live!" "He is living, just not the way that you think."In Seth's attempt to help Maggie he creates a confusing mess of feelings for her and himself. No spoilers here, but this love story makes us think and wonder. 'City of Angels' is complete and feels like home. Like many things in life that we take for granted... Seth discovers, a sigh, a flower, blood, love and breath. Like a child they are all new to him and they are, for a brief moment, new to us as well.Also, like much of life we are always searching and questioning. Seth believes he has found love and has to choose between God, and Life as a mortal. What are your soul searching questions? This movie makes you ask yourself that question.Through powerfully tuned cinematography and a deeply moving score, City of Angels, the film, is allowed to whisper in your ear. Listen to the rich dialog, harmonious character interaction and robust story telling. It does it with wit and charm. Once seen and heard you will never forget it.This brings to mind what I believe sums up 'City of Angels' to me, emotion means the movement of the mind brought on by something which affects it..."Your mind and your feelings become to powerful and you just can't contain it...and your body weeps."I was affected and I wept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film opens with Maggie Rice, a gifted surgeon, losing a patient on the operating table. Seth, an Angel, has been sent to collect his sole. He sees her suffering and trys to comfort her, he even makes himself visible to her. They begin to fall in love. All seems well, in this burgeoning romance until she discovers what Seth is. She believes that science has the answer to everything. Eventually she learns from Nathaniel Messenger, a patient of hers, who was once an Angel himself, until he feel in love with a mortal, that Seth can become mortal and that he loves her enough to forsake his immortal life for her. She ends the relationship, however, Seth gives-up his immortal life for her. They have one night together and the next day, on the way back from town she is killed. Seth is there just before she dies.This is a very intense film that needs to be viewed more than once to understand it but the message it delivers is all the better for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the feel of an old time romantic classic, yet moves to the heartbeat of modern tunes and times. Nick Cage is spellbinding in his portrayal of Seth, a heavenly messenger clad in black overcoat, who witnesses the passion of Maggie, a heart surgeon, in her fight to save the life of one of his daily celestial arrivals. In watching her life from afar, he falls in love. Silberling's directing brings us into the angel's world of observation -- sitting on skyscrapers, "listening" to the dawn, hearing the thoughts of people in the library -- only to bring us back to our own world with a whole new perspective in mind. With songs by Paula Cole, Peter Gabriel, Alanis Morisette, and a heartwrenching score by Gabriel Yared, City of Angels moves us, seamlessly, from emotion to emotion. Bottom line: This is what romantic movies are all about.</fullReview>

Cage, as always, does a great job in every role he plays.This film had a great premise and it played out beautifully until the end when, well, those of you have seen it know so I will not give it away. I will say that the ending is unnecessarily heartbreaking and truly seems tacked on just to make the audience cry. I know some will think it is a life lesson for Cage's character, but I saw it as needless tear jerking. Besides this, however, a wonderful, though somewhat cold, film on many different levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes it isn't a movie itself that can bring forth deep feeling from within one's heart, but just the IDEA of a movie that can evoke that type of feeling, love, and passion. For me, one who has lost someone that he loves, the IDEA of this movie - that they go on; that they feel no pain; that they, at the very end, have no fear, is one that I'm sure many don't believe or don't even care to think about. However, there are some of us that do think of such things and although the ideas in this movie and in the original "Wings of Desire" don't correspond to any one faith or religion - more an conglomeration of a few ideas from the Judeo-Christian belief system. For those of us that do believe in God and aren't afraid of making that idea "public", no matter what the faith, this movie gives a reminder to all of us that perhaps there is something more, both in this life and whatever may come after it, to look for, search for, and to perhaps find answers for...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been told to be careful watching this one. A good friend said to me "Kristen, you're gonna cry...for weeks." Meg Ryan as Maggie, the mildly self-absorbed heart surgeon, faces the ever prominent question.."What are we here for?", when she loses a patient and "sees" Seth (Nicolas Cage), the angel who's come to take him "home". Suddenly Maggie is faced with her own mortality and her self confidence is shattered. On the flipside, Seth, and angel who keeps a journal about "humans", is faced with desires he never gave thought to before. The desire for Maggie to "see" him, and more importantly...to experience touch and love. Dennis Franz as the appropriately named, Mr. Messenger, is the one who explains to Seth his ability to choose. Franz is great in this role and gives this film several lighthearted moments....including a fine fanny shot at the beach. This movie is profoundly deep and thoughts of life choices, what would have been's, and grief will sit with you for quite awhile. I truly recommend this movie to all...men included.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of Angels" is much easier to watch than "Wings of Desire." Most Americans cannot deal with the deep emotions and philosophical aspects of "Wings of Desire" -- at least not in a movie that is supposed to entertain. But since "City of Angels" was made for American audiences, it is lighter, brighter, and more accessible.The love story between Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage is engaging if not totally believable. But how believable can this story be, anyway? Let's all play "willing suspension of disbelief" and let the story tell itself. Other reviewers have commented on the beautiful cinematography, and superb acting. In particular I enjoyed the soundtrack which I think adds a lot to the movie.The ending was sad, yes. But it was a good story, a good cry. It didn't ask too much from me. It was easy to watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

It's meant, I think, as a sweet love story marvelling at the power of love and life, and how precious both can be. A little fantasy, some beautiful scenes, and odd perspectives are all part of the package. And, let's face it, some of the scenes (sunrise on the beach!) were simply beautiful. The acting was good if not spectacular. I wondered how such a deep love sprang from such a short acquaintance, but I think it goes back to the movie's premise of taking extraordinary things into consideration - nothing is impossible! All in all, a lovely movie, great for watching with your special someone, not for pondering over while you contemplate life. (the wonderful soundtrack is a plus, too!)</fullReview>

Not to be offensive, but the black man who played in the movie, at times you could hardly make out who he was, because the movie was so dark. With all the Angels dressed in black, they looked evil, they should have been dressed in white. Meg Ryan was beautiful, as always. But I think her acting abilities are far more better than this movie called for. It got so boring (and dark) at times, I fell asleep.

And I have this obsession with angels, so I loved the little tidbits of information the screenwriter wrote in (ie meeting at sunrise and sunset on the beach), and I even bought the soundtrack before I saw the movie (great track, by the way; after seeing the movie, I understand the lyrics to Iris perfectly). And while it could be considered slow at times, I think it was worth it. The ending wasn't what I expected, and although it wasn't the perfect ending, in a way, it fit the movie perfectly. You don't know what's gonna happen until about 2 minutes before it actually does, and that's only if you're thinking about it. The cinematography was great, the sets were amazing...all in all, I liked the movie a lot. But that's just me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Movies always seem to be a popular theme. This angel flick is about an angel named Seth. He falls for women named Maggie Rice, immortals falling for mortals is another theme thought a number of times. The problem with the relationship between Seth and Maggie is that Maggie is getting married to another doctor named Robert. To get her he gets the help of an ex-angel and must test his will. The movie is interesting, kind of stylish, and also tacky plus boring but ok. I give this movie 3 1/2 out of 5. Rated PG.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Hollywoodization of the German "Wings of Desire" improves on the original in a few ways (at least the leading lady isn't boringly existence in this one), but misses the mark in others. Both films are about an angel who falls in love with a mortal woman and gives up his divine status for her. Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are quite good (his face is becoming one of the wonders of the screen), but several things take on a Hollywood overstatement. I missed the luscious black and white photography of the original and the subtle way Ganz fell to earth. And if you're over the emotional age of 14, you might want to turn the thing off about ten minutes before the big dramatic ending.</fullReview>

It isn't so bad.If you view it as a remake of "Wings", it's like imagining Pauly Shore as Iago. But if you just accept the fact that it used the same general context to spin a romantic comedy, it is an enjoyable watch.

		<fullReview>The worst. This would be bad enough if it were just a travesty of Wim Wender's masterpiece (which it is) but it goes way beyond that. When will Hollywood learn to leave well enough alone? The answer is probably never. It starts out OK and for about 10 minutes is a fair approximation of the Wenders film and very off-the-wall for a mainstream American film. Then Meg Ryan cycles into view with her dimpled smile as, God forbid, a surgeon and from then on it's all downhill to the grave.At times it is very weird indeed. The angels in their long black coats hanging around the beach at dawn look like vampires or zombies. Nicholas Cage as an angel determined to fall plays his part like a somnambulist or more appropriately someone who has recently flown over the cuckoo's nest. Nevertheless, Meg finds him cute. His is a very bad performance but this is a movie nobody could save. Angels everywhere take heed, avoid Los Angeles like the plague and get back to Berlin as fast as your wings can carry you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of AngelsAngels coming down to Earth is nothing new. We've seen it before in `It's a Wonderful Life,' `Clarence,' `Michael'?Now, another angel-on-earth movie has been made; it is about surgeon Meg Ryan and angel Nicolas Cage falling in love (blah).Meg Ryan plays Maggie, a successful surgeon with a life that she doesn't know can get any better or worse; Nicolas Cage plays `Seth Plate,' a fallen angel who, once he starts to fall in love with Maggie, seriously thinks about giving up his angel powers to become human, like Dennis Franz's character in the film.The problem with this movie is that it can't help but fall into the supernatural-romance clichés, or any romantic clichés, at that. We know what's going to happen, and the film drags it out until we are asleep.First of all, the movie is way-y-y too long for its own good; the dialogue is nothing rich, the characters never have any kind of real development, and?well?that all leads to a boring story.Nic Cage gives a good performance, but it seemed a bit watered down ? more than usual. His expressions are typical Cage; lifeless, like a statue: but I don't mind that, because I happen to think Nicolas Cage is a good actor. He might seem dull to some, but I think that he has a `boring talent,' as in he's very normal. He plays very average characters, and seems much more human in most of his roles than some of the action heroes on the scene. Perhaps that's why his performance as something supernatural didn't quite fit like a glove. However, I still think he was a good choice for the character; no one can tell me he wasn't good when he was discovering what humans feel, how things taste, etc?Meg Ryan is her typical-self. The high-pitched voice, the short-cut hair, the cutesy-tutesy looks that remind of us a child. No one can hate her. Plus, she's a good actress, if a bit repetitive in her acting (her characters often seem the same; I think that's just because she either likes to play those characters, or can't act as other characters. I'm not sure)? I think her best role was in `Sleepless in Seattle,' and her character is very much the same her: very down-to-earth, yet dreaming of very romantic fantasies: hoping for `true love' and so on and so forth. She was a good choice for the character.Dennis Franz has a small role as an angel-turned-human, and he handles the role well; he is believable, likeable and completely forgettable (sorry, Franz).Overall, `City of Angels' runs a bit too much on the corny, clichéd side than on the original side, making it almost as forgettable as Ben Affleck's haircut in `Daredevil.'2/5 stars ?John Ulmer</fullReview>

It's hard to believe Meg's character would fall for Seth so quickly. Seems more like a stalker than a potential mate. Then just as it seems everything would come to a nice romantic ending, boom, yer brought back down to earth. The film doesn't know if it wants to be a romantic comedy, or drama. It seems as though it's goal was to make you contemplate the value of life, and life after death.

		<fullReview>I own Wings of Desire and let me tell you you cannot compare those two movies.In Wings of Desire you can feel everything the characters feels.In city of Angels you are left with an hunger for more with Meg Ryan character.I like Meg a lot she is beautiful and a good actrice but she never finish her work properly.In this film she does it again,when Nicholas Cage is behind her and caressing her you know what he is doing but the only thing you see is Meg face and the love scene is worst all during the love scene what you see is two close-up of Meg and Nicholas.Again he is caressing Meg but the close-up are so close you don't know what the hell is he touching.It took me three viewing of this scene to find out it was her tommy.Meg is too clean and proper to make a good love scene.Since she does not do nudity I knew I would be left with something missing and I was and yet this movie is good for Meg Ryan fans.She is lovely but to make a movie like this she needed to make us feel what she feels when being touch by Nicholas but it is not there.My mistake was too see Wings of desire.In Wings when the woman is touch by the angel you see her touch you can almost feel the sensations she feels,that's what Meg is missing.You need to see when where and how she is being touch but Meg is more worry about her nudity on screen and that's too bad.This movie needed somebody who could'nt careless about nudity but give us a complete range of emotions that include a little bit of nudity.Make you feel what she feels.If you are a fan Meg Ryan for her face this is the right movie if not you will feel you are missing a full range of emotions except maybe feeling sorry for the angel.This movie should had been a T.V. movie all the main emotions are missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now then, I didn't LOVE this movie, although my summary might suggest that I did. There are numerous films that I have seen that are much more enjoyable than this one. However, there was something about this film that was captivating. It was leisurely paced, yet it was by no means slow. There were times when there was no dialogue, and yet they were often the most intriguing moments. The soundtrack was especially memorable as well. I have to admit that I tend to prefer films that are more tense or comedic than this, and perhaps that's why I don't rate this film even higher, but it did tug at my heartstrings a little, and not many films are able to do that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the movie very inspiring. I am affected by a very serious illness and this movie made me look at my life in a whole new light. It made me see that it's worth living, for however brief a period of time and despite everything, despite pain, misery, loneliness, illnesses, and that you leave a mark when you live, perhaps a mark only seen by those who truly love you, but a very powerful mark all the same. Futile things like photography, soundtrack, effects of the movie are overcome by its strong message: to live, to love someone, to feel is always worth it, even if it's just for once. Shame on those who waste it on useless lives. 'Some things are true whether you believe in them or not'! The beauty of life is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had promise, but it failed to deliver. This was a cheap corporate American remake of a European classic. Its images lacked any kind of feeling, and the film lacked any kind of depth of field. The badly developed characters fade in comparison to those of the original 1986 German film. The big-name actors kill the original images of a dreamy naive world, the pathetic later half deserves no comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic, heartbreaking &amp; dream like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard very mixed reviews about this film before I watched it, but I was pleasantly surprised. There's something about films that deal with unconditional, innocent love that really inspire people. I suppose its the age old question of whether there really is that perfect someone "the one " for everybody. Whether there is or not doesn't really matter, but films like this can make us believe for a couple of hours that it might be possible. This film is a mixture of fantasy, drama and romance with two charismatic leads to guide us through the picture. The cinematography is breathtaking, especially the sunrise and sunset meeting of angels. Naturally it has all been done before, using different characters, but the essential ingredients are the same. The whole package was so well put together that it really has a lasting impression on the viewer. As always Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan are excellent. The portrayal of the angels was very well done, and in their unconventionality the angels became almost real. This really is a lovely film, but its not for everyone- if your not a romantic at heart stay well clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me declare first that in case you have seen the German film "Wings of Desire" please don't try to compare "City of Angels" with that one. Let's consider it an altogether independent movie. Well to tell the truth, the story is very much enjoyable. But it is quite hard to understand the inner meaning properly, what lies beneath the allegorical concept of the angels here. You try hard to understand and ultimately come up with this result -- "Well there is something beautiful, something very thoughtful underneath, but I just can't get it." And this very realisation would urge you to love this movie so much!Coming to the acting performances, you should admit both Cage and Ryan offered a fairly good acting. There are some places where Cage's acting appeared a bit artificial but they are very few compared to his most screen time throughout the film. He was never quite good at romantic emotional sequences but here he managed well. And in this typical Meg Ryan role, sweet, cool and jolly, she did a very well performance, probably one of her bests. Here portraying Seth's mortal attraction, Maggie, as a doctor but not an acrobat as in "Wings of Desire" is a very positive and beneficial move by the director Silberling. Dennis Franz, well, did not come out as much.The screenplay particularly is very good. The conversations between Maggie and Seth are well-written. There is a distinct tenderness all over the film that makes it very different from similar others. You would never miss the song "Iris" in this tender respect and the song was quite finely timed in the movie. To me, Silberling did a nice job. Presenting an already told story in a most original format is not very easy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is far and away the best performance that Cage has ever given on screen. Ryan delivers her lines without really lighting up the screen. Certainly she doesn't give the sort of performance that convinces me that she is worth giving up immortality for but not much more is asked of her so she at least get's pass marks.However, they are both a pale shadow against Braugher who's delivery is out-of-this-world. Whenever I watch this film I wonder why it wasn't a smash hit. The angels walking amongst the population is as pure an artistic delivery as I have seen on film. Unfortunately, by the end of the film it is all too clear why the box office didn't bite. It is just too depressing throughout.</fullReview>

I gaved to this movie strong 8, because in it's category it was a good movie, the scenario was not bad, the performance of actors was good, and there's no much useless scenes. The minus of this film is showing Nicolas Cage character infantile. I don't know is this was a directors idea, but from where he knows that all angels must be infantile? And Meg Ryan sometimes seemed too cold, but maybe it's just my imagination. Good watching of this beautiful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of Wim Wenders' 1987 cult German film Wings of Desire 'Der Himmel über Berlin', 'City Of Angels' is a wonderful story, about love, hope &amp; freedom. Brad Silberling has directed the film brilliantly! 'City Of Angels' is about believe and disbelief. It's about Love and it's Meaning. The Angels are harmless, the Humans are, conveys the film silently in those 114 minutes. If there is anything that gives away in an otherwise terrific film, is its slow-packing. The pace, especially in the beginning, is completely missing.As mentioned, Brad Silberling has handled the subject brilliantly. He's At the Top of his creativity over here. Cinematography by John Seale, is picture-perfect. The Adapted Screenplay is a wonder.Performance-Wise: Nicolas Cage is highly competent. He plays the central part with maturity. Meg Ryan is superb, yet again. A splendid performer! Dennis Franz leaves a strong impression. Andre Braugher is nice.On the whole, A Must Watch Film. A Genuine, Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the strong themes of guardian angels, which is a hotly debated biblical topic, this film is very humanistic. Brad Silberling's film focuses on themes of goodness and purity, ignoring evil and corruption. Credit the director with keeping the film from becoming predictable and sloppy.Nicholas Cage is very well cast and does a good job with his compassionate angel. Even better is Meg Ryan playing a frustrated, highly talented surgeon who cannot understand why she is losing patients on the operating table. It was great to see Meg playing a character with a little more depth.Saturday, March 20, 1999 - Astor Theatre StKilda</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of Angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might have tried this film for ten minutes, and given up quite quickly, but I was willing to give it a second chance, I suppose it wasn't a bad decision, from director Brad Silbering (Casper, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events). Basically angels are living all over the world, well, in this case in Los Angeles, watching over every move we make, being felt only as an invisible presence that occasionally influences us. Seth (Nicolas Cage) is an angel watching over a particular human, heart surgeon Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) who believes she must save the lives of all her patients. Angels can make themselves visible when it is really necessary, and Seth uses that to his advantage to intrigue Maggie with his opinions and presence, if only it was true physicality. Seth knows he is in love with Maggie, and he sticks very close to her, and it is only after realising he can't be harmed that Maggie shuts him out. Along the way, Seth meets Maggie's patient Nathaniel Messinger (Die Hard 2: Die Harder's Dennis Franz), once an angel himself but gave up his powers and immortality to become human for a woman himself, and he knows Seth wants the same. So Seth goes through the process to become human, and Maggie does let him back into her life, and they do finally get together physically. But then Maggie is taken away from Seth with a tragic accident, and he wonders if he is being punished by God, but he realises this is the humanity he has entered himself into, and he has to embrace it. Also starring Poseidon's André Braugher as Cassiel, Face/Off's Colm Feore as Jordan Ferris, Robin Bartlett as Anne, Joanna Merlin as Teresa Messinger, Sarah Dampf as Susan, Rhonda Dotson as Susan's Mother and Nigel Gibbs as Doctor. I can see what the critics mean by the soundtrack, songs like "Iris" by The Goo Goo Dolls and the Golden Globe nominated "Uninvited" by Alanis Morissette, making the film a little less slushy. Cage is pretty good, and Ryan is alright too, and Franz makes an impact in his time on screen, this may be a true chick flick to be concerned with liking, but at the same time it isn't a bad one. Worth watching!</fullReview>

It makes LA look gorgeous, no mean feat, with the soaring camera-work and slow pace of life not usually associated with that city. Nic Cage and Meg Ryan have wonderful chemistry, vital to the story and even though I know what is coming I just can't turn it off. And let's not forget Dennis Franz in the role originally played by Peter Falk and Andre Breugher as the almost cynical Heavenly Being. Music in the sunrise, what an amazing concept.

		<shortDescription>Unexpected love. One of Meg Ryan's better performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meg Ryan. For a while Ms. Ryan was the number one female movie star and in this movie she is at her best. She carries this movie, makes this movie not only watchable but enjoyable as her character goes on an emotional roller coaster ride, at times crying, other times consumed with joy as she struggles with life issues. Nicholas Cage plays a great straight man to Ms. Ryan and demonstrates a talent for maintaining a deadpan expression during even the most fantastic and intimate scenes, but this is Ms Ryan's movie and she makes the most of it. The story itself is somewhat contrived and at times becomes overtly sentimental as the two main characters reach out to each other, one believing that she is alone, the other trying to make a connection. Yet the movie successfully avoids corniness and maintains an even keel as she plies through the waves of emotion. Oh love, what a joy, made even more sweet when it happens unexpected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be, on the surface, a touching love story (although the premise of an angel and human falling in love is absurd). The movie is quite capable of evoking emotion. I think what touched me most is to be reminded that we are surrounded by angels. It's not something I am conscious to think about, although I've always believed it.I think it is a visually beautiful movie for the scenery and the music (especially the song IRIS). Meg Ryan is challenged to step outside her usual romantic comedy type, but seems to handle the drama quite adequately. I'm not a big Nick Cage fan - but he does well enough here. He just seems a little dopey and unromantic to me. But he can certainly act.There is a definite tear-jerker ending so have those tissues handy.</fullReview>

The hardest for any actor to do is to "NOT GIVE" any expressions at all in a movie, and that's exactly what Cage has done.. Bravo! Meg Ryan's work was also pretty good, but Nicholas Cage was exceptional. The movie redeems itself as it gets closer to a very predictable yet entertaining climax, indeed it is a very good attempt and is quite underrated in my opinion. Movies like these do not come out everyday and that is what matters. Just like, Meet Joe Black, I mean sort of like that..

		<fullReview>This movie was really amazing. I'm a sucker for romances and although I thought it was extremely weird that Meg Ryan (Maggie) would just let a complete stranger into her life the way she did, you get the sense that it was just the pure magic of Nicolas Cage (Seth) that drew her to him. The music is sincerely angelic (especially 'I Grieve' by Peter Gabriel which fit right into the situation.) Like I stated, it was weird to see Maggie just trust someone so easily but you just got the sense that Seth was so perfect that she couldn't resist him. I think the beginning was drawn out a bit too much; not very much though.However, only probably the last 15-20 minutes you see the two together and you just wish you could see much more because of the electricity between them. I hated the ending. It was more disappointing to me rather than depressing. You are delivered this amazing movie and then the ending just screws it up for you.If you love love stories and want your heartstrings to be wrenched enough that they can be tied around the moon two times, watch this movie. It's amazing. It's like two hours of pure poetry from how they fell in love to the very end. The music helps move everything along.It's definitely beautiful and heartwrenching at the same time.</fullReview>

The movie over all has a really clean look and feel to it that I think really added to the film. Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage have great chemistry between each other in this film, and it's absolutely one of the best performances that you will see out of these two. The movie has a great story which is just the selling point of this film, I don't want to give anything away so I'm trying to stay vague, but it's defiantly a must see movie. All I can hope is that you will go out and at least rent the movie, and just give it a chance and I promise you will not be disappointed. Plain and simple it's a great movie, go get it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of my absolute favorite movies. It's so emotional and always makes me cry whenever I watch it. I just love it. Nicholas Cage is a wonderful actor, and his expressions really show what he's feeling. The way you can just look at him and understand what he's thinking goes perfect with the movie, since a lot of it gets to the heart.Even though it's a sad film, it somehow makes me feel good, it kind of makes me believe in love on a whole new level. I think it's a very deep and sentimental movie, and even has some humor in it to relieve the sadness. Honestly I think it is an incredible movie, and the soundtrack is amazing, it has all the emotion in it that the movie does. I think there should be more movies with this much feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the Cynicism, this film is truly brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers*I feel people have been far too harsh on this film. I watched it a little while ago, on my own, and was in tears by the end. It is a very beautiful film, and Nicolas Cage is incredibly moving as Seth, the angel - he may not be a total 'wow-he's-gorgeous', but something about the way he conveyed the character...As I said in my summary, people should forget the cynicism. I personally think that you adults are far too easy to put your own judgements on things! True this film is not perfect - and maybe Cage has had better roles, I don't know - but it speaks of things most directors would be scared to approach - of angels, and the afterlife. And I don't like to put a film down, personally - because *I've* never tried directing, acting in, editing, or soundtracking a film. The people who do such things have incredible talent and also put a great deal of time and energy into it. A brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hi,I love this film and I've seen it several times, I have to say that I like it so much probably because of the period that I watched it, so all of the scenes and all of the songs reminds me about something special, like friendship and trouble connected with it.I like the atmosphere and the choice that Seth has to do, I think that we all, sooner or later, have to face up to some big issue.What I like the most of this film is the soundtrack, I am a huge fan of Sarah Mclachlan and Paula Cole, I think that their music and voice melt with the film giving to it even a deeper meaning.The whole film is for me a kind of sampler of emotions and feelings and every time that I watch it old memories come to the surface.</fullReview>

Now for the key Dialogue Dennis Franz-'Free-will' (philosophical term-look it up) Nicolas Cage- "I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss of her mouth, one touch of her hand, than an eternity without it...one."There are more lines, but you watch the movie and judge for yourself?Let yourself go with the flow and don't be too judgemental at the ending.Great theater--movies can be just that when they make you have a 'willing suspension of disbelief'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***Spoiler*** gives you a desire for life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it in the cinema and watched it again last night on DVD - it remains one of the greatest movies I saw. I kept thinking about it even the following days (how many so called blockbusters from Hollywood actually stick in your mind more than 1 hour after the end of the movie??). What makes it so great? First of all the story and the bottom line: life is great. Even if there is pain and heartache in life, it is part of it - and it makes all the enjoyable moments even greater. So the key-question to me is at the end of the movie, when the other angel asks: was it all worth it? and Seth answers: even for one kiss, one touch of her hair it was worth to leave eternity for that. So....I left the cinema (and yesterday my couch) happy, encouraged, with a desire to face the tasks life offers me, and actually to LIVE. What a movie!</fullReview>

Every time you see this movie it becomes better and better!The love that is born in this movie is beautiful and sad, which makes this movie a tear jerker and the love story of the century.

		<fullReview>First of all I'm a crier - the slightest sad thing in movies makes me cry so if your like me then you'll need a BIG box of tissues and a bin handy before you start watching this film. Never in my life have i seen such a heart warming and touching story. The naivety of Seth makes him instantly lovable, like the monster in Frankenstein he goes into the world unprepared being treated as an adult when he is just a child. He has no social awareness, no experience of everything that we take for granted. To feel something in a way only we can truly interpret and taste and smell - he has none of this. And the irony at the end is heartbreaking. It is a true message to live every single day to the full and try to remember as much as you can right down to the smallest detail about everything which has at one point in your life meant something to you. Because every moment is one we are never gonna get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what an angel can make for love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like this film, I simply love it. It is wonderful. Meg Ryan makes a fantastic role. The central theme of the film is a little bit imaginary, but it makes me think that there is someone protecting us, like a guardian angel as Nicolas Cage's role. Why don't think angels exist and they are around us? If they exist, they can give us love as human beings.I think this film is similar to 'What dreams may come true'. The main theme is all you can make for someone you love so much although you risk your own life. One of the scenes more significant of the film is when Seth (Nicolas Cage) after Maggie's (Meg Ryan) death says: 'I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss from her mouth, one touch of her hand than eternity without it.' Here, Seth show us that things aren't unworthy if you are able to enjoy them only for a moment. I don't like very much the ending because we don't really know how Seth will live he rest of his life, if he will have a job or not, we only know what his feelings are.The soundtrack plays an important role and the choice had been a very good decision. I think it is one of the best compositions of Gabriel Yared. This film composer born in Lebanon also has composed music for 'The English Patient' or other romances like 'Message in a bottle' or 'Autumn in New York'.</fullReview>

It should be like where Maggie (played by Meg Ryan) comes back as an angel and she watches over Seth (played by Nicolas Cage). That movie made me cry. Even though Nicolas Cage is probably better off as an "action film" type actor, he is impressing in City Of Angels. They give nice shots of his eyes. They are so beautiful. He is a nice looking guy and can play a romantic guy pretty well.</fullReview>

And beside this there is a love story (one of very rare ones) that hasn´t a stupid happy end (why does it remember me on Julia Roberts and Richard Gere?), but it has beautiful images, and one of the beautifulest soundtracks I ever heard!Why I repeat beautiful, because it´s not impressive, unbelievable or something like that, it´s just as it is, beautiful (nearly as beautiful as the scenes in the Shire from "The Fellowship"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange, and could have been more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed City of Angels, but only for the first hour. The Angels themselves are very well done, believable (if one can say Angels are believable), and have a real identity about them. Somehow I felt that the storyline was lacking, but can't really put my finger on as to what it was. It seems that there could have been so much more in this film, instead we really concentrate on the simplicity of the love story, without tackling what I personally feel was the controversial question that the film should have raised. Why do people die, who decides, and is it out of our hands or can we influence it. At one point it is indicated that we have free will, and that the Angels can not change situation, only affect it by bringing calm and kindness to people. That contradicts the question the film begins with; where Meg Ryan's character is unable to save a man's life, even though she did everything correctly at the operation table. What the film did get across very well was how humans, most of the time, do not appreciate the miracle of being human and how the little things do matter and could bring us so much more enjoyment. If I take anything away from this film is to value more some of the day to day things in our lives we take for granted. I remember when I saw this film in the movie theater that it moved me to much greater extent when seeing it on TV. Seeing it second time did not affect me or move me half as much as the first time, only relieved to me what it lacks. 7/10</fullReview>

Very much lacking any intellectual depth or meaning, but there isn't a mean-spirited bone in this film's body -- if anything, this is an exploration of (mostly) the positive side of what it means to be human, and to be able to feel, taste and experience. Who'd want to spend eternity without ever knowing that? 7/10</fullReview>

The music is great. Too bad it kept me from watching the movie because I kept reversing to try to find out how the songs where called (I know I could have looked that up with the subtitles). 3. This is the only movie that ever made me cry. Is that a good sign? NO!! It just means that it's too sad, too emotional. 4. Afer the 'big bang' (I can't spoil it) it got boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploring The Nature Of The Angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His name is Seth; he knows neither pain nor fear, hears music in the sunset and is eternal. Though he lacks the capacity to employ olfactory and physical senses, he knows our world, but is not of it. And he is but one of many whose presence is manifested in the beautifully lyrical film, `City Of Angels,' directed by Brad Silberling and starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Seth (Cage) is an angel, one of an infinite number of angels with the singular purpose of presiding over the living; helping with a decision, intervening when necessary and facilitating and easing the moment of transition from life in this world to that of the afterlife. All of which is established in a poignant opening scene, wonderfully presented, in which Seth appears to a little girl who is about to expire in the ER. He watches and waits, and when it is time she goes to him, leaving her body behind and, reassured by his benevolent presence, accompanies him as he escorts her to her new place. It's a moment of sadness and joy combined, and it plays out at a deliberate pace that casts an aura of serenity as Seth quietly addresses the concerns of his ward, explaining that it will be hard for her mother at first, but that eventually she will understand and accept what has happened. It's a tranquil moment that sets the mood for the entire film, and as the scene ends, with Seth and the little girl walking away, hand in hand, he asks her what it was she liked the best; and as she answers, the scene fades. A good director will let you know in the first few minutes of a film what to expect from what follows, and Silberling, with this adaptation of Wim Wenders' `Wings Of Desire' has done just that. From the opening scene right up to the end, this film maintains a sense of peace, even as it explores the complexities of the modern world and those who dwell therein. It's a thought-provoking fantasy that examines the nature of angels, but more than that, offers an expanded perspective of the nature of the world in which we live. Through Seth we must ponder an existence that affords everything, including immortality, yet at the same time denies everything; an existence that affords the essence of love but denies the actual experience of knowing and having real love, as mortals do. And what of the price one must pay to know that kind of love? What is one willing to sacrifice? It's a film that, beyond the romantic aspects of the cohesive storyline, poses questions and considerations about the very nature of the lives we lead, day in and day out; what it all means and where it's taking us. And about the decisions we must make along the way, and the consequences thereof. If ever a perfect call was made in casting an actor for a role, it was casting Nicolas Cage as Seth; he has a natural expression that utterly captures the essence of the character, and Silberling uses it to optimum advantage. Cage fairly implodes into Seth, lending the character a depth that resonates with nuance and emotion. The subtle restraint he uses serves to ignite an ethereal sense of life, of `being,' that so succinctly defines his true nature, the benevolence he personifies. It's a giving, compassionate performance that is truly transporting, and the most significant factor in the success of the film. Another important factor as well, is Meg Ryan's performance as Dr. Maggie Rice, in whom she imbues a strength that ultimately garners the sympathy through which the necessary connection with the audience is made. And that connection is a pivotal point, ultimately upon which the overall success of the film depends, and she delivers faultlessly. In a supporting role, Dennis Franz does a memorable turn as the likeable Nathaniel Messenger, a man with a unique past from whom Seth learns an important lesson. Rounding out the supporting cast are Andre Braugher (Cassiel), Colm Feore (Jordan), Robin Bartlett (Anne), Joanna Merlin (Teresa), Sarah Dampf (Susan) and Rhonda Dotson (Susan's Mother). There are a multitude of rewards to be reaped from `City Of Angels,' among them an uplifting sense of hope and the inner calm derived thereof; but it's something to which you must open yourself up and allow entrance. It's a film that is both entertaining and enlightening, that will take you to a place rarely visited. It's the magic of the movies, affording you an experience you should not let pass you by. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shallow message still too deep for most...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The message presented in this movie was actually quite shallow. Real love between two human beings -- OK. Actually a very shallow message, something that should be commonplace. Yet even those who "get it" will just come away from it wishing to find someone to fall deeply in love with. Those who don't (the loveless and empty) will scorn it. And nobody will grasp that love is eternally within, that it is a source that lies deep inside, an ocean of love without boundaries. Tap into that and see love as *giving*, not having or wanting or yearning. See Love for what it is... something inside, something that goes only outward, that has to do only with giving without thought of return, that flows from life and from Being itself. But nobody does, and nobody will. Most of those who like movies like this will keep going to see them, and die still yearning for that love. Will they ever learn to give, rather than longing for someone else to give to them? "Free will." 6/10</fullReview>

The song "Angel" is played at this scene, and when she stands there and Seth (which by the way is a *beautiful* name) is touching her with such passion.. one of the most beautiful scenes I know from all the movies I have seen in my lifetime; and that is a *lot*. I haven't seen "Wings of desire", but I love the title, so maybe I will someday. Buy the soundtrack to "City of Angels".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this day and age it is rare to see movies that capture your imagination and stimulate the mind. I am pleased to say that City of Angels is one such movie. I sat enthralled in front of the TV screen totally mesmerized by the plot and the incredible acting. It is the almost biblical story about the fall of angel and how he falls in love with a mere mortal. At first, I thought it would be impossible to portray accurately. Not so in this movie. One can feel Seth's desire to be human and what he does to go about it. Taking that huge leap! One also tastes Meg Ryan's dilemma. Once again this was a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing else I could ever say about this movie : perfect. The one and only movie that makes me cry every time I come to think of it, listen to a song from its soundtrack, or tell a friend about the story. I don't know why, but it just comes along with my other favorites : American Beauty and Pay it Forward. Same feelings that I feel while watching them. Same sensations. The soundtrack, the location, the story, the tremendously good actors Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan, the unadulterated bliss of the plot, the filming... I mean, it sounds tedious, but this movie really thrills me away. I was in Central Parl a couple of days ago, I spent the whole day on a bike that I rent, and I couldn't help acting the same way Meg Ryan did on her own bike before she bumped into a truck and eventually died : the pure stillness of the moment when you ride on a smooth, straight path, and you open wide your arms, close your eyes, tilt your head, pointing to the warm rays of sun, and enjoy this absolutely pure and perfect moment... Excuse my French, if any mistakes slipped into this text... It is still my belief that American people definitely know how to make good movies. Eric</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an indie film maker and I do it all- editing, acting, lighting, directing, producing and make up. Either I write dark, surreal screen plays or I write and direct very violent and emotional ones. If a specific film catches my attention, I leave my writing den and studio to take a look. I look for top notch editing, directing, cutting edge technicals and excellent acting. Either I can absorb a film into my mind and soul or not. ALL of the schematics, inside and out, MUST BE EXCELLENT... Not many films attain the luxary of making that accomplishment.Enter "City Of Angels". I saw the film the other day on my Digital Box and I must say, this film is a visual and visceral masterpiece beyond any human description. All of the schematics fit perfectly. Out of the many well crafted scenes, the one scene that stuck in my mind the most was the scene when Nicolas Cage glided off of a sky scraper at daybreak. It was a beautiful montage of flashbacks and different film speeds, coupled with a smooth and elegant brush stroke of angelic styled music. It was a scene that, in my opinion, faintly crossed visual and musical composition with "Bladerunner". To me, the scene was "euphoric"... "City Of Angels", in my opinion and observations, should have gotten the following Academy Award nominations. 1: Best Screenplay, 2: Best Original Score, 3: Best Director, 4: Best Actor (Nicolas Cage), 5: Best Actress (Meg Ryan), &amp; 6: Best Picture. The movie moved me throughout. I found it to be "the best feel good/ feel euphoric movie" of the latter 20th Century. Despite a significant number of good reviews, the film over all, from what I read on the Web, was under rated and not given enough credit. I vastly disagree. I found the film to be extremely well done in the fact of how detailed it is from all angles. The film was patiently shot, much like an artist who spends a whole week on just one brush stroke on his canvas- much to the same shooting integrity as Stanley Kubrick. A film like that cross hatched the directing threads of Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott with a series of it's own directorial ideas which is all excellent.. Then people complained of how too depressing it was and how the ending was terrible. That is what a person should come prepared for when viewing a fantasy film that crosses pathes with the cold and hard shocking realism of Life. Not everything is glitter and glammer. To each their own, but I found that the film touched on some delicate issues visually, audibly and invisibly. The film got a reaction of all different calibres.I give this film a serious and solid 5 stars of 5. Let yourself completely go when watching this film and you should be able to absorb it within your mind and soul... It did for me...Tom Millan "Indie Filmmaker" Kindred Gem Films 1998.</fullReview>

For example why does he know less about the world when hes been on it the longest cause he can't die, why does she not move when she sees the lorry or where does he live when she dies. These are some silly things you ask but some movie fanatics probably could explain. The sex scene is abit over the top. Who would talk like that but thats what makes the movie so romantic. Nicolas Cage is a great actor and Meg Ryan plays this part well to. This movie may make you think is there really angels everywhere?

Nicholas Cage spends the majority of the movie walking around with doe eyes as if that's supposed to express his loneliness, his love for the good doctor and, of course, his angelic presence. Meg Ryan is very natural in the movie and does a fine job with her role but the movie's a dud, so she can act all she wants but it's not gonna save this film. I don't know, maybe if you've never the original than it might be a better viewing experience for you.

		<shortDescription>Just watch the orginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really is no reason to bother watching this movie. From the start it seems odd to remake a movie whose original was released only 11 years prior. 'Wings of Desire' was an impressive film because of the tenderness in which it handle the idea of a purely spiritual self. Unfortunately, 'City of Angels' failed to capitalize on this subtleness, and replaced it with rather typical melodrama. Lost from the original is the grit of Peter Falk's character. Nicholas Cage's character (Seth) seems more motivated by lust, than a transcendence of a mere spiritual existence. The idea of actually wanting to feel pain is lost replaced by a willingness to endure pain in return for physical and emotional pleasure (a fine, but important, distinction). Also wasted in this film in a fine acting performance by Andre Braugher (though one would expect nothing less from him).</fullReview>

In fact, I rather enjoyed it. Even though it was based on one of the best movies ever made, it has some original ideas of its own. I really love what we're left with. The last scene is especially affecting. It also contains one of Nick Cage's best performances and, as far as I've ever seen, Meg Ryan's very best. Dennis Franz, however, is a poor excuse for Peter Faulk. Please, if you have seen Wings of Desire, don't ignore this film for that reason.

If Seth (Cage) really cared, he would have become her guardian. And then she dies! He becomes human and Maggie (Ryan) is killed.How stupid is that? Seth just gave up his immortality for nothing. Does he get back to Heaven? Who knows? They don't tell us. We have to make our own guess. I hate movies without endings.When I saw the previews for this movie, it looked so good! I was duped. I cannot believe I wasted money. And I am a hopeless romantic; I should like stories like this. But I didn't. The only good thing to come out of it was the Goo Goo Dolls song 'Iris.' Yet every time I hear the song, I think of how lame this film is. Save your money. There are other love stories for us romantics out there. Give this one a miss.</fullReview>

Although I like Meg Ryan and Nick Cage as actors, the thing I like the most in the City of Angels is the story itself, told in a wonderful way. Usually I'm not a very romantic guy, in fact I prefer hard movies such as war and action movies to romances, but when I first saw the City of Angels in cinema I almost began crying at its final scenes, that means I was really touched by the story and believe me I don't remember when my eyes after watching a movie were so full with tears prepared to explode, but I as a cool guy didn't let them do this... Anyway for me the best movie ever seen till today although I repeat I'm not really a romantic movie fan, perhaps I'm only a time to time romantic soul, but the City of Angels is simply the best so I gave it the maximum IMDB vote possible-a 10 with no doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done large scale romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely do large budget romances get made, and the box office returns from 'City of Angels' guarantees that you'll see more in the future. I'm not the type of person who goes to see films like this often, so I have little to compare it too, but I actually liked it. The is very good chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan, aided by a better than average supporting cast. I also though that the extremely unconventional ending added to the overall effect of the film, rather than detract from it. It is those last few scenes alone that make the movie memorable, otherwise it would've likely died a quick death (no pun intended) in the minds of most viewers. The film's premise is very intriguing, and the difficult subject matter is deftly handled by sophomore director Brad Siberling. The film is meant to be taken seriously, and that's where it falters slightly, in that it is quite lightweight up until the end. That is likely the only flaw, and I recommend seeing it even if you aren't the type who normally watches romances.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental remake is still worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original movie, WINGS OF DESIRE, was a thoughtful and original movie which tried to explore man's place in the universe, but was too much of a nothingness of being movie for me. This remake is hurt by Dana Stevens' too sentimental screenplay, but has some virtues. Chief among them is director Brad Siberling has borrowed the look Wim Wenders gave to the original without making it seem like a rip off. Some of those shots, especially when the angels are standing on top of buildings, are spectacular. Siberling uses L.A. like Wenders used Berlin, though obviously in a different way, since the cities are so different.I might be in a minority, but I think Ryan's better when she's not playing flighty characters, and more like the one she plays here. She's good at playing vulnerable without being sappy at it, like when she loses her patient. Cage sometimes seems like he's straight-jacketed by the part, but he again takes chances that few others would take which pay off, like when he first becomes human and experiences the world around him. I'm a big fan of Braugher from HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET, and I was surprised to see him here, but he adds gravity to the film. Franz is playing the weakest part of the film (as it was in the original), an overly symbolic part he can't do much with.</fullReview>

A real ''sleeper'' this year, it wouldn't surprise me if at least one of this pair garners a nomination when announced next month, as well as the film itself in some of the technical categories.

Seeing this movie now is a real bliss...because I can appreciate it better now. Nicholas Cage has done a reasonable job with this role although there was room for improvement. His portrayal of Seth was convincing but not so much as to be breathtaking. (6/10) Meg Ryan was perfect for this role..very apt. (8/10)Perhaps someone like John Cusack or even, Russell Crowe might have done a more convincing...a more "emotional" performance of Seth. Nicholas Cage doesn't really reach out to the character. But having said that, his scenes purely as an angel are terrific ! Its the parts where he and Maggie are together, is where he goes cold, i think.All in all, brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***********HERE LIE MAJOR SPOILERS*********** I just rented the DVD last night.To put it in one word: WOW! I was amazed at how great this movie was.According to me, a great movie is one which you enjoy watching as well as thinking about for at least a day after watching it.As of hour no. 20, I still can't stop thinking about it.One of the best things I liked about the movie was the way it handled religion and faith - Nothing too obvious or no clear hints at any specific religion (Although I have to admit, there are a few references to christianity).[i](After Maggie's death) Seth: Am I being Punished? Cassiel: Come on, you know better than that.[/i]Another thing that I'm sure bothered a lot of people is the ending. I'd like to ask you though, what would you have done? Ended in the typical Happy-Romantic film manner? Or givien Seth the axe?The ending had a special significance. Maggie died in the same way that Seth got a human life. They were both trying to enjoy their lives to the fullest. Feel what they had never felt before.Two more issues that people bring up are Nick cage's acting and the cliches in the movie. Cage has never really struck me as a untalented one-genre actor that some think he is. I've enjoyed watching him in most of his roles. Sure he looks and acts a bit like Big Moose at times, but for the most part I don't notice. BTW, if the movie were cliched, it would have ended right after Maggie died. We wouldn't have been shown the montage after or the beautiful scene in which Seth and Cassiel discuss the happenings of the past few days and more importantly, we wouldn't have got what I feel is one of the most touching lines that I've ever heard in a movie:Seth: I would rather have had one breath of her hair....one kiss from her mouth....one touch of her hand, than eternity without it. OneAnother touching moment is the time we hear the old man in the library read Hemingway.The overall casting is great. Meg Ryan plays her typical role perfectly with a few subtle, emotional changes. Dennis Franz (who I usually can't stand) was also cast well for his short scenes. Even Andre Braughner stands out as Cassiel.All the angels scenes were well choreographed and played out with some mind blowing instrumental music. I especially enjoyed the scenes where the camera angle is blown over the city and we see angels in places like helipads, etc.I've never really enjoyed to many other tragic movies, Arlington Road and Romeo and Juliet come to mind, But City of Angels really stands out. I will be buying the DVD once I can afford it. Although I should add that I doubt the movie will be very repeat-watch friendly. Its more of a 1 watch experience.Another thing I want to add is that after watching the film, I finally understood the song, 'Iris' by the Goo Goo Dolls which is in the Soundtrack. I've always loved the song but now its got a bit of added meaning and emotional value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 on a scale of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 30 minutes of this movie are nearly boring. Except for the intellectual stimulation revolving around angels interacting with humans, I could have just as soon been watching the grass grow. It takes off later, however, and the rest of the story is compelling.I am a reasonably big Cage fan and a huge Ryan fan. My problem with this movie is that I just don't see the chemistry between them. I actually think the angel part was considerably more suited to Cage than the heart surgeon part was for Ryan. Perhaps I just hold any romance with Ryan up to rarely attained standards such as When Harry Met Sally (10 out of 10).The ending was undesirable, but I had decided before it got that far that this was a 7 rating and it wouldn't have mattered how it ended.Well done, but needed better casting and more lighter moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know I avoided this movie for years because of the negative post made by people of IMDB. I will never do that again. I will see any damn movie I want to see from now on. I saw this movie for the first time this weekend. Very, very sweet. I felt Nick Cage's pain and sadness. Wouldn't you just love to look at the sunrises and sunsets and hear music. I wouldn't mind. Maybe if everyone in this world could hear music when the sun goes up and down, we wouldn't have some much terrorism and hate in this world. What do you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend told me I had to see this movie. Yes, my friend was a girl. What am I implying, that this is a girlie movie? It's the definition of girlie movie. So I braced myself for the worst. Nicholas Cage is an Angel that wants to be human. Meg Ryan is the human he falls in love with. I feel like I've seen this before...It's actually not as bad as I thought it would be but that still doesn't make it good. You know every guy is going to get dragged into this by his girlfriend, they could have at least thrown a little T&amp;A into it but no. Crappy song too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the initial visual scenes of the dark clothed "angels" perched on the buildings of LA like crows, I was expecting much more from this film than I got. I found no chemistry between Cage and Ryan, and their conversations lacked emotion. I particularly disliked the sound track which was oppressively loud and mismatched to the on screen action or lack thereof. The ending was easily predictable and, in my case, welcome as it foreshadow the end of a very tedious movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the people who liked this movie were probably the same people who couldn't predict what was going to happen. After seeing the trailer I had an idea about how it would end. Turns out I was completely right. Chances are any constant movie goer has seen this plot before and this movie adds nothing new to the formula. I can't recommend it to anybody except for fans of the lead actors. They are the only half-decent part of this boring mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Waste of Good Material &amp; Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story has so much potential, and yet "City of Angels" manages to deliver such a disappointing, mish-meshed concoction of a story line - it's not worth the effort to sort out. I've heard Meg Ryan's character described as everything from an "Atheist" to a "non-believer" - from my perspective, Dr. Rice was agnostic. She perceived that there was "something" or "someone" out there, more powerful perhaps, and perhaps having control over what she believed her own hands, mind and intellect ruled over. This possibility intrigued her and though she resisted strongly, she wanted to believe in and explore this line of thinking.Enter Nicholas Cage's "Seth" character, an angel who proverbially has "all the answers" to Dr. Rice's questions, and to the questions of the entire movie audience it seems as well. Seth however, either doesn't realize what the questions are, or chooses not to dispense his knowledge."We" (movie audiences) tend to credit or blame the actors themselves for everything that happened (or in this case - doesn't happen) within the movie. Though the acting itself and to some extent the depth of the character portrayal rests squarely on their shoulders - not everything else does. With "City of Angels" Meg Ryan, Andre Brauher, and Dennis Franz work very hard to save a poorly written story line so full of plot holes it couldn't hold frozen water in January. Here, the "blame" for an ineffective movie rests completely on the Director (Brad Silberling), and the Screen Writer (Dana Stevens).The references to the sensual lines from Hemingway's "A Moveable Feast", coupled with the on screen chemistry between Dr. Rice and Seth could have melted the screen with pure passion. Instead of this passionate heat, Silberling &amp; Stevens serve up a pre-pubescent couple stumbling through the Joys of Cooking. What a waste!!Then there's Andre Brauher, and Dennis Franz. Franz's character has "been there and come back", so-to-speak and Brauher's character cannot deny his interest of "what's it like?" Once again the movie audience is teased with the possibility of on screen heat, this time from a different source.Once again - unfortunately for the audience - the chemicals are not mixed (directed &amp; written) properly and we are left out in the cold. There are numerous "opportunities" where either the direction or the writing went in one direction, but the film went another.Finally - no, I didn't slight Nicholas Cage's effort (?) in this film. His portrayal of Seth was perfect - that is, it would have been perfect for "Psycho", "The Shining", or any number of other psychotic thrillers.In scenes where tenderness should have reigned, we received a bulging eyes, raspy voiced, stern faced portrayal of a character that would have frightened even Alfred Hitchcock! In a dark hospital corridor, late at night - if I bumped into Cage's Seth - I would not have spoken, I would have run like H---!!Unfortunately for the movie audience, this wasn't an isolated incident. Cage's characterization of Seth portrayed this psychotic behavior throughout the entire film. If directed to this or if written in this fashion, Nicholas Cage should have taken the initiative to soften Seth's approach &amp; demeanor. Here, the actor does have to take some of the responsibility of the outcome.Over-all, I'm sorry - - sitting through "City of Angels" was a waste of my time and I don't recommend that anyone else waste theirs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attempt to impart surrealism fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like a film to know what it is. This film could not decide if it was a sentimental romance, an artistic view of heavenly inhabitants, or a metaphorical view of spirituality.The haunting images of angels in their black garb gathering in various places were eye-catching, but not mind-blowing. The soliloquys were pleasant to the ear, but not as clever as they thought they were.The script seemed to dip between melodrama and surrealism. I came away unaffected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It started off slow, almost boring, but finally became more interesting.

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking, if you like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some years ago I watched "Der Himmel über Berlin", which is the original= of City of Angel, written by Wim Wenders, and I really hated it. It was something so disgusting, I just couldn't stand it. The only reason I watched "City of Angels" was Meg Ryan, who is my favorite actress. And I was really surprised how much I liked the movie: Every single picture looked so beautiful and these angels really looked like really heavenly. Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage did a terrific job and the movie itself occupied my thoughts for a long time. This is one of these really intense movies where you need to think about a lot. But still, even if it's much lighter than the German original, many people in the cinema didn't get the point, but most of those who did get the= point, really loved it.</fullReview>
