		<shortDescription>Fun, fast-moving with fantastic special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film about an oversize gorilla (about 10-11 feet), its owner (Terry Moore) and what happens when an unscrupulous promoter Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) lures them from Africa to America to become a hit. Let's get the bad stuff out of the way--the story is nothing new; Terry Moore and Ben Johnson are among the worst actors I've ever seen and there's zero lack of characterization among the humans. But when Joe Young appears all is forgiven. He looks great, moves realistically and has incredible facial motions. You can tell exactly what he's thinking by his expressions! Also, the scenes where he's grappling with humans, horses, lions look extremely realistic--that's saying a lot for a film that's over 50 years old! A fun family film. Try to see restored prints--there's a final sequence involving a burning building in which the whole reel is tinted red--very nicely done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong with a heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing Mighty Joe Young before I ever saw King Kong, and for the longest time I preferred it to Kong because it seemed newer, with better effects, and more familiar actors, while Kong seemed older and a little creakier with a less familiar cast of characters. Over the years I've come to appreciate both as great movies, the same basic story or premise, but with a slightly different spin, one as a grand thrilling epic, and one as a heartwarming story with laughs and thrills. Where Kong is the tragic violent figure meeting his fate for the love of a woman, Joe Young is a warm cuddly teddy bear of a creature trying to stave off that wild beast that lives inside of him for the affection of a woman. Where Kong wouldn't expend a drop of sweat helping a human, except for Ann Darrow, Joe Young appears more than human in that he would sacrifice himself to save the children and adults in an orphanage engulfed in flames. And although Robert Armstrong doesn't play the same character in both movies, just the same type of character, it's kind of nice to see him learn from his mistakes in the previous film and early on in this one so that he can make a determined effort to have this story end differently. While King Kong may have been a grand slam out of the park, Mighty Joe Young still comes out as a solid home run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Charming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the great ape films, this one made by the same folks that brought us King Kong and Son of Kong has to be the most charming. The story is simple enough about a young girl that raises a gorilla from infancy in the wilds of Africa to be wooed and wowed by an American showman looking for acts in Africa. The showman sees her gorilla and the way she can make it listen and do tricks...and soon both beast and beauty are off to the US to star in a night club act of all things. Terry Moore is a real cutie portraying the girl. The showman is played by...well who else but the same man responsible for bringing King Kong to New York City 16 years earlier...Robert Armstrong. The rest of the cast is adequate with Nestor Paiva in a small but crucial role standing out. The real star, however, is the ape itself and the special effects centered around it. This gorilla is brutish yet humane. He is playful and yet serious and somber at times. Willis O'Brien has done it again with the effects and his stop motion animation, with a great deal of improvement since Kong. The best thing about this movie is its heart, and the heart shown between the young girl and her pet/child. Some scenes are very striking in the film. One that stands out the most is the introduction of Mighty Joe Young in the night club with Terry Moore playing the piano. It looks like Busby Berkley choreographed it. Another very powerful scene involves Joe with an orphanage on fire. The scene is tremendous and even tinted red. Very impressive for its release. A True Classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you Enjoyed King Kong (1933), You'll Like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mighty Joe Young" was a very entertaining film with a surprising amount of action. In fact, the last third to last half of this film is just about non-stop. it reminded me of King Kong, of course with a big age being brought to New York City for display and then things going haywire. This movie, however, has a happier ending than "Kong," although it doesn't look like that will be the case near the end. It turns to be a very suspenseful movie in that last 30 minutes, especially.Even though this was an early Ray Harryhausen special-effects effort (and he's interviewed in two features on the DVD), it still looks pretty hokey in spots. But in 1949, this must have been pretty cool. Hey, to be fair, some parts are decently realistic if you aren't too critical. One thing: they are fun to watch!The only weak point was the acting. A very young-looking Ben Johnson sounded wooden and Robert Armstrong overacted. Terry Moore, as Mighty Joe's guardian, so to speak, was so-so.What made this movie better-than-average was the injection of some humor into this adventure story. Humor, and a bit of sentimentality as Mighty Joe is humanized to a degree. The big ape was funny while sitting in the back of a speeding truck eluding the police, and at the very of the movie he made most viewers laugh.This movie is much better now that it's on DVD. The transfer is excellent; a nice picture. Near the end, with the big orphanage fire, the black-and-white scenes are tinted. Overall, if you liked the 1933 version of King Kong, you'll like this. A lot of the same people were responsible for both films. This is pure entertainment, which is why I gave it '9' stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderfully entertaining slant on "King Kong" by Kong's creators, Cooper and Schoedsack (along with John Ford). Much better than Kong's 1934 sequel, "Son of Kong", which was hurriedly made. The creators put a lot of thought and effort into this worthy follow-up and it shows. More superb special effects from Willis O'Brien as technical director, featuring the budding talents of protege, Ray Harryhausen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanksgiving just can't be Thanksgiving without Mighty Joe Young. From as far back as I can remember, until about 10 years ago, WOR, channel 9 in New York City, played a King Kong festival on Thanksgiving day, and then a Godzilla festival on Friday, dubbing it "Monster Weekend." Of the 3 "ape movies" played back-to-back (King Kong, Son of Kong, and Mighty Joe Young), this was far and away the best. There were several reasons for it. (1) Mighty Joe Young has the best special effects of all the ape movies (and, truth be known, far better than those of most of the Godzillas -- which were filmed 10-20 years later!). (2) Mighty Joe Young has the best story. It's about a little girl who adopts a young gorilla in Africa on her family's plantation, and she grows up with it. The gorilla turns out to be the largest in the world (but nowhere near the size of Kong). Joe is affectionate with his "sister", and very protective of her, and the animators gave him a wonderful range of facial expressions and emotions. (3) Mighty Joe Young has the best climax, and the best ending.All told, Mighty Joe Young is a terriffic movie. It was light years ahead of its time in so many ways, including special effects. It is well worth the time to see it.My score: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When many people bring this film up, many of them want to compare it to its predecessor King Kong. However, if they would let this film stand on its own they would see that this is a good film about a young girl and her pet gorilla. Joe is almost childlike and is even lovable. Also, the human cast is fine especially Terry Moore and Robert Armstrong in what pretty much is a repeat of his role of impresario Carl Denham in the original Kong.But, lets not forget the special effects. Willis O'Brien and his protégé, a young Ray Harryhausen do a remarkable job with Joe. The pretty much show him as being a more rounded character than Kong and you can see the aforementioned childlike qualities they bring to him. This is definitely a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this first came out, I saw it on the Silver Screen. It's been described before, and the closest thing to a really nasty person are the cops who want to dispose of Joe.This is an MGM film: Misunderstood Gorilla Movie. As presented to the audience, he's neither a menace nor a bad sort.Possible minor spoiler: The introduction of Joe in the nightclub was a memorable scene. The girl plays Joe's favorite song at the piano on a stage, and as the song continues, the piano and stage rise smoothly until they reach a significant height, and then the lights come up: Joe is holding up girl, piano, and stage. This is one of my favorite scenes in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Excellent Movie and with Awesome Special Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Africa, the girl Jill Young trades a baby gorilla with two natives and raises the animal. Twelve years later, the talkative and persuasive promoter Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) organizes a safari to Africa with the Oklahoma cowboy Gregg (Ben Johnson) to bring attractions to his new night-club in Hollywood. They capture several lions and out of blue, they see a huge gorilla nearby their camping and they try to capture the animal. However, the teenager Jill Young (Terry Moore) stops the men that intended to kill her gorilla. Max seduces Jill with a fancy life in Hollywood and she signs a contract with him where the gorilla Joseph "Joe" Young would be the lead attraction. Soon she realizes that her dream is a nightmare to Joe and she asks Max to return to Africa. However he persuades her to stay a little longer in the show business. But when three alcoholic costumers give booze to Joe, the gorilla destroys the spot and is sentenced by the justice to be sacrificed. Will Jill, Gregg and Max succeed in saving Joe?"Mighty Joe Young" is a surprisingly excellent movie, with a story that entwines drama, romance and adventure and with awesome special effects for a 1949 movie. I bought this DVD a couple of years ago, but I was expecting a lame rip-off of King Kong based on the awful Brazilian title. However, the plot is engaging, with lots of emotions and many plot points and Joe's runaway is spectacular. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Monstro de um Mundo Perdido" ("Monster of a Lost World")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RKO managed to put out a sweet movie, even with the cheesy backdrops (the African scenes) and special effects (they obviously used toy vehicles in one scene). You'll root for the good guys and laugh at the rougish character played by Robert Armstrong as he schemes to get Joe back home. Look for Irene Ryan (who later played "Granny" on the Beverly Hillbillies) in a quick scene in the nightclub.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Am I dreamin' or did I just see a gorilla?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An African girl (Terry Moore) is best friends with a twelve-foot tall ape named Joe she grew up with. American promoter Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) persuades the girl to bring her ape to America to take part in his show. You can pretty much guess how this will go wrong even if you haven't seen King Kong.First big role for Ben Johnson as a cowboy who falls for Moore. He's pretty wooden here but then again he was a fairly wooden actor throughout his career. He does his usual John Wayne, Jr. routine. Lots of "Yassir" and "Ah reckon" type stuff. Robert Armstrong plays a role very much like Carl Denham from King Kong, although a little more comedic. Terry Moore is more Helen Mack than Fay Wray. That is to say she's cute but not much screen presence.Re-teaming of many of the King Kong team for a story that is very similar to that film, although different enough to keep this from being considered a remake. The story is mostly kid stuff and fluff but cute nonetheless. The Willis O'Brien/Ray Harryhausen special effects alone are worth checking this movie out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy successor to KING KONG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From many of the same folks who gave us the classic KING KONG, we have Joseph Young of Africa.The FX are great, especially considering that this film was done long before razzle-dazzle computer work. The movie is an interesting, amusing, and touching variation on KING KONG but stands up as a strong, entertaining film in its own right. Robert Armstrong is once again the big showman who has to knock the public dead. In this case, nobody dies, but the public is still impressed.It's interesting to note the different reactions of the theater audiences when Kong was first displayed and when Joe is first seen on stage. Perhaps the audiences were actually getting more sophisticated in 1949, and the difference could be an interesting comment by the movie makers on how jaded people were getting by 1949.In any event, Joe Young is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Joseph Young of Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most entertaining and family-friendly films of its era. Made by the same crew that did the immortal King Kong, this movie wisely doesn't even attempt to match the thunderous, epic quality of that movie. Instead, it's a sentimental look at how "savage" civilization is and how "pure" the so-called jungle "beasts" are.Mighty Joe is a gorilla left as a baby on the doorstep of an African plantation owner. The boss' young daughter finds the infant ape adorable and begs Daddy to keep him as a pet, which he grudgingly does. As the girl grows up, so does Joe...into a towering 15 foot giant. But the bonds of love and friendship between the two remain strong as they live in their idyllic African paradise.Enter the scheming Max O'Hara, played with the usual abrasive aplomb by Robert Armstrong. Though the name is different, Max is pretty much the same as Carl Denham, the showman who brought King Kong to New York. Max's latest idea is to start a New York night club based on a Safari theme, featuring real African animals. He assembles a crew of Western cowboys to help him capture the animals and heads off to Africa.Well, O'Hara and his cowboys manage to encounter the towering Joe and narrowly avert being crushed by the giant gorilla. Learning of the girl Terry's control of Joe, O'Hara sweet-talks her into traveling with Joe to New York, to become the star attractions of his new Safari club.Terry and Joe are a smashing success as far as attracting attention go, but the truth is, neither one likes the soulless hustle of the Big City that much. Joe is made a fool of, forced to wear a bellboy outfit and play at being an organ grinder's monkey. When a bunch of abusive drunks harass him, the mighty ape loses control and goes on a violent rampage, completely trashing the Safari Club and almost killing his tormentors. Joe is now on the loose in civilization and the worried police have put a death warrant on him, feeling they have a giant killer gorilla stalking the countryside.Can Mighty Joe escape the terrors of New York? Will his human friends be able to help him? And does the big gorilla have what it takes to be a real hero? Well, the movie is sentimental and even corny, but the ending gives the answer to all of these questions and more. The pace of the film is excellent and there are several scenes that stand out. In the Safari Club, Joe does an exhibition tug of war with a bunch of wrestlers and strongmen, including such well-known names as Primo Carnera, The Swedish Angel, Bomber Kulky and Rasputin. Carnera in particular is a hoot as he tries to bluster his way past the big ape. Joe's violent rampage after he escapes is breath-taking, as the Safari Club is destroyed in an orgy of violence. Other wild animals like lions are released during the rampage and they cause their own danger. Finally, Joe tries to rescue toddlers from a burning building in a scene tinted red.The acting is so-so, but Armstrong is always great as a fast-talking con man. Ben Johnson plays the leader of the cowboys who falls in love with Terry, who is played by Terry Moore. Other familiar faces like Nestor Paiva and Frank McHugh pop up.The real star, of course, is Joe himself. Both King Kong creator Willis O'Brien and his young protégé Ray Harryhausen worked on the film and brought their typical attention to detail and character to their efforts. Joe's height seems to change a bit during the picture, but he exudes so much personality that he outshines his human co-stars.A charming film with a good message about who is really savage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent gorilla adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mighty Joe Young was the first movie to feature the work of Ray Harryhausen, where he worked with Willis O'Brien to animate Joe.A young girl obtains a baby gorilla as a pet, little does she know he will grow up to be a giant. Moving on to the present day, movie producer Max O'Hara manages to talk the now grown up girl, Jill to bring Joe to America and attend some shows over there. While in America, several shows are attended, but it eventually gets too much for Joe and during one show, he goes on the rampage killing several lions and destroying the theatre in the process. An order is then given for Joe to be put down, but they manage to escape with O'Hara's help and succeed. During the escape, Joe rescues some children from a fire at their orphanage, which gets destroyed. He becomes a hero after this. In the end, Jill, her new lover and Joe end up back in Africa happy ever after.The stop-motion work by Harryhausen and O'Brien is excellent, as is the score.The cast includes Terry Moore as Jill, Ben Johnson and Robert Armstrong as O'Hara, almost repeating his role in King Kong.In 1998, Disney remade Mighty Joe Young which had Terry Moore and Ray Harryhausen in a cameo role.This movie is excellent and I have seen it several times, the first when I was rather young.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good flick, better than the newer version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Hollywood must makes remakes due to the mostly lack of creativity that we see these days coming out of Tinsel Town, then at least make the remake better. This original story of a Girl and Her Ape is so much better, so much better paced and without the hideous mean spirited additions the new one had added. The very fact that this first version was done with stop motion photography gives it an edge over the computer generated swill we saw in color just a few years back. Sure there are some 1940ish hokey "B" movie formula stuff, but in the end-the 1949 film is just so much better paced and more palatable for the younger set. If you have not seen this one, give it a shot. If you prefer the newer version then you obviously have a thing against the black and white films of yore.MM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Piece Of Stop Motion From The Great Ray Harryhausen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PLOT - Jill Young (Terry Moore) has brought up her pet gorilla since she was a child. Twelve years later, when the gorilla is fully grown, Hollywood promoter Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) travels to Tanzania, Africa, and convinces Jill to bring her extraordinarily large gorilla, Joe, back to America. While in Hollywood, Joe is used in a stage production and is exploited to no end. It doesn't take long until Joe is sick of being mistreated and he escapes to run loose in civilization.REVIEW - This is an instant where I've seen the remake first, then the original. So I'm holding my feelings about this one. For what it is, it's good. I think Cooper and Obrien wanted to make this film for a kind of nostalgia trip. CHARACTERS - The characters are great. Terry Moore, while not a beauty that tames the beast, is more of a sister to Joe. She's very likable and you can see and feel her confusion when entering America for the first time. That's another thing about Kong films is that they're kind of painting an evil image of America as they only care about greed. But I digress. Robert Armstrong is once again fantastic, playing that lovable Denham like showman, also adding a bit more of a comic relief in him and this time, instead of being a bit of a mad man, becomes a hero in the end. Ben Johnson's character, I'm sorry, but these young male leads in these first movies are so bland and boring to me, so I got nothing to say about them that are interesting.EFFECTS - This is also the first film to introduce publicly the legendary stop motion animator Ray Harryhausen, who would eventually be the next in line on the stop motion animation throne. His animation on Joe is great for his first feature. It's said that he ate carrots and bananas and act like a real gorilla in order to get the character moving. Now that is what you call dedication. FINAL VERDICT - Overall, the movie it is a good watch with good VFX and Animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is essentially a smaller, pared-down re-run of KING KONG, with everything taking place on a smaller scale and perhaps a slightly younger audience in mind. It's nevertheless an extremely watchable and at times powerful piece, one that's at its best when depicting the worst of human nature; namely Joe's transformation from king of the jungle to a side-show freak.Such films are inevitably dated now, presenting a view of a world long forgotten. Despite this, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is gripping and exhilarating in equal measure. The opening sequences are slightly twee, but once the action shifts to Hollywood it gets better and better, especially the extended "will they make it?" climax. The scene with the burning building is an incredibly complex set-piece and one which is executed beautifully.KING KONG guru Willis O'Brien was the guy headlining this production, but by all accounts stop-motion king Ray Harryhausen did most of the work, and Joe is one of his best creations; not only is he a realistic monster, but like the best of the stop-motion beasties, he's a recognisable character too, and one you empathise with. The rest of the production is well-paced and well-made, with a level of finesse raising it above the level of the competition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis O'brien Wins Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the conclusion of what I like to call, "The Great Apes" Trilogy, which consists of King Kong, Son of Kong, and Mighty Joe Young. The three films involve Merian C Cooper, Ernest B Shoedsack, Ruth Rose, Willis O'brien, and Robert Armstrong. For most people, including myself, King Kong is the best of these three films, while Son of Kong is the weakest. Mighty Joe Young is in between. The gorilla effects are well-done, and even eliminated the ruffling of the rabbit fur King Kong had in 1933. Joe is an amalgamation of the King himself, and his son; containing childlike qualities, as well as the fact that Joe could potentially do some damage. There is one sequence which is simply marvelous involving the nightclub that steals the show. The performances are good for a movie of this type, and ends up being a happier film than the previous installments. Also, Willis O'brien's unmatched talents were finally recognized, with an Oscar for his work on this very film. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Same people as my favorite movie, "King Kong" which I've probably seen about 25 times, both the edited and, later, the unedited version. Same people and a lot of the same situations, but with different - er - feelings.Kong was bigger and meaner. MJY is smaller and, for the most part, much friendlier. Both had their crushes, Kong carting a screaming Fay Wray about, and Joe carting a happy Terry Moore.Quick note - let's dismiss "Son of Kong" which was a Kong bomb.Both apes were better off where they were before folks carted them to what we laughingly refer to as civilization. Joe's encounter with a red-tinged burning orphanage was excellent, and I like the fact that Joe had a sense of humor. Dig those expressions from the back of the truck when the meanie cops were chasing him.Speaking of mean, the three drunks who got Joe drunk were well-known, and very convincing character actors from that era. And, that entire nightclub scene was well done.All in all, "Mighty Joe Young" is exciting and fun family entertainment. By the way, he was nowhere near as mean-looking as the picture on the box but, then again, such things are always exaggerated.Kong will remain my fave, though. Technically, it was excellent when you consider the year it was made and the painstaking one-step-at-a time method.And, trivia buffs, "King Kong" opened at New York City's two biggest theaters at the same time, Radio City Music Hall and the Roxy. I forgot which theater I saw it at, but I will never forget the thrills it bought.As for Joe, see and really enjoy. And, checking out Terry Moore is rather painless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read most of the reviews on this board about "Mighty Joe Young", and no one mentions 'Beautiful Dreamer', how come? I know it's not the kind of song you associate with a big ape, but the first thing I think of whenever I hear the melody today is this picture. It's also cool to read all the reviews from folks who were around during the glory days of WOR TV in New York back in the 1950's. It's where I got my start watching a lot of these classics as a kid, and whenever you came upon one you really liked, you got to watch it every day for a week! Boy, those were the good old days! What you have here, mostly from the same folks who brought you "King Kong", is an entirely derivative story fashioned after the 1933 original, but as others have pointed out, a story with more heart. I can remember as a kid how bad I felt when the drunks at the Golden Safari got Joe tipsy to start the rampage, hoping against hope that Joe wouldn't be a goner when the cops arrived with their guns. Funny how you can recall those feelings from so long ago, and have the same reaction while watching some fifty plus years later.My favorite scene still has to be the strong man lineup from Joe's first act at the Club. I recognized Henry Kulky as Otto Schmidlapp from "The Life of Riley", and my Dad would tell me about some of the other men on stage, pro wrestlers like The Swedish Angel and Man Mountain Dean. This was my first introduction as well to Primo Carnera, boxing champeen who also went on to a pro grappling career. I still get a kick out their introduction in the picture and the feats of strength done to the shout outs from the crowd.The one actor I forgot about who made a mark in the picture was Ben Johnson, very cool to see him once again as the Oklahoma cowboy who has to get in on Max O'Hara's (Robert Armstrong) action in Africa. Watching the picture earlier today though, I couldn't figure out why he and his men thought it would be a good idea to try and lasso a wild gorilla. That didn't seem to make much sense, but then again, sense is not what the film makers were going after in the final product.What they were going for were action, thrills, and adventure, mixed with some humor that would appeal to all members of the family. I think they did a pretty good job of it, considering I can remember most everything about the picture, even if I first saw it over fifty years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When WOR TV in New York got the RKO film library for its disposal and use, of course the most popular films easily were the ape trilogy of King Kong, Son Of Kong, and Mighty Joe Young. Forget Astaire&amp;Rogers, Cary Grant, The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, if you were below the age of 12 these were the films you wanted to see. Every Labor Day the Ape trilogy was run and when WOR had Million Dollar Movie all day, it's highest ratings went to the simians.When you realize that unlike the other two, Mighty Joe Young was specifically geared to that audience you can relax and return to your childhood to enjoy this film about two young lovers and their pet 15 foot gorilla.The same folks, Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack who did the Kong films have brought you this one and Willis O'Brien had a resident special effects genius as an assistant in Ray Harryhausen. Watching the film now I see clear traces of Harryhausen that become apparent in his later work.Young Terry Moore who is played in a prologue by Shirley Temple wannabe Lora Lee Michel is seen acquiring the baby gorilla to the chagrin of her father Regis Toomey. She must have cared for him good because he grew to some immense size.Enter Robert Armstrong whose character is clearly influenced by producer Billy Rose as it was in King Kong and Son Of Kong has come to Africa for publicity and animal acts in that order. He's brought some rodeo cowboys led by Ben Johnson and Terry Moore who's not seen any of the outside world is influenced by Armstrong's fast talk and Johnson's boyish charm to come to America with the gorilla named Mighty Joe Young.Of course if you remember the havoc that King Kong wrought upon New York when Armstrong brought him back, then you have some idea where the story is going. But only some idea believe me.Mighty Joe Young does have some stupidity in it. For instance I don't think any rodeo cowboy is good enough to capture a lion by roping him. But that's what the film has you believe about Ben Johnson. And Ben Johnson ought to know better because that's what he was before going into acting.Still the film has an innocent charm about it and you can't help, but like it and the characters in the film. I daresay if WOR ran it again it would get the same high ratings. It's a children's classic for kids of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost King Kong as a child...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jill Young has grown up in Africa where as a child she purchased a baby gorilla from a local man and has raised it as a free roaming pet to adulthood. They live an idyllic life, but things go a bit wrong when she is convinced to take Joe to America to perform in a circus like show. Joe gets a bit upset when taunted by the audience, resulting in disaster and a death sentence for him.Mighty Joe Young is a wonderful family adventure movie that is kind of a childlike version of King Kong with a happy ending. And this is not a bad thing. It really is a touching and charming story with enough action to propel the story forward and enough "drama" to keep it interesting.The effects on the gorilla, primarily done I gather by Ray Harryhausen, are great and manage to capture a juvenile character and attitude.Mighty Joe Young is a much lighter story than King Kong, but no less entertaining. Definitely recommended for a good fun family viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was Hollywood overkill that (almost) killed the beast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For Ernest Shoedsack's final feature as director (he directed a prologue uncredited for a film later on), he takes the King Kong concept, but makes it sweeter, more amiable for a family or small kids, and has the wisdom to put on Ray Harryhausen for Mighty Joe Young's special effects and stop motion. While Harryhausen will always be synonymous with Jason and the Argonauts, among other monster movies, this one shows so much care and energy on a first official go-around. It might not be as wild as the original Kong from 1933, but it's a little more polished, with lots of cool fights with lions, and freak-out in an auditorium, and a climax that involves (don't laugh) a burning orphanage. If for no other reason the movie has instant appeal for fans of the great Harryhausen as one of his quintessential efforts.The film itself is a fun, heartwarming concoction where we see an ape that's smaller than Kong, and less obsessed with diddling the woman of the picture. In fact, the gorilla this time is in the form of a pet, and as such it's friendlier, funnier, but easy to provoke unless its girl is with him (the lovely Terry Moore as Jill). He's surrounded by some 'stock' characters, like the greedy show-biz-man Max O'Hara, and the kind-hearted 'cowboy' Gregg played by Ben Johnson. And the story has a somewhat predictable end. But what makes it enjoyable is that the attitude stays strong enough for its target audience to stay in tune, and there's even a rather amazing climax with the burning orphanage; Shoedsack puts a red tint on the entire sequence, and without much dialog (save for the obvious "JOE!" and screaming children) and thrilling music it's like a near perfect silent movie sequence done with some extra flair. It gives it just that little boost that makes it comparable (if not as iconic) as the building climax of Kong. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The same crew that brought us the original King Kong must have decided it was something of a downer, so they offered us a different, more upbeat (and very funny) variation on the theme, complete with happy ending.Mighty Joe is a huge 2000-pound gorilla, raised as an orphan by a human girl companion. Joe is no King Kong, he's a gentle, good-natured giant.One of Ray Harryhausen's first stop-motion projects, Joe's expressive face and mannerisms - body language, personality quirks and the like - make for the most believable stop-motion gorilla on film. (spoilers):Mighty Joe and the girl get "discovered" and end up as a truly remarkable act in an African- themed 'coconut grove' night club, complete with a dozen African lions behind glass partitions..It doesn't take long for a pair of drunks from the audience decide to go backstage to Mighty Joe's pen and introduce him to the joys of alcoholic intoxication, leading to what may be the single most outrageous scene ever filmed.The ensuing "giant-gorilla-on-the-loose" scene pulls all the stops: A drunken, berserk Mighty Joe proceeds to demolish the night club, throwing lions around as the audience scrambles for the exits. The stop-motion Mighty Joe is, of course, throwing stop-motion lions, but those are real, live lions we see flying about, crashing into tables and running off! This has got to be the only film where you can actually see live, very-confused 500- pound African lions being catapulted across the room into furniture!Everything works out for the best, of course. Plenty of good gags and cute touches, fun for adults and kids alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film to show your School Agers on one of those half-fast School Holidays(like Ground Hog Day), Especially Good for Girls! Why? Just Read Ahead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some have called MIGHTY JOE YOUNG(Argosy Pictures/RKO Radio Pictures, 1949), "...the 3rd installment of KING KONG(RKO,1933)!" That would be following the quickie, make-a-buncha-dough Kong sequel, SON OF KONG(RKO,1934). This may be an example of wishful thinking or over obvious pigeon-holing. I mean, just because the central theme involves the exploitation of an innocent,wild animal, who just happens to be an Ape, it should be classified the same? We think not.First of all, KING KONG is really a monster movie. Not like the 'Mad Doctor's'"tampering with that which only God should dabble!" We do have perhaps THE Classic example of the "Nature's Gone Berserk" mixing incompatible life forms.In a (once again, proverbial)nutshell, a widower, John Young(Regis Toomey)an African Planter, has been having trouble. What with working as hard as a man can to operate his huge farm/plantation and at the same time doing his best to provide his little girl,Jill(Laura Lee Michel)with a suitable and loving home life. Lacking any real playmates, the little child negotiates a trade with two natives. Showing a good knowledge of native dialect, she manages a few words and haggles with the 2 men in order to obtain the mysterious contents of a wicker basket that they were carrying. Some beads aren't enough, but when she throws in the fine item of a super neat,large, chromium metal giant of a Flashlight, the scales of a barter are tipped her way! So what if the flashlight belonged to Daddy?She obviously thought about behaving properly, as she pondered the questionably proper transaction. Her decision came out on the side of her doing it! She has a little fun with Father when he comes home, and in spite of his warnings and better judgment, the girl keeps and raises the little baby gorilla(the contents of the Natives' Basket).Meanwhile, several years ahead Show Business Impresario, Max O'Hara(Robert Armstrong)is busy in his New York Broadway Offices, planning and announcing to the world through Press Agent, "Windy"(Frank McHugh)a new type of Night Club Entertainment, with a "Darkest Africa" motif and theme!(Shades of Disneyland, Disneyworld, Busch Gardens, etc.!) O'Hara's expedition calls for taking real American Western Rodeo Cowboys, headed up by Head Cowboy "Greg"(Ben Johnson), to capture by roping the Lions needed for the show.Of course we have a collision course between Show Business and the greatest example of African Wildlife, Jill's now full grown and obviously over-sized, Gorilla, who she has raised, naming him "Joe".Being the Landlady of the Property now, since the death of her Father, it is up to her to decide what to do when the $how Bu$ine$$ Mega-Buck$ are dangled out as an offer for her (and Joe's)services. The Act and Night Club are highly successful, as the box office is kept raking in the Ca$h, as long as there is the Jovial Giant Gorilla as the main attraction.Soon there is the unavoidable collision between Nature and Civilization, between the wholesome, pure and innocent wild creature and the insatiable, gluttonous appetite of Show Business and the Public for getting their kicks and entertainment. Following a riot and stampede of Wild African Animals, a warrant to have Joe destroyed is signed by a local State Court Judge. An escape plan by O'Hara and Company ends with Joe's being a hero in saving the victim's of a fire in an Orphanage and sustaining seemingly incredibly serious bodily injuries.It may have taken some 50 years to realize the obvious, but what we have here is a sort of modern, latter day Fairy Tale. True, we don't have the Dungeons, Dragons, the Princess or the Brave Prince or the Knights in Shining Armor to act out our story. But, we do have the Modern Day, 20th Century's equivalent of those people, in the poor little (Rich)Farm Girl, the greedy Entertainment Industry and the Brave, Modern Day Mounted "Knights", the Cowboys. And without getting into it all too deeply and spilling the beans, it does have a sort of Fairy Tale Ending, sort of! The film was a co-production of John Ford &amp; Merrion C. Cooper's Argosy Pictures and RKO Radio Pictures, which also did the Release &amp; Distribution. Like its cinematic cousin, it comes by this association with RKO honestly. Merrion C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack were the Director?Producer team on both films. It is officially listed as "an ARKO Production",combining the two company names.For a film that was considered to be strictly Saturday Afternoon Matinée fodder, it must have had a considerably larger budget than most. The special effects department included the modern effects whiz, Ray Harryhausen as 1st Technician and included Project Chief Willis O'Brien and Marcel Delgado(both gaining fame and reputation on KING KONG, 16 years earlier! It won the Oscar for "Best Special Effects" at the 1950 Oscars! Like all successful films, the cast (all of the cast)is largely responsible. There is no exception here. A few more familiar names do stand out, though, like:James Flavin(the 2nd Mate in KING KONG),Douglas Fowley, Dennis Green, Paul Guilfoyle, Nestor Paiva,Mary Gordon,Iris Adrian, Ellen Corby, etc., etc., et al! There was a most interesting scene in having Show Biz Magnate O'Hara stage a "Tug of War" between "Mr.Joseph Young of Africa"(as He was being billed) and Ten(10)Strongmen. It was here that the FX boys really earned their Oscar. The whole sequence appears to be just a filmed stage show, even today, after nearly 60 years! And this band of Strongmen assembled were mostly Professional Wrestlers, they were: Sammy Menacher, Henry Culky, 'Killer' Karl Davis, Wee Willie Davis, Sammy Stein, 'Man Mountain' Dean, Ivan Rasputin, the Swedish Angel(Phil Olaffson),and Former World's Heavyweight Boxing Champion/now Pro Grappler, team anchorman,Primo Carnera. The tenth strongman was well-known Hollywood Bar owner and Super-Grip Strongman, Ian 'Mac' Batchelor. This segment is a real high-spot of the film.It proved to be a nearly perfect film to show our girls on a stormy day or half-fast School Holidays!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfairly chastised in some quarters for being a kiddie friendly King Kong, Mighty Joe Young is as charming as an Autumnal day. Many of the team from King Kong reteam to make this film, and undoubtedly it's pretty much the same plotting only with a different resolution.However, the effects work is still magical, harking back to a time when geniuses like Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen sweated buckets to make the magic move on the screen. Mighty Joe, the huge Gorilla of the title, is beautifully realised, full of expressions and emotions, he even has time for some sense of humour traits.Action is never far away, with models and sets destroyed with brute force, while plenty of beings get flung about to emphasise the madness of it all. Narratively like Kong there's still themes of greed and ignorance, the tampering with Mother Nature a big mistake, which all leads to a thrilling finale that in turn leads to something to savour.Kiddie Kong? Who cares! A wonderful film of skill and guile, of charm and brains. Go Joe Go! 8/10</fullReview>

Campy plot has Terry Moore and her humongous pet gorilla lured out of their African seclusion for stardom in the big city, but things predictably go awry. Silly, occasionally slow-moving picture with a decent cast. Moore is a good sport (if not a first-rate actress) and the effects (with help from Ray Harryhausen) are fantastic.

		<fullReview>This movie is fun and it's also touching and upsetting.The plight of "Joe Young," the mighty ape imported from Africa to an L.A. nightclub, presages two characters in two much greater French movies years later: Should this noble animal have been taken out of his native habitat and treated in an anthropomorphic manner? This is the question posed in the Truffaut's magnificent "Wild Child" regarding its title character. And the tormenting of Joe by drunks is like the plight of the poor title character in Bresson's transcendent "Balthasar." This scene will also break the heart of anyone who prizes animals.Until then it's been fun and exciting. Once that has happened, all we want is for Joe to get home, ASAP.Something seems to have been wrong with the print I saw recently. As he is being driven in a truck to a ship that will in fact take him home, suddenly the movie takes on a red tint and Joe becomes a hero recusing children from a burning building.What is the building? Could it have been off the dangerous road they've been on and on the way to the ship? It sort of girls the lily: Joe is already a hero, beloved by the viewer, who wants nothing more from this movie than a happy ending for its title character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story line similar to KING KONG, but much better than SON OF KONG. Special effects were top notch for the late 40s. A young girl, Jill Young, makes friends with a small gorilla and names him Joe. After Joe is grown, he is taken from Africa to America by a Hollywood promoter. Mighty Joe Young is a featured attraction until he is ordered to be shot because of some bad conduct.A scheme is devised to get Joe out of the country and back to his homeland. Enroute to escaping, Joe becomes a hero by saving children in a fire.Joe's antics during the escape are quite humorous. This is really a neat film to watch again. Young and old can't help but enjoy this.Jill is played by the beautiful Terry Moore. The rest of the cast is solid and well acted; Robert Armstrong, Ben Johnson, Frank McHugh and Regis Toomey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . seldom has been more truthfully depicted on the big screen than in 1949's MIGHTY JOE YOUNG. Seduced by limelight, applause, and booze, this "Gorilla Ironman" (G.I.) Joe does ALL of the work and is given NONE of the profits. Hollywood's infamous accounting methods subject him to abject poverty in an appalling condition of solitary confinement. His career is on track to be shorter than James Dean's, River Phoenix', or Heath Ledger's, as a judge orders his summary execution by firing squad at his first hint of Union Activism. Always the Rich Man's stooges, the L.A. cops are only too happy to oblige The Man. But before these murderers-by-proxy can carry out their ghastly orders, G.I. Joe detours from his escape-back-to-Africa route to rescue a handful of young girls from a burning orphanage--the only thing preventing his liquidation by the Oppressors' Tools. A few years later John Garfield (GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT), Dalton Trumbo, and the rest of the "Hollywood Ten" martyrs would NOT fare so well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Citizen Kane' of Stop-Motion Animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was released in 1949, one year prior to the beginning of the scifi/monster boom of the 1950's. In terms of genre descriptions, it is hard to pigeonhole MJY...like Disney's 'Dumbo' (1941) it is a bittersweet story of a persecuted and exploited performing animal...and like Disney's 'Song of the South' (1946) it successfully integrates animated images with footage of living performers. But I also think that the classic 1946 Cocteau version of 'Beauty and the Beast' is also an antecedent.There is a tendency among modern viewers to judge special effects from the basis of how closely they approximate the way actual film of impossible happenings would appear. Yet we do not commonly judge paintings and sculpture by a standard of photorealism. With BATB and MJY, the special effects should instead be judged by how they convey mood, personality, theme, and how they tell the story.Not only are the stop-motion-animation techniques in MJY a quantum leap from the 1933 classic King Kong, they exceed most of what Harryhausen would achieve in later projects. I make this extraordinary statement because although the Harryhausen's Technicolor mythological films are indeed spectacular, none of his later beasts conveys a personality as believable and sympathetic as that of Mighty Joe Young.In 'Citizen Kane,' RKO deconstructed the agonized materialistic persona of pre-war America. In 'Mighty Joe Young,' RKO breathed heart and soul into a puppet, reconstructing the shattered fragments of the post-war America into a form of innocence and empathy.Besides being an effective fairy tale, MJY is an incisive social satire, with the nightclub scenes being effectively a tableau of the seven deadly sins of man, with an emphasis on greed.Robert Armstrong has a couple goofy moments where comedy relief is attempted, and the sequence with him riding the mule keeps me from giving this film a '10,' but this is a small flaw, and 1949 audiences probably thought it was funny.Terri Moore has a strange face, but she is compelling and believable, and her earnestness makes us believe in Joe even more. I don't want to spoil the ending, but after seeing this film, I felt as though I, and every other viewer, had been given a very special Valentine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willis O'Brien animated the King Kong and Son of Kong as well as several other effects movies. Ray Harryhausen was hired to assist, but 3 weeks into production Obie's son committed suicide, which devastated him, and he spent most of his time in his office, not doing the stop motion work. This became Harryhausens first 'heavy lifting' assignment. Ray did about 75% of the stop motion work. Joe's trait of pounding the ground with is fist when he was mad or trying to threaten was created by Ray. Even in 1948-9 Ray Harryhausen's talents as animator was evident. He created the personality of Joe in the way he animated. Joe is much more of a 'real' character than Kong ever was. This is why, as you watch the end of the movie you may have a tear in your eye as Joe rescues the orphans from the burning orphanage.</fullReview>

How could anyone expect to think ropes would hold a 25 foot tall, 2 ton gorilla? And the soundtrack is odd, with obvious editing, and voices spliced in.And the scene where the 3 drunkards are harassing Joe in his cell, it is not credible that anyone, even when drunk would be so bold. And the 10 incredible strong people, who think they might be stronger than Joe, one so confident he even slugs Joe on the chin.However, it all works for me. It is one of my favorite movies, its quirkiness is consistent throughout. There are no slow scenes or wasted dialogue.It is a pleasant diversion from more serious undertakings.

The similarities are there for all to see, director Schoedsack directed King Kong, actor Robert Armstrong plays virtually the same character who tries to exploit Kong/Joe for his own gain, Ruth Ross provided the scripts for both films while both were produced by Merian C. Cooper &amp; of course not to mention both King Kong &amp; Mighty Joe Young revolve around huge Gorillas who both have special feelings for a blonde, both are transported to the US &amp; exploited, both escape &amp; go on a rampage &amp; both end with their hairy over-sized stars climbing up large structures. However Mighty Joe Young is so much more than just a rehash, while it doesn't feature any other monsters or the terrific Skull Island expedition &amp; certainly is softer in tone it's a a very enjoyable fast paced monster film with some truly mesmerising scenes &amp; special effects. Forget about films like Independence Day (1996) &amp; The Matrix (1999) this was the special effects Hollywood blockbuster of it's day just as those other two films are now. The story is good, it's maybe a bit predictable &amp; there's a slightly sweet sugary happy ending but I must admit I was captivated by every minute of it.The sheer magic of Mighty Joe Young has to go down to stop motion animators Willis O'Brien &amp; Ray Harryhausen who work miracles here. Some of the effects work is truly amazing, from spectacularly animated scenes of Joe running in Africa with a heard of Elephants to the scene when Max &amp; his men try to lasso him to the nightclub scene where he runs amok climbing support pillars, swinging on ropes &amp; fighting Lions to a scene where he leans out of the back of a moving truck or the amusing tug O'war scene to the magical image of Joe holding a huge platform above his head with Jill on it playing the piano &amp; singing Beautiful Dreamer or the sequence when Joe gets angry &amp; smashes the door to his cell open. Each effects sequence seems to have had so much care &amp; attention lavished on it, stop motion animation is a laborious task &amp; it's clear the effects guy's who worked on Mighty Joe Young loved the process. Deservedly Mighty Joe Young won an Oscar for best special effects in 1950. But that's not all since they saved the best for last as Joe rescues several children from a burning building as it crashes down around him, another truly spectacular scene which is just one of many. The animators give Joe real personality &amp; sympathy, you really feel for the big guy. Unlike King Kong which was fairly horrific at times Mighty Joe Young has more of a heart &amp; tones the horror elements down. Filmed in black and white it's also available in a computer colourised version.Technically the film is impressive with some truly dazzling special effects scenes although the films depiction of Africa &amp; it's natives is poor with very flat fake looking painted backdrops. Certain shots in the cowboys in Africa sequence were apparently taken from footage originally shot for a King Kong sequel which was never completed. A sequel called Joe Meets Tarzan was planned to be made in 1950 but the box-office failure of Mighty Joe Young meant the project was canned &amp; never made. The acting is fine, it's a little wooden at times like a lot of these early films are but it's alright.Mighty Joe Young is for all intents &amp; purposes a King Kong rip-off but it's a bloody damned good King Kong rip-off, while not quite as wonderful as King Kong it's not too far behind. Remade to less than stunning effect as Mighty Joe Young (1998), definitely watch this one instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong without the sad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could also be titled, "A tale of four giant monkey movies", since MJY and KK were both given remakes in recent years (for this review, I'll ignore the unfortunate 1976 KK remake). The plots for each is, by now, pretty much familiar to most people, although MJY has been overshadowed by KK. This is a pity. Growing up, I always loved this film. I liked the original KK, too, but always thought it took itself just a little too seriously. Also, as a child, I really didn't like that Kong was killed at the end. Kids don't really appreciate tragedy.MJY has the heart and humor that KK lacked. Some would complain about maudlin sentimentality, and it does require a certain innocence to appreciate it. I was fortunate enough to first see it at an age when I still had that innocence. I'm not ashamed to admit that I can still see it that way after all these years. Disney remade MJY in 1998, but some of the innocence and charm were lost in translation. The '98 version was a very forgettable film and an unworthy successor to the original.Comparisons to KK as well as the '98 remake are inevitable though, so let's address them (WARNING: some spoilers ahead)...KK is pretty much a straightforward action film with interludes of unconvincing romance. The acting in KK is really quite awful. (Although Robert Armstrong plays pretty much the same part in MJY that he played in KK, he does it better in MJY.) But then, all of the human actors in KK are pretty wooden, and not helped all that well by the script. (Peter Jackson's KK remake is excellent, crippled only by the poor choice of Jack Black to play the Carl Denham character.) By comparison, MJY also blends action and romance, but adds some notes of humor and sentiment. All of these have held up well over the years. One of the big differences between the original and the '98 remake is that the original seems more genuine in context. The original is really good storytelling, but the remake seems built on the same plot framework, but designed to appeal to focus group audiences. The acting in MJY is still inferior to the remake, but that's not enough to detract from the charm of the story. Peter Jackson obviously had some of the same feelings about the two that I did since he added some moments of lightness and sentiment to his KK remake that the original lacked.KK's great weakness is that its "moral" is hopelessly naive from a modern perspective. "Beauty killed the beast" is not only corny, it ignores that what really killed Kong was human greed and meddling with the natural world. Both KK remakes have picked up on this. By contrast, MJY is a "fish out of water" movie where both Joe and Jill are seduced by a society they're too innocent to understand. As great storytelling, you root for them to be able to go home, and the story obliges in the end. Unlike KK, the moral of MJY is every bit as relevant today as the day it was made.One weakness of the MJY plot is that Joe is, essentially, Jill's pet. Although this enhances the charm of the story, it detracts from its message about nature. No, Joe isn't a house pet, but he's still clearly domesticated. That Kong is just as clearly a wild animal enhances the sense of dread in KK's action sequences. KK turns that relationship on its ear, the making Ann Darrow character Kong's pet. One major difference between the original KK and Peter Jackson's remake is that the original suggested that the relationship between Kong and Ann was sexual on some level. The remake depicted Kong as a lonely creature and his pet human as a welcome companion.I have to make one final observation, unrelated to reviews of any of these films... I find it fascinating to see the effect that these giant monkey movies had on the careers of their female leads. Without KK, no one today would be likely to remember Fay Wray. Alone among these actresses, Terry Moore was most likely to have been remembered, but more for her relationship with Howard Hughes than her work in MJY. The '76 KK remake launched the career of Jessica Lange just as the MJY remake launched the career of Charlize Theron. It will be interesting to see how Naomi Watts' career progresses after the latest KK remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Torch Is Passed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mighty Joe Young" was the third of Producer Merian C. Cooper's giant ape trilogy following "King Kong" and "Son of Kong" both released in 1933. It was directed by Cooper's old pal Ernest B. Schoedsack, who also had directed the first two. At this time Cooper was producing pictures in partnership with John Ford. Ford's influence can be seen in this film. Ford's protégé of the time, Ben Johnson is cast in the lead, Ford regular Jack Pennick appears in a bit as a truck driver and the "Fordian" humor is evident, particularly in the nightclub sequence.Robert Armstrong, who had played a similar role in the Kongs, returns as Max O'Hara a fast talking promoter who was reportedly based on producer Cooper. This film also marked the passing of the torch from legendary stop motion animator Willis O'Brien to the then young Ray Harryhausen.The film opens in Africa where the young Jill Young "buys" a baby gorilla and names him Joe. Fast forward 12 years where Max O'Hara is planning to go to Africa to capture wild animals for his African themed restaurant. A young wrangler, Glenn Johnson (Ben Johnson) applies for a job and accompanies the group to the Dark Continent. Suddenly their camp is turned upside down by the now 12 foot tall "Mighty Joe Young". Amid the confusion, the now grown Jill (Terry Moore) emerges and calms the ape.O'Hara seeing an opportunity, convinces the girl to bring the ape to America to perform in his nightclub. Along the way Jill and Glenn become an item. Following a successful introduction in "civilization", Joe is taunted by three drunks (Douglas Fowley, Nestor Paiva, Paul Guilfoyle). They then sneak down to where the gorilla is caged and feed him liquor. Well..you know what happens next. Joe escapes and runs amok in the nightclub, releasing the lions and wrecking the joint.Jill, Glenn and O'Hara seeing the plight of Joe decide to take him back to his home. The police having been ordered to destroy the beast in pursue them. Along the way, they come upon a fire (filmed in a red sepia tone) in a children's orphanage. Joe becomes a hero and everyone lives happily ever after.One cannot comment upon "Mighty Joe Young" without praising the special effects. Under the supervision of O'Brien, Harryhausen creates some amazing effects. Gone are the jerky movements of the Kongs. The facial expressions of the ape are simply amazing. Its movements are very realistic and convincing. The wrecking of the nightclub and the orphanage sequence are unbelievable. In spite of the sanitized script (no one is actually killed), the effects carry the day.For both Johnson and Moore, this was their first leading roles. Johnson who at this time as an actor made a great cowboy, went on to a distinguished career lasting almost 50 years (including an Oscar in 1971). Moore, who provides an informed commentary (along with Harryhausen)on the DVD, became more famous for her alleged marriage to the then middle aged playboy, Howard Hughes.Also on board are Frank McHugh as O'Hara's assistant, Regis Toomey as Jill's father and a number of then famous wrestlers playing the strongmen in the night club sequence: Primo Carnera, Carl "Killer" Davis, William "Wee Willie" Davis, Man Mountain Dean and Henry Kulky who went on to a acting career of his own. Also watch for Ellen Corby and Charles Lane in bits.Not in the same class as "King Kong" but an entertaining film nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Kong movie with a Different Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is in the same vein as King Kong in that an unscrupulous promoter sees making money in using a big gorilla in his shows, but this movie unlike King Kong and Son of Kong has a happy ending . The plot starts in Africa where little Jill (Lora Lee Michel) trades her father's flashlight for a baby gorilla. This gorilla grows up to be the 12 ft tall Mighty Joe Young. Club owner Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) goes on a safari and encounters Joe, and decides to bring him back State side (this time the scene is set in LA not New York) by talking Jill (Terry Moore) into a contract. Joe and Jill performs in a club act, but both are not happy with the city life, and decides to go home. Around this time, unsatisfied customers offers Joe a bottle of drink which after Joe goes on a rampage, and court orders him terminated. Jill, Gregg (Ben Johnson) , and Max plots an escape for Joe. Police comes after them, and during the getaway, Joe ends up saving hand full of children from a burning building. His worthiness proved, Joe, and Jill goes back to Africa accompanied by now fiancé Gregg.Terry Moore plays the part of Jill, and she's great in her role. Her voice is so wonderful when she shouts "No, Joe", "Put him down Joe !". No wonder Howard Hughes fell for her. This movie is great because the giant ape finally gets a happy ending. Sort of a return match for Kong where he finally gets the good ending he deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mighty Good Show and Great Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, Mighty Joe Young is a better movie that the original King Kong. In the olden days, we didn't have television, in fact, television wasn't ever thought of being in the homes, so you had to go to the movie theater's to see anything moving on a screen, and on the big screen things moved. Dad told me once that when King Kong was playing at the local theater, he was standing outside the theater when Kong appeared on the screen and the next thing he heard was a lot of screaming and people running out of the theater screaming for their lives, but not so with Mighty Joe Young. The public loved it, and so did I, but there's a Little more to the movie than people are aware of.Terry Moore is a Momon and she dated Howard Hughes, and Hughes owned R.K.O. and, of course, she was perfect for the part of Jill, but how much did Mormonism fit into the movie? A Mighty Fortress is Our God, is a favorite Momon Hymn, so you get the word "Mighty". Joseph Smith was the founding father of Mormonism, so you get the name Joseph, or actually "Joe", and Brigham Young was the second head of the church; so you get the name "Young", so put them all together and you get "Mighty Joe Young" the name of the movie, and by the way, Joseph Young was the name of one of Brigham Youngs son, so that's another way they could have come up with the name of the ape. So, there was have been, if not by Terry Moore herself, some influence on the picture from other Mormons involved in the movies creation. But, it is of note that when Might Joe Young makes his first appearance on the stage with Terry Moore playing "Beautiful Dreamer", another favorite amongst Mormons, Joe is introduced as Mr. Joseph Young! But, no matter how much influence the Mormons and Terry Moore had on the film, it's a great film and will always be one of the greats and bravo for its restoration! Later, Terry Moore was married to Howard Hughes on his yacht, and proved it in the courts by producing the original marriage certificate!For years, Terry Moore played very virginal parts in films, but it was her playing of the town whore in Payton Place starring Lana Turner, that she finally got to drop that virginal type role that she was so known for in her Hollywood years. Yes, she's still living!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a movie it's pretty awful, but Harryhausen fans take note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mighty Joe Young (1949)Wow, there sure are some silly moments and bad acting in this movie--and yet I watched it to the end! Why? For the story itself (I love the King Kong idea) and for the campy fun of it. It's actually pretty horrible, and the special effects are interesting but not exactly convincing, so I would recommend not seeing this movie unless you are especially into the genre. The director, Ernest B. Schoedsack, is the very same Schoedsack who directed the original King Kong way back in 1933, but after a series of similar adventure films in the 1930s, he had been inactive for nearly a decade before getting involved here.The story we've seen before--big ape taken from the jungles of Africa to become a stage act for a impresario of dubious character. The acting is terrible terrible. Say no more there (okay, Robert Armstrong isn't quite terrible). The effects, for all their Harryhausen fame, are pretty basic, though there are a lot of them (the ape, but also lions behind glass, and some mutilation to the lions, PETA folk and other decent people beware). Remember this isn't the early 1930s, when the effects for King Kong were pretty amazing in that context. This is post-war America. The fact that everything has to be created by hand and matte shot (double exposed in a selective way) does make it impressive, but even if you like Harryhausen's efforts, the rest of the movie will likely let you down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging &amp; Child-like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to its predecessors in the giant ape genre, Mighty Joe Young is rather a tame film, but the old Cooper-Schoedsack-Willis O'Brien charm is still evident in its every frame. There's a engaging and child-like feel for exotic places and things that's been largely killed off over the years by mass media and air travel, and the movie has for me a sort of wide-eyed boys' book quality that still works. In this respect the film is rather like the Tarzans and the Maria Montez-Sabu-Dorothy Lamour jungle and island pictures, full of a love for the exotic and faraway, anything unlike Main Street, USA. As the story of yet another giant ape and his problems with 'civilization' it's okay but nothing special; that so much of it is played for laughs is all for the good. Mr. Young's rampage in the nightclub is still something to see; breathtaking and funny, it is in some ways the movie's climax. There's a bigger sequence to come, however, as an orphanage is (conveniently) burning down, which gives Joe a chance to show what a humanitarian he is despite his temper. The movie is awfully sentimental at times, and though it's a kind of sentiment I can live with and even sometimes share, it does seem to indicate a lessening of the creative powers of the men behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mighty Joe Young</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had already seen the 1998 Disney remake with Charlize Theron and Bill Paxton, so I had a rough idea what to expect with this black and white original version, directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack (King Kong). Basically in 1937 Tanganyika Territory, Africa, eight-year- old Jill Young (Lora Lee Michel) lives with her father John Young (Regis Toomey) on his ranch, she and two Africans come across an orphaned baby gorilla, Jill really wants a pet, her father allows her to care for for the gorilla. Twelve years later, talkative and persuasive promoter Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) with his sidekick, Oklahoma cowboy Gregg (Ben Johnson), are on a trip to Africa looking for new animal attractions to headline O'Hara's new Hollywood nightclub. They capture several lions and prepare to leave, but then out of the blue they see a huge 12 foot gorilla, they try to capture the creature, but are stopped when now teenage Jill Young (Terry Moore) rescues them from the beast harming them. Jill explains about her connection with the gorilla, named Joseph "Joe" Young , Gregg is smitten with ill, while Max seduces her with the thought of a fancy life, fame and fortune if she signs a contract for her and Joe to come with them and become the star attraction of his nightclub. A short time later, back in Hollywood, the nightclub opens and Joe makes his stage debut, with Jill by his side to keep him calm, the audience reaction is staggering and Joe's popularity grows, but the high life is not quite what Jill pictured. Jill realises that Joe is unhappy and asks Max to arrange her return to Africa, he does persuade to stay a little longer in show business, but three alcoholic customers give booze to Joe, causing him to rage and break out of his holding cage in a violent temper. Joe is sentenced by the justice to be destroyed, Jill, Max and Gregg do everything possible to find him before the authorities, it comes to a point when Joe reaches an orphanage that gets set on fire, he rescues some of the children and appears to be harmed, but in the end he is safe and sound, and returns to Africa with Jane, and Gregg joins them, they send a goodbye message to Max. Also starring Frank McHugh as Windy, Douglas Fowley as Jones, Denis Green as Crawford, Paul Guilfoyle as Smith and Nestor Paiva as Brown. The story is a obviously a variation on the King Kong tale, made much more schmaltzy, but it does have the fantastic work of stop- motion animation genius Ray Harryhausen to create the giant gorilla and his movements, all in all I prefer the remake, but this classic original is an alright fantasy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Effects, Special Effects. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot. The movie's action galore. When I was a kid we all wanted to see it once the lavish promos started. But I guess I didn't have the money. Anyway, t finally caught up with the flick the other day. Okay, my viewing now wasn't with a 9-year old's eyes, but for this geezer it was still a lot of fun. Note (unless I missed something) that no one dies despite all the havoc in the nightclub. That's important because it allows Joe to go home without some kind of moral retribution, unlike Kong, for instance. (I suspect the Production Code applied to human-like simians as well as the standard human being.)Anyhow, apart from the matte backgrounds the special effects are great, even if Joe's size does vary as IMDb points out. Narrative and acting don't count for much here since they're not the draw. Plus the comedic efforts are feeble, to say the least. Nonetheless, the action sequences are riveting, while Joe-- or should I say Harryhausen-- manages a degree of human-like pathos. All in all, I'm glad I finally caught up with the flick even if many years later. And speaking of catching things, it was about 1949 when cutie Miss Moore caught bigger game than a thousand pound gorilla. That is, she managed to throw a matrimonial net over that elusive 10,000-pound bachelor, Howard Hughes. So move over Joe!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant re-tred of "King Kong" told from a different perspective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't expect anything but entertainment in this fast-paced sweet film about the friendship between a young woman and the giant gorilla she has raised since it was a baby and she was a very young girl. In the beginning, we see how she bought the baby gorilla and somehow convinced her father to let her keep it. He warns her that it is going to grow up to be 700 pounds of danger, but it ends up being more like 7000 pounds of gentleness towards her, only vicious either when strangers show up uninvited or when given alcohol. Baby Joe Young is SOOO cute it would be hard to resist him, but for some explained reason, he ends up being more than twice the size of any normal gorilla. Lora Lee Michel, a child actress of impressive credits who somehow ended up forgotten, is the young girl who grows up to be the attractive Terry Moore. The men who show up include "King Kong" veteran Robert Armstrong, handsome Ben Johnson, and comical Frank McHugh, playing basically the same part he played for years in all those Bogart and Cagney movies at Warner Brothers. They convince Moore to come to America with them so Joe (the gorilla) can be featured in their huge spectacular. And what a spectacular it is. As a piano begins to rise off the stage, it is not thanks to a spring underneath, but Joe responding to his favorite song, "Beautiful Dreamer", which he used to take his naps to. The show is a smash hit, but Joe becomes homesick for Africa and freedom while living in a cage. He even appears to have tears in his eyes, which is heartbreaking. All the while, you'll be praying for a happy ending, knowing that somehow he's going to cause havoc, and thanks to some drunks who give him some booze, he does. Joe is seen destroying the fake jungle set, tossing lions about as if they were ragdolls, and fortunately saving one of the drunks by saving him from a lion about to devour him. But Joe is deemed dangerous and sentenced to be shot. What happens then can be considered far-fetched and beyond belief, but because the film has such a light-hearted charm, it's acceptable.This may not be as sophisticated as "King Kong" or even "Son of Kong", but it's totally enjoyable. The special effects using miniatures are very easy to spot by the sophisticated eye, but somehow it doesn't matter. This was early Ray Harryhausen at work, and it's easy to see the genius that was later prevalent in his films of the 60's and 70's, and of course, his most famous work with "Clash of the Titans". Animal rights activists might have a hard time watching some of the gruesome sequences involving Joe and the lions, as well as the way poor Joe is exploited, but there is a great pay-off that indicates that the writers were opposed to such treatments of circus animals and zoos that didn't give the animals a natural habitat to reside in. Seeing these society folks (which include bits by Irene Ryan of "Beverly Hillbillies" and the very recognizable Charles Lane) watch this show makes you wonder who is the real beast-man or the animals of the wild? The scene where they are tossing what appear to be frisbees at Joe is difficult to stomach. The spooky Madame Sul-Te-Wan, best known for her role as Tituba in "Maid of Salem", is also instantly recognizable as Moore's African housekeeper.IMPORTANT SPOILER AHEAD: The chase sequence at the end is of course far-fetched, especially when they stumble across a huge schoolhouse on fire. But this of course we know is meant by the plot to save Joe's life, and seeing the sequence in tinted red makes it all the more riveting. I just had to allow my heart to fully engulf this plot twist and overlook my normal sensibilities. Joe comes out a hero and is given back his freedom, which is all that matters, unlike poor Kong who had to topple off the Empire State Building to create more potholes on the corner of 5th Avenue and 34th Street. This film doesn't advance the art of special effects, but does leave the message that we are meant to share this world with a variety of other animals, and we should respect their habitats and leave them to their world as they leave us to ours.</fullReview>

However a showbiz guy finds them and offers Jill a chance to be in the showbiz with Joe. Jill wasn't too sure about it but she went for it eventually as long as Joe will be happy.They moved to Hollywood at a tropical Night club. They put up some great shows. But Joe Young isn't feeling great about himself after some humiliating performances. He dislikes the cage he's in too.After a bad accident at the night club Jill and the showbiz guy decide to get Joe out to here. But it would be risky with the police on about.Mighty Joe Young is a classic. Has the same special effects from King Kong and Son of Kong. It's also done by the same people who made King Kong possible. Those who like King Kong might like Mighty Joe Young as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Fantasy From Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With King Kong turning a profit with re-releases as late as 1946, RKO brought back much of the production team for the similarly themed Mighty Joe Young including the co-director of the 1933 masterpiece; Ernest Schoedsack. Stop motion animator extraodinaire Willis O'Brien designed the special effects and delegated much of the physical aspects of the work to Ray Harryhausen who's own expertise in the field would become the stuff of Hollywood legend. Mighty Joe Young is a gentle but enormous gorilla taken from his African home to perform at a night club cabaret while in captivity. His spectacular escape and thrilling adventure at a burning orphanage are but two of the unforgettable sights which catapult this wonderful fantasy to the heights of a genuine classic. Although it never made a dime in theatres, Mighty Joe Young is remembered with much affection and was later remade by Disney. An Oscar winner for visual effects.</fullReview>

It is Ray Harryhausen's Debut Stop Motion Work (reports are that Willis O'Brien, the genius behind Kong, mostly supervised), and Won the Oscar for SFX.It is a Simple Story that Consistently Tugs at the Heartstrings and is a Rousing Romp that is Fast Paced and Genuinely Engrossing. There are Many Highlights with One just Topping the Other as the Movie Moves Along with a Stupendous Eye-Popping Climax where Joe Saves the Day. There is a Sweet Childlike Quality that Works on Many Levels of Emotion and the Film is as Exciting as it is Heartbreaking and then Reassuringly Heartwarming.

		<fullReview>King Kong (1933) showed that giant apes could be excellent box office. Having misfired with Son Of Kong, the team of Cooper, Schoedsack, Rose, O'Brien and actor Robert Armstrong dipped the pail in the giant ape well one more time, and came up with this tale of an over-sized gorilla in the big city. The differences with Kong are major, though - Joe is big but not Kong-sized. Though most of the action takes place in the USA, Joe (gorilla) and Jill (Terry Moore, human) became close as youngsters in Africa. And Joe, though misunderstood, is essentially good hearted.Most of the story concerns Joe's misadventures as a quasi-celebrity and then on the run and, given that Joe is a sympathetic character, we care what happens to him throughout. Willis O'Brien, the man who animated King Kong, is in charge of the animation, but delegated most of it to Ray Harryhausen who puts his own stamp on his first professional job.Might Joe Young is somewhat dated, but is still an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong's good natured younger cousin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Merian C. Cooper wanted to make a giant gorilla picture, and as he did with SON OF KONG, the showman wisely chose not to top his 1933 classic (although the stop motion destruction scenes are unparalleled), but to have fun with it. MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a fast paced fantasy-comedy-thriller about a gentle simian giant raised on an African plantation by a young girl (Terry Moore). A Carl Denham-clone stage producer named Max (the always energetic Robert Armstrong, this time sporting an awful toupee) coaxes Jill to bring Joe to Los Angeles where he features the giant ape in a night club routine. The crazy skits Max dreams up for Jill and Mighty Joe resemble Barnum and Bailey on crack! (The tug of war between Joe and a line up of beefy muscle men is 100% entertainment overdrive!) Joe finally goes berserk, and tears the club apart. There's a court order to have him killed, but Max and Jill brainstorm an escape, and the mad chase is on.John Ford is credited as a second unit director. (I'd love to know what scenes!) There are amusing cameo appearances by Hollywood supporting actors like Charles Lane, Edward Gargan, and Jack Pennick. MIGHTY JOE YOUNG's highlight is the stop motion work, most of it by young Ray Harryhausen. His work here is some of the best animation you'll ever see. The fist-fight between Joe and former heavyweight champion Primo Carnera, Joe's rampage through the club (complete with animated lions, drunks, and debris), and the climactic fire sequence, help make MIGHTY JOE YOUNG a high-caffeine treat.I have to mention how "film-logic" fuels MIGHTY JOE YOUNG's third act. Joe is in a stolen van, being chased by angry policemen who are gaining on him. Suddenly they come across a burning orphanage, and Joe redeems himself by rescuing the trapped kids. (With my luck, if I was helping Joe escape, I'd come upon a burning maximum security prison with death row inmates waiting for a rescue!) While Joe lies there injured, after having rescued the last screaming tot, Jill is assured by her boyfriend (warmly played by Ben Johnson) that "Nobody's gonna shoot Joe now!" Uh, excuse me, Benny, there's a court order to shoot Joe! Are you a lawyer?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mighty Good Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Different and monstrous does not necessarily mean bad. Mighty Joe, a Mutant Nubian Gorilla is brought to the United States as a sideshow freak. After winning a tug of war between about 10 strongmen of that day, amongst them, the swedish angel and primo carnera, several of Joe's keepers get him drunk, then he breaks his cell and goes on a rampage. The Police want him exterminated, along the lines of a rabid dog. But after he selflessly [or should I say, simianlessly] rescues a little girl from a fire, the police think diferently of it and see to it personally that MJY and his keepers are returned to Africa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Big Ape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Moore stars as Jill Young, a young woman who has raised a gorilla named Joseph Young, who has grown quite large in her care. When nightclub owner Max O'Hara(played by Robert Armstrong) and his cowboy employee Gregg(played by Ben Johnson) find Joe, they persuade Jill to sign a contract and head for Hollywood, where Joe becomes the star attraction. Sadly, he isn't happy in captivity(can't blame him!) and after three drunken idiots humiliate Joe, he escapes and becomes the dogged pursuit of a manhunt, but Joe will come to the rescue when an orphanage is on fire...Good-natured film is hurt by extreme familiarity, since this had been done before and better in "King Kong". Not bad, but mediocre film is mostly good for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just don't know....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start by saying that this movie came to my attention because of Ray Harryhausen, not because of the 90s remake.I didn't even know about the remake until after I discovered this. Anyway, I have tried to watch this movie three times but I can't make it past the first scene.It's so unrealistic and filled with bad acting that I keep rewinding and can not make it any further.For some reason a little white girl lives in the African jungle and her father leaves her alone all day, already off to a bad start.Of course the girl doesn't have a mother, children in old movies never do.Two savages walk past the house carrying a small basket on a large stick.The basket contains a monkey but that doesn't even matter.Why would it take two of them to carry the basket?It could have easily been carried in one hand.And why do they wear diapers?So the girl runs out to stop them and see what they have and here's where any sign of reality goes out the window.She wants to buy the monkey and runs back in the house to get jewels.While she's gone the two men rub the stick and it's very weird.Even though they don't speak English, they seem to understand everything she says.They turn down the deal of jewels for the monkey and turnaround,heading back in the direction they came from.WHAT??!?!?Then she adds a flashlight to the deal and they immediately agree!WHAT??!?!I guess they know where to get batteries in the 1940s jungle.But the real shocker is that the savages don't rape,murder or kidnap the little girl.Which is mind blowing.I don't see how anyone could ever watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monster-sized schmaltz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're an enormous fan of Willis O'Brien and his work, then do watch this film as it contains some of the best integration of stop-motion animation and live action you'll see in any film. Alas, even that plus is spoilt for me by the model of Mighty Joe Young, who's made to look more like a bemused teddy bear than a ferocious gorilla (his ancestor, Kong, has bags more character in that respect). If you're hoping for a decent story with some sympathetic characters, don't expect any of that from the human actors. This is a big slice of schmaltz, woodenly scripted and very poorly paced dramatically, guaranteed to send you back to the 1933 version of King Kong with all the more admiration and gratitude for what that earlier film achieved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innovative in 1933, to me this just looked very dated...though the story was enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mighty Joe Young" is a fun, escapist movie. However, as I sat and watched it, I couldn't help but think that the much more famous "King Kong" (completed 16 years earlier) looked a heck of a lot better. For example, the matte paintings used through much of the film look much less realistic--they looked just like paintings. In "King Kong", they had an other worldly look that was priceless--such as the great looking Skull Island. Also, as Joe the gorilla ran about, the background images looked like they were projected on a movie screen behind it--and looked much more fake than it should have. You would have thought after all those years that this all would have looked a lot better. However, I do seem to be in the minority here, as MANY of the other reviews talked about how great the effects looked! I stand by my opinion--this should have been a lot better.The film is very much like a reworking of "King Kong". Like "Kong", it stars Robert Armstrong and also is about a big gorilla--though Joe is minuscule compared to Kong. Joe's big compared to a gorilla but only about 15 feet tall--not the HUGE creature Kong was. Also, Joe is NOT the dangerous and scary monster that Kong was--he's a beloved pet of a girl living in Africa. When they are discovered by Armstrong, they agree to come to America to go on tour. There, they become a huge hit. Sadly, however, poor Joe and the girl soon tire of this life and long to go back home. Then tragedy strikes and,...well, you should see what happens next for yourself.The biggest difference between Kong and Joe is far more than size. Joe is a nice-guy--and the film is very much like a child-friendly giant ape film. He doesn't eat anyone, doesn't kill any creature and is VERY family-friendly. In other words, while enjoyable, Joe is also a bit dull! I know a lot of people loved the film, but I wanted a bit more violence and mayhem instead of the sweet, lovable creature we see in this film. This, combined with the fair special effects make this a pale shadow of Kong. Enjoyable, certainly, but it could have been so much better without the schmaltz.By the way, what is with that scene in the nightclub where everyone is tossing things at Joe to torment him?! This made little sense and just seemed awful and out of place. And what followed really didn't make a whole lotta sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont like these ape run amock movies. Even the old original King Kong, its good, but its really kind of a waste of time. I also really dont see much of an improvement on the special effects of the orginal either. And whats with the title anyway? I still don't get it. Anyway the thing that stands out about this, apart from my parents bizarre fascination in watching it whenever it was on, is the scene with the lions. I swear they abused real animals to make this film. The ape gets drunk tears up this chic jungle nightclub that has about 20 lions behind glass. He smashes the glass and starts killing the poor things? It was so disturbing as a kid, and when i watch it now, it still is!! You are supposed to like this damn monkey? Gimme a break. I see they remade it, I'll bet that cost a few jobs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SON OF KONG was even better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate MIGHTY JOE YOUNG. I liked the special effects, but other than that the movie was downright horrible. The pacing was all off. The story was pointless. The timing was horrific. The acting, by some good actors, was downright bad. It was corny and it was lame. I mean, they just happen to come upon a big house burning down... and lo and behold, it's an orphan's home. And the drunks who get Joe drunk all act drunk like they're in cartoons with that overdone twisted way of talking like they should be in a mental hospital. And the lions were lame, and not scary. And the ending was really, really, really bad, the very ending where Joe's name is written in the clouds. And the very beginning, where the little girl, the biggest overacting child actor I've ever witnessed, is talking to some hunters, man is that a bore. This movie is downright painful to watch. And as bad as SON OF KONG is, I still like that one more; it's more enjoyable, more relaxing, and there are way better fights because there are dinosaurs and giant bears and you can at least have a good time. But this film was just pointless. It's sappy and tiresome. No on Joe.</fullReview>
