		<fullReview>Wow, I've just watched it. Probably, it'd be better to just lay back, think about the movie and, only after cooling down on emotions, review it.But not this one."Pusher" tells us the story of, perhaps, the worst week of Frank's life, a 'middleweight' dealer caught in an unpayable debt to pay to Eastern European type mafia. And as his story unfolds, your blood pressure will rise just like the incredible tension increasing throughout the movie. No wonder, the debt grows higher and higher every day. Will Frank be able to ever repay it? Its just like the tag-line says:"You've got no chance! Grab it!" The fresh thing about this movie is that it shows what is actually happening somewhere in the middle of the 'food-chain' of drug dealing. Not at the top, covered by movies such as Casino, Scarface, Blow, or any other high budget movie made in Hollywood. After all Copenhagen is just not a world of amazing luxury and incredible piles of coke here and there. But the movie doesn't follow another cliché' either. It doesn't show us the bottom, where junkies scavenge on each other, sell their mothers for a gram of heroin, a topic which is usually covered by some low-budget off-movies.Pusher is the ultimate, pure, refined truth about drug dealing. I have a personal experience, myself being for a time an immigrant into Denmark (I've never been a criminal or ever wanted to be, though, just to clarify that matter). And some guys, that I've came across upon coming here, went into this businesses and well, they all hit rock bottom. OK, the movie is hard to get into with its dramatic realism, but I assure you: this movie is as close to coarse truth and gritty reality as it gets!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding, realistic crime film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really good film, one of the most realistic films about drugs and the criminal underworld I've ever seen. The film examines a week in the life of a mid-level drug dealer on the streets of Copenhagen and pulls no punches. Kim Bodina gives a great, nuanced performance as Frank, the dealer and main character. He captures perfectly the snaky charisma, emotional detachment and nihilism of a street dealer. Frank is essentially a sociopath, turning on the charm when it suits him and turning a blind eye on the people in his life when they can't be of any use to him. Especially effective is the portrayal of Frank's relationship with Vic, the high priced call girl he obviously cares about but can't bring himself to get physical with because of his emotional coldness. Frank blames this dilemma on her work, suggesting he can't touch her because she's a whore. However it's Vic he always turns to when things go bad.And things go very bad very quickly for Frank. Through a series of miscalculations and bad luck, he finds himself indebted to a slimy dealer higher on the food chain who's patronizing attitude barely conceals a violent streak. As the week progresses, Frank spirals downward into a desperate attempt to fix his broken life. Trusts are broken, violence and mayhem ensue, and the film finishes on a surprising but perfect note.The director, Nicolas Winding Refn, shows a good command of pacing and camera work. The real star of the film, however is the script. There is never a moment of Pusher that doesn't seem utterly real. Though many may find this film dark and depressing (I won't argue), I think it's strong acting and excellent direction make it well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A week in the life of a pusher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm facing a bit of a problem here: what the hell can I possibly say about a film that left me completely speechless? Brilliant "Pusher" is prosaic and extremely realistic movie. It's made to look almost like a documentary. One week in the life of a man who makes his living by pushing drugs isn't basically anything so nice to watch but "Pusher" is just so upbeat, strong, rough and exciting little movie. It's impossible to ignore it just because it's a portrayal of a truly repulsive and violent lifestyle.Minute by minute the film becomes more and more tense and a viewer starts to wait how dirty can it get and is there any solution ahead or does it all end as it's logical to expect. Well, there's no easy way out. "Pusher" shows that it doesn't matter if you're a drug user or a pusher or even both, it's life and death anyway. Actors make the enjoyment prefect. Excellent and impressive Danish thriller that simply won't leave you cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MEAN STREETS, Danish style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PUSHER (Nicolas Winding Refn - Denmark 1996)A genuinely original and completely fresh take on the gangster genre by first time Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, giving us an insight in the live of Frankie, a lowlife Copenhagen drug-pusher. The film follows his day-to-day pusher-routine during a crucial week in his life but in this particular week things go wrong, as he sets up a heroine deal with a former mate of him, that goes completely bust because the police was informed. He is arrested but is released soon. Problem is, he lost the drugs AND a lot of money and now owes big time to one of the most dangerous criminals in town, a Balkan low-life Yugoslav mafia type, named Milo. Now he desperately tries to find money to repay him in what is very likely to be the last week of his life.There must have been some buzz about this movie when it came out in 1996, but it completely passed me by. Luckily I managed to catch up at the 2006 International Film Festival Rotterdam when hordes of people were attending a screening of the complete Pusher-trilogy ( a bit too much for me at the time, it was sold out anyway). At the same time, Nicolas Winding Refn, was giving an intriguing interview for quite a huge crowd. He had a very dry sense of humor and a scene from MEAN STREETS by Martin Scorsese was shown as his main inspiration for this film, so it stuck with me and I simply had to see it for myself.A tense, exciting storyline, executed in a raw almost documentary-like fashion with a hand-held camera, this film grabs you by the collar and never lets go once it's gets going. Not for the squeamish though, as the sometimes very violent and intense confrontations come very unexpected. Kim Bodnia, who was equally outstanding in NATTEVAGTEN (1994) is exceptionally good. His character, Frank, doesn't invoke much sympathy, but somehow he manages to make his character very much alive and even touching at times. The rest of the cast is equally good with some truly extraordinary performances.Camera Obscura --- 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pushing as a way of life, no way out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew me and my friends away 10 years ago. This rock steady and realistic tale about real criminals, not the typical American teen age- BS. These people are real, that's as simple as it gets. The docu-kind of outlook fits this movie perfect.Someone was complaining how he couldn't sit through this movie because he didn't understand why Frankie made the choices he did. That's the point, there is no reason in real life. People make choices because they are bored or simply don't want to think about life outside the carnival. What is a family, Volvo or a house in the suburbs to a guy, who still at about 35-40 goes out clubbing and gets hi on crank and what-not everyday. These human fates don't need explanation. Perhaps I've been too close to need an explanation. One thing is for sure, these guys have made a great movie that has become a legend within certain groups of people. I guess the point of the movie was very clear in the end. Where does a man go, who keeps pushing the envelope day after day? The answer is - nowhere... Learn your lessons people, no more explanations needed.Absolutely fabulous, that's all I can say... And I won't say too much about the movie, just that it kicks ass. Definitely one of the most enticing criminal stories in the last 20 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film is almost without flaws. The dialogue, acting, atmosphere,cutting and soundtrack all mesh in a perfect union. The director has not gotten the international recognition he deserves. Unlike Breaking the Waves and The party the qualities of Pusher are mainly relayed through word of mouth and websites like this. I hope he makes it big with up and coming Bleeder...which by the way also is the name of the band fronted by the guy who scores the films music.(Same guy who did music for Pusher). Anybody who thinks tough street action with good dialogue can only be made by yanks like scorsese, mann and tarantino should think twice and check this one out. It's one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional debut-movie by Nicolas Winding Refn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1990's a new era in the history of Danish cinema began with movies such as NATTEVAGTEN, DE ST?RSTE HELTE, PORTLAND and most importantly PUSHER. Nicolas Winding Refn was only 26 years old when he co-wrote/directed this art-house masterpiece debut. I first saw this gem when I was 12 years old. I remember being immediately stunned. It had the stylishness and brutality of Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS or MEAN STREETS, the realism and hand-held camera-style of John Cassevettes' THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE and the cool pop-culture referential dialog of Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION, although it easily exceeds being just another post-modernistic Tarantino rip-off. It portrays the milieu and characters in such a realistic and dramatic way that it feels voyeuristic. PUSHER is a docu-drama in the truest sense of the word.Storyline: Frank (Kim Bodnia) is a intelligent, ill-tempered, young drug-dealer who can deliver just the drug for your purposes - hash, heroin, cocaine etc. Frank's everyday life consists of selling drugs with his partner-in-crime/best friend Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen) in Copenhagen's underworld, and hanging out with his girlfriend, the prostitute Vic (Laura Drasb?k) in the evening. They are three drug-addicts themselves. One day two police-men interrupt Frank in a big-time heroin-deal with a Swedish customer. Frank outruns the police-men down to S?erne, where he empties the heroin-bag into the water. Frank is arrested, but the police are forced to release him 24 hours later, since they didn't get the evidence. But now our protagonist has a much greater problem, as he owes away 230.000 Danish kroner for the eliminated heroin to Milo, one of the most dangerous drug-dealers in Copenhagen's underworld.PUSHER portrays a bunch of lost people in the drug milieu of Copenhagen (the capitol of Denmark). Nicolas Winding Refn doesn't care about the drugs or the crimes, he's interested in the humans behind them. Therefore PUSHER feels very real and heart-wrenching. In a very brutal scene Frank locates Tonny at a bar, grabs a baseball bat under the counter, and smashes Tonny to pieces, because the police have informed Frank that Tonny has agreed to witness against Frank. In another scene Frank visits his mother, which he apparently rarely does, in a desperate attempt to loan money. We discover that Frank, unlike most of the lost souls in the crime world, actually comes from a normal danish middle-class family without any negative social heritage. Combining these two scenes illustrates greatly that Frank is a three-dimensional character, because he comes from a socially positive home, and still he's cynical enough to beat up his best friend with a baseball bat. What in Frank's life made him so cold? Hatred for his parents? Boredom? Depression? The answer isn't apparent, and that's what makes it so great.Kim Bodnia (Frank) delivers one of the best performances ever seen in a Danish movie. In fact he's often been compared to Robert De Niro, although I think that image has changed since. Mads Mikkelsen (Tonny) shows much promise in his debut role. Today he's one of the highest regarded actors in Denmark, and in 2004 he continued the Tonny character in PUSHER 2. But the biggest cast surprise is Zlatko Buric (Milo) - an actor you have to see to believe. Many of his dialog improvisations in PUSHER have become popular catch-phrases in Danish youth culture. For example: Du er min veeen, Franke" or "S? du er blevet bustet, huh?" and many more. This is something that you can't pre-invent in any manuscript. Zlatko Buric is a natural!The PUSHER soundtrack consists of amazing 80's-style glam-rock and heavy metal by Peter Peter (ex-member of legendary danish rock group Sort Sol). The hand-held camera work and semi-expressionistic cinematography by Morten S?borg was very innovative for its time, and matched the movie perfectly. The aforementioned cast is great, but also the small cameo-roles played by Lars Bom (Cop), Thomas Bo Larsen (Junkie) and Jesper Lohmann (Mikkel) must receive credits. If you enjoy raw semi-realistic gangster-movies such as THE KILLING OF A CHINEESE BOOKIE or MEAN STREETS, you have to give this a chance. Don't forget its two sequels which, amazingly enough, are even better. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pusher is a movie you either love or hate. I'm among those who love it. I especially like the fast cuts between scenes, the camera movements and that the foreign language in the movie hasn't been translated. That gives you a feeling of being there... you're able to feel how the main character must feel in the situations where he's surrounded by the drug dealers. He can't understand what they're saying and must rely on his intuition and their body language - and so is the viewer!The movie is rather brutal, but it seems natural when you're watching it. It's a different movie, but it has a story to tell and it succeeds. And then there's the end.... an open ending, but somehow you know that Frank doesn't really have many oportunities. You feel sympathy for Frank even though he's actually a criminal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pusher is a visceral low-budget movie set on the streets of Copenhagen. Though its director Nicholas Winding Refn is not a part of Dogme 95 the film uses many of the Dogme maxims to better effect. The plot is deceptively simple. Frank (Kim Bodnia)is double-crossed on a deal and has a couple of days to make good the covering loan to a sadistic Balkan gangster. The film's speed rhythms convey the nightmare of time running out, luck running out, and life, shot with hand-held camera in natural light going around in circles until suddenly damnation beckons. Tougher than Tarantino or Trainspotting, it pulls no punches and its running gags fail to draw the sting. One of the great city films of the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the police about to spring, the buying, selling and dealing in drugs (cocaine and the like) is an extremely dangerous business. Profits can be enormous...providing of course that the buyers don't lag in their payments and that the dealer is sure of the quality of the drugs he has on offer...it must be the genuine article, not talcum or bicarbonate of soda!This is the tragic story of Frank, a pusher of drugs (Kim Bodnia) who finds himself in terrible debt due to the fact that the drug money due to him is not forthcoming. Desperate situations require desperate remedies. Much of the film is devoted to Frank's frustrating efforts to get the money. He feels he is trapped in a dangerous situation. He goes on a rampage. Frank has a terrible temper. When angered he is quick to retaliate with his gun. There is much bloodshed in this film, but the drama of the situations holds you and sweeps you along to the next confronting situation.There is more and more killing as Frank pursues his debtors in his murderous attempt to collect the money owing to him so that he in turn will be able to pay for the drugs he acquired as the middle man.Be advised that this film is not for the squeamish, but if you like to watch a good drama about a man caught in a series of tragic events, go ahead . Kim Bodnia as that man Frank will hold you spellbound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grim, tough debut feature from Nicolas Winding Refn (based on his 5 minute short film) tells the story of Frank, a hardnosed drug pusher in Copenhagen, who gets more than he bargained for when a deal goes wrong. His Serbian supplier Milo (Buric, in a standout performance) and henchman Radovan give him one last chance to come up with the money, but as it is nothing goes like planned. Kinetic, realistic and supercharged with sudden bursts of (mostly offscreen) violence and a pounding soundtrack as well as all around knockout performances with Kim Bodnia excellent as Frank.

		<fullReview>Although i've heard only good things about Pusher, it took me several years to pick it up. The result was surprisingly good.The movie is shot almost as a documentary, which is well suited for the subject it depicts. Unlike hip-hop videos advertising gangster lifestyle, Pusher shows us the reality of a low level drug dealer. There is no glamor, but rather hard labor without strict working hours providing questionable financial gain.Serbian gangsters are depicted rather realistically, presumably due to Slavko Labovi&#x107;'S experience as bouncer and mingling in the appropriate milieu.Despite its independent funding, Pusher is rubbing shoulders with the best gangster movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What drew me to this film wasn't the fact that there are two remakes of this film but due to the fact that this is the directorial debut of Nicolas Winding Refn. The Danish director who made the impressive and brutal Bronson and equally entertaining Drive.Filmed in a naturalistic nature, the camera follows the central character Frank and his associate Tonny through their day to day life in an objective manner. The film kicks off with the two of them wheeling and dealing (the narrative does not pause for breath for minor details such as background characters and situations, we are just pushed straight into the world of drugs, dealers and buyers).An offer of a big deal comes along in shape of a large buyer and Frank goes to his suppler Milo to obtain the goods. Milo is reluctant to give him that much without money upfront as Frank still owes a substantial amount but on the condition that Frank pays him the following day, Frank accepts. When he goes to do the deal with the buyer, things start to go very bad for him as the police are waiting for him and he has to throw away tip all the goods into a lake. In the following few days Frank has to come up with a large amount of money or face the consequences.What comes across you straight away is the immediacy and intensity in the way in which the camera follows our protagonist. Medium close up and long cuts pushes the audience closer into the seedy world of drug pushers and the criminal world. confined spaces in the car and apartments makes it feel claustrophobic and trapped in this underground business.An altogether rawness and close to documentary quality to the picture makes it feel almost real and gritty. As Frank becomes more and more desperate the mood and atmosphere changes, making viewing feel ever increasingly uncomfortable.A powerful and harsh look into the world of drug dealers shot with roughness and unremorseless savagery. With the character Frank, we not suppose to sympathise with, but he shows enough emotion that there is a connection that he is still human underneth it all. A great performance from all involved, mesmerizing and montrous in equal measure. It's a film that will burn in your memory for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and engaging crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank is a drug dealer moving heroin between the level above him and his customer base. When he is asked to get 200 grams of dope in less than 24 hours he balks but when he is offered 700 on the gram he tries to pull it together. Already 50,000 in debt to local gangster Milo, Frank takes a risk and gets the drugs on credit ahead of a good sale. However when the sale goes down the police are tipped off and the only thing saving Frank from jail is his quick wits to dive into the lake and destroy the evidence against him. Released by the police within hours, Frank knows his problems are only beginning as he now owes even more money to Milo ? a man not known for his patience.Although I had not really heard any hype over this film, I had heard it compared to Mean Streets in style so I thought I would give it a try. The main thing that struck me was how gritty it was and how lacking in the style and pop culture that the post-Tarantino audience have become accustom to. For some viewers this may be taken as a complaint but for my money it made the film that much better as a piece of dramatic realism as opposed to a modern thriller. Of course "reality" is a loose term in regards this film because I hope I never see this as a world I recognise, but it is still one that I found convincing.Refn's direction helps it by being hand-held and mobile in lots of good locations ? the viewer never feels like they are on a set or with jobbing actors. It is perhaps a bit too gritty and slow for some tastes though but I didn't really find much wrong with it in what it tried to do. Perhaps I would have gone for a bit more character development and emotion or maybe it could have lost a bit of running time and been tighter for it, but mostly it was effectively desperate, gritty and with a good feeling of claustrophobic hopelessness. Bodnia does this aspect really well; he is an unsympathetic character but we are taken along with him as he is convincingly real. The film belongs to him but the support cast is mostly good with turns from Buric, Drasb?k, Labovic and Mikkelsen.Overall then a convincing and gritty crime story that reeks of fear and being trapped. It avoids the trappings of modern Tarantino style and instead keeps low to the street, meaning that it does well by aiming for its own target and hitting it consistently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can surely say it is an amazing movie, we're following Frank (Kim Bodnia) and his life in the Copenhagen night life. Frank is selling drugs, and under a big deal, it all goes down the drain. Then he hurries down to a nearby sea followed by the cops, and throws all the illegal stuff out, so the police can't arrest him. But he borrowed all the money to buy the drugs, and Milo (Zlatko Buric) wants it back.Then we follow frank around while he tries to raise the money needed to pay of Milo. This is a very violent movie, but nevertheless it's worth seeing, and seeing again.I will recommend it to everyone who likes action movies, it purely breathtaking. A sure 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quentin Tarantino fan?, Then watch this. Pusher has it all, drugs, violence, sex and great dialogue, it doesn't hold anything back. It's the first film by director Nicholas Winding Refn (Bronson, Drive.) and arguably his best.The film is shot in a documentary style, in this film we follow small time drug dealer frank who is busted by the cops for trying to sell drugs, as a result of losing his drugs franks is now in debt to a local gangster named Milo, he has one week to come up with Milos money, during this week we see the desperate levels Frank stoops to in order to secure the money. What makes the film is the interesting characters, Frank, Franks girlfriend Vic, Franks friend Tonny, gangster Milo and Milo's henchman Radovan, each character brings something completely different to the film, you will find yourself favouring one of them.The dialogue contains a lot of extreme racial slurs, and brutal violence, it makes a Quentin Tarantino film look like a PG 13. Overall the film is a fantastic watch, Kim Bodnia (Frank), Laura Drasbaek (Vic), Zlatko Buric (Milo), Slavko Labovic (Radovan) and Mads Mikkelsen (Tonny) are brilliant in this film.What I love about this film is that it has no good guy, some people will side with Frank, some will side with Milo. Pusher is raw, edgy and most of all, entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pusher is the first part of Nicolas Winding Refn's trilogy of the same name. We get to know Frank (Kim Bodnia), who is a full-time drug dealer in Copenhagen's seedy underground. He runs drug deals and drives through the streets of Copenhagen with his good buddy Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen). From time to time Frank drops some of his drug load at his girlfriend Vic's ( Laura Drasb?k) place. The two partners seem to be moderately successful until a heroin deal goes wrong and Tonny rats out his friend Frank, who now owes a great deal of money to the people he initially got the heroin from. From there on things progressively get worse: Frank is in desperate need of money, as the guy who owes it to (brilliant: Zlatko Buric) can change his mood from friendly to psychopathic in a second. So Frank goes on his journey to scrape chunks of money from either past business associates or even his mother. He reaches his first low when he kills Tonny in a violent rush. It's the first time something disgusting happens on screen. And from there on it's one big downward spiral into the madness of the brutal underground.Nicolas Winding Refns trademarks haven't changed in the sixteen years that have passed since he made Pusher. The things people loved about Drive are already present here. The portrayal of a cold ruthless underground world. The long follow shots over the shoulders of someone walking fearlessly with their hands in their pockets. The love for detail and the spot-on depiction of the way these people talk, act, the way they elegantly exchange drugs on the streets, trained by years of experience. As in Drive the very graphic violence serves the purpose of confronting you with the brutality and ruthlessness of that world, after initially deluding you into thinking it's inhabitants are in some way cool, at the same time making you feel bad for thinking so.As things get more sinister for Frank, you are glued to the screen and hungry to know what the other two films in the Pusher trilogy have to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with true grit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So in essence, this is a film with true grit. Possibly the grittiest I've seen, literally. Come to think of it, it reminds me of Harlan County, USA documentary, it's dirty, grungy, and perfect for a film with a subject matter this film possesses. Truly, it's as if Nicolas Wending Refn assembled a small crew and started following a real pusher, who gave you an inside look into a week of his life, took you to the seedy, dirty, nasty, harsh (and whatever other synonyms you can throw its way) underworld of the street life so everyone could get an idea of what's it all about and why you probably shouldn't ever get involved. Certainly not a new concept an average man now understands, but it's the way it's all presented that really made me love this film. As I mentioned earlier, the documentary feel of this makes me think Refn had it in his mind when he set out to make this film. The vibe and mood of the film is top notch for the film of this caliber, but really it's the character of Frankie who was fleshed out the most and in the end made me really dig the guy despite essentially who he was, and his profession - though he makes a point later in the film which gives food for thought. What makes it memorable for me is that it isn't devoid of depth, and you get a quick look - which was enough - into each character's life by ways of genuine conversations they're having between each other, which felt like they were ad-libbed, but that's what made it genuine for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No glamor. Just the reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Winding Refn modernized the crime film genre with his Pusher trilogy. Thinking about that and the era he made the first part makes you probably think of another crime film modernizer of the 90's, Quentin Tarantino. He made something totally new in the United States with three crime films: Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994) and Jackie Brown (1997). People often see Tarantino as one of the most important directors in the crime genre, because he influenced it a lot. In the same way Nicolas Winding Refn made something completely original. He made Pusher. A movie about a drug-dealer who gets into a debt swirl. The way Refn shows the lives of the criminals is harsh. It's different from other 90's crime films, because it doesn't show any glamor in the underworld life. No one has got expensive cars, all of them live in their cruddy apartments, they aren't that rich and they all are under the control of their addiction to drugs.Pusher is about a drug-dealer, Frank (Kim Bodnia) whose life isn't pretty. His only relationships are with his friend Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen) and with his "girlfriend" Vic (Laura Drasb?k). When a Serbian drug-courier comes to Copenhagen and Frank fails to deliver money to him, he gets into a debt swirl.Frank is portrayed as an ordinary guy, who is a juvenile child under his hard shelf. He even goes to get money from his mother when he needs to pay his debts. All the conversations he has with his friend Tonny are about blow jobs, strippers and prostitutes. The dialog is sharp and it's well made to feel like common everyday chat.The film is very fast-paced and it's colored with some aggressive punk music, which I enjoyed a lot. It added a great element to Frank's life full of loneliness and despair. Pusher is a great description of the underworld in Copenhagen, Denmark. It's excessive realism and doesn't add any glamor to the lives of the junkies. It deals with the problems that are out there and with us every day, no matter where you live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drug pusher Frank is under great pressure to pay money he owes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Riveting film that seems altogether real about a drug dealer who is under huge pressure to pay his supplier. He already owes him money and then on top of that, he gets dope from him that is lost when he's busted. He has only a few days to come up with the money and we witness and experience with him the life of a dealer as he attempts to collect money owed to him. The perils of this business are brought to life vividly. Every part is well-etched and played to perfection. This is neo-noir in which one or two errors mean you're in deep trouble if you have no backup, no insurance of some kind, some stash somewhere. "I didn't do anything wrong," says Frank. No, nothing intentionally wrong to stiff anyone or his supplier. What he did was a common business error. He overextended himself. He essentially sold (or lost) what he had borrowed and couldn't repay it.This is a character study and a suspense story and a portrait of a slice of the drug world all in one. I was reminded of Bob Hoskins a bit in "The Long Good Friday", even though they are very different kinds of movies. In both cases, we have a man under pressure battling larger forces and things beyond his control, no matter how much he struggles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A drug pusher grows increasingly desperate after a botched deal leaves him with a large debt to a ruthless drug lord.Today I continued the Nicolas Winding Refn marathon with his first movie "Pusher". I had begun with "Drive" and was great, then i followed with four films (Valhalla Rising-Bleeder-Bronson and Fear X).Pusher is a very good movie and when you take into consideration it was his first movie, it makes it all the better, you can sum up the movie in one simple sentence, (A really bad week) in the life of a Danish drug pusher. That's the story. For a first time director, working with a lot of first time actors, he gets great performances out of them. The story moves along very quick and has enough turns in it to keep the viewer interested.The characters are also deep enough to make you actually care what happens. Many first time film makers seem to go more with whats happening now then character development. Refn however does a good job at both. The only familiar face in the movie is Mads Mikkelsen, who played the villain in Casino Royale and also was the main character in Refn's "Valhalla Rising". This movie is the first in a trilogy but has a definitive ending that does not make you feel you need to see the rest immediately, ending leaves one speechless. I won't spoil it, but it's unforgiving and breathtaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there's something VERY rotten in Denmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since we usually get an image of Scandinavia as the world's calmest, cleanest, most idealistic region, it's always a shock when we see a movie like Norway's "Junk Mail" or Denmark's "Pusher". This one portrays Copenhagen drug dealer Frank (Kim Bodnia) having to run from the law while simultaneously owing money to a very nasty dude. They film the movie like cinema verite, so as to give it a gritty feeling; and let me tell you, they succeed. Watching the movie, you know that Frank lives a pathetic existence, but you always feel like you want to root for him. If you can stomach it.So, I recommend this movie, but be prepared to get shocked. I wonder what Hans Christian Andersen would have thought had he known that his country would one day have this problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget all the crappy glossy American gangster films like The Godfather, Pusher is much more real to life and brutal.I saw Pusher in 2004 on DVD after I was highly impressed with Bleeder, another of Refn's masterpieces.Pusher follows Frank, a drug dealer who gets in a spot of bother with Milo, a drug kingpin, when Frank accidentally loses/has to get rid of a stash of Heroin bought on credit from Milo (who he already owes money too) after the cops chase after him through the street.He then has a short amount of time to recover the financial and moral loss to Milo otherwise he's in the $hit, his life being at stake.A fantastically acted film with a 100$ fluid plot that really does keep you intrigued, that's what I love about Refn. The whole film oozes with originality, pace and substanceA brilliant Danish film, from a British reviewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realism sold me on this dark story about a pusher that needs to make a bad deal good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danish Indie cinema DENMARK - southern Scandinavia. Many European movies SUCK!! This one doesn't!!! ==SEE IT.==This is not for everyone, it is danish or German with English subtitles. Danish sounds a lot like and is generally based on German- so this has a very germanic harsh and dark feel to the action and the dialog.If your xenophobia and ignorance makes you think of that as a minus- stop here.For those of us a bit more worldly- this is a cool movie about a pusher that is fronted some stuff he can't pay for-thinking he'll be able to pay for it once he sells it, and then through some unfortunate events winds up owing someone money he doesn't want to owe money to. Enter the problem!! And it's a BIG problem.We are taken through the dark gritty nightlife of the men and women who are forced to act like animals because of their habits and their need to feed those habits. Drug addicts, pushers and bosses all played rather well compared to what you normally see in cinema. If you like the darkness because it is fascinating- this movie will take you into that darkness for a while. It spawned a rather popular trilogy- pusher 2 "blood on my hands" and pusher 3 "I'm the angel of death". Some fans disappointed with these because they concentrate on different characters in each movie instead of keeping one anti-hero through the trilogy.If you like watching street life and people who burn like an inferno today because there's a good chance there won't be a tomorrow- this is your flick.If you are making cocoa for two little children in the next room while you are thinking happy suburban fantasies that are illusions for sheeple- then you won't get this movie at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ohh what a movie and trilogy, this is truly a masterpiece. As a guy who is in touch with drugs and people from that environment I can say that director and actors did a great job. A story about 2 best friends(Frank and Tonny), small dealers, who suddenly had an a opportunity to do a big job with drugs and earn some nice and easy money. So basically, Frank took a kilo or something of heroin from a local drug lord boss and Serbian immigrant(Milo) and told him that he will be back in a hour with money. But sadly for Frank, when he went to a meeting with a guy to sell him a heroin, police was there... Frank flied with heroin while cops was chasing him and when there was no more space for him to run, he threw heroin in the lake in front of the cops. He was released from prison because no evidence, but problem for Frank now starts because he needs to pay the money for a heroin which he got from Milo. And here the story begins..This is one of the best movies and trilogy I ever saw and cast was just amazing, especially Zlatko Buric and Kim Bodnia. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pusher" picks up where "Mean Streets" stopped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pusher" depicts a world where Hollywood never casts a light, a world filled with ruthless residents and most banal acts of evil, but it is an immensely captivating world. Sure, Nicolas Winding Refn directed one of Tom Hardy's best performances in "Bronson", and he made a cool movie with "Drive", but "Pusher" remains his masterpiece.The film centers on Frank (Kim Bodnia), a mid-range Copenhagen drug dealer. The police mess up one of his deals, and he has to dump the stuff into a pond. He owed his boss Milo (Zlatko Buri&#x107;) 50 000 krones, and now it's 230 000. Of course, Frank has debtors on his own, and of course, they can't pay him really fast either. A race against the clock ensues.This is all but your typical gangster movie. There is no excessive luxury. Milo is no larger-than-life figure like one of the Corleones or Tony Montana, and he scuffs around in his kitchen, and even gives Frank some time to deliver the money, because, hell, maybe he finds enough and why would you kill him just like that? But maybe Frank just jerks him around, or he has come to be unreliable. In that case ... Anyway, Zlatko Buri&#x107; makes a sluggish nagger out of Milo, and his scenes particularly seem improvised (because, you know, they were improvised), but it's also as if Refn waited for the right moment when gibberish transcended into artistry, and took the best parts."Mean Streets", with its lowlife crooks, is a prime influence on Refn, but he is beyond Scorsese's reflections on sin; the quest for some money to scrape by is the all-defining imperative on his figures. What else they say or do is often foolish; it is their flaws that shape them.Frank often hangs out with wannabe gangster Tonny, played by Mads Mikkelsen in his first role. If you saw Mikkelsen as an ice cold villain in "Casino Royale" and the "Hannibal" series, and thought they were quite different from his mild-mannered teacher in "The Hunt", watch this (and by the way, watch about any other film he's been in). Look at him in the car with Kim Bodnia, licking his front teeth like only a dork would do. Or when he wants to catch a gun, lets it slip, lifts it, and playfully points it at its owner as if he had the safest possible hands. Or when he wants to show a roundhouse kick and you know that he tries so much to make believe he can do it that he thinks so himself. And how he then hurts himself and angrily blames Frank because he was laughing at him. It is one thing to play dimwits, but Mikkelsen creates a nuanced, believable and even oddly fascinating moron. No, there are no benign characters in this film. The only one you may feel sympathy for is Frank's girlfriend Vic (Laura Drasb?k), a prostitute who insists that she is a "champagne girl", and who doesn't want to be called a slut. Frank wonders where's the difference between undressing for 300 or 3000 bucks. The movie has no mercy on its characters, but it is honest to them, and they emerge as (deeply spoiled) human beings, who behave just the way they should. No wonder that Refn shot his low-budget debut with many people from the streets in his cast, and in some of the shabbiest corners of Copenhagen. He uses a hand-held - but not an overly shaky! - camera and actually achieves a documentary style instead of causing confusion and nausea in his viewers. There are hardly any artificial sources of light, and shadows fall on backs and faces (to most effect in the opening sequence, where we see the protagonists with half-illuminated fronts, accompanied by powerful rock music).In all honesty, the matter of believability when it comes to interactions between characters may depend on where you live. New York crime movies are popular everywhere in the world so we all can catch that when De Niro mumbles it's not phoney. It may not work entirely the other way around. If you're Danish or Swedish, or German and watch this film in the excellently dubbed version, you can relate to little gestures or the way characters talk, but this effect may be missing in other countries. Nevertheless, any audience should resonate with the style, and the way the story unfolds.Frank is desperate, and we may not like him, but we know what he's going through. We are all dependent on (or, as one may say, addicted to) regular doses of money, and "Pusher" takes place in a world where missing a shot can be more literally lethal than in ours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple yet excellent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one those movies that grow on me with time. It is a simple movie with a simple story, simple plot and a main character who is a simple man. Yet I feel it is one of the strongest and most honest movies I have watched. I never get tired of this movie, I have watched it many times but each time it feels like I am watching it for the first time again. The reason why is because of how honest I feel the movie is. It is not the kind of movie which try ingratiate its audience with escapism. It is a movie with both feet solidly planted on the ground and it is not afraid of getting ugly and gritty. But it never went over-the-top and that really astonishes me. Especially being Nicolas Winding Refn's directorial debut. He did an extraordinary job. He is one of the few directors who makes me feel humbled. I basically love all of his movies. Now Kim Bodnia as Frank, well, let's just say I can't imagine another actor playing as Frank. Kim Bodnia did such an outstanding job. So did Mads Mikkelsen. They both made their characters look so human. The other actors did an outstanding job too.Like with most of Nicolas Winding Refn movies the movie's main theme is morality and desperation. Now Frank is not an evil man, he is just an ordinary man caught up in a corrupt world. I could relate to his desperation. He is not stupid he is just not aware of his possibilities of living outside the criminal world and he only does what he knows to do. Yes he is a criminal, a pusher but that does not make him any less human. The extraordinary talent director Refn has is he simply do not make good vs. evil movies. There is no good guy or bad guy but he lets the evil show through the relationship between the characters. Like with real life, evil does not come from a single person but it rises between all humans. If you are alone try to notice that problems do not rise unless you make them up, but when you are with other people problems seem to come out of nowhere. This is where Nicolas Winding Refn has a keen eye. I dare say this movie is one of the few intelligent movies and quite an honest portrayal of a man driven by desperation. Simple yet a strong movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pusher" digs surprisingly deep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pusher" is the first installment of a gritty crime trilogy from Danish writer-director Nicolas Winding Refn set in the Copenhagen underworld. In each of the three films, the main character (a different one in each) is trapped in the same existential scenario: One incurs a debt from a drug deal gone wrong and must pay it back on a tight deadline. It's not stupidity that puts these pushers in a bind: The drug trade is inherently a risky one, and even the smart players can get beaten by the odds. Relying on hand-held camera-work, a tight budget, and an emphasis on natural lighting, the trilogy's gripping set of stories unfolds with the raw immediacy of a documentary. In "Pusher," our anti hero is Frank (Kim Bodnia), a mid-level dope dealer who is successful and hardcore enough to live his days in a fast, fun-loving manner. Accompanied by his friend/enforcer Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen), Frank spends the movie's first half-hour roaming from deal to deal, to a couple of bars, and simply living it up with Tonny. Bad news arrives, of course, in the offhand form of a score gone wrong with local kingpin Milo (Zlatko Buric) on credit, despite Frank's looming debt. When the cops chase Frank down, he dives into a lake, taking the drugs with him. Now his debt to Milo is unmanageably huge, and as the thugs come looking for him, he begins a frantic, frustrated search for cash. The film begins loosely structured, but as Frank's predicament becomes more dire, the narrative tightens. Surprisingly, Frank slowly becomes genuinely compelling despite the fact that he is a low life smack dealer and now an emotional wreck beneath his stoic exterior. Abrasive from start to finish, Refn's debut has a vibrant life apart from its obvious influences (Mean Streets, Trainspotting), and he has the gift for taking familiar material and making it his own. Refn scoffs at Hollywood's third-act redemptions and justice served as simply a pipe dream, while refusing to glamorize criminality or trying to correct it. As botched-drug-deal stories go, "Pusher" digs surprisingly deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good warning film, perhaps too much focus on a single actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In other words, I enjoyed more the first third or so when good performance by Kim Bodnia (as Frank) was complemented by even better performance by Mads Mikkelsen (as Tonny; usually, he has totally different roles); their ensemble was great, their dialogs witty and a good demonstration of modern vanity fair. Anyhow, it is a strong film, depicting daily life of drug dealers/addicts in a realistic manner - without making it heroic or "cool". The use of hand-held cameras and suitable soundtrack provide additional value to the film.The other male actors are catchy and veracious as well, particularly Zlatko Buri&#x107; as Milo and Slavko Labovi&#x107; as Radovan. Female characters tend to be more sketchy and spend a little time on screen.The film is for you if you like gloomy stuff and to have ambivalent feelings towards most of characters - there are virtually no "good persons" visible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Danish Mean Streets?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of a mid-level, Danish drug pusher falls apart over the course of a week.It's nowhere near as good as its main influence, Mean Streets. For example, it lacks Scorsese's touch with a good sound-track - generally there's nothing in the Pusher other than normal background sounds and what music there is is what's playing on the radio. That's not to say that this isn't a good film in its own right, however.The characters are generally convincing and well-rounded and, like Scorsese's movie, Pusher gives you the illusion that you understand what it would be like to live the life of these low-level criminals. Lots of hanging around in cars and sleazy bars. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic but as things go from bad two worse fro Frank, the main character, you begin to share his stress.Some fairly graphic violence, but surprisingly little drug taking and no sex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film about how crime never pays. Literary. Pusher Frank(Kim Bodina) is a middle level drug dealer in Copenhagen. He spends his time hanging out with his drug dealer buddy Tonny(Mads Mikkelsen) doing business and clubbing. He has also a strange psuedoromantic relationship with the hooker "Vic"(Laura Drasb?k). Frank is debt to the drug-lord Milo(Zlatko Buric), but since Milo is a nice guy and Frank is his best friend in Copenhagen he is cool with it as he trust his friend to pay him back. One day Frank get's the chance to do a big deal with the swede Hasse(Peter Andersson). Frank get's the heroin the swede wants to distribute in Malmö, but the cops show up and Frank drops the heroin into a river. Frank's "buddy-debt" has now been blown up to a enormous level, and Milo shows how little friendship means in a world with no morals.This film is a fu***** masterpiece. It's so good that it together with Pusher II: With Blood on my Hands and I'am The Angel of Death: Pusher 3 it manages to even outshine the Godfather- trilogy. Pusher is a dirty and raw ride into the bottom shaft of the Copenhagen-underworld. The criminals are scum, but they are still people. They are like real people with good and bad sides. Every actor in this film is fantastic. Kim Bidina, Laura Drasb?k, Mads Mikkelsen, Slavko Labovic and Zlatko Buric all give wonderful performances. Will cinema ever see a greater gangster character than Milo?During the cause of the film, we get to know more and more about Frank and the more we get to know the more questions pops up. In one scene Frank visits his mother and we learn that Frank grew up in an ordinary middle class home. Why did he become a gangster? What went wrong?The image quality is gritty, it feels more like director Nicolas Winding Refn took his personal 16mm camera and followed a pusher for a week. The film does not feel like a film, but a home-video belonging to a gangster who has filmed his friends for fun. It's honest, authentic and gripping.The music by Peter Peter is great. It feels very much like the stuff you would hear on the radio in the hideout of some Copenhagen mobsters. It's as gritty as the film itself.The ending leaves one speechless. I won't spoil it, but it's unforgiving and breathtaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danish excellence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a tough time deciding if this movie should get a 7 or 8 rating. It is an excellent movie in just about every aspect. The two things that influenced me to give it a seven is that I had very high expectations that was not met fully, plus it is not my very favorite category of movie (although I really do love these "realistic" underworld crime dramas).The things that make this movie stick out is primarily direction and acting. Director Nicolas Winding Refn (this being his first full feature) brings fresh blood and thinking, mainly resulting in a series amazingly well done handy-camish quality shots. Also he apparently challenged the actors to really get into their roles, doing in-depth research and such. I have heard that his high demands on the actors has a downside as some actors get "burned out" from the pressure.But the acting is very good, and that goes for lead actors as well as extras (with the possible exception of Peter Andersson (playing the drug-searching Swede), but I must admit to having a personal problem with the stiff acting I feel Swedes in general represent). My favorite performance in this flick is without a doubt Laura Drasb?k. To me she does an excellent performance of the naive stripper/luxury hooker Vic (the lead character's girlfriend(?)). By the way, Mads Mikkelsen (the lead character's side-kick) is also seen in King Arthur, as Arthur's bird attached blade swinger.To sum up; although I haven't been close to the world in question, the movie feels rather realistic and raw, although maybe not the whole way. I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece - but it is a really well done movie with an intriguing story. I tip my hat off to the danish movie industry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more deal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has so many of the cliches of the independent low-budget film that you might be tempted to be put off by any preview or by an uncommitted viewing: the grainy look; the steadicam camerawork; the loud music and flashing lights;the minimalist and almost inaudible dialogue. How many times have you seen these features used to disguise a lack of originality. You're thinking ho hum. Another maverick low-budget director who reckons by spending less he can make it look more realistic: more in your face.Perhaps the aforementioned features are sine qua nons of the modern crime film but the skill of the director is that he only uses them as tools to mould a fine character study and a credible story of the Copenhagen drugs underworld.And it works. And while it might be a bit premature to proclaim its director as the saviour of Danish cinema, or indeed as the Danish Tarantino, it has a special appeal of its own.Basically its the story of a small time drug dealer who finds himself increasingly living on borrowed time: the suppliers are becoming impatient for payment, he just isn't able to make the deals he needs. What are his options?From the initial scenes of an everyday drug deal gone wrong, where the violent lead shows his worst side, we gradually find ourselves sympathising more and more with this small-time loser as he finds himself pressed into a corner by his violent overlords. The confrontations with the bosses,the desperate efforts to pull off one last big score to raise the necessary finance for a further extension on life by whatever means contain particularly tense scenes of real menace, but it is not all doom and gloom.: (A good example of the balance of the film is the scene where the dealer seeks some financial support from his aged mother).Apart from the main characters, (the pusher and his supplier), the acting is little more than functional and I'm also sure that the portrayal of Copenhagen will be welcomed by either its Tourist Board or its Balkan immigrant community but overall this film is a fine addition to the modern-day gangster canon.The real test of the director will come if and when he attempts either a big-budget (Hollywood?) film or strays outside the crime genre.But I'd like to think we can get at least another couple of genre films of this quality prior to him going down either of those routes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently this gangster film was really huge in Europe. I'm not sure how 'big' it was here, in Britain, but, in my opinion, it's no 'Lock Stock.' Firstly, it feels cheap. I know a lot of people who enjoyed it will call it 'gritty,' but Reservoir Dogs was 'gritty' and still felt stylish at the same time. 'Pusher' just feels like it was filmed with a video camera without anyone's permission on each location.It's about a gangster, who seems to dabble in everything from drugs to armed robbery, trying to organise a drugs deal which ? guess what ? goes wrong and leaves him in debt to an even nastier gangster. Do we care? Not really.I have no problem with films about gangsters (or 'bad guys' to use another term). We don't have to like them to enjoy the film, just as long as they provide some form of entertainment. Our central character here doesn't. He's bland. He doesn't ever really inspire us to care whether he lives, dies or finds a way of paying his way out of the situation. He just sort of spends the film wandering around doing some half-hearted effort of calling in old debts.And that's about it. A cheap-looking film with bland characters who you won't really care about and a plot that's been done to death. Yes, the film has Mads Mikklesen in an early role, but he doesn't do enough to elevate it to anything other than very ordinary.However, this film has seemed to have spawned a couple of sequels meaning many must have seen something in it that I didn't. I guess if you can put up with the subtitles and don't mind the rawest of raw films then you may get something out of it.</fullReview>

You don't need to know the (simple) story, just rest assured that this a great film, with fantastic subtle performances and one of those endings that makes you really feel ... well, just watch it! You won't be disappointed!!(The extras on the UK DVD are top notch. Are the same on the US release? Not sure.

		<shortDescription>Drug Dealers: The Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen most of Nicolas Winding Refn's recent work, it was kind of awkward going back to his debut feature film. While it does show flashes of brilliance, hints of what Refn's style would develop into, for the most part it's your typical "mid-level drug dealer gets in over his head" film that has been many times before (and better). PUSHER follows Frank, a Danish drug dealer who is about to make this huge deal with some Swedes. However, at the moment the deal is about to go down, the cops show up and he has to dump the dope in the river. This puts him in some serious debt to Milo, a Serbian drug lord, and the rest of the film is Frank trying to get the money to pay him back. Before watching this, I did scope a few reviews just to see what kind of film I was getting into, and one comparison I saw a few times was with MEAN STREETS. While I can see the surface similarities, ultimately PUSHER doesn't have as many likable characters and feels more amateurish. Since I don't speak Danish, I can't really say whether the acting was good for sure, but it didn't seem too bad. The production values were also pretty good for a low-budget indie film. Even the script and dialogue weren't too bad. My favorite parts were in the first 20-30 minutes when Frank and his best friend, Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen), share some Tarantino-esque exchanges about whatever was on their minds at the time. However, once the plot kicks in, whatever sense of fun the film had before was all but gone. I don't mind gritty realism, and the cinema verite style in which the film is shot was handled quite well, but I never connected with the story all that much. It also didn't help that Frank was such an unlikeable prick. For my money, Tonny was the most interesting character, but he's not in the film for too long. Fortunately I am aware that Tonny is the focus of the the sequel, so it has that much going for it. Ultimately, PUSHER is a well-made film that shows some of the talent that Refn would later put to great use, but the story has been done many times before, and better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicolas Winding Refn's realistic directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Winding Refn's directorial debut is an engaging, zero-budget story of crime and revenge, a thriller which sees a small-time drug dealer's life spiralling out of control when his latest deal goes bad. Shot on the streets of Denmark in a verite style by a director who already appears accomplished, PUSHER is a fine debut feature.There are certain influences in the film; with the recent release of Tarantino's PULP FICTION there had to be, but the style of PUSHER is all its own. Despite being relatively unknown at the time, the acting of the cast is very good; THE BRIDGE's Kim Bodnia and VALHALLA RISING's Mads Mikkelsen in particular play each other off very well. There's also a surprising level of originality in the script that keeps the viewer on his toes at all times; you've never quite sure of what exactly is going to happen next.PUSHER isn't a perfect film, and there are a few flaws that stopped me enjoying it totally. It lacks a single sympathetic character in the entire cast, and much of the dialogue is moronic and off-putting. It's also fairly dark and depressing, although I understand such style is all the rage these days. However, PUSHER overcomes such deficits by being one of the most realistic thrillers out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Kim Bodnia in Terribly Happy, and went looking for some of his older stuff. This film interested me because it tells the story of a drug dealer who gets in trouble with his boss (Zlatko Buric).In order to get out of trouble, he goes deeper and deeper into madness. He even uses his girlfriend (Laura Drasb?k).He's in the hole for 230,000 and has a murder hanging over him.He makes a deal to get out, but his girlfriend takes his money. Now what? Well, you won't know until the next film.Buric was great. Bodnia was not as good as he was in Terribly happy, but he still presented a great character that just seemed short of a sociopath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather slow-moving until the last thirty minutes or so, though even then it can be stop-and-go at times. The drawn out dialogues in the car and convenience store which take place the protagonist and his sidekick in the beginning are juvenile and boring.Aside from a rather unexpected turn out at an attempted money collection around the middle, nothing really exciting happens until the very end. But even then, it is almost torturously slow and suspenseful, which I guess is the good thing going about the film.I suppose I shouldn't put it down too much, since it's not particularly boring. It shows the more mundane side of a criminal's life, and presents the inevitable downward turn with realism.One part that impressed me was a conversation which takes place in the car between Frank and Frank's boss' goon. The guy casually talks to Frank about how he once cut out a guy's kneecap with a knife while collecting money. In the meanwhile, he and Frank are heading somewhere for Frank to collect money he himself owes the goon's boss. Yet they speak as if they were best friends. This was the one thing about the film that truly stood out to me, as far as the characters go. Up until the very end, they all speak as if they were friends. Don't expect the American-style macho-talk and cursing here.The best part is perhaps the anti-climactic ending, which just leaves you staring at the screen with a distinct creepy feeling of hopelessness crawling up your spine.To summary: not for action fans; decent film for more serious viewers who prefer a more dramatic approach to the criminal-life-gone-bad theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but could have been perfect had it not been for a few nagging points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I'm not too fond of Danish cinema, since it's mostly derivative, dull and several hundred miles behind anything out of Hollywood during the same period. I decided to give this film a chance, though, as I'd heard so many good things about it. The film turned out to be better than I expected, in fact, it's great. There are just a few things that keep it from being perfect, that keep it from a perfect ten. First of all, we never get a good insight into why the main character is living this life... why he does what he does, and doesn't try to get out. It's clearly not a very healthy or pleasant way of making a living, so it would make it easier to sit through the film if we got some background info, some hint at why he chooses to keep 'pushing'. He must've had a choice at one point, he must have been able to do something else with his life. We never get real insight as to why any of these people do what they do, and it's harder to sit through the film because of it. The cinematography is pretty good, considering that all of the camera-work is done on steady-cam, and there are fewer cuts than what we're used to from American cinema and mainstream films in general. There's a bit of a documentary feeling to this film because of that, which works well, but also makes the film seem slower at times, because there's often very little going on on-screen, and the camera either moves shakily or not at all, with only the good acting and the purposefully flat dialog to entertain the viewer. The score/soundtrack is pretty good, it fits nicely with the visuals, but at times it interferes with how natural, documentary-like the film is. The plot is good, and it evolves nicely throughout the film. The pacing is good, but around the end, it seemed to slow down a little too much... or maybe I was just tired with the documentary-like feeling of the entire film. I'm not entirely sure. The acting is mostly great, with one or two exceptions. The characters are sufficiently different and well-written, but they're not fleshed out enough, we don't understand them. The ending relied heavily upon understanding one characters actions, which we don't, which takes a good bit of the impact out of it. This film is very good, no doubt about it, but it just falls short in too many areas to be particularly re-watchable. It's worth one viewing, though, at least. Most people who either know or want to know about the Copenhagen underground should see this movie. I recommend this film to anyone who has an open mind about movies(this is in no way mainstream) and who enjoys gritty movies about the underground life of bigger cities. Be warned, though, it's not for the faint of the heart. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The high point of the film is its opening credits sequence. Blaring instrumental rock music plays as we fade in and out of shots of each of the main characters, their character names given and their faces hidden in shadows, until the title presents itself, stretching thoroughly throughout the screen. It's all downhill from here. It's promising in that first sequence, like we're in for that good ol' blood-soaked, stylized gangster picture. But we're not. We're in for a movie where a very mean drug dealer beat people up and gets himself in trouble he doesn't have any real reason to be getting himself into. Why is he committing to the risks he is taking? Why does he refuse to act on anything but impulse and use his brain? Why do we care?There is nothing wrong with a film wherein the main character has no truly redeeming values. There are several, and a lot of them work. Others, like this one, put them in situations that have no reason to have happened. The film is also too inconsequential to enthrall us in the life of this diminishing character. It does not occupy its running time with drama that outweighs the violence and gore. What is outweighing the violence and gore, unfortunately, is a stream of meaningless time spent on the character of the exotic dancer, who follows this drug pusher's directionless plans and endures his abrupt outbursts of treating her in the most excruciatingly demeaning way. Why does she do this? We never know.Pusher is perhaps made with indecision, as if the director didn't know whether he wanted to portray a petty, depraved criminal environment, or actually tell a story. He leans just enough in one direction to make the story and its characters shapeless, in a movie that could've been so much more had it a clear idea of what it wanted to say.</fullReview>

It probably would have pigeon meat and tartar sauce on it. I'm saying that this movie is not like "Trainspotting." There's no humor or surreal aspects to this film. Get it? Stand on your chair, kids, the jokes are going over your heads.I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I made a poor analogy.That doesn't mean that "Pusher" is bad, though. The acting is fine and the cinematography is actually pretty good. However, the English subtitles are not very good (on th eVHS version, anyway). Several times, character dialog is left in Scandinavian. To viewers that don't speak Scandinavian --- Americans or people who have learned useful second languages, for instance --- this gets aggravating. Aggravating enough ... to KILL??? No, but it's an annoying feature in an otherwise decent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank, the petty drug dealer, and his journey through a week from hell in the underground Copenhagen drug world is a relentless, in-your-face trip for sure. I heard this was regarded as a cult classic, and I'm starting to think it was mainly of exotic reasons, being Danish... because the film itself is just SO unsatisfying. The documentary/Dogma style is unfortunately no asset this time, as many scenes and dialog abound that are just painfully obvious time-fillers. No mistake, I like a hard, tough film cookie in this jar of themes... ("Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a dream" are classic gems to compare with) But there are no touches of genius here, only a whopper of a problem with the blatant absence of any characters to care for at all- and especially the protagonist! As with Tony Montana in "Scarface", Frank perishes slowly, agonizingly AND deservedly- so all I wish as I watch, is for the script to just finish him off quicker! And any movie that accomplishes that, has more or less failed.So yes, drug-dealing is a soulless, harsh and cold business... too bad that goes for the movie, too.3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, this film is best remembered as a prime example of how the danish movie industry works. Its all about who you are and who you know - not about what skills you actually have... Before getting all amped up about the horrors of movie makers in Denmark, I should, in all fairness, start out by acknowledging the success of the movie... 'cause all said it is still a major blockbuster in danish terms and should be applauded for that. But, and there's always a but - the movie is really not that great. At best it's a guided tour of skid row Denmark...for those of us so lucky that we didn't grow up seeing or knowing the people this movie portrays. But if you've ever taken a stroll through Istedgade (a kind of danish red light district) you won't find anything in that movie that rocks your world...or if you've ever seen movies like Romper Stomper, Trainspotting or a Sam Peckinpah movie you won't find anything here either... The only true brilliance I can find in this movie is its timing...It couldn't have been made at a better time. In 1996 you had the drugs claiming a part of everyday life of more and younger people - therefore hitting a key with a big part of the moviegoers in Denmark... In the 1990's you had the dogme-concept (1995) taking all the headlines and combined with movies like Carmen and Babyface and Carlo and Ester you might expect a movie like Pusher striking it right with audiences not quite relating to sobby but basically innocent dramas, light comedies and arty farty experimental movies... Therefore the final comment would have to be: Watch the movie if you don't mind shutting of your brain or avoid it if you have a desire to force movie makers actually making something original...</fullReview>

I pretty much wanted to see him die from the film's first frame, and every second the thugs who are after him aren't torturing and killing him is a wasted one, in my opinion. To boot, the film is absolutely ugly visually. How the Hell did Refn ever produce a film as great as Drive?
