		<shortDescription>Underrated and often quite fun to watch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fathers' Day" seems to pride itself in its two main stars, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams. This is more of a film made out of vain then for comedic purposes. It is for the crowds out there who have been waiting for Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to star together in lead roles, almost like the fans of "Freddy vs. Jason" have been waiting for their heroes to duke it out. This movie combines two big stars, and the amazing thing is that it actually gets away with it.Yes, "Fathers' Day" isn't all that great, and no, I didn't love it, but sue me: I enjoyed it. Is it too much to ask from a comedy that it simply entertain me, give me a few laughs? Films like "The Hot Chick" can't even manage to do this, but "Fathers' Day" pulls it off. Why? Maybe because it is so fun watching Crystal and Williams interact. They bring a dead script to life. I must admit that given a better script their pairing could have made for one of the funniest films of the year, but the screenplay for this movie is dead in the water. Crystal and Williams do their best and make it amusing, but it could have been so much more. When a film resorts to showing Robin Williams doing impersonations in front of a mirror for the umpteenth time, you know that the script isn't all it could and should have been.And this is pretty strange, because Babaloo Mandez and Lowell Ganz are usually trustworthy to deliver an amusing and hysterical script. These are the men responsible for one of my favorite comedies in recent years, "City Slickers," and their script for "Fathers' Day" just sinks to predictability, sappiness and sterotypes.Get this: Crystal plays an ambitious lawyer who gets a call from an ex-girlfriend he went out with 17 years earlier. She tells him that her sixteen-year-old son has run away from home, that he is the father, and that he must help retrieve the boy. She gives him a photo of the boy (who looks like the typical teenage snot named Scott), and touched by her story for whatever reason he agrees to find the boy.Problem no. 1. Crystal is a lawyer. At the end of the film, he is lied to and knows this. His wife (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss) asks how he knows. He says, "I'm a lawyer, people lie to me all the time." If he is such a brilliant lawyer, why did he not look past his ex-girlfriend's little lie? Don't know, don't care - it is part of the film and what can you do?And get this: Crystal's ex happens to be Williams' ex, too. She tells Williams the exact same story as Crystal, hoping to get at least one of them to find the boy. They both try. We know they will accidentally meet looking for him, there will be confusion, the boy will not be grateful for their helping him out until the very end, and so on and so forth.But this movie entertained me. Crystal and Williams have good chemistry, even if a good script could have made their interaction a bit more. The jokes do fall flat at times, but the direction is nice (Ivan "Ghostbusters" Reitman), and to be honest, I had fun watching this movie. That's all I really ask for in some comedies.(Also note a cameo by Mel Gibson, who dropped by the set during filming of "Lethal Weapon 4" at Warner Bros.!)3/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are times when the critics crucify a movie and those who star in it, with no justification. I ignore critics completely because I know what I like. I find it particularly offensive when unjust criticism is levelled at young performers at the start of a career. For this reason I shall begin by mentioning Charlie Hofheimer's role in the film. This was his biggest part to date and brother it must have been hard. He had to play a straight role with no comic lines between the two old hands, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal who obviously ad-libbed from beginning to end. It is of enormous credit to him that he managed to keep a straight face at all. His character was a spoiled teenager who was at various times in love, in a drunken stupor, on the run from criminals and suddenly confused about who his father was. I fail to see how he could have carried this part off better than he did. Add to this the fact that at 15/16 Charlie was undoubtedly one of the most handsome young men in America.Williams with his extravagant style and Crystal with the more subtle approach provided the perfect foil for each other. So the comedy flowed. Nor did all of the best comic moments happen when these two were involved. The third father's rescue mission was hilarious. There was also a fair amount of pathos running through the film which made it into just the kind of happy/ sad mixture that I love.This was no Oscar nomination, but good, clean, harmless fun. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure it could've been better, but it's still an enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you put together the talents of Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, you bet your life people are gonna expect big things. I myself expected big things. The movie doesn't deliver on all levels. There are some badly written gags and lame dialogue ("He's having some problems with his testicles"). But throughout 80 % of the movie I was entertained and got a fair share of laughs. Naturally, Billy and Robin have incredible chemistry and I'm sure a lot of their stuff was ad-libbed. They just could've used a better script. Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel wrote the great comedy "Mr. Saturday Night," so I did expect better from them. The two guys don't always seem secure with the material, and rightfully so, like with that lame running gag about "the whirl." Nevertheless, "Fathers' Day" is a delightful comedy and it definitely has its moments. Some won't be as satisfied as others, but I myself was satisfied. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, the plot's kinda lame and not too believable, but the stars are able to make it a fun time. In fact, the best moments are the ones that serve not to advance the story, but allow Williams and Crystal do their trademark acts.Billy Crystal is a master of the non-response, such as when told that he has a 15 year old son, continuing to slowly drink his coffee. Robin Williams is the improv master. It's fun to guess which lines were written in the screenplay, and which ones just came from his head full of characters.We know everything will turn out OK in the end, but there are enough unexpected twists and turns to keep the story interesting, and some pretty funny minor characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big talents produce few laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stop me if you've heard this one before. Take a terrific French comedy, produce an American remake, and watch many of the laughs disappear. Even the two huge talents who star in this film can't save it. This film isn't nearly as bad as most of the reviews seem to suggest, but it really is nothing more than ordinary at best. Do yourself a favour, and watch the original film, "Les Comperes", instead of this one. Plus, Gerard Depardieu seems as though he could give a stronger head-butt than Billy Crystal, don't you think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Remake of Francis Veber's Les Comperes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1983 Francis Veber did a delightful comedy called LES COMPERES, starring Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard, in which an ex-girlfriend approaches both men separately to help find her run-away son. It seems that, although raised by the girlfriend and her actual husband, she claims the boy was the son of either Depardieu or Richard (although she doesn't mention either of them to the other). That film follows both bungling potential daddies as they pursue their "son" and finally bring him back to his mother and her husband.American films (especially comedies) will occasionally steal ideas from French or other foreign cinemas - especially the French. It think it is more common with France because of the symbiotic relationship between our love-hate fascination with French culture, and their deep appreciation for American films. In any event, it took fourteen years before LES COMPERES was produced in the U.S. as FATHER'S DAY. It is special in several ways besides being based on such a successful French film. It is also (so far) the only co-starring vehicle for Billy Crystal and his friend and collaborator Robin Williams. They (of course) have the roles of Depardieu and Richard (although their jobs are different).The story is similar. Scott Andrews (Charles Hoffmeier) has an argument about his girlfriend Nikki Trainer (Haylee Johnson), and runs away with her. His mother Collette (Nastassja Kinski) decides to track down two old boyfriends that she had affairs with seventeen years before (the same age as Scott). One is Jack Lawrence, a successful lawyer (Crystal) and the other is an over-emotional, suicidal failed writer and actor (and mime) named Dale Putley (Williams). To both she says that the boy is actually there son. She keeps tight raps on this, but eventually her husband Bob (Bruce Greenwood) overhears her talking on the phone with Jack, and decides he must find the boy before his two rivals do. This is a change from the original movie, as the doings of Depardieu and Richards as friendly rivals was sufficiently funny by itself.Complicating Williams' search is his own emotional problems. But complicating Crystal's is that his lawyer is very busy, and on his third (presumably happy) marriage to Carrie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Jack turns down Colette's request at first - but when he is on a legal assignment in San Francisco (where Scott is supposed to be) he decides to get involved. Quickly it becomes apparent that Jack is far more efficient at getting to anywhere on this search than Dale - he won't take crap from anyone (as he does very effectively show with Nikki's father Russ Trainor (Charles Rocket) by almost crippling him when he starts being threatening. Dale (on the other hand) almost gets beaten up by Russ a couple of minutes afterward.The chemistry of the leads is the big plus here as they act and react with each other. At one point, when Crystal starts telling Hoffmeyer a story about his own youth, he just opens up the anecdote by saying "When I was ten years old my father took me to the circus". Williams quietly says, "That's a fascinating story.", as Crystal looks at him like he is crazy. Later, when it turns out the story really doesn't hold up too well as illustrating anything, Williams reassures Hoffmeyer "I didn't understand it either."The sequences include crashing several rock concerts, dealing with two dangerous drug dealers, bringing Hoffmeyer down to earth when he learns the girl of his dreams is not someone to die for, and reassuring Dreyfus that those crazy antics in Crystal's hotel room that she overheard on the phone were not anything to break their marriage over. There is some nice little throw away moments, such as Crystal at a legal deposition, learning from a seedy gentleman that two ruinous disasters at his previous businesses (a fire and a gas explosion - both after midnight) were "acts of God". Williams rehearsing in various costumes how to introduce himself to his "son" (including a rap artist, a sophisticate in a robe, and an eastern spiritual philosopher) is worth looking at. And then there is the cameo by Mel Gibson, as the ultimately stoned face piercing expert.The conclusion of the film is different from the French original. Some might think that a weakness, but I find it fascinating for giving an out to both men from a no-win situation. The change does not prevent the film from being entertaining to the viewer, if not as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been a lot better....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would expect that when the comic talents of Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are combined the results would be fairly amusing...unfortunately they are not. This is another failed attempt by Hollywood to Americanize a French movie which is everything that this film is not. One of the biggest problems with this film is that the boy is so unlikeable - probably a fault of both the script and the actor. You can't believe that anyone would care that this little idiot ran away from home, and that two people were desperate enough to be his father to chase after him. Julia Louis-Dreyfuss &amp; Nastassja Kinski have very little to do in their respective roles, especially Kinski, whose role is more of a cameo than a role of any substance. The entire setting and story behind the boys disappearance is ridiculous, as is the sub-plot involving Kinski's husband trying to find the boy as well. The leads are just not up to scratch compared to their usual comic abilities. A real let down, and a total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This year I rented the movie cuz I remember wanting to watch it ever since it came out but I forgot about it. Good thing I forgot to watch it, I would've wasted my money back then. The plot is interesting; a woman wants to find her runaway son. She tells the 2 guys, whom she had a previous relationships with, that either is the father, though they're really not. Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are a great comic duet, really, but not in this movie cuz their character is so... blah. Billy's lawyer character is too boring and Robin's writer character is too stupid.  What really surprised me is the appearance of Cali-quintet band, Sugar Ray. They had little or no dialogue, though! In one scene where Dale and Lawrence pretend to be German producers from a record label, only Mark McGrath ("I think we've met before, dude.") and Murphy Karges ("I have heard about these guys.") spoke while Rodney Sheppard, Stan Frazier and Craig "DJ Homicide" Bullock just sat there. Good thing they still have their music careers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If any of you have seen "Les Comperes" you know what I an talking about. This movie is just an absolute joke. Sure the big name talents make it seem like a great movie, but all in all it's just a waste of time. The storyline just doesn't seem as great. A kid runs away to follow a band. At least "Les Comperes" was funny. This was just *sighs* boring. Besides, Gerard Depardieu kicked the crap out of Francois Pignon so much it was just hilarious. This was just a watered down version of a pretty good French comedy. For once the French have done something better than us. It is a sign of things to come. Soon the U.S. will just bow down to the French as the better ones in movie making. Tis a shame!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoyingly stupid movie! (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, how does IMDB pick the User comment on the main film page for 'Fathers' Day'? For, if I hadn't seen the film already, I would have gotten the spoiler on Mel Gibson's cameo next to the "plot outline". So much for IMDB's strict guidelines!That aside, the film sucked. Pure and simple! Had to be one of the most stupidest films I've seen in a long time. Now, I'm a big fan of both Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, and I thought the pairing them together would make comedy heaven. Wrong! Instead, we get a stupid movie involving two guys in many unfunny moments who think they are the father of some snotty teen that has gone missing. 'Fathers' Day' is a remake of a French film called 'Les Comperes' which I haven't seen. It seems remaking French films is something Hollywood always tries to pass as their own. Well, at least 'True Lies' was good. Ivan Reitman, the director of 'Ghostbusters', 'Twins' and 'Kindergarten Cop' hasn't really had a hit in the late 90s. 'Fathers' Day' is a blemish in his resume, and proves that pairing two great comedians in Williams and Crystal doesn't work if the material and plot is completely stupid. ***POSSIBLE MAJOR SPOILER*** And don't get me started on the ending where Nastassja Kinski doesn't get what she deserves. I mean, veins would be throbbing from my head if my ex-girlfriend did that to me- and it also throws the whole premise of the film as "pointless"! END SPOILER. Along with the unfunny jokes, and stupid plot, 'Fathers' Day' is really an annoying experience.*1/2 out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a TV add for this one, and started to laugh at gags, that were in it. Plus there were two great comedians in it. I couldn't wait to see this one and I expected nothing, but laugh and a top notch comedy? So did this movie satisfied my desires for a good laugh?NO. The story could have been shown much better with the right directing, since it was interesting topic involved. But I shouldn't blame director for all the bad credits. The two leading actor didn't show a half of their acting talent (just remember a Williams unforgetable appearance in Dead poets society and if you want a comedy in Mrs. Doubtfire or Good morning Vietnam), The same goes for the rest of the crew. Just unnoticeable.SURE, there were some laughable gigs that made me watch this movie to the end. Even if it was made as a light comedy (or under 80 IQ type of movie) it should provide some fresh humor scenes. That's why I couldn' give this one a rating more than3 out of 10 (and a special plus for Mel Gibson performance and Nasstasja Kinski beauty:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just glanced at the title in the TV listing.. and for some reason read it as "Father of the Bride".. so I taped it. When I glanced at the listing again realized I was wrong and couldn't quite place it. When I came here to look it up, I realized WHY I forgot it.. If any movie with so much comic talent was ever FORGETABLE, this is it.Perhaps, the producers should have gone the whole nine yards and cast Whoopee Goldberg as the scheming mom.. that would have made the circle complete.. but Whoopee had already made that film - with Ted Danson. And it was a lot funnier.TO be fair, a lot of the dissatisfaction with the film is due exactly to Billy and Robin being featured. We expect more from them and, when the writing doesn't support the capabilities of the actors, the results are exactly what we see here: Mediocre schlock.Since Reitman was the director, that lit a (Ghostbusters) bulb; I can see Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd doing a better job with it.. or even Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very flat and predictable story. Robin and Crystal do make an ideal on-screen duo. Too bad they chose this script to do it. They can't save this mess. There are some very funny parts, but it's overshadowed by a poor story. It seems like those two and Julia Dreyfuss are the only ones making an effort. Charlie Hofheimer was very annoying and the rest of the characters looked liked they'd rather be in another film.A supposed big laugh was intended when Bruce Greenwood's character stepped into a Port-o-san, a truck backs into it, and it falls over into a ditch, implying that the interior is now flooded with human excrement, with him stuck inside. I have no aversion to gross-out toilet humor, but that is just not funny. From there the movie goes from going downhill (no pun intended) to a flat-out nosedive. I don't think I even lasted to the end.I can only hope that these two immensely talented actors will try to work another film together, but please choose something a little less insulting. Normally this would score a four, but Crystal and Williams bump it up to a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but nothing special about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father's Day is a cute movie with a few cameo appearances from Hollywood personalities. Sugar Ray plays several songs and Mel Gibson is a body piercer. Two men find each other as they search for a young boy who might be either of their sons. The son ends up getting in trouble as he follows Sugar Ray around to different cities and is saved from his problems by Dale (Billy Crystal) and Jack (Robin Williams). By the end of the movie, it turns out that neither of the men are the father of Scott and that Scott's mother was only using Dale and Jack to find her son for her. Both men return to their lives, happier and they both have their own women to share their future with. Its a happy, feel good movie with some good humor from Crystal and Williams. Pretty good movie, but nothing amazing to go out of your way to view. Its pretty much a Saturday afternoon sit down, relax, and have lunch kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not just flat, but offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can picture the pitch for "Fathers' Day". "See, you got Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, and this woman tells them each that they have a long-lost son who's run away, and then the wacky adventures begin!" I suppose this idea could have worked...well, I'm not sure exactly how, but it could have.I can picture the studio executive saying, "Sure, but make sure that Robin Williams does one of those really funny montages in which he does a bunch of different characters and voices." Yes, it's here. And yes, it's grown REALLY, REALLY OLD by now. Note to studio executive: it was funny the first few times Robin Williams did this; it's not funny anymore.What I can't picture is the thinking that went into the scene where the characters with a fear of flying (puh-leeze!) are acting foolishly on a plane, as the camera slowly pans across the row...revealing one character holding the hand of a large black man for support. See, it's supposed to be funny, right? Because large black men are really scary, and these characters are so afraid of flying that they're not afraid of this large black man, see...? Wasn't there anyone on the set to point out that this is offensive?If you can't get enough of Robin Williams doing the same shtick over and over again, movie after movie, then rent "Fathers' Day". Otherwise...well, you don't have to rent a movie every night, do you? Read a book, weed the garden, paint the bathroom ceiling...give "Fathers' Day" a pass.</fullReview>

I think Billy Crystal did a good job playing it as a straight business man but why did they rate this movie as a comedy??? The funniest part of the movie was by an actor that nobody even knows. The part where the boy's real father gets stuck in the outhouse. This is not a terrible movie but it's not all that great either. ** of 4</fullReview>

A lawyer (crystal), and a writer/Major goofball (Williams) Who have nothing in common until they both go in search of their so called son, which their Ex-girlfriend tells them both without thinking they'd team up during the search. Funny, with a laugh around every corner. This movie deserves a lot more credit than given especially cause of the two great actors and Great director IVAN REITMAN.

		<shortDescription>So tell me, why did I watch this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an American comedy staring Billy Crystal and Robin Williams and is about two grown men who are led to believe that they are the father of the same boy. An old high school girlfriend has lost her son and she approaches these men separately and tells them that the boy is their son and that he has gone missing. The men decide to seek him out and inadvertently meet and find out that they are chasing the same boy. Billy Crystal plays an upperclass lawyer who likes to think he is pretty straight and has an average life (if you count two ex-wives average, which unfortunately most people do) while Robin Williams is a crazy author who's life is quite dull, to the point where he wants to commit suicide. As for comedies, this movie is typical of America. It is funny but it is only because Robin William's character is quite bizarre. Billy Crystal, who is supposed to be a very funny comedian, is quite dull. Without the unusual character of Robin Williams, this movie would basically suck. There is a lot of Americanisms in this silly movie, such as everybody living happy at the end, and the kid lying to make everybody happy. Seriously though, lying may heal a short term wound, but it really does aggravate it in the long run. Its like putting a band aid on a bullet wound. Robin Williams' character is quite funny, but, unlike the French characters, his is just simply crazy. The French make cool characters because they are quirky. They are not outright crazy as the Americans tend to make theirs, they are just normal people with little extra things added to them. Still, can't blame them for their lack of creativity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ivan Reitman's 'Fathers' Day' is a passable flick from the long-gone year 1997. It has a interesting premise &amp; the well-known filmmaker does fairly well. It's not half as bad as it fared at the box office.'Fathers' Day' is no milestone, nor it's a very-good film, but it surely as mentioned, is a one-time watch. The film has a decent start, a bland middle, and a fair climax. Reitmen's work, according to me, is just right. Coming straight to the acting department, Williams &amp; Crystal both are the life of the show. Both are excel to the T. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has always been hot, and even her performance is quite okay. The Razzie Nomination was just uncalled for. Others are adequate. There's not much left to write, and a film like 'Fathers' Day' doesn't demand that either. Watch it, cause it's really not as bad as one would've told you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre Comedy Fueled by Star Power at the MegaWatt Level....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are two of the funniest men in the business and it is their own brilliance as comedians that makes FATHER'S DAY worth a look. In this rather lame comedy, a woman named Colette (a miscast Natassia Kinski)has a fight with her son (bland newcomer Charlie Hofheimer)who runs away from home to follow his girlfriend who is following a touring rock band. While the boy's father (Bruce Greenwood) sets out to find him, Colette calls two men from her past (Crystal, Williams)who she had affairs with years ago, tells both men that the boy is their son to get them to help in the search for the boy. Crystal is a successful attorney fresh into his third marriage (to Julia Louis Dreyfuss) and Williams is a suicidal writer who has a gun to his head when Colette calls. The plot takes all the routes you would expect but Williams and Crystal are so funny that you don't mind taking the ride. I suspect large portions of their scenes together are improvised and nobody does that better than these two. When these two are off-screen, the movie comes to a screeching halt, but when they are on, they somehow manage to make this convoluted mess worth sitting through. No classic, but Williams and Crystal fans might want to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Father's Day you Don't Want To Celebrate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are two of the funniest comedians of their generation, and they combine forces for this comedy, about two fathers who go searching for their respective suns who ran away. Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, and Natasha Kinski. I went to see this movie, appropriately enough, with my father. The movie was alright, but considering the talent involved this movie should have been much funnier. The two just seem to be sleepwalking through a badly done script. In this movie they play two fathers trying to track down their respective sons, who have run away together. While it may not be the most original the two should have been able to be funny enough to make this movie work. Unfortunately these two men are above these roles. The two have done far funnier roles separately, and it is too bad, that these two comedians get together so rarely on screen, and it is even more unfortunate this collaboration falls so short. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad movie, and it does have some good moments, but it could have been funnier. Watch for an appearance by Mel Gibson in an interesting role.</fullReview>

The two get conned by the boy's mother, a woman they each dated in their pasts, to help her find the brat who is following a whacked rock band and trying to win the affection of a teen girl who has a heart of stone. A really sorry production that wastes the enormous talents of Crystal and Williams and in the end you will think "Why did I even bother?". 2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack (Billy Crystal) is a very successful attorney in Sacramento. He has the perfect wife (Julia Louis Dreyfus), the perfect car, a jag, and the perfect clothes, plus a staff to aid him at every turn. On the other hand, Dale (Robin Williams), is a writer on the verge of suicide in Berkeley (how ironic and sad). He is scruffy and emotionally unstable. BOTH of these gentlemen get hit hard when an old girlfriend, Colette (Nastassja Kinski) calls to tell each of them, separately, that they are the father to her seventeen year old son, who has run away. She implores them to help her find him. The last lead is that he is following a popular rock band on the road with his galpal. Taking off, the two gents arrive at a concert with a picture of the same boy. Bonding quickly as duo-papas, they rescue their son Scott from a drunken slumber and take him back to their hotel. Yet, when Jack is called away on business, Scott tricks Dale and splits. Meanwhile, the father who raised Scott (Bruce Greenwood) has the misadventure of a lifetime with a flat tire, a port-a-potty, and a garage in the sticks. Now, the search is on again, this time to Reno. Will this trio of males find out who is the real father? Will they all rescue Scott before major damage can be done? This is a fun film, thanks to the stars. Yes, the plot is on the silly side but Crystal and Williams are a pairing in dreamland. While Billy deadpans one great line after another, Williams goes on a rock stage and performs a sixties dance number that is side-splitting, among other hilarious hijinks. What fun! The supporting cast is very fine, too, as are the costumes, amusing script and energetic direction. Most of all, the settings in California and Nevada are just terrific; what beautiful scenery! As a latecomer to this funny flick, I say don't YOU make the same mistake! Try to get Fathers' Day for the third Sunday in June. Now, that's a stunning idea!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun comedy starring two fun comedic actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This to my knowledge is the only film that Robin Williams and Billy Crystal made together, and in my opinion it is a good showcase for two very funny actors at the top of their game.The plot is simple enough and the great thing about that is that lends itself more towards the dynamic between the characters being shown in lots of different scrapes. There's strong verbal and physical comedy and the two actors bounce off each other so well.My only fault with the film, as others have said, is that we have a rushed ending that both doesn't paint the mother in a very good light or give us the conclusion we hoped for. In a very funny comedy it is sad to see the ending just fade away.Overall, while not being the best film either of these two actors have been in, it is still better than most of the 'comedies' we see today.</fullReview>

A woman convinces two men to go looking for her son by telling both of them they're the father. Best Performance: Robin Williams Worst Performance: Dennis Burkley</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams and Billy Crystal elevate what is essentially a lowbrow farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FATHER'S DAY, starring Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, is fairly middling as comedies go. Still, the chemistry between Williams and Crystal is very good and both deliver a number of laughs with their own brands of comedy. Billy Crystal is the straight-laced, sarcastic type while Robin Williams is a high-strung, emotional wreck with a penchant for improvisation (his character is an out-of-work playwright/actor).The premise of the movie is that a woman (Nastassja Kinski) calls and tells each of them that they're the father of her 16-year-old son who just ran away. Then they go on the road in search of him and hijinks ensue. While the concept is rather far-fetched, if you throw plausibility out the window this movie can be enjoyable. Both of the leads get to revel in their schticks for what is essentially a paycheck gig, but it still looked like they had fun working with each other.The acting across the board is OK, but this type of movie doesn't really require too much anyway. The most important facet is the humor, and for the most part this movie does fine. A lot of the gags were lowbrow and borderline tasteless, but for what it's worth I laughed quite a bit. That being said, there is one gag involving a porto-potty that was drawn out a little too long.On the negative side, there was a couple of things that disturbed me a little bit, considering Robin Williams recent death, namely, a couple of suicide jokes. When an actor plays a role, certain elements of their real life inevitably make it into the character, and there were some interesting comparisons one could make between Robin's character in this movie and his personality in real life. What really shocked me, however, was his introductory scene which shows him about to blow his brains out with a pistol. On the lighter side, there was a completely out-of-the-blue cameo in the last act that really threw me for a loop.Generally speaking, this is yet another one of Robin Williams' lesser comedies. It takes a ridiculous concept, stretches it a little too thin and piles on lowbrow gags, but it was still pretty funny in spite of itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Joe Pesci of you....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Scott has a fight with his father and runs away, his father refuses to go after him. His mother, Collette, then goes to one of her former boyfriends, Jack, a lawyer, and tells him that he's her son's real father. Jack initially refuses. So she goes to another boyfriend, Dale, who goes off looking for Scott. Eventually the two men meet and realise that they are looking for the same boy and that Collette told them they are the boy's father. What follows is a desperate search and chase, because the boy doesn't want to go back....On paper this must have sounded brilliant. Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, and Ivan Reitman. Three names that should give you comfort and confident when you know they are going to make a film together.So its a remake of a movie, The Birdcage was okay, but there is something really rotten about this movie.Williams and Crystal are as good as always, but the humour in this is just cringe worthy. Usually when you see Williams dress up and pretend, it'd be a hoot, but here, you end up feeling sorry for him.Crystal is just too violent, and here's the fundamental flaw with the film, its just too violent and dark. It should have been a family friendly movie, but the spate of innuendo, drug references, and unlikable characters, really make you dislike the film.Make it a little more slapstick, take out the vomiting, and drug lords, it would have been a winner, but its just forgettable and a dud in both stars CVs.But it has a cool Mel Gibson cameo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing to it !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let us see. The scene where (Williams) was trying so many "father" characters in front of a mirror, preparing for meeting his teen kid for the first time. Another one where he was personating a German producer. And a glimpse of (Crystal) as serious actor. Other than that, forget this movie, or simply, you'll do effortlessly ! Knowing that it's based on French movie leads to the fact that it isn't original. However watching it is what leads to the fact that it isn't funny! The script relies on just the presence of the 2 stars for the half of it, and makes easy toilet humor for the other. So it was between empty and disgusting. Seeing a moving human toilet (Williams at one point), or someone trapped in one (Greenwood in another) is what this movie considers as funny, and doesn't stop doing without any fear of repetition. As you see, this comedy has no talent and no conscience either !Gathering 2 comedy rockets like (Robin Williams) and (Billy Crystal) in one movie is a great idea, this movie isn't. That neurotic actor was interesting character, but (Williams) had no actual situations or workable lines to do. That firm lawyer was supposed to be the very rational fretful opposite, which was disappointing knowing that it was played by (Crystal). The thing is he had no funny stuff, and his seriousness wasn't utilized in a funny way (unless you think that using his head to hit people is funny !). (Nastassja Kinski) and (Bruce Greenwood), naturally cameos, were imprisoned in that empty and disgusting script. (Mel Gibson), most probably was coming across the studio while shooting, did an awful cameo. Again, the writing sucked there. The only one who was handled right things and did them rightly was the son. He undoubtedly was that lost, confused and desperate teen. Director (Ivan Reitman) does wonders with only creative scripts (remember Ghostbusters), so here's one movie he won't be proud of. As for the American movies based on French ones, long list during the 1980s and 1990s, this axiomatically remains in the bottom. And as a buddy comedy, other buddy comedies produced in the same year, from (Men in Black) to (Out to Sea), were more amusing and ? sure ? less gross! So the good side of (Fathers' Day) doesn't exceed "seeing" (Williams) and (Crystal) together in one movie. It has nothing to it script, and nothing in it feel. For the million time : Hollywood, in the last 2 decades, as if has everything except "the writing". Big tragedy that is, which you can live the most through the comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams and Billy Crystal Are Stellar Together!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS] Jack Lawrence (Billy Crystal) is a smart allec lawyer in Los Angeles whomeets with an old girlfriend who says her son Scott ran away. She also said that Jack was his father, and after the fact, she asked if Jack would go look for him, but Jack declined. Dale Putley (Robin Williams) is a depressed oddball writer inSan Fransisco who get's a phone call seconds before he was gonna blow his own brains out with a six-shooter in his mouth. It was his old girlfriend, who was Jack Lawrence's old girlfriend too. She said her son was his and asked if he'd look for him. Dale was more enthusisatic about it than Jack was. Jack travels to San Fransisco and while he's there, he interviews the parents of the girl Scott ran away with. Father first. He was anything but helpful. Jack met Dale also. They travel to see Mrs. Trainor in Dale's car. They had to go over the Golden Gate bridge and driving over bridges makes Dale nervous. Mrs. Trainor wasn't helpful until Dale pretended to cry (actually laughing). The "friends" travel to Sacramento where they find their son drunk. Both on beer and love. They take him back to San Fransisco and the next morning, he recovers and runs away. He was following around a band called Sugar Ray, and they were due to play at a concert in Reno, Nevada, so Dale and Jack travel there. Scott is also in hot water with two thugs. Well aseries of hilarious antics ensue and soon Scott is returned home to his real father and mother in Los Angeles. Apparently Jack and Dale werelied too, but it made them feel good anyway. Jack loans Dale his Jaguar(his classic, irreplaceable thing), to drive to the airport. En route,Dale meets a woman who was having car troubles. It was love at firstsite! So in Jack's car, they drive back to San Fransisco. This movie is a personal favorite of mine. I like Robin Williams and Billy Crystal and they're perfect in a movie together! They gotta make more! Both their characters were so outrageous and funny. Although I found Scott to be exactly how Jack Lawrence described him: A major pain in the ass and so damn annoying! Teenagers can be. So I strongly recommend this movie! Williams fans, Crystal fans, whatever. You'll love it</fullReview>

Also, I must admit it has a good soundtrack, with music by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Sly and the Family Stone. But otherwise, this is painfully unfunny.

I relate to the whole "not knowing your father issue" and having accepted it find this movie tickles my absurd funny bone. Humorous treatments of serious issues offend some but this movie can get people talking and that's a good thing.

I thought that was the whole point, to make people laugh? So "Father's Day" is nowhere near deep and meaningful and masterpiece-y, but it's not supposed to be. I thought it was really hilarious, particularly that part where Robin Williams just heard that his "son" is missing, and he was practicing his greeting to his son in the mirror. When he did that rap thing? It took me ten minutes before I finally shut up. This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. It *shouldn't* be taken seriously. It's a comedy, and it's funny. I've never seen Billy Crystal in anything, but that face he makes whenever Dale starts blubbering...cracks me up everytime. Pretty good acting, although the guy who played the son is really annoying. And I could've done without seeing Sugar Ray, but...I like this movie. It's the perfect way to pass boredom on a dull Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Father's Day (1997): Dir: Ivan Reitman / Cast: Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Nastassja Kinski, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bruce Greenwood: Blatantly cruel comedy that mocks fatherhood. What Nastassja Kinski does in this so-called comedy is cruel. Sure, she loves her son but she also tells two men that they are the father of her runaway son. Billy Crystal plays a lawyer who can deliver a nasty head-butt, and Robin Williams is a depressed writer who claims that attempts at suicide is the only thing keeping him alive. They both search for who they believe is their son. They also learn that he is wanted for stolen drug money. Humor is in poor taste particularly when the sincere real father goes out searching. Both leads are told that they are the real father to spare their feelings in conclusion. It is an ugly sick joke. Not a high point for Ivan Reitman who has directed such superior comedies as Ghostbusters and Dave. Crystal and Williams recycle tired material that doesn't do either one justice. Both have done superior work and will no doubt survive this trash. Kinski plays the kid's mother in the film's least sympathetic role. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is also wasted in a cardboard role. An absolute waste for all talent involved. During the next family gathering copies of this film should be used as target practice or part of a bonfire. This is the kind of film that not even dad would laugh at. Score: 0 / 10</fullReview>

Throughout the film the boy endears himself with Billy Crystal's character through loving acts such as stealing his car, stealing from drug dealers, running away constantly, having a toe that looks like his, lying to him and physically assaulting the other man by throwing hot water on his genitals (which heal surprisingly fast). So in the end Crystal's character wants kids with his wife because they're so much fun...Yeah more of Hollywood's agenda to make people want kids to buy more of their kids movies. I see your game Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be so hard on this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes critics can be too hard on some movies...it's like everyone expects every movie they watch to become a 'classic' or an academy award nominee. Well 'Fathers Day' is neither but take the movie for what it's worth. I've never been a big fan of Billy Crystal,but he he did a good job as far as acting like the 'older brother' to Robin Williams in this movie. Williams was funny as always,doing his usual bits.. the ending of the movie was better than the beggining I think,with the son telling but men who was the real father,and finally they both found out it was neither of them. Will,this movie be remembered thirty years from now? No. But it would be refreshing to watch on a lonely sunday afternoon. Hey,I have plenty of time on sundays,and why not share a few laughs from watching this movie?~CWM~</fullReview>
