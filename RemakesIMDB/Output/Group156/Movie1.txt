		<shortDescription>Nolte as a good actor? He is very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In `The Good Thief' Nick Nolte plays Bob Montagnet, a down-but-not-yet-out Bogie, a very bright thief, and a heroin addict. Natsa Kukshianidge's femme fatale, Anne, is a 17-year old Bacall. It's the south of France--Nice and Monaco-- and it's time to relieve Monte Carlo of some precious paintings. Picasso is the model for Nolte's scamming talents: Picasso's conflicted painting of a woman with 2 sides to her face is the appropriate analogy for the duality of the young girl, both innocent and depraved, and Nolte's gambler, good and bad as the title suggests. Picasso's being accused of stealing from everyone adds to the allusive charm. The caper involves a Judas deceiver to support director Neil Jordan's frequent Christian motif (Remember `Jude' in "Crying Game"). The ?crucifixion's' good thief, Nolte's thief, is good to the young Anne by saving her from the pimp. Jordan again joins an unlikely couple (Consider Fergus and Dil in "CG"), here a father figure with an errant daughter.The winding roads of the Mediterranean shoreline are also fitting metaphor for Nolte's tortuous path to redemption. The requisite drying-out scenes, where Bob handcuffs himself to the bed and rejects Anne's offer of sexual freedom, are effective realism in an otherwise stylish film that eschews clarity and ingenuity in favor of some character development and much atmosphere.The scenes at the casino are smoother than "Casablanca's," slicker than James Bond's, and lighter than "Croupier's." When Bob and Anne begin their end of the elaborate heist by challenging the house odds, there is little to worry about their losing but much about the philosophy of gambling, of going all the way regardless of the outcome. However, Jordan's take on slick thievery is not really different from that found in the recent `Confidence,' `Heist,' or `Ocean's Eleven.' The denouement is hardly logical or dramatically tight: Does an ex-thief go clean? Does he save his Mary Magdalene? Does he stop his losing streak and addiction? Does he pull off the heist? None of this is the point.Bob as a "good thief " is all that matters. And Nolte as a good actor? He is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Subtitles, Better Than Bob</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a re-make of the 1955 film noir, "Bob LeFlambeur," which I also own. That was black-and-white and made in France while this is 2002 movie in color with English-speaking actors.Usually I'll take the original over the re-make but not in this case....with one major consideration. In order to like this film, I had to play the DVD with the English subtitles on because many of the accents were just too tough to decipher and if you can't understand the dialog, it gets a bit frustrating. The story is confusing enough as it is, so, if you have a similar problem as I had, play this with the subtitles.If there is such a thing as colorful film noir, this would be it, with many splashes of the neon nightlife of France, inside and outside. Story-wise, if you're confused you are not alone. After two viewings, I still haven't totally figured out the twist at the end. The dialog tries to be snappy mid-40s Raymond Chandler stuff and sometimes it's great, other times it's affected. Overall, however, it 's fun. Nick Nolte delivers most of the clever lines. The young girl in here, Nutsa Kukhianidze, is intriguing new face, as was the case with Isabelle Corey in "Bob."This movie gets a lot of negative reviews from professional critics. Don't trust them; give this a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and Satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Good Thief' is the best film Neil Jordan did since 'Mona Lisa' almost two decades ago. It is a classical and well written robbery story, complex enough to catch the interest, simple enough for the spectator to follow and enjoy, and with the special twist at the end that makes a good script. The main character fits Nick Nolte like life, I can imagine only Humphrey Bogart doing better in this role. There are a few other memorable characters, with the Georgian (from the other Georgia) Nutza Kukhianidze promising to become soon a star if she has enough luck to continue to work with good directors and scripts. The cinematography has a special quality, with final stills after each shot, enhancing a good digital camera work. I also liked the soundtrack, it's a mix of classic, jazz and even Leonard Cohen sounds right for a change. 8/10 on my personal scale - certainly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchers and Copies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Some time back, Soderbergh took time from his glossy projects to remake `The Limey.' It was a copy but so much more: it was a film about the previous film. This was emphasized and leveraged by shots that were overlain on shots, echoing and restating motion. Very clever, but too intellectual for most I guess. To hoots and catcalls, Van Sant remade `Psycho' in a more reverential way, but the amazing Julianne Moore led a self-referential revolt of the actors to create an annotative subtext. So when you watch the film, you see three films at once: the excellent original, the slightly larger `copy' and subtle embellishments on the original in the copy as a private dialog between the viewer and actor.Now comes the most elaborate, excessive and fun of this type of hyper-irony. Neil Jordan has played with us before, even when his chancy films didn't succeed. `In Dreams' has some of the most chilling scenes I know, the underwater architecture of a parallel world. `End of the Affair' was multidimensionally self-referential, employing -- even stretching! -- the amazing Mrs Moore's ability to inhabit several persons in the same body. Even `Vampire' echoed Tarkovsky's notion of constructed memory (down to the use of Domiziana Giordano as `mother').This is a copy of a precious film. It is in fact all about copies: the paintings, the copy of Bob in Paulo, how he manipulates the idea that he will copy his past crimes, the copy of the vault in the Russian's warehouse, even the copy of the copies on its walls, the twins, the copy of Philip in Phillippa, the false copy of the plan planted in the snitch. Lots of copies, lots of similar references to repetition. Also lots of focus on observation: the cop, the cameras, the remote computer trick and the inclusion in the cast of three filmmakers noted for their `observational' stance. Everyone is watching someone else. Most of all, we have Anne as the proto-observer who anchors our own narrative perspective. She is us: eager for sense, visiting a new world, unsure of how things will unfold, magnetically drawn to the `real thing' despite its attendant obsessions and fictions. This young actress is one of the luckiest I remember, having so much attention paid to her by makers of the film. The whole enterprise is about her (and us). Nolte knows this. He's not at the level of Moore, but he sure as heck knows what's going on and supports it.Along the way, there is copious color, fakeout stories, flatout love of the camera and style of life -- a pleasant conflation of rich living from one man's letting the world define him, together with a masterful manipulation of us in our defining of the character and film based on past film memories and templates.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a smooth, satisfying caper film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set on the scenic French Riviera, Neil Jordan's `The Good Thief' is a remake of 1955's `Bob Le Flambeur,' a Gallic film that enjoyed a successful re-release in this country a few years back. This new version is a stylish caper film about an aging master criminal who comes out of retirement to help lift some priceless paintings from a Monte Carlo casino.In terms of plotting, there is little that we haven't seen in this type of film before. First, there's the idea for the heist, then the wooing of the reluctant `reformed' criminal, then the gathering of the other participants, then the intricate planning and rehearsing for the job, followed by the inevitable double dealing and double crosses, and ending with the sly turnabout ending to set our heads spinning and make us question everything we have seen heretofore. But Jordan has a knack for turning the ordinary into the extraordinary, and this he accomplishes with a complex screenplay, a strong sense of atmosphere, a host of well-developed characters, a sly sense of humor and an assortment of first-rate performances from a talented cast. Nick Nolte is superb as Bob, a shrewd, world-weary thief who is also a compulsive gambler and drug addict. Needless to say, the role seems tailor made for the star. Most of the rest of the cast is made up of French or Eastern European actors, all of whom do a fine job in their assorted roles.Actually, the only complaint I have about the film is a direct result of that largely international cast. Much of the film's dialogue is hard to understand due in large part to the very thick accents emanating from most of the actors. Even the one native English speaker, Nolte, is difficult to comprehend at times, but that's just because Nolte is simply being Nolte and we expect to miss half of what he is saying anyway.Apart from that, `The Good Thief,' less polished and slick than movies like "Ocean's Eleven," offers top-notch entertainment for the hardcore heist film aficionado.</fullReview>

This is not a basic average Hollywood-movie - it's a great mixture of the best stuff from both American and European movies, still without any over-dramatizing you see in independent films. The acting and the casting is just fantastic, all lead roles pull of something they might never repeat. -AND the movie really has the moods; spectacular atmosphere throughout the movie. Since this movie I've been searching for all Nolte-movies I haven't seen.. Really, I say no more, you just make sure you see this one! Totally amazing..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, gritty, multi-accented heist flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good Thief " is a classier one-last-great-heist film than "Ocean's 11," in a more exotic Riviera locale with grittier repartee and well-worn actors with many different accents. The long-time camaraderie among crooks and cops is comfortably reflected, though much back story has to be stretched to explain why American Nick Nolte fits in. Based on a 1955 French film I haven't seen, "Bob le flambeur," I don't know how much Neil Jordan changed from the original. It has the kind of twists and turns that has strangers in the audience turning to each other at the end to compare notes. Really odd that Ralph Fiennes's cameo is uncredited, as he's terrific, and much more effective here as a leonine cynic than as a romantic in "Maid in Manhattan." Most creative transsexual character since "Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert" and neat use of the Polish brothers. Jordan resists another male fantasy until the end when Nolte finally pairs up with the seductive teen-ager who conveniently announces she has just turned 18 so he can't add statutory rape to his rap sheet. Oh, so then we're supposed to feel happy ever after. Very nice world-weary multi-lingual soundtrack, including Serge Gainsburg and Leonard Cohen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GOOD THIEF (3+ outta 5 stars)Very good character study/caper film about a drug-addicted American criminal (Nick Nolte) in France who straightens himself out for one more Big Score. He in constantly under the watchful eye of a kindly police inspector who wants to stop him for his own good... so he hits upon a plan to devise a *fake* robbery to divert attention from the *real* one. It's a remake of an old French classic, "Bob La Flambeur" (which I haven't seen yet... so I may have a different take on this movie after I've seen the original). The cast (various character actors of different nationalities) is great... and Nolte portrays a very believable down-on-his-luck substance-abuser... but that may not be much of a stretch for him. Directed and written by Neil Jordan... it may not be one of his best movies ("The Crying Game", "The Butcher Boy") but it's still a fine piece of work.</fullReview>

Jordan captures the mood of drugs and nightlife with the fantastic photography and very cool soundtrack, including Leonard Cohen and a great version of That's Life. The cast makes this film, especially Nutsa Kukhianidze as Anne and Said Taghmaoui as Paulo, whose interaction take the film in an even more interesting direction, while the addition of identical twins (the Polish brothers) was a stroke of genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A heist movie that oozes style, particularly in the form of Nick Nolte, gangster, part-time heroin addict (he handcuffs himself to the bed to go cold turkey before a job) and good guy. He befriends a gorgeous young waif (Nino Kukhanidze) with only altruistic motives (when she could potentially become his Achilles Heel) and proceeds to mastermind a complex heist, playing a chummy cat and mouse with the chief of police. Far classier than your average thriller, and mercifully lacking (with the occasional plot-based exception) in explosions and fast car chases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusually satisfying story of male affection/vulnerability,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>within an interesting heist flick. All of the leading actors are middle aged men and they are INTERESTING people who enjoy being together and respect each other. This is what captures us, the film audience -- as well as the two young actors (guy and girl) who want to be part of this engaging friendship. Nolte's warmth and ironic humor are at the center of this. As his longtime cop friend says, "Everybody likes Bob, that is the problem!".The heist is really a question of whether this group of men's unusual dignity, intelligence, and ability will be victorious over the Establishment in which people never do more then live half lives; i.e., unlike what makes the main characters appealing. Perhaps all of the films built on this classic pattern are saying, "the real criminality is never to have been alive."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dissapointing trashy hollywood remake..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another one of the current slew of trashy hollywood remakes. Incase you did not know that this is, infact, a remake, of the French Noir classic "Bob le flambeur".They took a very stylish, very charming new wave french crime film, that was made on a shoe string budget, and threw lots of money at it, and added lots of T&amp;A, drugs, transsexuals, techno music and, oh yes, a zombie-like Nick Nolte.Part of the charm of the original, was that on an extremely low budget, Jean-Pierre Melville created a very stylish, classy, and all around cool film. It took him 4 years to make it, simply because he had to keep stopping to raise more money.This new film had too much money for its own good. Part of the charm of the original was that it was shot guerilla style with very little money.And why on earth did they make Bob a DRUG ADDICT!? what the hell?!?!?! The whole POINT was that Bob was the old, wise, COOL guy. Now he's this old mumbling heroin addict. They added lots of drug use, WHY? They added a transsexual, for comic relief, WHY? and they replaced the really cool old score with dance music and lounge jazz....WHY?!----spoiler alert----and for the love of god....by far, the worst changeTHEY GAVE IT A HAPPY ENDING!!!!?!??!what the hell?!?!?! Paulo is supposed to get SHOT! because he's an IDIOT! and even worse...Bob is supposed to go to JAIL!----end of spoiler----anyway....I can possibly understand every once and a while remaking and updating an old film. Not to replace a classic, but to stand next to it. This film does not deserve to have any relation to Jean Pierre Melville at all.If you want to see a decent remake of Bob le Flambeur, see Paul Thomas Anderson's "Syndey", admittedly directly inspired by "Bob". Or, just stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are repugnant in principle, but they can occasionally be worthwhile, if the people making them actually have something new to say. That's definitely the case with The Good Thief.Jean-Pierre Melville's 1956 Bob le Flambeur is a quirky but masterful film. It's also flawed in many ways. Its most obvious limitation is the leading man, Roger Duchesne, who clearly lacks the charisma required by the part. Melville worked on the cheap, and couldn't afford a big-name star. Neil Jordan rectifies that problem beautifully; Nick Nolte is absolutely the perfect choice to play Bob Montagné.Bob le Flambeur also has a very peculiar loping pace, which adds to its charm, but works against its logic. Things in Melville's films seem to happen almost at random; characters often come and go, win or lose, for little obvious reason. Jordan adds several levels to Meleville's original plot, making it flow more smoothly and rationally. In the process, he turns The Good Thief into a rather different film - more of a complex heist caper, compared to Melville's simpler mood piece.Nonetheless, The Good Thief does retain Melville's fundamental affection for the central character. In fact, we get a deeper look at Bob, who has now added a drug habit to his other vices. Jordan also does a lot more work to 'sell' the original ending. He gives us a more explicit interpretation - it's all about doing things with style. This is Jordan's personal commentary on a film he obviously admires.Of course, despite its flaws (or perhaps because of them), Bob le Flambeur is clearly a ground-breaking masterpiece. The Good Thief is not. It's merely a very good film - likable, clever, insightful, less frustrating and far more entertaining than the original. It's not so much a remake as a reinterpretation. It deepens our appreciation of the original, but also stands alone as a fine work in its own right.In short, I'd recommend both films very highly. See Bob le Flambeur when you're in the mood for a breakthrough art film, graced with moody black-and-white photography of 1950s Paris. See The Good Thief when you'd prefer a colorful caper film with strong characters and some real philosophical depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind Of Blue: The Good Thief and Jazz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An essential tool for every aspiring jazz musician, a "fake book" is a huge compilation of sheet music encompassing classic pieces: jazz standards. Each piece's theme is written out simply with standard notation, and chord symbols appear above the staff, to allow improvisers to work their magic, hoping to both reshape and pay homage to even the most hackneyed, endlessly covered tune. Neil Jordan's The Good Thief (UK, 2002) is a hyper-stylized and passionate riff on a seminal heist film ? Bob Le flambeur (Jean- Pierre Melville, France, 1956). Many cues within the film, not least the duplicated paintings, seem to be inspired by this essence ? that it is itself a reproduction and reinvention of an earlier work, building on the essential structure created a half-century ago.Launching from the foundations of this earlier work of art, Jordan is able to reimagine it as a fast-paced, inventive, character-driven thriller, with its palpable suspense woven from many competing tensions, for instance youth versus experience, morality versus debauchery, authenticity versus fakery and even chance versus predestination, all while reinforcing these contradictions with an assured and clever manipulation of visual leitmotifs. Like jazz music itself, everything is a celebration of contradictions here, from the nature of the film itself to its characters, plot and formal devices. The plot is simple: an ageing master thief, Bob Montagnet (played to the mischievous hilt by a grungy yet twinkling Nick Nolte) is playing out the coda of his once glorious career, almost drowning in a seedy strip-club soup of heroin, debt and existential angst. An act of altruism to save an underage stripper named Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze) ? who herself is another study in contrasts, alternatingly na?ve and lubricious ? sets off a series of events which inspire him to reinvent himself one last time in a gamble to pull off a massively profitable heist with the help of a motley crew of criminal associates. Despite a carefully orchestrated plan, Bob is confronted with a series of unpredictable events, but the interplay of various moving parts beyond his control and a universe- defying dose of good luck turn the tables and result in his ultimate vindication.The French are known to be great lovers of jazz; and the overall feel of The Good Thief (enhanced by the smoky music of Leonard Cohen and Serge Gainsbourg) translates many of that musical mode's qualities to the screen. A characteristic of cool jazz performances from the 1950s, made popular by legends like Miles Davis and John Coltrane, is that they start with a coherent melody, veer away through improvisation to as chaotic a place as remains tolerable, before rediscovering and coalescing back to the harmony of the original tune. From a macroscopic standpoint, the film's narrative arc charts a similar course. A revered underworld figure, once at the very top tier of the world of thievery, descends into restiveness and discord, is reawakened by beauty, executes and improvises a meticulous series of parallel schemes and actions with the help of a (mostly) steady band of confidantes, and finally and utterly gets his groove back. Clearly, the ability to improvise while staying "cool" despite sweet-sounding plans going awry is a key asset for big-time crooks, and Bob's grace under pressure (does he possess a megalomaniacal confidence in a positive outcome, an existential "whatever will be, will be" attitude, or a paradoxical gambler's combination of both?) serves him very well in the end ? perhaps the sense that his character has played a variation on this type of heist many times before means that, like a pro soloist, he can comfortably coast on instinct and faith. Indeed, it seems somehow natural and reassuringly symmetrical that everything literally comes up aces for Bob and his crew at the climax of the film.It is interesting to note that Bob's tech-savvy co-conspirator Vladimir is first seen in a decrepit old warehouse where he is improvising a guitar solo which is being translated via computer into an abstract laser display. The character is played by another film director, Emir Kusturica, and the translation of a story (which musicians would call an improvised solo) into light it is symbolic of a director's work.Adding to the film's overall aesthetic is the repeated use of freeze frames at the end of sequences, a kind of rhythmic visual stutter, which adds a strobe-like syncopation, and further evokes the intrinsic similarities of the editing process to musical phrasing. Bathed in swaths of blue light, evoking the pop art which identify the cool jazz records of the 50s, The Good Thief shines as a rewarding tribute to a very complex and complimentary set of art forms, film and improvised music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third kind of heist movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heist movies are of two kinds: those where the heist is successful and end in some sort of bliss for the robbers (on whose side the viewers always are) and those where it fails and ends up in tragedy. The heist told in this movie belongs to a third kind because in my opinion it's neither successful nor unsuccessful like you will see in the end and understand why I am saying so. Nick Nolte does an excellent job in the role of a middle aged gambler, heister and drug addict who plans a robbery of valuable pictures in a casino in the south of France despite the fact that he is being watched by the police. The heist plan is very original indeed and it is based on a fake heist on one place while the real robbery will take place on another one. The end of the movie is bit confusing while mixing luck at gambling (in a rather unbelievable and unexplained way) with the success or failure of the heist itself. Well but it's a merry movie (except for the only death that occurs there)and Nick Nolte plays his part in a wonderful way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Running from bad luck and bad situations is something that most people do out of a simple survival instinct. Bob the thief (Nick Nolte) embraces bad luck and hard times just to spite himself and keep his life tilting along the razor edge he is accustomed to. He is not without honor or brains, but his run of bad luck has culminated in the loss of a last bet. His remaining choice is to orchestrate an impossible heist or slide into heroin-induced ruin as part of the gutters of Paris.The heist film has been popular over the last several years, and it could be overkill to do a remake of a respected noir thriller. "Heist" was David Mamet pushing his skills of sharp dialogue into a tight plot of double-and-triple-cross. Frank Oz's "The Score" was a Hollywood character study disguised as a heist. "Ocean's Eleven" was a great piece of ensemble entertainment. However, Neil Jordan keeps thriving life in the genre by filling his edgier film with characters you can imagine populating the social underbelly of southern France. (Please keep in mind that this is only a review of the 2002 film on its own. This is not intended as a comparison with the original.)Anna (Nutsa Kukhianidze) is the 17-year-old prostitute who Bob rescues by throwing a winning poker hand with her pimp to pick a fight and lift her passport in the fracas. She is a drug addict, but speaks ironically about herself and her future when people ask, and respects Bob's protégé enough to refuse to return more than physical love. Although Roger (Tcheky Karyo) is a police detective who thoroughly knows Bob's less-than-legitimate past, they maintain a delicate friendship of polite lies and strange courtesies. Roger, as a professional. tries to determine what Bob's next job is; while, as a friend, is simultaneously attempting to talk him out of it. Tony Angel (the impeccable Ralph Fiennes) is an art dealer who Bob uses to finance his job with a rare Picasso, but when Bob's treachery is uncovered, Tony is another force to be reckoned with. There are arguing protégés, a conniving set of twins, the scorned pimp trying to get adequate revenge on Bob, and his team of quirky, yet professional thieves. It's the blow-with-the-wind way that the characters interact which makes the outcome believable. Jordan's re-adapted dialogue lets the audience fill in the unspoken meaning more often than it spells everything out - something that makes the seedy goings on that much more unpredictable. The photography of Chris Menges is simply breathtaking. It would be hard not to capture the glamour of the Riviera, but it's the way he captures the shadows of the ill-lit apartments, alleyways and strip clubs that really gain our attention. It all adds to the sense that the world of Bob and his associates are all inhabiting a world that may crumble in on them at any time and increasingly makes you hope that Bob hasn't bitten off more than he can chew. That is what sets it apart from a myriad of mediocre crime thrillers - its not about the win, it's all about the play. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoy spending time with realistic, well developed characters as the story slowly maneuvers towards a satisfying (but not necessarily flashy) ending then you might enjoy this. The pacing is reminiscent of The Big Sleep or The Third Man, so some might not have the patience for it (they should go see The Italian Job, also good but more of a standard "popcorn movie"). In "The Good Thief" the journey is more important than the destination and the dialogue and performances (Nolte in particular, of whom I'm not normally a fan) make it a pleasure to watch. I recommend it strongly, but am not surprised by the negative reviews I've seen here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I haven't seem the original "Bob le Flambeur" I'm not in a position to compare the two versions.In the right hands this could have a been a good (possibly great) film. Unfortunately in Jordan's hands it's just a mess. As in many of his other films Jordan has good ideas but seems to be incapable of carrying them through successfully.An immediate problem is the constantly mumbled dialogue. In a film with pretensions at a complex heist plot that's a complete no-no. It may be realistic in a real-world sense but it's certainly no fun for the viewer. The cast are good and the cinematography is fine. The biggest problem is the script. It comes across like a first draft with numerous logical holes, spurious scenes and cardboard characters. Some of the plot twists are very reminiscent of the Oceans series and one has to wonder how much of an influence they were on the plot, particularly in the later stages of the film. Here they just don't work as they aren't sufficiently developed or underpinned to convince. It's almost as if Jordan was writing the film as he went along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do I look for in a good movie? Personally, it's a cool mood-inspiring soundtrack, a stylish lead and stunning locations. I want to escape in the fantasy of the character and his world. I want to think that they are Mr. Smooth and that they can get away with anything. Which is why my favourite film is the original Thomas Crown Affair.And why I loved the Good Thief. Maybe Nolte's character was flawed (i.e. drug-addicted criminal), yet he was loyal and caring. Loved the twist at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Neil Jordan's "The Good Thief" and "Ondine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's what I deal with? that meeting place between fairy tale and real life." - Neil Jordan Neil Jordan directs "The Good Thief". The film stars Nick Nolte as Bob, an ex convict, addict, thief and full time drunk. Speaking in slurred speech and bumbling about Southern France like a grizzly bear with a hangover, Bob spends most of his time doing good deeds for down on their luck women, taking young thieves under his wing or chatting to local police, most of whom enjoy his company despite his criminal past. He's quite literally a good thief, liked by all. The film was based on Melville's "Bob The Gambler", an influential "heist movie". Jordan's film is faithful to Melville's, whilst also staking out its own style and story.Like most of Jordan's films ("Company of Wolves", "Mona Lisa" etc), "Thief" attempts to collide a gritty crime-and-drugs plot with fairytale tropes. Nolte's part noir knight, part alcoholic on a downward slope to hell. When he attempts to pull off a dramatic casino heist, we're left at the edge of our seats, anxious to know whether fantasy wins out over the grunge. But the joke of the movie ? the film sets up several possible resolutions then ends with a fairytale deus-ex machina - is in Jordan's delight in forcing us to recognise the romanticism in filth, and the grungy, seedy side of fairy tales. Noir/crime-cinema is largely a fantasy, or fantastical, and romantic idealism always has its sleazy flip-side.Beyond this, the film is preoccupied with doubles, replicas, doppelgangers and copies. There's a real heist and a fake heist, several twinned characters, authentics and surrogates, real paintings and fake copies, real rooms and fake mock-ups, double-crimes, double-bluffs, double crosses, two versions of every story and Jordan's usual fondness for transsexuals (muscular men with boobs and/or effeminate men) or those who undergo sex change operations, all of which again contribute to the blurring of all lines between original and copy. The germ of originality is always moving, just as Bob himself continually seems to rely on reinvention. While Melville's "Bob" was largely silent, stoic, and modelled on Sterling Hayden's role in "Asphalt Jungle", Jordan's Bob is both a fake and aware that he is a fake, continually recreating his past in order to get out of whatever fix he finds himself in. He also talks incessantly about thievery, numbers, probability theory, gambling, art etc, and idolises Pablo Picasso, who he regards, perversely, as the best thief that who lived. His prized possession is itself a Picasso, which he claims he won during a bet with the master."A film about remaking, reinvention, about the interplay between fakes and originals, became interesting to me," Jordan says, and in a way his film almost plays like a treatise on remakes. He even goes so far as to have Melville's heist literally play out as a "fake heist" within the film, which is then used to distract the authorities, and audience, from the "real heist". This "real heist" then itself turns out to be a fake. The way the old, new and newer vie for attention, or even survival, is itself embodied by the cast, who like Bob (and Jordan) are all old, haggard and on the verge of retirement - a French detective Inspector, played warmly by Tcheky Karyo, is Bob's closest companion - or young, cocky and hungry for mischief. Bob survives, like Jordan and his film, because he knows how to adapt. Jordan acknowledges this autobiographical quality: "Bob eventually solves the problems inherent in the idea of a remake. He likes copies, replays, versions of versions, feints, old hands played in different ways. Even the Picasso he owns is revealed to be a double of the original, a fake. It's a good fake, though, Bob says. Painted by Keating, one of the truly great fakers." Today Paul Keatings are celebrated and sell for millions.Like Melville's film, indeed like all noirs, "Thief" is preoccupied with luck and a sort of existential indeterminism. Bob lives by the dice, but secretly dreams of the impossibly complicated heist, planned to aesthetically pleasing perfection. His artfully constructed plot fails, of course, but he is nevertheless rescued by a moment of cosmic luck (a reversal of "The Killing's" climax, again with heist maestro Sterling Hayden, released the same year as Melville's film).Not as good as "Thief" is Jordan's "Ondine", which stars Colin Farrell as an Irish fisherman who, like Bob, is a former drunk who finds himself plucking a woman, his own personal lady luck, out of darkness. He's convinced she's a mermaid and believes she can alter fortunes. Fairy tale tropes ? a fisherman's love for and dependence upon a magical woman, and vice versa ? and grungy, crime tropes then collide, Jordan revealing that the woman is really a drug mule, is evading gangsters and so forth. The "mermaid's" magical powers, her ability to control fate, is then revealed to be a sham. Events in the film which we perceived to be "magically" preordained are then revealed to be pure chance. This echoes the climax of "The Good Thief" in multiple ways. "Ondine" then ends with the couple living happily ever after despite a complete breakdown of their and our preconceptions; the girl isn't a magical, fairytale princess, but she's princessly despite her foibles, the fisherman isn't a hero, but is heroic despite his flaws. In each of these films, the realistic basis allows for the fairytale, and we're asked to recognise that fairy tales can't exist without something sleazy to be rescued from.Aesthetically, both films are special; hyper-moody, sensual, lots of night skies, eye-popping lights, or in the case of "Ondine", atmospheric Irish coastal towns, cold greys and cosy wool sweaters. "Thief" utilises odd jump-cuts, a nod to the French New Wave. Both films rely on mood, tone and place to make up for their weaknesses.8.5/10 - Worth two viewings</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by Nolte</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thief comes out of retirement, and the gutter, to put together an audacious plot to rob a casino in defiance of a policeman with whom he has personal history; how many times have you seen that one before? Yet although 'The Good Thief' does not exactly set new standards in originality, it has certain merits that set it above the average film of it's type: the complex plot, a certain skill in invoking the mood of the underbelly of France (even if all the dialogue is spoken in English); and Nick Nolte's unique ability to convey a sense of ruination. Offsetting this, Nutsa Kukshianidge' female lead is very pretty but I found her acting unconvincing; at times the story appears to be trying too hard; and director Neil Jordan certainly is, with his busy style and some off-putting habits (in this film, he peculiarly ends each scene with a freeze-frame, which adds nothing to the movie save annoyance). Even so, it's one of Jordan's better movies, a thriller that mixes grime and glamour, even if it never quite manages to transcend its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Synopsis Spoiler! The film is about an aging thief, gambler, and drug user Bob (Nick Nolte) who is down on his luck. He has a chance to change his luck by robbing a casino in the French Riviera. However, what Bob doesn't know is that someone has tipped the police of the heist. The policeman, Roger (Tcheky Karyo) who has a friendship with Bob, begins to watch him knowing that he will eventually have to arrest Bob for this crime. To get ready for the heist, Bob quits taking drugs cold turkey. One of the funny scenes that I liked was when Bob must get rid of Roger who is following him. Bob gets Roger to drive him to an addiction meeting and tries to get Roger to admit that he is an addict too. Bob goes into the meeting and goes out the back door. Bob's part in the heist is to gamble at the casino and keep the police focused on him while the team does the job. With Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze) and great style, Bob wins big. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish film with a very confused ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very enjoyable film right up until the climax. Then it was suddenly over and I was left wondering what had just happened, and that's not usually the sign of a good movie.Nick Nolte is very good in the role of an aging thief in the south of France. He's turned sour over the years and has just hit rock bottom when the opportunity of a big casino heist turns up. He kicks his heroin habit and prepares to steal some paintings the casino owners are holding in a vault.********* SPOILERS *********This involves the plot, so you might want to turn away if you haven't seen the film.Nick and his gang have a plan: They're gonna leak the news to the police that they're planning on breaking into the casino vault, but the real robbery involves stealing the paintings held across the street in a secure room. The police will fall for the ruse while they make off with the real goods.On the big night, everyone's in place except Paulo, who had to flee after killing the snitch who was screwing his girlfriend. Nick and Anne go into the casino and gamble while the boys are across the street tunneling into the room where the paintings are. But the police are on to the switch and are waiting for the thieves to break in.Now, here's where the ending confuses me. The heist goes wrong because a gas line breaks and the thieves abandon their plan. But Nick is in the casino and he's on an amazing winning streak. I couldn't follow how much he was ahead, but it looked like tens of millions of francs - maybe the equivalent of ten or twenty million dollars.Nick cashes all his chips in finally and the casino discovers that their vault has been emptied when they go to pay him. The twins working inside the casino have pulled off the caper they'd been planning and which Nick was aware of. In fact, Paulo must have helped them because he's seen in the end climbing out of the car with all the casino's money in it.So, my question is, was Nick involved in the other heist, the one that really worked, or was his take just the winnings he made at cards? The way he won was so off the charts that I was expecting them to reveal he'd had some inside help, but that apparently wasn't the case. So, was Nick just incredibly lucky or was he really a very clever thief? I couldn't tell what the ending meant, and that was unsatisfying after having enjoyed the buildup.*********Good characters and the scenery along the Riviera was terrific. Nolte does mumble a lot, but I could understand him for the most part. Tchéky Karyo was good as the detective shadowing Nolte throughout the film - they had a friendly relationship and Tchéky seemed on the verge of laughing at the other actor's jokes a few times. Nutsa Kukhianidze is an eyeful as Anne. The rest of the cast is also very good.Entertaining, but that ending still confuses me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing. Good last quarter can't quite redeem it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What went wrong with the first hour and a half of this film? I don't really know. I found myself trying to work out whether the script was bad or whether the execution of the script was bad. I guess either way the responsibility is left with Neil Jordan. On reflection I think much of the dialogue was poor, the editing wasn't great and the story itself couldn't fill the time that was asked of it. So the film muddles along, not making much sense, and leaves you really quite bored. Much has been made of Nick Nolte's performance but (as much as I love him) I couldn't really see why -not that he was at fault, but his character didnt develop or really have any depth whatsoever. The same was true of most of the other characters in the film too. I actually thought the girl was OK. At least she looked good in her pants.To be honest I'm rambling off here like the film. A couple of points though - is it me or did the scene where Nolte picks up the girl from the side of the road seem totally unnatural? And [SPOILER?] how does Nolte's sidekick just get away with murder without even going to San Remo?!So there you have it. It saddens me to say it, but Daredevil is a better film than this. And that's coming from someone who would rather see an independent film over a studio film 9 times out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't much one can, or for that matter should say about Neil Jordan's "The Good Thief". Fun and stylish heist movie that drags a bit in the middle but gets back on track by the end. Along for the ride with a weathered thief/drug addict/bon vivant named Bob (Nick Nolte) is a motley crew of characters with varying degrees of fashionable zaniness. The most notable of the lot might be transsexual Philippa (Sarah Bridges) and security-systems expert Vladimir from Vladivostok (played by another raconteur European director Emir Kusturica). Dialogue, though, sounds like it was written by a teenage comic book artist in a foreign palaver and then translated into English. The fact that most of the actors don't list the language of the British as their mother tongue isn't helping either, especially when the details of a complicated robbery are being discussed. However, this all fits comfortably enough in the overall ambiance of the movie. Choice of music is excellent, enhancing the experience greatly. It was nice to see the REAL south of France with its strong Algerian influences instead of just the usual white bred high society crowd most people associate with Monte Carlo and Nice. In addition to Algeria, we also get some Russia, Bosnia, England.. P.S.: Young actress from Georgia Nutsa Kukhanidze is another bright spot managing for her vulnerable character Anne to also come off very sexy, chic and even debonnaire. Through her confident performance she really sells us on the notion of these hardened 'old' men being infatuated with a 17-year-old crack whore from Bosnia. And they say movies sugarcoat reality... :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Good Thief" is a smart heist flick with Nolte at the center as a rogue with a heart and a habit who is as at home at a casino baccarat table as he is in the streets of Nice. This film is all about Nolte, a babe, and his gang of expert thief assistants who assemble to rip off a Monte Carlo casino under the watchful eye of the cops. This well crafted flick features a cosmopolitan cast, a crisp location shoot on the Riviera, a cleverly convoluted story which gets busy and stays busy, attention to detail seldom seen in movies, and a good musical score. Recommended for anyone into heist flicks but don't expect much else. This tight little drama is all about the heist. (B)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good remake of "Bob Le Flambeur" ( but I still prefer the original). Nick Nolte plays Bob this timeout, a down and out gambler and retired crook who bites when the "big job" comes his way. He assembles a team of thieves and they construct a plan to hit the Monte Carlo casino one day before the Grand Prix. His Nemesis, a cop, has a feeling something is going down, but isn't quite sure of what. Neil Jordan does a great job of taking the source material and adding knew life into it, by adding new characters, some subplots and other surprises. I really like how actors like Ralph Fieenes waltzes right in and does a cameo and leaves. Same with the Polish towns. But the original 60's film had it's new-wave style, and nothing can replace that.</fullReview>

As with the original, this remake of "Bob le Flambeur" gets off to a slow start before picking up some steam, but the overall effect is less than satisfying. Nolte plays the world-weary criminal with his usual whispers and grunts, making it hard to understand much of his delivery. The 1956 film featured a terrific debut performance from Isabelle Corey; here, the role is played by newcomer Kukhianidze, who, like Corey, is an alluring presence. Oddly, there's a brief freeze frame during the transitions between scenes, an eccentric decision by director Jordan that serves no purpose other than being a distraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bobby Montagnet: Drug Addict and Thief. Swell fella though and it's so nice in Nice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good Thief is written and directed by Neil Jordan. A remake of French film Bob le flambeur, it stars Nick Nolte, Emir Kusturica, Nutsa Kukhianidze, Tcheky Karyo and Said Taghmaoui. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Chris Menges.Bob Montagnet (Nolte) is slipping further down the ladder of hope, addicted to drugs and gambling he allows himself a shot at glory by taking part in one last intricate heist....The heist at the heart of The Good Thief is pretty much playing second fiddle to the characters involved with said heist on each side of the law. This is primarily about conversations and characters defined by their actions, there's no shoot-outs and screeching of car tyres as the Gendarmerie pursue edgy criminals. It's sedately paced and neatly stitched together, even if it's too smooth for its own good at times. A trait of Jordan's is to focus on a main character with issues and have the audience wondering how it is going to pan out. Here Jordan gets maximum mileage out of this premise whilst directing Nolte to a terrific and gripping performance.Cast around Nolte are mostly splendid, though young Kukhianidze is a bit overwhelmed by the quality around her. Chris Menges photography is beautiful, affecting golden hues for character moments of hope, cold tones for harsher aspects of the story. There's a rich cosmopolitan flavour to the production, both with the French setting and cast list, while the patience of the viewer is rewarded with a well constructed last half hour as the heist comes into play and one or two tricksy reveals come tumbling out of the card deck.It's about brain over brawn in this one, hardly a masterpiece of the crime drama sphere, but Nolte and that last third make it well worth the time of the discerning cinephile. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You seen one heist film, you seen them all. But every once in a while, somebody who really gives a you-know-what, figures out how to make it fun again.The Good Thief doesn't stray from established nostrums of the genre.There's the eclectic band of robbers drilling holes under a sealed room. There's the stoic and ultra-exotic moll - and I mean EXOTIC because I've never seen something like Nutsa Kukhianidze. There's the double, triple cross plot and the debt that must be paid by Monday... or else. Yeah, on paper this reads like the heist film blueprint by Jules Dassin or Jean-Pierre Melville himself, but The Good Thief is a lot more and a true underrated gem. It's a heck of a surprise considering it's a remake of a Melville's Bob Le Flambeur. It's all in good fun, Picasso stole too right?Nolte never seemed so at home or at ease. It's questionable if he read any dialog from a script at all. Nolte is not acting - this is pure skill, confidence and simply brilliant casting. Where the hell was his Oscar? Under recorded environmental dialog has you leaning in to catch every word under the ambient scattered noise. The photography has a realist punch that makes Ocean's 11 look like the bench warmer who tries too hard. Don't miss the slick soundtrack of blues, jazz and even vibrant French rap.Rapid fire dialog right out of David Mamet leads character exchanges, but here it is far more engaging than his rhythms of nonsensical unimportance you find in most Mamet productions. There's a drive and purposeful feel to the editing too. Where Michael Bay movies are loud orgies of quick cutting rock nonsense, the Good Thief cuts less like a Bay Ferrari commercial but with a pulse of real life. You can't miss the frame drags in chases or the Jules and Jim freeze frame at the end of scenes. At first it seems too much, but in reflection of the whole, you see it's just a director doing things because he loves what he does. He's in love with making the movie.Einstein didn't believe in luck and I never knew Neil Jordan had it in him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for something a bit different in heist film, check out The Good Thief. It's a smart, sexy film that has an excellent cast and some oddball twists (transgender member of the crew, identical twins, a "fake" &amp; "real" heist) that give this film an edgy feel.Speaking of feel, this film has a style all its own. For lack of a better term, I call it "Euro Sleaze". It mixes the traditional high class of Monte Carlo and the South of France with some of the modern realities of Europe: young Eastern European women being sucked into the sex business, gambling, crime, and ex-pats from 3 continents. You combine this with the mash up of graffiti covered back alleys and glitzy gambling casinos and a soundtrack that mixes electronic and Leonard Cohen, you have an atmosphere that is second to none.The acting is solid. I'm biased in that I'm a HUGE Nick Nolte fan, and he does not disappoint. Ralph Finnes is more than a cameo: he delivers a powerful performance in short time on screen. Nutsa Kukhianidze portrayal of Anne is incredible, playing the teenager-on-the-verge-of-woman role to the hilt. However, the sign of a good movie is the quality of the supporting cast and this film has as an excellent one. There are no wasted roles or performances.My only complaint is that there just seemed like there was that little extra something that seemed to be missing. Otherwise, if you are looking for an off-beat heist film, give this one a try. You might be surprised.</fullReview>

Depressed and feeling that he just hasn't got it, being a criminal mastermind, anymore Bob soon comes up with a plan to make up for all the lost time he spent in both drug and alcohol rehabs. Getting together with his close friend and fellow crook Raoul, Gerard Darmon, Bob cooks up this plan to knock off the famous Monte Carlo Casino the day that the Grand Prix is being run.The plan calls for a slight of hands job with Bob's partners in crime Roul and Co. breaking into the Casino's safe that has 80 million francs worth of precious paintings. This while having the police and casino security think that they'll actually ripping of the same number of fakes in the main casino ballroom upstairs from where the real paintings are being kept! The key to all this is with Bob at he time in the casino gambling and being seen by hundreds of gamblers and tourists as well as the casino's battery of security cameras. This action on his part will provide Bob with an air tight alibi in not participating in the robbery.Far too complicated to go into details, without giving away the very clever surprise ending, "the Good Thief" has Bob pull off a real double whammy to the surprise of everybody watching, as well as in, the movie. Bob not just lowers the boom on the casino and the cops headed by Bob's good friend, who want's to see him go straight, Capt. Roger, Theley Karyo,but on his clueless, in what his real plans are, fellow crooks as well.Besides Nick Nolte and the aforementioned cast members there's also Nutsa Kukhiaidze as the part time hooker and full time nightclub dancer Anne. Anne gets herself involved with Bob and is used by him as a partner in his extraordinary gambling exploits in the casino later on in the film. The crew that both Bob &amp; Roul assembled included sex-changed, from a male to a female, bodybuilder the former Philip and now Philipe, Julien Maurel. Philipe's fear of spiders, something he or she keeps secret from the rest of the crooks, later almost blows the entire caper wide open.There's also the Judas, or rat-fink, that Bob covalently set up without his knowledge to throw the police off to what he was doing Algerian fugitive Said, Ouassini Embarek. Said desperately trying to find out what exactly Bob, who earlier in the movie saved his rotten neck, was up to in order to get in good with the cops who were in the process of deporting him back to his native Algeria. In his also trying to get in good with Anne, whom he supplies with dope, to find out Bob's plan Said didn't realize, until it was too late, that her boyfriend Paulo, Said Taghmauel, had a nasty and murderous jealous streak in him.The really big ace up Bob's sleeve in what turned out to be the perfect crime turned out to be the identical twins Albert &amp; Bertram, Mark &amp; Micael Polish. In an amazing final sequence the twins not only had Bob, together with Anne, pull off the crime of the century but have in done with a double indemnity clause tacked on to it as well!P.S The song "A Thousand Kisses Deep" on the movie's soundtrack had me at first think that it was sung by non-other then it's foghorn voiced star Nick Nolte. The song in fact turned out to have been preformed by singer Leonard Cohen, who's voice is a dead ringer for Nolte's, instead!</fullReview>

Though the idea is the same, the cops are all ready to get the upper hand, but it all goes to the dogs because one sexually ambiguous gangster is afraid of some spiders and this leads the cops to leaving the Casino per se. So the safe is emptied and the boss who has been playing all the time wins big, real big, but his gang loses and it is the small youngish others who win. The world is no longer what it used to be. Apart from that the film lacks the humor Ocean has and the very hostile world that really plays it as a game and not as a war. But apart from that it is an acceptable entertainment though it will not change the face of the world nor the color of the moon.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a good film, with an excellent performance from nick nolte.He is a natural in the part, and the other characters are reasonable. The ambiance is spot on, due to the good musical choice and romantic setting of the french Riveira.However,the let down is the lack of a clear storyline, and the characters were not particularly portrayed in any depth.The DVD of this film has annoying interruptions,which could be mistaken for a fault.The story is a bit of a European oceans 11 but i think the film carries itself in its own way.Intelligently made, Tcheky karyo and Nutsa kukhandize put in good performances. The ending is a bit of a anti climax, but the overall structure of the film makes up for this.Not in the Oscar league of films such as basic instinct or Titanic for memories, but still reasonable by any means.Overall, not a bad film but quite a good one.Worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monte Carlo heist movie, with the usual planning and action, and a fine cast to see it through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film appears to be a perfect vehicle for Nolte at this stage of his career. He certainly shouldn't attempt to portray the'good looking' older man, but as the worn veteran he makes a stunning presentation.This role seems to parallel Nolte's personal life, and it only assists in making him more believable, and more likable. Did I forget to mention his heart of gold?The supporting cast of predominantly European actors click well with Nolte; not only the female lead is vibrant. Make no mistake, this is not a one man film; the rest of the cast sparkles, and with an umbrella of driving music, we become part of his crew.Whether or not the center of the plot, a casino heist, is successful is irrelevant. What takes us along is Mr Nolte's innate roguish charm, and his slick interplay with his entourage. He does all the right things to keep us unmarred, and as I mentioned before, the outcome is secondary:the joy is in the ride, not the destination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thoroughly enjoyable, there's nothing not to like about this film except Ms. Kukhianidze's hairstyle in every single scene save for the final casino outing, where she decides to comb it at long last.The cast are nicely chosen for their roles, with Nick Nolte looking significantly better and more "together" at his character's lowest point in the film than he did in his real life mug shot. With a gravely voice that sounds like his throat has dealt with one too many cigars and one too many shots of booze, he wanders around in a daze all the while putting together an incredibly daring, multifaceted plan to loot a casino and trying to figure out how not to overdose on smack.There's fun here for almost everyone, and the kids in particular will get a thrill seeing a transvestite capable of benching "400 lbs." hold a man over a balcony and threaten to drop him, then later ruin the robbery plan because (s)he is post-operatively afraid of spiders...In the end it's Nick Nolte's semi-acting, semi-natural performance that carries the movie and makes it so easy for the audience to end up hoping a drug addicted, thieving loser ends up on top. Thankfully, he does, and the pace is such that we don't lose interest.Incidentally, just a few rough points in the script: most Europeans would have said "180 kg" not "400 lbs." regardless of their current gender status, French police don't get involved in Monaco, and locals not on the lamb or not wanting to look odd wouldn't necessarily produce a passport at a "border" check nowadays, though this last point is perhaps the most realistic "oops" committed. Now, who decided the stop-frames are artistic? It made me question my freebie DVD copy or even my player.Give the film a try, you'll most likely find something to like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Lil' Heist Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2 main characters are all given very seedy qualities, ie: Bob is a washed up gambler/heroin addict, Anne is a 17 yr old Russian hooker/junkie and everyone else is somehow involved with Bob's past, including the cop, Roger. The atmosphere of seedy bars and back alleys of some small town in the South of France is effective.I thought Nick Nolte did a great job of Bob's character, all very convincing. Nutsa Kukhianidze played the character very "flat" which seemed to suit, because no matter what she was doing the expression on her face seemed to stay the same, about the only time she showed any emotion was when they won for the 1st time on the roulette table and Nick's character told her to tone it down.So we have a small time Gambler/Heroin addict offered a job to steal some very valuable paintings from a Monte Carlo casino, which just seems minutes away from this small South of France town setting. Bob goes cold turkey, so he can figure out a plan to steal the paintings. Before this happens Bob rescues Anne from a local pimp and takes her in. Bob's young side kick Paulo takes a liking to her and beds her. Bob comes up with a plan to use the $80m in the Casino vaults as a decoy heist . The local Policeman (Roger) has threaten an Algerian illegal immigrant with deportation if he doesn't get some info on the rumoured heist, who is also Annes drug dealer. Anne is used as a leak so people are made to think that the $80m is the main job. The Security system installer is the inside man for the painting heist. Bob uses an old unknown Picasso painting to finance the heist. he convinces a local art dealer to advance him the money while the art dealer tries to sell it on the American market. Bob rounds up his old crew which includes a trans gender body builder Phillip/ Phillpa (who appears to be really a female? Sarah Bridges) The cop Roger tails Bob everywhere he goes and doesn't try to hide this fact. In the mean time 2 twins who work as security in the Casino and help carry the money to and from the vaults approach Bob and inform him that the Casino don't know they are twins as only one of them actually has the security job. Now Annes former pimp in turn rescues her from her dealer who was trying to get more info out of her while she was stoned and the pimp finds the reconnaissance photos of the paintings. Paulo comes home and is confronted by the pimp and is informed that the dealer knows about the heist, Paulo finds the dealer talking to Roger the cop and duly shoots the dealer dead. The pimp lets slip to the cop, that Paulo was the shooter and that the heist is for the paintings. Paulo is told by Bob to make his escape across the border to Italy. The art dealer discovers the Picasso painting is a fake and threatens Bob with a deadline for his $1.5m. Bob takes Anne with him to the Casino to play the Roulette table during the heist. The heist crew descend into the service tunnels under the room holding the paintings. During a previous dummy run Phillipa asks Paulo to turn the gas off for him as the handle is crawling with spiders and Phillipa seems to have a spider-phobia, but Paulo doesn't turn up for the heist. The cop takes the whole towns police force to the casino and catches the crew in the act after an explosion in the paintings room. But while all this is going on Bob and Anne are winning big on the Roulette table and the Blackjack table.............You'll have to see the movie for the rest, suffice to say, I liked this movie, a lil' bit of the movie must have been left on the cutting room floor as the end may have been better handled, as I had to come into the movie data to try and grasp a few things I didn't quite understand as how did the twins fit in, but it sort of falls into place. I recommend anyone that likes a heist movie to rent this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented The Good Thief at the video store and was pleasantly surprised. The great acting and characters drive the movie and at the end you almost want to see what happens over the next few weeks to these characters. Anytime they leave you wanting more, it was a good movie. The direction was fine but the cutaway scenes were a little amateurish and anoying. The plot and script were adequate but were a little lacking. The thing that holds this film together is the great acting, Nick Nolte along with an all European cast really shine in this one. Probably a guy movie, I love a good heist movie and I would rate this as good. Check it out you won't be disapointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Good Thief" is an English-language remake of the French auteur cinema "Bob le flambeur". Director Neil Jordan improves on all the problems I cited in the original. The plot and character development are not wanting here; Bob is no laconic bungler, nor is Anne merely a nonchalant siren. Unlike in the original, the paternal relationship between Bob and Anne becomes the polestar, with dynamic performance from Nick Nolte and Nutsa Kukhianidze.Nolte plays Bob, a pathological gambler, liar and heroin addict (quite a mess compared to the original gentleman high-roller). After bottoming out, he is enticed to heist a Monte Carlo casino. Bob is neither a charming bad guy, nor a morally upstanding person; he lies within that grey area. He is likable and intelligent, but he has his vices (human complexity unrealized in the French version). Apparently, Nolte shot heroin while making this film--leading to his arrest. Not commendable method acting, but perhaps it helped and doubtless, this is one of Nolte's finest performances (near or beside "The Prince of Tides" and "Affliction").Newcomer Kukhianidze is also exceptional. Although Bob doesn't help much with Anne's seamy associations, her adoration for Bob might become something of her salvation. Jordan amply turns the film on her and reaches a satisfying end.</fullReview>

Nolte gives his finest performance in years. Neil Jordan pays enormous respect to ? and has fun with classic French film Bob La Flambeur. Without knowing what "Thief" was about, I began watching it and getting strong feelings of deja vous only to realize what an IDIOT I was not to recognize the homage to the earlier film (and set in Monte Carlo as opposed to the original's Paris.) A film which has you routing for the bad guys, who are, of course, the best guys. Everyone is obviously having a terrific time and Jordan provides a terrific reign over this large ensemble that is the equivalent of a world class conductor at the helm of a great symphony ? everything is full of nuance and balanced so well that even the most convoluted moments (which are some of the best) have a feel so perfect they seem natural. Delightful, bad guys are good guys perspective that works splendidly.p.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing performance by Nolte</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a 1955 film called "Bob Le Flambeur" but this version is definitely different with an amazing performance by its star. Story takes place in the south of France where an aging thief named Bob (Nick Nolte) drinks, gambles and is addicted to heroin. After losing his last 70,000 francs on a horse race Bob handcuffs himself to his bed to beat his addiction. Bob has also helped a 17 year old prostitute named Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze) and together Bob gets through this difficult phase in his life. Bob emerges from this broke but a friend takes him to a local casino to show him the paintings on the wall. Bob says that they are all fakes but learns that the real ones are held downstairs in a room with high security. He gets a loan from a local thug and art dealer named Tony Angel (Ralph Fiennes) who wants a percentage of whatever he gets. On Bob's tail is Roger (Tscheky Karyo) who is a cop and a friend who knows that Bob is up to something so he follows him everywhere.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Bob enlists the help of other characters to assist him but things get complicated when Anne's pimp wants her back and then the head of security at the casino tells him that he wants to be on the heist but it turns out that he has a twin brother that no one knows about. This film is directed by Neil Jordan who can be at times a brilliant filmmaker but over the last few years his efforts have been at best spotty. Here he seems to be in great form and like his films in the past this is a story about odd characters who try to survive in a harsh world despite their passions. Jordan is aided greatly with the casting of Nolte in a role that seems to be written for him. Nolte has stated in interviews that he did some heroin for some of the scenes in this film. This is one of his best roles and its a performance that borders on his very own personal demons. It reminded me of Robert Downey Jr in "Two Girls and a Guy" and when I describe it that way I mean that these two incredible actors brought out a dark side of themselves and exposed it to the camera. It's not easy to watch but these types of riveting performances are raw at its basic level. Nolte's ragged and weathered face is a mask of both pain and experience. His character is definitely someone that can teach you something but he also comes across as a guy that you would want to know at a distance. Along with a good performance by Kukhianidze and Jordan's wonderful direction this works both as a heist film and a fascinating character study.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ingredients were there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a pretty well established formula for heist pictures, and the bits and ingredients are almost always the same, so it's the execution that counts. Emeril and I could buy the same stuff at the same store and stand side by side in the kitchen, and I guarantee his meal would be much, much better than mine. That's why you need a director.Neil has a classic film to base his work on so you would think half the work is done. Update it, cast it properly, establish the tone, and push start. Unfortunately, he can't make the parts equal the whole. Similar problem with the remake of "The Italian Job."***Spoilers*** Am I the only one who is upset that the femme fatale is a mess-up who induces her "lover" to murder and rats out the heist and pays no price, except she gets to cavort in a slinky gown in Monaco with Nolte. Uh, OK. And the humorous bits (Phillipe/Phillipa, the twins) are thrown in so casually as to be almost non-existent.If you rent the DVD, you should seriously consider turning on subtitles to figure out what Nolte is slurring. A disappointing film, although the soundtrack is intriguing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting cross between Ocean's Eleven and The Score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some great photography with some very well done coloring of the backgrounds. The editing is interesting, with the little pauses at the end of every sequence. Like Ocean's Eleven it's a caper in a sense with a lot of things at stake. Like The Score it focuses on a very good thief who's trying to pull of one last job. In terms of acting, Nick Nolte is good, but hardly great. His voice has gotten very raspy so it is hard to understand what he is saying. The girl is good too as well as the supporting characters. Oh and watch out for a brief cameo from Fiennes too. The script is well done with some interesting narrative flowing. The direction is good too, but I haven't really seen any other Neil Jordan films. I can understand why people would be dissapointed in this for one of his films. As for the flaws, they come in few numbers. This film feels too long because of the slow- pace, which isn't needed. Also, the story becomes a bit of a stretch once in a while and it also takes away for the credibilty. It's an okay film, worth watching, but nothing exceptional. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the comeback I was hoping for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had hoped THE GOOD THIEF was the movie that gets Neil Jordan back on track. He had an international smash in 1992 with THE CRYING GAME, the best movie of its year (IMO), one that earned him a Best Original Screenplay Oscar.Jordan's movies since then have been hit-and-miss. INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE was successful, but I never cared for it; on the other hand, I really liked THE BUTCHER BOY, but that generally isn't considered a great movie. His other movies include IN DREAMS, a confusing, overplotted misfire, and MICHAEL COLLINS and THE END OF THE AFFAIR, both unseen by me. I wish THE GOOD THIEF was something special, but it's a disappointment, unfortunately; I wish I could articulate why, but I don't really know how to approach the act of committing my thoughts about it in words.Ever see a movie that's just barely better than average that you wished you liked more, but can't? That's the response I'm having to this movie. I guess the best place to start is with Neil Jordan's direction. What he was thinking, I wish I could figure out. For some reason he chose to end scenes with a distracting split-second freeze frame; all night I've been trying to decipher the meaning of this odd visual tic, but I'm at a loss for an explanation.But Jordan isn't the only below-the-liner whose decisions I'm questioning. I'm not sure whose job this falls under - either the cinematographer or the art director - but the visual style presented here can only be described by the seemingly oxymoronic phrase "neon decay." So much of what's filmed is washed out, but there are moments when day-glo green or purple dominates the frame. This stylistic choice may be significant in some metaphoric way, but, again, I'm without a clue as to why.While I'm focused on the negatives, I might as well mention Nick Nolte's performance. Years of hard living have not been kind to this man's voice, and it took several scenes before I grew accustomed to his gruff, scraggly intonation. For a while I was wishing I was watching a DVD, just so I could turn on the subtitles. But I eventually accepted this, like I accepted the fact that everyone in a movie set in Monte Carlo speaks English at all times (except for a brief scene early on where a character from Algeria needs to not be understood for the sake of the story).But Nolte's performance was, all in all, a strong center to a slew of supporting characters, one of which was inhabited by newcomer Nino Kukhanidze. Anyone who's seen MONA LISA or THE CRYING GAME is aware that Jordan has a knack for creating intriguing, mysterious female characters who aren't quite as wise as they think they are, and Kukhanidze's Anne, a jailbait but almost-jaded Russian prostitute, is no exception. Her performance recalls the earlier work of Chloë Sevigny, and I'm interested in seeing her develop as an actress.Other supporting actors include Sa?d Taghmaoui (best known to American audiences, perhaps, as the Iraqi captain in THREE KINGS that holds Mark Wahlberg captive), Mark &amp; Michael Polish (the stars of TWIN FALLS IDAHO, who in this movie are integral to much of the intricate heist plot), and, most bizarrely, an actor (whose name I can't recall) who plays a transsexual bodybuilder, and who can be credited for much of the movie's humor.Many of these characters are quite interesting but aren't developed enough to be truly memorable. This undernourishment is really the main problem of THE GOOD THIEF. The movie's first half is quite choppy and disjointed; there seems to be footage left on the cutting room floor that fleshes out much of the background to this story and these characters.Oh, the story? It's your typical heist scenario, dealing with surprise double crosses in a plot about ripping off a Monte Carlo casino which also somehow hold priceless works of art, so I won't spoil it for those who are interested in this movie. Let me just say that things seem to make sense when all is said and done, although I struggled to put together the details of the theft. Something about gambling as an alibi while a gas main is or isn't supposed to explode at the right time, while the main guy (Nolte), whose gambling addiction comes in handy, is being tailed by a detective who almost knows what's going on.Have I made THE GOOD THIEF sound like a confusing jumble of half-baked ideas? In a way, it is, but the story, once it gets going, hums along nicely, and the movie is never boring. The climactic sequence, which includes a tense gambling jag, is actually quite suspenseful, the soundtrack makes good use of Leonard Cohen, Serge Gainsbourg and Euro-Arab pop, and the plot is unpredictable even if you can follow every detail of the story.6/10</fullReview>

It glamorizes and extols wrong ideas...macho behaviour... blatant sex...drug addiction...successful crime... It also must hold a Guiness record for the movie with the most smoking ever filmed. EVERYBODY in the film ALWAYS has a cigarette (or a cigar) dangling from their lips, removing them, it seems, only to mouth the "F Word." In one memorable scene, a driver casually flips a cigarette butt out of his car. Was that really necessary? It had no dramatic value. No. I don't advocate goody two shoes movies. People smoke. People swear. People scheme. But should not the underlying theme of such a story ultimately be a positive one. I despised Nick Nolte's character. But sadly, many may think it's cool and worthy of emulation. The film is a classic example of Hollywood's depravity and lack of responsibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolte as a modern Bogie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Good Thief, Nolte plays the same sort of character Humphrey Bogart was known for; the knight in dented armor, the mysterious man of uncertain allegiences who follows his own law but acts ethically within his code. This is an updated Bogie, modernized with Heroin but with the same sense of ultimate cool. Nolte is brings wonderful assurance to the role. (I also found him, contrary to what some of the reviewers here say, perfectly comprehensible, even though I often have difficulty making out mumblers in movies. I saw this on TV, and am wondering if the sound was tweaked or there was a bad copy in the theatre, because I had no problems at all).The movie itself is engrossing and well paced, with intelligent dialogue and intriguing characters. The most unfortunate aspect is Jordan's penchant for meaningless stylistic flourishes, most notably a couple of scenes shot for no good reason in a jerky manner and the way scenes end with a quick, meaningless and distracting freeze frame. The other problem is the movie's anti-climactic ending, which gives you the sense the writer had a good buildup for a caper film but didn't really have an ending. Now I'd like to see the original French film Bob the Gambler to see if they did a better job that time. All in all, a little flawed but well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly surprising "caper"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caper movies are getting to be just a little too predictable, don't you think? They always build up an absurd amount of complications that can only be resolved by radically turning the tables at the end, and that table-turning is often not very credible.The great thing about this movie is that it builds up that same caper-type complexity and then in the end - well, it really does surprise you and turns out to be a much deeper film than your average caper. It ends up being about chance and a guy who after all his fumbling around triumphs at the end of his life and does it the way he always thought it should be done.So I am not sure this should really be called a caper film. It uses the expectations and conventions of the caper film to do something very creative.</fullReview>

Nutsa Kukhianidze played the babe role well and the rest of the cast was competent but not especially memorable. I thought the movie glorified drug use and the cigarette smoking was excessive but is, unfortunately, typical of the genre. Also typical are the black leather jackets and stubble. Is there some union rule that the bad guys must wear leather, look slovenly and smoke constantly. The cliché is tiresome. The DVD version of the movie had an irritating quirk. Each scene ended in a very short , less than a second, freeze frame. I don't know if this was a problem with the original movie editing or due to the DVD transfer.

The only part I found interesting was Nolte's performance at the casino late in the movie, but that was pretty much dashed by a boring ending, which I guess was supposed to be some sort of surprising revelation. I just couldn't understand or couldn't care less.For recreational viewers, if you want a good heist movie, check out Matchstick Men, Confidence, or Ocean's Eleven. Sure they may be "big budget" and feature extravagant plots and gadgets, but they are FUN!!! Isn't that what movies are supposed to be about? But if you like an independent feel and enjoy dissecting characters who you can't really understand, then The Good Thief is probably the movie for you.

		<shortDescription>An abundance of style, but sadly no substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that Hollywood's found its new favourite genre;the heist movie, already we've had big budget extravaganzas such as 'Ocean's 11', 'The Score, 'The Thomas Crown Affair' and the appropriately named 'Heist'. All of these movies have enabled large ensemble casts of important Hollywood actors to devise and execute brilliantly inventive thefts, but in the process have generally sacrificed any personality in the characters. I was therefore looking forward to the 'good thief' as an elegant tale not only of devilishly clever thievery, but also(due to the fact this was being directed by Neil Jordan) as a character study of flawed, fallible but ultimately likable people.Alas t'was not to be. Jordan has in fact made a very stylish but emotionally hollow film with frustrating plot holes and a 'twist' (and I use the word 'twist' very loosely, I saw it coming a mile off) ending which is likely to leave audiences baffled and cheated.The film centers around Bob(Nick Nolte) a has-been thief and heroin addict who, bizarrely, is loved by everyone. However all is about to change when he befriends a 17 year old prostitute and rescues her from an abusive pimp, as soon he has chained himself to his bed in order to go cold turkey and has begun to plot an elaborate (and utterly ridiculous) painting theft with a large group of shady misfits.Sadly all the plot potential is squandered, as Jordan opts instead for a sleek cruise through the nightclubs, brothels and dark alley ways of Monte Carlo, paying virtually no attention to the characters and employing an extremely distracting method of editing; as the camera pauses in freeze-frame for a split second as a scene ends. The plot drags on at a soporific pedestrian pace, indeed the heist is never gone into in the specifics but discussed in a distinctly broad manner (hinting that perhaps Jordan hadn't given much thought to how the Heist would actually work). Still, Jordan has always had a good command of dialogue and there are plenty of good one-liners and witticisms, though these sadly are wasted as the actors (particulairly Nolte) mumble their lines or speak with such strong accents that their dialogue is basically unintelligible. Had it not been for the subtitle option on the DVD I doubt I would even of gathered that Nick Nolte's Character was named Bob.In fairness the actors are well cast and Nolte was born to play Bob(it's just a pity you can't understand what he's saying) and the soundtrack, which is an eclectic mixture of Techno,rock and French pop, adds considerable atmosphere to the proceedings. I loved Jordan's films 'The Crying Game' and 'Interview with the vampire' but this film fell short of my expectations by some way. My score: 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the best and briefest description i can come up with: this movie seemed rushed, like someone was holding a stop watch for each scene. Even Nolte, who should've been perfect for this role, was mumbling and slurring too quickly to understand some of the dialogue. Several times characters seemed to be stepping on each others lines. Maybe this is the style intended: the script is as choppy as the editting and direction. This contrasted with the smooth-as-syrup sound track and left me wondering if they just wanted to get the film in under two hours. As a heist film, it slips into predictability, and again in the name of saving time (i guess) the details of the plans are sped thru so much so that there is very little suspense. All that said, we did get a good look at southern France, as the cinematography was fine, and the soundtrack was superb. It's a moody film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me disagree with those who for some reason didn't think this was a brilliant film. Second, I wish to point out that Nolte has done a superb job in this film of playing himself again, as he was in Dog Soldiers (Who'll Stop the Rain). That character and this one are splendidly created by Nolte, a great actor if there ever was one.The plot was complex and fascinating; the acting excellent; dialogue witty and intellectual. Ralph Fiennes has a great cameo (and please note that he's listed as an art expert in the credits). The soundtrack music was carefully chosen, and Leonard Cohen's song, "A Thousand Kisses Deep" seems as if it were written for the film.I have already seen it twice in the theatre, and I can't say enough good things about it. TEN STARS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good Thief is a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a child stealing cookies from a jar, there is something delicious when sometimes the bad guys win and the good guys lose. "The Good Thief" reminds me quite a bit of "The Thomas Crown Affair" with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. Both films have to do with clever scheming, high stakes gambling, the dance between men and women, and masterpiece art. And like a candle and a flame, or a gambler and his wager, both proclaim the wisdom that the money may reward you, but it's the gamble that hooks you. The prize money just lets you come back to the table one more time. And risk it all again.I'm disappointed and surprised that this movie has so far only averaged a seven, with most voters giving it an eight. I think it deserves way better, like a nine or a nine and a half. There's so much here to like. I love the way this movie looks, the way it thinks, the way it demands that you pay attention. Okay, I wish the actors could have spoken up more (what did he say? did I miss something important?) but still, wow.Nick Nolte deserves the high marks he's already received. I think he's this generation's equivalent of Robert Mitchum, another tough guy who is sadly missed. But other performances deserve credit too. For one, whoever the guy is that plays the slimeball informant plays a slimeball informant really well! And the lead guitar/techno art/computer geek/co-conspirator is another offbeat character who is cool to watch. Lastly, it was great to see that actor from "Three Kings," again. Pretty intense, and yet I sense he could do comedy too.So who do you believe, 'the sevens' or me? Bet your nine bucks. Go see this movie. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolte finds his niche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When lady luck and sister morphine just aren't the companions they used to be, Bob Montagnet (Nick Nolte), gentleman crook and do-gooder nudges up against rock bottom. Busted and in hock, he needs to get back into the game, but he knows that the risk has to be worth the reward: if he gets busted once more, he'll be living the low life in a none too quaint French penitentiary. Complicating matters is Bob's reputation ? his recent stint as junkie-gambler notwithstanding, his status as jewel thief extraordinaire has earned him his very own police shadow. Throw in a street smart waif, a couple vengeance clichees, a convoluted plan and the necessary Judas for a little cross/doublecross and things start to get interesting.Years of substance abuse, a recent run of bad luck and a voice that sounds like he's got the world's longest running case of strep throat may not be in Nick Nolte's best interests as a person. It does however give him a distinct advantage when tackling the character of Bob, as Nolte doesn't have to delve too deep for the source material. He is surprisingly suave despite his rough edges, which makes Bob's transformation all the more credible. Aside from the personal failings, Bob is a solid human being which makes the audience root for him.The supporting cast works well as a whole, due to an ease and familiarity in their interactions, which in turn helps the story flow. This meshing of minds is distilled to its purest form in the scenes with Nolte and Tchéky Karyo, the inspector out to nab Bob. Their exchanges are so smooth and natural- from their facial expressions and body language to their zingers and pithy asides - that it's easy to accept them as friends who are simply improvving their dialogue. There are, however, some notable problems with the story.Most annoying for me was the anemic subplot with Ralph Fiennes as an `art entrepreneur'. A poor contrivance that adds nothing to the story it becomes an annoying vanity cameo that adds nothing to the film (and don't even get me started on his little I-want-to-be- Rafe-not-Ralf petulance?). I can only assume that the continuous use of freeze frame shots were intended to be dramatic or artistic, but fail on both levels, and quickly become an annoyance (I thought that there was a problem with the projector the first two times it happened). The biggest sin however is the plot ? while Neil Jordan tries to infuse the film with suspense his delivery is worse than a drunken street mime. Consequently the little plot twists and parallel storylines fall flat. In spite of great dialogue, solid acting and an eclectic cast of characters, `The Good Thief' ultimately falls victim to a predictable plot. Not even the mini homage to `The Crying Game' could rise above it. Wait for it on the small screen ? it probably won't take too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't know where to start. First, what is the movie about? Is it a character study or a crime caper? The screenwriters seem to be going for the former in the first hour or so. Nick Nolte is strung out on heroin when we meet him--he is shooting up in a bathroom in some nightclub; his eyes are puffy and he looks like hell. I'm thinking--great make-up job. But then he kicks his habit and he still looks like hell.In that first hour, Nick hooks up with a 17-year old hooker, played by Nino Kukhanidze. I don't know whether to blame the director or the actress. Nino's performance is sort of indifferent. Not sure whether the director told her to play the part like a numb street hooker who is dead to the world. But the problem is that her performance is so uninteresting. You cannot feel for a person you don't care about.The second half of the movie is the crime caper. A paint by numbers scenario that is humorless. The only saving grace is the last ten minutes of the movie which feels sort of dropped in after too many test screenings. Don't know about this one. I'm sure the story about the making of the movie would be a lot more interesting than what is on the screen. I would say wait for the DVD but why bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds you how good Nolte can be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to do a full review for The Good Thief. To be honest I can't get particularly excited about it either way. I need to love or hate a film to really deconstruct it and I this film just didn't engage any great passions within me.Still plus points are the performances from Nick Nolte and Tcheky Karyo. Karyo has rarely, if ever, been better as the cop on Nolte's ex-con's trail. Nolte meanwhile smoulders and burns up the screen with a stunning, powerful performance that reminds you why he is so good. This performance is Q&amp;A good - for those of you who have not seen Lumet's sizzling Q&amp;A, you need to. Now.Also great is an exciting and well staged flashy finale. The final 30 minutes of the film are in a different league from the overly slow set up period.Unfortunately for most of the film director Neil Jordan doesn't deliver as he often can. While the film is interesting it doesn't grab you and some people may not last long enough to see the pay-off (the last half hour). It also has a terrible lead female performance from an Eastern European actress who may just be suffering Penelope Cruz-itis (ie - good actor in home language, comes off seeming wooden through unintelligibility and lack of emotional depth in English language) but it a big problem.Still, interesting to watch and worth seeing for Karyo and especially Nolte - just don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Largley uninteresting and generally under-cooked crime film that does its best with the material, but falls short in the long run.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hot on the heels of Steven Soderbergh's 2001 Ocean's Eleven remake comes Neil Jordan's The Good Thief; a colourful, extravagant film about some pretty desperate people inhabiting a grimy world of strippers, drug addicts and gangsters unsure of whether to keep on the straight and narrow and depict it as all fun and frolics, or as a depiction of a disgraceful; disgusting underbelly to a photogenic locale that everybody needs to wake up to. Personally, I like my neo-noir-cum-heist movies in a greyed out, grotty, grimy locale; think something along the lines of 2010's The Town, unravelling in Boston; thin 1999's Payback, unfolding in a weird mesh of Chicago and New York further still transported back to the 1960s; think post-war London acting as a great backdrop to the original The Ladykillers. The second you hop over to a warm, colourful location such as Monaco, it just becomes a holiday ? and I find it difficult not to just instantaneously wash my hands of the whole thing .The film's cast, while not as big nor seductive enough to lure those in whom watch their movies for who's in them rather than who's making them, is still pretty hefty and again follows these people doing their utmost to thieve something big. The film is ultimately a let down, a rather fruity failure which fizzes now and again but is too grounded in genre convention and quick to submit to off-the-wall content typical of the more recent films of director Neil Jordan to be any good. Nick Nolte plays Bob Montagnet, and being Nick Nolte, he plays him with that trademark growl that often has him come across as what Chris Rea might sound like doing a Tom Waits impersonation. He's an ambling, shambling individual; a man who loves his gambling, even bases himself within the European capital of gambling, Monte-Carlo, and going so far so as to confess his love for the pastime that he has a roulette wheel in his apartment.Along with this particular hobby, Bob has a tendency to dwell within the realms of strip clubs and is additionally a drug addict; in his own words, he "cannot remember back to the 1980s" - such is the nature of his life and what it has been for so long. Despite these coked up; down-and-out; floozy knowing foundations, he is able to speak Arabic - one such instance seeing him utilise these attributes when there is a disagreement during yet another night in the blue-hued clubs of pole dancers and drugs. What unfolds is an instance that sees Bob act cool and collectively; a stopping of two people from coming to blows, in what is a handling of a situation in a methodical and scrupulous manner. Later, Bob will need to apply these traits to a mission carrying a greater amount of risk and hostility; this follows a day at the races, in which he goes on to bet every last morsel he has on a huge risk/reward punt which, as surprised as we all are when we watch it, doesn't go according to plan. Bottomed out, he turns to what skills he had in his former life as a criminal; specifically, stealing and instigating a heist on a casino housing many thousands of French currency.It is established this casino has been hit in the past, although unsuccessfully on the occasions it has been; the picture ominous as we entrust this stammering, stuttering drug addict seemingly too spaced out to recall what happened fifteen years ago, although is able to cite and discuss the work of Piccasso. Hope lies solely with the fact the place has had recent refurbishment, and that this fact ought to aid them in some way. What follows is that of the film's uninteresting meat on a pretty spindly bone, a series of meetings and interactions with other people able to assist in the heist which forms into the bulk of what usually transpires during the opening act of a bog-standard heist film. Here, varying scenes of planning and such are stretched out to an overly long, and often uninteresting, degree which is dressed up with some cool lighting and some Heat-esque musical tones not only calling to mind Michael Mann's film but making you wish you were watching the damned thing instead.To carry out the heist, Bob must kick his drug-habit, but this is only the first of his problems as Sa?d Taghmaoui's Arab Paulo looks to grass him in if it means saving his own skin while plain-suited police officer Roger (Karyo) is constantly watching his old rival with the intent to arrest him if needs be. One scene they share, in a church, exemplifies the nature of their relationship; that is to say, their meeting in a peaceful and very calm locale reiterates their harmonious coexisting, or understanding that they have, but is punctuated by Bob's persistent moving around highlighting the stationary Roger's inability to get a 'lock' on him. His crew will come to consist mostly of gross representations, in that an Eastern European woman will be depicted as flimsy and loose; an Arab will no-quicker betray his best friend than he did thank him for previously getting him out of trouble, while a character with an ambiguous sexual orientation is under developed and feels wedged in so as to garner smirks from the audience. The Good Thief strikes us as style over substance, such is the nature of Jordan's work when he doesn't quite fire as loudly and as proudly as he did with both Mona Lisa and The Crying Game. They were films about male leads walking a tightrope as a world of sleaze, or criminality, spun rabidly around them threatened to undo their uneasy relationships with the women in their lives. Here, we do not like the lead as much as Hoskins' ignorant, although well-meaning, driver; nor as much as Stephen Rea's terrorist cell operating rouge whom decides to develop a conscience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neil Jordan's terrific heist movie breaks the cardinal rule that remakes can never be in the same class as the original and if this doesn't have the same emotional pull of Melville's "Bob Le Flambeur" at least it often feels as if it's in the same ballpark. Jordan is obviously in thrall to the original but not so much he can't keep his version sufficiently loose, (although the film is so tortuously plotted a knowledge of Melville's movie certainly helps).Nick Nolte is brilliant as Bob, the gambler, junkie and former thief on his last heist and the supporting cast of largely European actors match him every step of the way. (The strong emphasis on character in both films is what gives the robbery it's resonance). Jordan juggles the plot enough to keep us second-guessing and the twists are neat and clever and don't seem tacked on for their own sake. That, and Chris Menges' superb location photography, and you have one of the best thrillers for quite awhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As good as the final thirty minutes were, it could never make up for the excruciating boredom the film had subjected viewers to for the previous (what seemed like 5 hours)hour and a half.Not even Noltes' performance or Bonos' rendition of "thats life" could hold together this painfully slow and obvious plot. Character development ranges from poor to non-existent .As opposed to enjoying the film you end up wondering how actors such as Nick Nolte, Tchéky Karyo, Sa?d Taghmaoui and Ralph Fiennes accepted the script. Perhaps after they read it they too felt as if years had gone by and perhaps if they asked for a second copy of it, they would have a life time supply of toilet paper at their disposal.As a world traveller, I have learnt that different forms of behaviour and values are accepted in different parts of the world in different social arenas and situations. This further leads me to believe that when you find yourself in an Irish Movie Theatre and people all around you after only half an hour start answering their phones and having conversations unrestrained by their fellow movie-goers, you probably have paid into the wrong film, because what you are watching is uninteresting, and rubbish. What you are watching, is The Good Thief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The jury is in and The Good Thief is out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most over-hyped movies of 2002. All reviews I read on the film said it would be good. Nolte's history of superb movies made me figure this would be great. It was not. It was horrible. Very poor digital camera work was the first problem: jumpy, dizzying, and dark. Inability to hear the dialogue was the second. The third is the title. Why "The Good Thief"? It's a reference to the two people who were crucified with Jesus (as the movie itself states), but there were two good thieves, not one. Even though Biblical references make things seem intellectual and monumental, I would really have to stretch to see how this relates to the action of the movie. The "Good thieves" on the crosses on either side of Jesus were told that they would see paradise with Jesus very soon. They also suggested that Jesus should save himself. Does this mean that the Russian chick is Jesus because Nolte is her "protector"? Does this mean that Nolte will see paradise soon even though his current situation looks hopeless? "No" is the answer to both questions. The title was chosen because it sounded arty.The movie moved through Austin (a town that loves pretentious, arty crap) faster than "Deuce Bigolo" and appears to be playing nowhere in America now. That's the final jury verdict: America doesn't want to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Jordan Is Pure Boss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Jordan who brought us "The Good Thief" takes us on his journey with some is famed signature traits that's been proved effective over the years (weary convict who has aspirations that are usually beyond what one would desire). executed in a dreamy light-hearted approach. Unlike another one of Jordan's films like the 1992 "The Crying Game", the main character's fate isn't in his own hands. AS a heroin junkie and master criminal, Nick Nolte dishes out a gripping but not angered performance. He's the kind of guy that men wish they were and that women wish they'd want as their own (if they were addicted to the same stuff he's taking or who could get a quick blow-job). But my sarcasm was not meant to be cynical. In fact quite the opposite. You see, Nolte's addiction is quite fun to watch as well as the selection of shirts he wears throughout. We also get suckered into his very articulate and innovative voice for storytelling. And we root for him as he triumphs victorious in his gambling, without clearly caring if his double heist is going by with or without a hitch. Along with the movie "Affliction", "The Good Thief" comes across as one of Nolte's better movies I've seen him in.People in the theater were just hamming it up with praise and applauding it with all the great qualities about this movie and laughing at the subtle humor that was delivered in the movie. The film is both smart in it premises, but also quite charming to visualize. the freeze frames, the camera tricks and the angles were visually sublime. The soundtrack features a variety of diverse music that fits this international cast. The only small setback of the film is that you may need to go back and watch it again because the dialogue was a bit hard to decipher, Especially from the predominately European cast. But through a second helping, I was able to get by and understood things more clearly. The character development really was taken by storm while at the same opened up compelling portraits from the diverse Mediterraean underworld. Sure it's not a flamboyant heist movie, but the characters portrayed in this movie were fun to watch as you go along on another one of Neil Jordan's exciting journey of "The Good Thief".</fullReview>

I remember seeing this guy guest on a couple of shows, and can't remember much what he looked like. To me, it is possible it is the same guy. anyone know? He could have 'bulked' up to make more of the 'breasts'. I remember him saying that he 'got' a lot more women with the breasts, than he did before the operation!I am only interested in finding out if this is that person, or not. I make no judgments.

With so many Americanisms in the script, the only character who looks like he fits in, is Nolte's character.It looks like the scriptwriters for this film didn't design the movie for the cast and setting the director was using. It's also an interesting oversight: Didn't ANYBODY on the set express concerns through th weeks of shooting? Or is it so easy to believe for everyone in the world speaks like an American?Apart from this, there are also too many stereotypes in the film. Okay, we're not looking for deep social debate here but can't the makers of the film be just a little bit more inventive? The Russian hacker who loves rock music sounds and behaves like he came out of a Bruckheimer pastiche. The background shot of some Japanese men performing some kind of Shinto ritual looks like a cut and paste from war films. And of course, the smooth-talking wise-cracking American thief that Nolte plays is straight out of a film noir '40s or '50s script, except he's in colour.I normally like Neil Jordan but this effort is intellectually lazy. 4 out of 10. Oh, and Nutsa is HOT!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Good Thief" isn't a bad film, but after Neil Jordon's earlier work I hoped for much more. The camera was used competently, but not compellingly. The soundtrack was pleasant and effective, but again hardly ingenious. Nolte has the meatiest role, and he does a competent but (again but) hardly compelling job of it. The other actors are adequate. If I came to this film without any preconceptions, I think I would have enjoyed it more. But Jordon is capable of so much more. I'm going to put on "The Crying Game" and prove that to myself, at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident IMDB film aesthete "tedg" has kindly provided for us once again the only review here worth reading (it's somewhere in the middle of the some 60 or so reviews written so far, and worth a look). I wanted to note the trouble over the "muddled" dialogue (Nolte talks under his breath most of the film). A stylistic move -- keeps you on your toes, and the nuggets you do grab are all the more pleasing (I caught about 90% of what was said). You just have to pay attention, and it's worth it. The dialogue is a lot of fun. Great movie. The craft at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GOOD THIEF is a film with a whole lot of plot, but no real place to put it. The story follows Bob (Nick Nolte), a washed up thief who lives in the south of France. Due to a several events he is pulled in for one last score, etc, etc. The story in a film like this is not really the most important thing. It falls to the actors, director and crew to bring it above the watermark of the genre. In that, the film does not quite make it.Actors: Nolte does a great job (as is par for him), bringing to the role enough world weary despair to make his character believable, the lines in his face telling the story of this guy. The scene where he dries out handcuffed to the bed is very well done. Ralph Fiennes also shows up for a good, although brief, turn as a crooked art dealer. However the girl who plays Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze), does not seem quite up for the challenge. Also, a usually fine actor, Tcheky Karyo, has so little to do with his role as a French cop, he spends most of the time smiling and furrowing his brow. Most of the other Parisian cast balances scissors on their heads and has trouble pronouncing Montana.Director: Neil Jordan, a good director (see MICHEAL COLLINS), who has made a few forgettable films (see IN DREAMS), does a good job with the material. However the material that is there is mostly a jumbled mess of quirky thieves, including twins and a post-op body builder; it seems to be more plot than Jordan can handle. The film never really focuses on one character or story line...anyway:The Crew: Chris Menges (MICHEAL COLLINS, THE MISSION) lights the film well and much of the photography is quite lush. On the flip side however Menges work is undercut by the lapse frame editing, some of which is in slow motion. This effect always comes off as TV cop show cheese, I'll never understand why directors use it. Elliot Goldenthal's score is effective, though sparse; once again this is spoiled by bad song placement.Compared to a film like HEAT, which covers some of the same territory, THE GOOD THIEF falls flat. The characters never really come to life, and each are ingrained with some "interesting" quirk that is supposed to take the place of actual development. But whatever, perhaps there are American bank robbers, who live in France, and recite the theory of prime numbers while shooting horse. I've never been to France. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed Neil Jordan's uneven heist caper "The Good Thief" on DVD and after reading the comments here am relieved to learn that the incomprehensible dialogue was not due to disc or equipment malfunction on my end. That addresses the film's major flaw. Jordan seems to have lost his way in the making of this film, giving the appearance of having borrowed heavily from numerous other directors -- the annoying use of artsy technique (freeze-frame ending of shots, canted camera angles, shots taken through colored filters, etc.) screams 'Steven Soderbergh'; garishly colored interior sets (Dario Argento); a pervading dark atmosphere (Mike Figgis); and an over reliance on the musical soundtrack to carry the mood of the film (Wes Anderson). The result is a bizarre hybrid with multiple fathers, but none of them Jordan himself. The confluence of plot and characters defies credibility, but it probably was not meant to be realistic in the first place.I am a great fan of Jordan, but he is maddeningly inconsistent. Even so, I have noticed a defining trend in his works: those films set in Ireland or the U.K. range from good to brilliant (e.g., "Mona Lisa" (1986), "The Crying Game" (1992), "The Butcher Boy" (1997)), while those set overseas range from outright clunkers to minor disappointments (e.g., "We're No Angels" (1989), "In Dreams" (1999), "The Good Thief" (2002)). So Neil, boyo, stick to the old sod where the wind may always be at your back. Rating: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will spend most of your time in this movie trying to figure out what Nike Nolte is mumbling, and when you are able to hear it, it wont make much sense.The beginnging of the movie is confused, poorly scripted and shot, and finally just confusing. By the time the movie manages to make any progress, its over, and your left wondering exactly what happened.There is a confusing mass of charaters in the film, all with no depth or personality. Most serve no real purpose at all other than to add drama completely unrelated to the story line. In fact much of the action these characters take part in is so utterly unrelated to the plot, the scenes just become incomprehensible time fillers.All in all The Good Thief is an attempt to make an edgy hard nosed casino robbery movie, but fails by not actually having anything in it related to the plot until the last 10 minutes of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good Thief: 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Nolte admitted at the Toronto Film Festival that he used a little bit of heroin every day to prepare for his role of Bob in The Good Thief. If you think it's a regular heist movie, think again. Instead of the obligatory twists, turns, backstabbings, cheating on wives, and everything, it has a sophisticated style to it (it helps that it was all shot in France?nice!). However, it gets bogged down by TOO much flair and sophistication, a confusing plot, and hard to understand accents.The plot has Bob (Nolte) as an?guess what?aging thief who wants to do one last giant heist! Boy, I love the originality in plots today. He lives in the beautiful scenery of France, and he wants to rob paintings with a high value from a casino. People along for the ride include Paulo (Sa?d Taghmaoui), Raoul (G?rard Darmon), and Remi (Marc Lavoine). This entire movie has an un-Hollywood feel to it, but one `quality' from American films comes into it: there are a whole lot of characters. It's hard to keep track of, and Nolte's mumbling voice doesn't help.Another aspect of The Good Thief that I found nauseating (literally) was director Neil Jordan's way of ending scenes with a freeze-frame. At times it looks like some bad editing, while at other times it simply looked like watching a scratched DVD on a very slow computer. Jordan seems like one of those `trendy' Hollywood directors. Others like him include Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down), Spike Lee (25th Hour), and Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich). I don't particularly like their styles; they always seem to use odd camera shots and even odder ways of ending scenes.Don't go into The Good Thief expecting an ordinary, Hollywood heist movie. It has an air of sophistication, but ends up in deep bleep by the end.My review: 6/10Rated R for language, sexuality, drug content and some violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced and quite heavy compared to most films in the genre but still engaging fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Montagnet is a thief, a heroin user and a gambler. As a thief he is one of the masters of his craft, but the heroin will kill him eventually and his losing streak has become so bad that the last bet he won is a distant memory. With a heart for lost causes he picks up young prostitute Anne and helps her as she tries to get by. Not willing to die away in a cheap old person's home, Bob goes for it when he is offered a part in a bit on a casino in Monaco. The plan is to set up a robbery on the casino to cover a robbery on the art that the casino keeps in a vault across the road. Bob gets clean to plan the job but this proves the least of his challenges as police officer Roger peruses him.It took me a bit of time to get my head around the rather strange mash of American heist movie and European atmosphere; in fact at the start the film moves with a crawl that is similar to the manner of the knackered main character. Although it does keep this pace to a certain degree the plot does start to pick up after Bob gets clean. Those familiar to American heist movies (such as myself) may well still struggle with the slow pace anyway but the material is solid enough to keep it moving. Perverting the genre slightly the whole thing is pretty lowkey, even the compulsory twists are delivery lightly. Jordan's direction is dark but stylish. He has an eye for Monaco without resorting to making it a tourist film, although his constant use of the freeze-frame got old quite quickly.Nolte is his usual gruff self and, aside from being hard to understand when he speaks with his gravel tones, he is convincingly lived in. He manages to pull off his tired, fatherly relationship with Kukhianidze, who looks the part but isn't actually that good. Karyo gives a good turn and support is generally good from the rest of the gang. I do understand why mainstream audiences struggled with the performances because the accents are all pretty thick and, combined with Nolte's muttering delivery it is regularly hard to catch what is being said.It is a genre film of course but fans of heist movies might find it a little slower and less obvious than they are used to. However if you can get into step with it and can get with the thick European flavour then this is a solid if unspectacular heist movie that is dark and quite enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This re-make is strident and harsh, and lacks the 'style' seen from Mr. Jordan's directing in the past (I've followed his career with interest ever since 'Danny Boy'). According to IMDB, the creators of the original, the French minor classic 'Bob le Flambeur', died some years ago. But, their names (le Breton and Melville) are still on this particular product, with that of Neil Jordan as the accredited writers. Clearly, they couldn't have added the 'bells and whistles' onto their original, sharply defined, tightly made gem. So, who did? Who's to blame? I find no fault with the performances of the actors (Mr. Nolte is as professional as ever), but what's with all the cigarette smoking, and constant Marlboro promos. Was this re-make paid for by the tobacco lobby? In general, this movie lacks much of the quality previously evident from Mr. Jordan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nearly unwatchable. This movie was so self-preoccupied and precious it was hard to watch. The first time the film stops and freezes for impact seemed interesting. Around the 40th time, it just seemed like the filmmaker lacked imagination as the technique, by that time, felt old, overused and boring.The other factor that I found distracting was that much of the dialog happened simultaneously and could not be understood. This was not a good strategy if the filmmakers wanted people to be able to follow the movie storyline. However, if the plot was sufficiently meaningless, perhaps muddied dialog is just what the doctor ordered.And what about that old lead character (Nick Nolte) who plays a guy his age (in his 60's) who ends up with the adoration of the 17 y/o beauty? How disturbingly ugly (and unrealistic) is that? And the scene where she is begging him to have sex with her? Give me a break! Perhaps the biggest lie is the title itself, "The Good Thief". What is that??! I think this is just more Hollywood grist for the mill concept...money looking for stars (or one star) with no thought to content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob le Flambeur this is not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen every film directed by Neil Jordan. Being a big fan of his, I didn't want to miss this one. Well, it was the big disappointment of my life. This remake of Bob le Flambeur is horribly directed and acted. The last sequence is just about the best thing of this film, but as for the rest, it was just mediocre, at best.The idea of putting together these many characters in the Riviera was probably a great thought, but then, the many actors of different nationalities and backgrounds prove to be a hindrance to the story. If one can get over the accent problem, then there is the sound track of this film, which was so hard to hear at all, at least in the theater where I saw it, that you have a double hurdle to get over.Nick Nolte with his hair dyed a carrot hue looks hideous; he probably was going through a bad period when he made this movie. His take on Bob is fitting with the character's spiral descent into hell because of his drug problem, no doubt. But he is also hard to understand since he whispers and mumbles most of the time. A little more clarity would have helped.The last moments of the film are very well executed, but as caper films go, this picture doesn't contribute anything to the genre.Sorry Mr. Jordan, better luck next time out. Maybe leave remakes to mediocre directors. You could not improve in the original one, so why even bother?</fullReview>

This Georgian beauty is definitely worth catching and she gives a great performance here.But, the stellar performance is Nick Nolte - a gambling and heroin addict that used to be a thief. I wouldn't say he was very good as he went to prison six times. Nolte was perfect for the part and really kept me interesting in the caper he was planning. God, I love a good caper and this one was magnificent.His buddy, the policeman, Tchéky Karyo, who played Jean Villeneuve in The Patriot, was trying to catch him before he did anything so he would not have to send him back to prison. The cat and mouse between them was hilarious.It also included the always enjoyable Ralph Fiennes in an uncredited role.</fullReview>

A supposed homage to French New Wave ? I'm not a film student or even a film buff, but if you want to see a stylish French crime film check out "Diva" from the early eighties. What's wrong with making a well plotted, straightforward, character driven crime caper without all the stylistic nonsense, anyway ? By the way, I'd imagine the much discussed freeze frames technique at the end of some scenes was both deliberate and meant to imply something really significant ! Maybe I missed some of the plot threads but for me the film didn't hang together at all. Neither was the lack of a coherent plot overcome by interesting characters or witty dialog. On the contrary I found the characters one dimensional and the dialog painfully pretentious - perhaps this was another stylistic affectation of the genre ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transplanted from more innocent times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After enjoying the marvellous '27 Missing Kisses' I wanted to see what else Nutsa Kukhianidze could do. Answer: A lot, if only the scriptwriter would let her. I think we'll be seeing much more of her in coming years.Why was I disappointed? The problem is that the role of Anne comes from a more chivalrous time, when a woman could be just an ornament. I haven't seen 'Bob' but I can imagine the original Anne, a stereotypical woman, who can switch from being a prostitute to a glamorous casino patron instantly because she is really just an appendage. Anne does not advance the plot. She is a passive recipient of patronage, luck, exploitation, protection and new clothes. We expect more of our female characters these days. We certainly want to see them causing their fair share of effects.Neil Jordan's Anne is far too strong, intelligent and sane to be believable in her 'about to become a prostitute' situation. These days the real Anne would be more hard-bitten. She and Bob would have to work harder to earn each other's trust. It is a less innocent world in 2002.This movie is a remake only half brought up to date. I felt as if I needed to have seen the original in order to understand it.It is only the writing that lets the movie down. Performances are all terrific. As another reviewer has said, Nick Nolte is made for the role of Bob. And it is worth seeing just to hear the music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what sort of fantasies Tedg has about being a movie reviewer, but he obviously failed to notice the following:This movie is ridiculous. It is badly written and badly acted. There is poor character development. Nolte's character is thin, unbelievably and his lines are rushed. The other characters are flimsy generic Europeans who speak accented English even to each other. The plot development suffers from a terrible lack of coherency. By the end you don't know how Nolte could have possibly pulled off whatever it is he pulled off, because a lot of the heavily accented dialog is hard to understand, on the one hand, and because success of the heist requires such a confluence of risky and unlucky outcomes that you are ready to believe that Nolte's character is into "chaos theory" but not that he deserves credit for having planned anything. As for the fact that there were motifs of duplicity and lots of "copies" - whoa. I think a 10th grade cinema arts student would fail to be impressed by that.This movie deserves a 2 on a scale of 10. If I hadn't paid to rent it I would have simply stopped watching it. Granted, it does get more interesting near the end, but the first 3/4 is so badly botched that there is little in the way of coherent redemption. Save your money and see a decent heist story, like the original Thomas Crown Affair, and join me in shaking your head as to the direction of Nolte's career. He was in another real stinker 6 years ago - Mullholland Falls.</fullReview>

A thief, herione addict and Good Samaritan is an interesting combination of traits all in one character (played by Nick Nolte). However, the loot he was after, was never really made clearly desirable, whether the paintings in the vault, or the money. Also his struggle with drug addiction was never really properly dealt with onscreen. The other characters were uninteresting as was the film. The story was complicated as many heist stories are, but not worth the effort to figure details. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never having seen the original "Bob le Flambeur" I can't compare it to this remake. On its own, this one isn't bad as remakes go. It's juiced up, confusing, and noisy but it's engaging too.The first thing one notices is that Nick Nolte as Bob is pretty good. He's older now and a little puffy. His voice is a barely interpretable hoarse whispery croak. If he used to stride a little much, he now shambles. It fits the part of a recovering junky who lives a squirming kind of life among the seedier folk of the French Riviera. And his performance is better than it sometimes has been. Watch him shiver in the back seat of a speeding convertible when he begins his withdrawal.The second most noticeable thing is Nutsa Kukhianidze as Anne. We first meet her when she's in her underwear and she's thoroughly unforgettable. First of all, she has this slinky French walk, her narrow shoulders held back, her hips a little forward, her steps tiny, and her slender arms and dainty hands swinging gracefully. She has the figure of a gazelle, a little sinew here, a little avoirdupois where it counts. When she smiles her lips curl in on themselves like Dana Delaney's. She has a boyish haircut, a fluffy Medieval warrior's helmet. (There's undoubtedly a name for this genre, a French name, but I have no idea what it is.) Her slightly crossed eyes have pronounced epicanthic folds suggesting that if you shook her family tree a Khalka Mongol might fall out. What I'm trying to say is that she's tiny and scrumptious.The direction is functional. Bodies are efficiently moved about. I missed the first twenty minutes and found the story confusing because that's probably where all the planning for this complicated robbery took place. Anyway, there are no directorial fireworks, except that on occasion a freeze of a fraction of a second is appended to a shot before the cut is made. The device calls attention to itself and adds nothing to the film. It's even used during fast-paced scenes.There's a good deal of slightly bent humor in the script and some good lines of dialog. The twins who are part of the gang simultaneously say, "Two heads are better than one," and they sleep in twin beds.In another scene, Ralph Feinnes is a fence for stolen art who has been ripped off. He and his burly henchman corner Nolte and Nutsa. Feinnes is enraged that Nolte has given him a fake and claimed it was a genuine Picasso. The dialog is something like this. Nolte: "Sure it's a fake but it's a very good fake. It was painted by Chester C. Smith, a great artist." Feinnes: "Well, Kandinsky here (his henchman with the knife) is going to give you a lesson, and what I'm going to do to BOTH your faces will definitely be CUBISTIC." I wonder how closely this remake follows the original, because some of its elements have been used elsewhere to comic effect. The burrowing upward from the underground tunnel goes awry and a gas pipe blows up, so the plan seems to fail. Meanwhile, Nolte and Nutsa are upstairs in the casino supposedly distracting the police while gambling. The upstairs feint makes the fortune, while the original plan collapses in a farcical scene. I'm thinking of "Big Deal on Madonna Street" and Woody Allen's "Small Time Crooks." In the end everyone is happy except for the owners of the Casino. Oh, and one bad guy who winds up dead.It's enjoyable in its own slight way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Nolte's a drug ridden gambler reaching old age quick, and has the chance to perform one last heist before retirement.Sounds promising? It was actually a disappointment and kind of uninteresting and dull by the end. Had it moments but I'd give it a miss...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boring, boring, boring, etc. I fell asleep. The only thing I could logically follow was the guy with breasts who didn't like spiders. All the characters were worthless. There are attempts at gaining audience appeal for the Nick Nolte character but he is just too sleazy to like. I can't figure out why people think this thing is worth spending a matinee price on.</fullReview>
