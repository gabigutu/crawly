		<shortDescription>Melville: two syllables - magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the first of Jean-Pierre Melville's astonishing and unique cycle of gangster films, which have been variously called 'ironic', 'structuralist', 'post-modernist', 'doconstructionist', 'existential', 'Lacanian', 'oneiric', 'philosophical' etc. Their influence on modern cinema has been incalculable - Melville's creative indepedence, location shooting and low-budgets inspiring the nouvelle vague; his filming of violent men in action everyone from Scorcese and Coppola to Tarantino and Woo; his deconstruction of genre encouraging Bava and Leone.Yet in many ways, 'Bob' is the least typical of Melville's thrillers. Where, say, 'Le Samourai' exists in a sparse, abstract, geometric, dreamlike Paris, the Montmartre of 'Bob' in vibrantly alive, with its nightclubs, bars, stray GIs, petty hoods, casual sex, late-night gambling. Where in 'Samourai', the hero's character is pared down to psychological abstraction, Bob is a recognisable human being, stern, but sweet, honourable, a Chandlerian knight, with back-history and motivation. Other characters are plausible, if elusive, also. Where 'Samourai' is a masterpiece of tone, in which direction, acting, cinematography, narrative, sound, colour, decor all cohere into a perfect whole, 'Bob' is a riot of clashing modes, more reminiscent of the gleeful iconoclasm of the nouvelle vague - parody and action, humour and seriousness, dream and realism, co-exist in fertile, thrilling tension.The hero is what the title suggests, a man who can't stop gambling, moving from one late-night backroom poker-game to another, betting most of his money on horse-races, leaving his diet to a throw of the dice; he even has a fruit machine in his well-appointed flat, where his art collection seems to consist of framed carpet. Yet, ironically, he is a methodical man, keeping to the same routine, the same hours, one night losing a fortune, another making one. Gambling is his only vice now; formerly a con, he did time 20 years previously for a failed bank job - he now considers himself too old for the criminal grind.After one particularly unprofitable spree, and a chance conversation with a pimp-turned-croupier, Bob and an old friend decide to rob the casino safe at Deauville, and begin rounding up the usual experts and investors, minutely orchestrating the heist. Almost immediately the plans fall through - the dissatisfied wife of the inside man informs the police, as does a thug Bob once refused to help. The casino boss is informed, the police lie in waiting. And yet Bob goes ahead...For a man who took his pseudonym from one of the great novelists; who adapted most of his films (including 'Bob') from books; and who wrote his own screenplays, Melville has little patience with words, and the story of Bob is brilliantly encapsulated in a series of establishing images. The opening narration eulogises Montmartre with shots defining milieu in realistic terms. yet, when we first see Bob, he is in a setting of extreme artifice, with symbolic chess walls (a recurring pattern) and pictures of, rather than actual, locations. He puts on his trenchcoat and fedora, his signs of movie criminality; whereas Jimmy Cagney and Humphrey Bogart's characters WERE gangsters by their deeds, Bob plays the role of a gangster just as Ledru plays the role of a cop, and Anne plays the role of vamp or femme fatale - they are recognisably human behind their 'types', but, in this world made of movies, they cannot do the sensible, plausible thing, but are locked into their roles, despite Ledru's humanistic insistence otherwise. Sense would tell Bob to give up the heist; his pre-ordained role means that he cannot.As he walks in the early dawn at the beginning, he looks into a tarnished mirror, a further visualisation of the difference between one's self and one's role, identity etc. In an extraordinary long shot, the road-sprayer that circles Bob is echoed in the circular shapes of a nearby park, echoing the circles of the film, the vicious circle Bob gets trapped in, the circles of the casino, the cycles of life. He watches as Anne is picked up by an American motorcyclist - Bob as helpless observer; the movie will dramatise the various ill-fated ways in which he will try to move from passive to active, to stop being a pawn of fate; the frequent, unmotivated-angle shots undermine this. Like all Melville's films, this is not the story of a gangster, but a dismantling of all the concealed codes, ideologies, assumptions, of the gangster, of masculinity, of Hollywood cinema.One of the ways 'Bob' breaks with traditional cinema is in its anti-Oedipal bias. ; A conventional film often uses an Oedipal trajectory, usually showing an immature hero's moral progress, often defeating an older figure, taking his place and power, and winning the girl. This is a necessary process of continuity for the social order. And this seems to be fulfilled here, as Paolo, who hero-worships Bob, obeying him like a father, takes his place, takes his girl, takes his apartment to have the sex Bob can't have anymore, even using Bob's gestures. Bob is a shadow of himself, de trop in his own home. As it should be. The subsequent narrative could be seen as an attempt of Bob's to regain his identity and power, and to emasculate Paolo.This sublime film is full of little twists of the norm like this. Isabelle Corey is unprecedented among all film heroines, her amoral, seemingly indifferent sexuality far more suggestive and powerful than her contemporary, Bardot's - her fulfilling her femme fatale role does not result in tragedy any more than Bob's fulfilling his gangster role does.The use of the narrator is interesting too; voiced by Melville, creator of the film, he is also a kind of God-creator, talking about heaven and hell, taking us on a journey from one to the other; talking from the darkness, about how lives cross, but destinies don't meet, than creating a work where crossed destinies are crucial; intruding at bizarre moments, with prior knowledge of the characters' fates before the action has actually determined them. This, of course, dissipates tension, as does the clownish music, mocking and undermining as much as it propels the action, and the characters' theatricality, their awareness of their roles (eg the rehearsals for the heist like a play).The filming of this goes way beyond Melville's heist models, 'The Asphalt Jungle' (his favourite movie) and 'Rififi' - after all the plot elements have been put in place - the plan, the preparations, the tip-off, the suspense - Melville moves to a completely different register, and what had been a crime film involving many interested parties becomes a solitary, private rite, Bob's gambling in the casino is a heightened, hallucinatory dream, not quite a rite of death, but a rite of middle-age, of letting go the trappings of youth, also paving the way for the great climax of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly': the shoot-out is pure, beautiful, dream abstraction.For many, great cinema is defined in rarefied terms of high art, snobbily above the detritus of popular culture. For some of us, though, great cinema means a transformative enriching and expanding of popular genres, a cinema that can speak to everybody, not above them, but making the familiar strange. Keaton. Hitchcock. Hawks. Whale. Ophuls. Sirk. Leone. Melville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BOB LE FLAMBEUR (1955) - DVD Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I have watched Jean-Pierre Melville's BOB LE FLAMBEUR (1955) for the first time, by way of Criterion's exemplary DVD edition. The film is a typical 50s French noir in its presentation of divided loyalties among a gang of crooks, women causing trouble, an elaborate heist-gone-wrong, police interrogation, etc. With this, Melville's first outing in a genre he later made his own, the director shows he is already at one with the milieu, capturing its every nuance and mannerism with almost effortless ease.The cast is relatively low-key but all the main roles are admirably filled. Unfortunately, none went on to do much else of importance (apart from Howard Vernon) - and it was, in fact, lead actor Roger Duchesne's penultimate film. Looking a bit like Rudolf Klein-Rogge (who as Dr. Mabuse also played a gambling crime lord), he exudes a smooth charisma and is quite arresting in his playing. Isabel Corey, still a teenager but looking incredibly sexy and mature, was literally hand-picked by Melville himself for the role of Anne, the lovely waif whom Bob takes under his wing but whose inexperience eventually leads, in part, to his downfall. The film also makes brief yet subtle use of nudity which, at that time, was not something one would hope to find in American movies! Daniel Cauchy as Paulo, Bob's right-hand man who also falls for Corey, acquits himself well too here and, on the DVD, delivers an intelligent and delightful 20-minute interview which gives some insight into Melville's working methods, the film's pain-staking shooting schedule (it took some two years to complete during which time Cauchy found time to appear in another four movies!) and also the director's insistence in portraying the 'correct' way of dying on screen. Howard Vernon has a brief but pivotal role as the shady Scotsman who offers to finance Bob's 'scheme'.Apart from the usual conventions of typical French crime dramas, BOB LE FLAMBEUR introduces some new forms of technique which anticipated the off-the-cuff style of the Nouvelle Vague by some years: the editing has a strange, almost disjointed rhythm to it which is particularly felt near the end during the long gambling sequence at the casino; the hand-held camera-work lends it a slightly amateurish look which suits the mood perfectly; a vaguely avant-gardist touch is also evident in the set design, as in the domino-styled walls of the gambling-dens Bob frequents and the closet in his apartment that is fitted with a privately-owned slot machine! Another interesting aspect (derived perhaps from Julien Duvivier's PEPE' LE MOKO [1936]) is the mutual admiration that is present between Bob and the Police Inspector played by Guy Decomble.Unlike most of Melville's other work, and particularly his film noirs, the gloomy 'atmosphere' is here counter-pointed by a deft playful mood that makes the film extremely enjoyable despite its fairly slow pace. The film's conclusion then, improbable as it may seem, provides a perfect and deliciously ironic twist - complete with a wonderful closing line.Criterion's DVD also includes a rather vague radio interview, conducted in English in 1961, with Jean-Pierre Melville who is made distinctly uneasy by interviewer Gideon Bachmann's frustratingly opaque questions. We learn, however, of Melville's great love of American cinema as well as his own work's belated but well-deserved international recognition. I have now watched 8 of Melville's films - LES ENFANTS TERRIBLES (1950); BOB LE FLAMBEUR; LEON MORIN, PRETRE (1961 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); LE DOULOS (1962 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); L' AINE' DES FERCHEAUX (1963); LE SAMOURAI (1967); L' ARMEE' DES OMBRES (1969 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); and UN FLIC (1972 - I still haven't gotten round to purchasing the Anchor Bay R1 DVD). I haven't yet watched LE CERCLE ROUGE (1970 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion) which I own on VHS, but I may just check it out now that I'm in the mood for more Melville movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gamble, Bob, Gamble, in it is the source of salvation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a movie in which a gambler finds out about a huge payday at a casino and decides to pull off a major heist. He and a couple of friends find a rich backer to put up the money necessary to pull such a large heist and then Bob (the gambler) decides to enlist some others to help out. In the end, he has involved not 9, not 10, but 11 people in the heist. Sound familiar. This hugely influential film by Jean-Pierre Melville has spawned both versions of Ocean's 11 and is also often credited as the grandfather of the Nouvelle Vague movement. This movie is French, so unlike the American versions of Ocean's Eleven, there is no singing, no laughing, no hi-fiving, just straight-faced gambling, plotting and even the loving is grim and made without a smile. The characters are memorable, especially Bob and Anne as they go through life expecting no happiness. Bob never goes to bed before 6am, as he spends his nights, every night, gambling at different locations. This addiction is part of who he is and plays a key role in the twist at the end.This movie is like a good strong Camembert. As with many French movies, definitely an acquired taste, but once one learns to appreciate the sharpness, one realizes that there is nothing comparable. Camembert, unlike bacon, is not the food of joy. But it is good, flavorful, and powerful in making one want to partake again and again. Until you feel the tanginess in your mouth, there is no describing the taste or effect, but it is definitely worth the effort to build an appreciation for it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic French crime movie from the 1950s. An influence on everyone from Godard and Truffaut to Paul Thomas Anderson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cult director Jean-Pierre Melville was originally involved with French art legend Jean Cocteau, but really found his niche making hard boiled crime movies. 'Bob le flambeur' was the first major work by him, and he kept making movies up until the early 1970s with 'Dirty Money'. His work had a huge influence on the French New Wave led Godard and Truffaut (who cast him in a supporting role in 'Breathless' as an acknowledgment), and has proved to be a major inspiration for American film makers like Scorsese, Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson whose debut 'Hard Eight' owes 'Bob le flambeur' quite a debt. 'Bob..' really knocked me out, and along with the equally brilliant 'Rififi' directed by Jules Dassin and released the same year, it's one of THE great crime movies of the 1950s, and should be mentioned in the same breath as Huston's 'The Asphalt Jungle' and Kubrick's 'The Killing'. All four films have had an enormous influence on most subsequent movies in the heist genre. 'Bob's plot is quite simple but the story itself isn't the half of it. What Melville DOESN'T say is just as important as what he does, and the viewer has to piece a lot of it together for himself. Roger Duchesne is super cool as Bob, the ageing gambler on a perpetual bad streak, Daniel Cauchy is excellent as his cocky young protege Paolo, and Isabelle Corey is sexy and intriguing as Anne, the jailbait who gets involved with them both. Personally I prefer this movie and 'Rififi' to 'Breathless' and any French New Wave I've seen to date, but that says as much about my taste as much as the movies themselves. Even so I highly recommend 'Bob le flambeur' to anybody who involves crime movies. It's a classic of the genre, and still fantastically entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool and elegant blend of American gangster film and French sophisticated comedy of manners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Melville's "Bob le Flambeur" (1955) has been often called the first film of the French New Wave. First or not, French New Wave or not, "Bob le Flambeur" is one of the coolest and memorable films I've seen. The most fascinating element of this exquisite crime/dram/noir film is its title character, Bob Montagne- Bob the Gambler (Roger Duchesne). All women wanted to be with him and all young men wanted to be him. He was the man well respected and liked by the cops, the criminals, and the gamblers alike - the king of cool, the elegant loser with his own respectable code of honor. He drove an American car and wore an American hat but he belonged to the streets of Montmartre, Paris, where he was born just as the film itself that could've been only made by a French director who admired American films and had created a perfect blend of American gangster film and French sophisticated comedy of manners. Made back in 1955, the movie is fresh, crisp, sensual, modern and simply delightful. Having watched already all "Ocean's" movies, including Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack's classic, I see where the inspiration for them came from. "Bob Le Falmbeur" was released in the USA in 1982, nine years after Melville's death and became an instant cult hit. Often, cult movies are not the best made but it is not true in the case of "Bob le Flambeur". Its direction is perfect: seemingly simple and truly elegant, its cinematography is beautiful, its music score is amazing and its characters are not the caricatures - they are the real human beings of flesh and blood and they have something (or a lot) to lose. Acting is great by everyone with Roger Duchesne unforgettable and Isabelle Corey as a young streetwalker Anne whom Bob took under his wing, absolutely marvelous in her first role - child-like innocent yet already perfectly aware of her powers over the men, by the words of Bob's friend, "she will go far -she knows what she wants but does not show it".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary crime-noir, from the director of Le Samourai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Le Flambeur opens with a glimmering shot of early morning Paris, where we find the rugged, nonchalant hood Bob Montagne, sauntering through the neon lit streets, looking every bit the icon of cinema that he is. To Bob, everything in life is a gamble, an uncertainty, a ten-to-one shot. He inhabits a world of games and chances... as the gravel voice narration points out, "the city can be both heaven and hell, as long as you know how to play it". He is, as the title suggests, a man who lives and loves gambling. A one-time crook now taking it easy, we find him huddled in a smoky apartment - the walls painted black and white like a chessboard - hard at work towards yet another pay off. When he isn't 'working', Bob lives the simple life, hanging out in bars with old pals or relaxing in his penthouse apartment. His only real companion is Paolo, a young tearaway who idolises and emulates Bob's look and lifestyle. The child of a former friend, Bob becomes the surrogate father figure to Paolo, looking out for him and making sure he isn't consumed by the lure of the mean streets.Bob le Flambeur was one of Melville's earliest entries into the gangster cycle that would later give birth to his better-known film, Le Samourai. Like that film, Flambeur is a technically assured and understated journey into the underworld, employing a raw cinematic intensity, knowing irony and loose plot, which can probably be seen as an influence on contemporary filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Ringo Lam, Paul Thomas Anderson, John Woo, Quentin Tarantino, David Mamet and Wong Kar-Wai. It can also be seen as something of a revolutionary work, with Melville's bold use of real locations, available light and hand-held cameras offering an obvious precursor to the style of the later nouvelle vague, and, to great filmmakers like Godard, Chabrol and Truffaut. Like those directors, Melville has a strong understanding of genre conventions and the post-war Gangster ethos, and thus, crafts a film that is both European in style and sensibility, but at the same time, nods to the classic gangster movies of 30's and 40's Hollywood... giving us a cool and slick film, that still has enough edge and grit to make the characters seem like real people.The plot unfolds at a natural pace, slowly at first, but gradually building momentum once all the major players have been introduced, with Melville creating something of a confrontational three-way struggle between Bob, Paolo and Isabelle Corey's deceptive femme-fatal. As the film progresses, we delve deeper into both the plot and the back story, finding Bob seriously out of pocket after a spot of bad luck at the casino... and, with only one way to go to get the cash back, he decides to pull off the ultimate gamble... by which, allow himself to be pulled back down into the criminal underworld that he'd almost escaped. From this point on the film becomes concerned with the intricacies of crime, the impact of friendship and the fixation and fundamental need to succeed, or else, forfeit the next ten to twenty years of your life... and for the aging Bob, this is not an option. At this point, loyalties are tested and precision film-making is pushed to the limits as the plot continues headlong towards its climax. The story takes all manner of twists and turns along the way, with Melville keeping the story rooted in the details of his characters and the intricacy of the crime it's self, so that by the end the film the whole thing has seemingly worked towards chance and blind luck... proving to some extent Melville's grand metaphor that life is the ultimate gamble.Melville's film is one of the classic post-war noir films, if not one of the most important French films ever made... an evocative depiction of glistening black and white France, replete with shady gangsters, crooked cops, gambling dens, back street cafés and the ultimate heist, made all the more potent by the astounding performance of Roger Duchesne as the laconic and iconic Bob, and with great support from Daniel Cauchy as Paulo, Isabelle Corey as the wide-eyed Anne and Guy Decomble as Inspector Ledru.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bob the high-roller," as he was called in the translation I watched; loves gambling. He's also a thief. Everyone thinks he's retired, including the police sergeant he keeps in touch with. But he suddenly gets a taste for it again, and decides to put a group together and rob a casino. Remade un-memorably with Nick Nolte as The Good Thief, this black and white French original created the clichés that made the whole world sing, from Ocean's Eleven (1960), Reservoir Dogs (1991), Casino (1994) and every other breezy heist movie ever made. Stanley Kubrick said he stopped making crime movies because Melville made the perfect one here.Great characters, a memorable score with jazzy sections, great performances, and probably the best pacing and story of any heist/noir/crime movie from the 30's, 40's or 50's. This is just guaranteed compulsively good entertainment, and as a first experience from Jean-Pierre Melville, instantly encourages me to see everything else he did. My next steps will by Le Cercle Rouge, Army in the Shadows and Le Samourai.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Genre Film that Fights Conventions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Bob le flambeur for a class on the French New Wave. The film is brilliant. The title character is a complicated former gangster who has mellowed out since spending time in prison. He reminds me a great deal of Burt Lancaster's character in Atlantic City. He is an old-timer in a world that has moved on.Bob is a gambler (hence the title of the film) that never wins. He has a relatively big win at the races but then blows it all in a casino. He seems destined to be a loser. The fact that he always loses may have some bearing on why he refuses the sexual advances of the young and beautiful Ana. Instead of bringing her into his web of misfortune, he "gives" her to his Polo (the son-figure). Nevertheless, the relationship between Bob and Ana is frought with sexual tension.Half way through the film, Bob loses all of his money and decides to put a crew together to rob the casino of 800 million francs (this reminded my a lot of Kubrick's The Killing). What follows is Bob's retreat into his original gangster form. At one point, he slaps Ana across the face - something that he (at the beginning of the film) would not have ever done. In addition the second half of the film is filled with sequences of the gang "training" to rob the place. Some of these are extremely hypnotic such as the lock-picker opening a copy of the casino's safe. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a great movie, that does about everything right. It's an early French crime caper movie, that obviously helped to set the standards for later movies.It's not like there weren't any movies like this prior to this movie but this is one that has all of the modern genre element type of ingredients in it, that we can still see back in todays movies. It perhaps makes this movie seem as a bit of a formulaic and generic one by todays standards but in the light of when this movie got made, it surely is a greatly original one. And it still really is one that is among the best, regardless of the fact that you probably have seen all of the elements in this movie being handled in later ones and better known ones as well.It has a great story with some equally great characters in it. It's a very rich movie that also manages to capture the right tone, thanks to some fine directing. It has lots of typical crime elements in it, such as an heist, likable 'bad guys' and the cat and mouse game between them and the police.It really is a fine made movie, that got directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. The movie has a good look over it, as well as a nice steady pace. The scene's are being build up great and the entire story gets told effectively. It's a great 'how-to' on directing and storytelling. It feels really like a Hollywoodized version of a French movie but in this case that's a good thing. It's also why this also helped to influence movies from Hollywood as well.No reason why to not like this movie.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just doesn't get much better than this. Visually, this is one of the most stunning and sumptuous feasts your eyes will ever experience. From the early-morning streets of Paris to apartments, nightclubs and bars, Melville captures a moment for all eternity. It doesn't hurt either that the acting is great and the leading lady is beautiful. Simply stated, this is one of the most enjoyable movie experiences one can have. If I wanted to get all analytical, I might write about the way Melville has taken the conventions of the American gangster movie and humanized them by populating his movie with sympathetic, emotionally-rich characters. But what really matters, in the end, is that this movie is enormously fun and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A History lesson in more ways than one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's probably common practice to brush aside films that were once made before a country really had a 'boom' in terms of coming up with their own film form or film movement. Bob the Gambler was made in the mid 1950s, a few years before Goddard amongst a few others devised the French New Wave and made it popular with films like The 400 Blows and Goddard's own Breathless. You can take numerous examples from down the decades: Does any one remember or still watch any German films before their Expressionism movement in the 1920s? What about Italian film before the 1940s or Danish films before the Dogme '95 movement? This is where Bob the Gambler is living proof that it hasn't aged that badly as we (or at least I'm) still stumbling across pre-film movement films and enjoying them for what they are.It's not just Bob the Gambler that is an example of French film and how pre-new wave French film has survived; a lot of the Lumi?re brothers films should be the first point of call for someone wondering where film and cinema came from; the answer is of course the French. Bob the Gambler as a film is just simply fascinating ? its look, its use of locations and its actual narrative just ooze class. Melville uses a very clever technique to introduce not just the characters and the setting but also the film as a whole without even touching on the story. This is done through the opening thirty or so minutes which just consists of character interaction as we discover what types of people these characters are and any other necessary information about pasts or whatever is delivered to us through dialogue. We discover a bit about Bob and his relation to the police as well as a bit on the shady past of the character of Paolo who will contribute to the plot later on since he works at the casino.But the film also consists of both outdoor and indoor scenes that are fascinating to watch. The indoor scenes for reasons just said and the outdoor scenes as more of a historical lesson if anything. This is post war Paris captured on film with cars and buildings acting as brilliant, timeless and irreplaceable mise-en-scene. And yet, Bob the Gambler has enough essence of noir, crime and innovation to keep it worth watching. There's a shot of a nipple in the film that surely would've had censors doing somersaults, several suggestions that sex has happened is implied by way of the scenes ending and there's even room for a shot from the backseat of a travelling car as the two occupants drive to their destination and maybe share a glance. Two things: 1. Would a Hollywood film from the time include such a scene or just get them there without the journey and 2. The shot is eerily similar to that of the one in Goddard's 1960 film Breathless where Michael is describing what he likes about the girl sitting next to him in list form. If Melville had been a bit bolder and included some jump cuts, the New Wave would've started there and then ? no question.There is further proof that the film has aged well and that the director was thinking big at the time in the script. My personal favourite scene is when they're going over the heist plan and one of the robbers stands to attention as non diegetic music stars up before Bob yells at him to sit back down and then the music immediately stops. Melville toys with us once again and has fun with the soundtrack simultaneously whilst probably having a stab at Hollywood for the time. That said, the script is full of witty putdown and lines that don't advance the story but are truly 'real'; very akin to today's Hollywood films after Tarantino gave everybody permission to do so.Bob the Gambler is a number of things and utilises a number of conventions that whilst watching in today's world, seem very familiar to us thanks to recent films but this was France, mid 1950s and even more fascinating: pre-French New Wave. If ever there was a film to watch in order to see what French film was like 'pre-movement', then this is it. Not one to be brushed aside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The generally positive reviews for this film baffle me. Some movies wear well with age. This one, made nearly sixty years ago, hobbles along on crutches. It is billed as 'a crime thriller' and 'gangster movie' but NOTHING HAPPENS! Jean-Pierre Melville had no experience of directing a movie before he put this together and, even with the help (or perhaps because) of rewrites from Jean Cocteau, the action remains comatose, the narrative entirely linear. It looks like the work of an amateur, though admittedly Paris in 1956 is shot atmospherically. The cigarette count is as high as the body count is low. What gangster or flambeur (the French argot for 'gambler') was ever called 'Bob'? Bob is a name you give your pet Labrador - it's a light comedy name. This particular entirely uncharismatic Bob wanders around from one gambling den to another in a one-expression performance. Other characters are poorly defined by the script or weakly acted by an inexperienced cast. The music (of which there is much) is as intrusive as it is frequently inappropriate. Don't believe the film pseuds. Mickey Spillane or Dashiell Hammett it ain't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Le Flambeur (Bob the Gambler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently this film is not very known for cinema goers and stuff, I certainly only heard of it when I saw it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I had to see if it was one that may deserve more recognition. Basically Robert 'Bob' Montagné (Roger Duchesne) is an old well dressed gangster who has a nice apartment, two-toned convertible coupe and he respects the police, but his big problems is a compulsive love for gambling. On a losing streak he is considering a last job in the Montmartre district of Paris, he overhears that the Deauville Casino holds unimaginable quantities of money and is vulnerable during morning hours. Bob develops the scheme to steal the fortune, and he brings in a safe cracker and a few other underworld characters to help out, and at the same time the middle aged ex-con becomes involved with young Anne (Isabelle Corey), who has no place to live and stays with any man who will have her. Bob's friend and partner in crime Paolo (Daniel Cauchy) trusts the young woman when they spend some time together, he even tells her the robbery plan, and she betrays the gang on the night the heist is planned, unaware it was meant to be secret, and she tells pimp turned informant Marc (Gérard Buhr). Marc was going to tip off Inspector Ledru (Guy Decomble), who Bob saved the life of, about the robbery, but he is killed by Paulo before giving away the big details, and the police officer warns the gangster off the job. The man inside the casino, Jean the croupier (Claude Cerval), has also tipped off the police, and to occupy himself before any heist Bob gambles a winning streak inside the casino. He has ironically got a large enough fortune with his winnings, and when his friends arrive, as well as the police, there is a shoot out, where Paulo is shot, and he is finally arrested. Bob was able to stash his hundreds of chips inside Ledru's car, and he remarks the possibility he will get off lightly and be able to sue the police for damages, while lonely Anne waits for him at his place. Also starring André Garet as Roger, Howard Vernon as McKimmie and Colette Fleury as Suzanne. Duchesne gives a good performance as the gloomy and addictive risky gangster with a good poker face and all the moves, I did not notice many funny moments, but the story that is similar to Ocean's Eleven was quite good entertainment, and the gambling scenes are interesting too, a watchable crime comedy drama. Vey good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid early Melville.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming a few years before Jean-Pierre Melville's ongoing obsession with trenchcoats and fedoras, Bob Le Flambeur is probably his most traditional noir flick, centered around the titular Bob (played by Roger Duchesne), an aging gangster who decides to go in for one final gamble by robbing a local casino. He recruits a small group of partners to come in with him, but the arrival of the beautiful young Anne (played with compelling charm by Isabelle Corey) throws a rift in the dynamic of the group and we all know how a girl can bring the downfall of a great many men.It's all relatively standard procedure, but it's interesting to see Melville developing what would eventually become his trademark style. The film doesn't have the unbelievably slick style of Le Samourai or the brooding grit of Le Doulos, but at times you can see pieces of each and it's all built around an interesting central figure. Bob is a man who we never get the chance to fully explore, but it's that stoicism, that mystery, that makes him all the more engaging. Duchesne plays him with a haunted, world-worn reserve that reminded me of the kind of stuff that George Clooney has been doing for the last five years or so. Bob Le Flambeur ends up being a character study more than anything else, which made me kind of curious as to why Bob essentially takes a backseat to the supporting characters for the middle stretch of the film.After the first act establishes him he almost disappears and we instead focus a lot more on the cops and Bob's young protégé Paolo (Daniel Cauchy). It was a disappointing turn, made all the more so by how interesting things got once we returned full-on to Bob in the final act. It's a diversion that's easy to understand in order to bring about the conflicts that drive the overall narrative, but it made me wish that we had been focusing on him entirely the whole time. Still, it's an ultimately minor complaint in an otherwise solid, if not overly impressive Melville entry. The film features an excellent ending as well, closing out on a high point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sly Caper Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Duchesne is Bob le Flambeur, the gambler, who is unable to keep away from the casinos in the seedy district of Montmartre. He has pretty seedy friends too. They get together and plan to pull an armed robbery of one of the clubs. The robbery is to be one of those suspenseful, precisely timed jobs in which some little thing always goes wrong and holds up the plan. The cops, not unfriendly types, are vaguely aware that something is up and an Inspector even warns Bob to stay clean. (He's been in the pen before.) Two "somethings" go awry in this story. The first of them is Isabelle Corey, a blond dancer at a nightclub and sometime lady of the evening, or rather early morning, when the clubs are shutting their lights off and the streets are still filled with drunken sailors.Isabelle Corey is a friend of Bob le Flambeur. I called his friends "seedy" before, but it would be a mistake to call Isabelle Corey "seedy." Not a bit. No seeds here. She's more like a red, red rose that's newly sprung in June. Her hair is long and invitingly tousled, her eyes often downcast, her expression shy, her arms and most of her chest usually bare, and she seems to shiver slightly when she moves. And she doesn't seem more than slightly put out when somebody slaps her for being naughty. My kind of woman! Lamentably, one of the gang of thieves is Paolo and Paolo has a big mouth. He tells Isabelle Corey and Isabelle mentions it to somebody who talks to the police. Hearing of this, Bob le Flambeur is aghast. But, ever the optimist, he figures maybe it didn't penetrate to the proper ears within the gendarmerie. No Frenchman should ever be so optimistic. They should be like Mexicans, fatalistic to a fault.The second thing that goes wrong is that Bob le Flambeur is supposed to be an inside man at one of the casinos. He's to meet the rest of the gang at just about the hour of closing and they will make a coordinated attack on the confused and befuddled casino staff.But Bob le Flambeur is, after all, a flambeur and hanging around for a couple of hours in a gambling house, doing nothing but watching, proves to be impossible for him. So, putting aside for the moment any thoughts about his rendezvous with the others, he places a small bet. Winning, he places a larger bet. Continuing to win, he moves from roulette to the bacarat table. The bills pile up to a considerable height in front of them and he never bats an eye as the money accumulates. Robbery? WHAT robbery? In most movies of this sort, especially during the 1950s, this is the point at which the hero loses all on a single bet, steps outside to meet his destiny, and is plugged by the other gang members, for whom some sins are unforgivable.Not here. Jean-Pierre Melville is not that kind of a director and not interested in such a tragic story. It suddenly occurs to Bob that he has a robbery to pull off but by the time he rushes outside, the gang have been stopped in their tracks by the cops. Knowing he was implicated, they put the cuffs on Bob too.But as Bob sits in the police car, the staff of the casino bring out all his winnings, enough to keep him in clover for a long time. With the right lawyer, muses one police officer, you could get only a few years. With a better lawyer, another thinks, you could get a suspended sentence and no time at all. Bob le Flambeur looks into the camera and says that with the best of lawyers he could sue for damages and walk away with still more loot.This sounds like a comedy but it's all played straight. A narrator somberly keeps us informed of Bob's actions and thoughts. Nobody laughs. Nobody even smiles. Melville was a neat guy, amiable and polite. He took his name from the author of "Moby Dick." And he was a friend of Margaret Mead, about whom he made a delightful short documentary, when they were both old. In the last shot of that documentary, Melville is holding the camera and walking backward away from the Venerable Mead. "Bye-bye, Margaret", he calls. Mead smiles and waves her hand, growing smaller in the distance, "Bye-bye, Jean." More sweet and satisfying than Bob le Flambeur but both films reflect his engaging personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leisurely but quietly absorbing little crime piece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob le Flambeur is an interesting little crime film by a director that would prove very influential to New Wave cinema. The title character is a middle aged gambler who has served some prison time in the past for a failed bank robbery but is on friendly terms with the cop who arrested him (who also had his life saved by Bob on the day they met). The film is pretty plot less for the first forty minutes before there is any real talk of a casino heist, but in some ways those first forty minutes were my favorite part of the film. Not that the rest is bad, but I liked the leisurely pace of getting to see Bob roam around Paris and meet various characters he knows as well as taking a young girl under his wing. Bob's young friend Paolo looks up to him and even gets teased by being called Bob by some other characters in one scene. Both men befriend a pretty young blonde called Anne, who reminded me a little of myself when I first escaped to Paris (except in the one scene later on where she does something completely stupid that I would never do). I also did not know anyone and needed to find a place to stay. Isabelle Correy was surprisingly reportedly only fifteen when the film was made and director Jean-Pierre Melville's meeting with her is very similar to how Bob encounters her in the film - finding out that she has no place to stay and offering her help and a place to sleep. Much of the film's atmosphere and style seems more New Wave to me for most of the film but in the last half hour or so, things get far more film noir. The film is very influenced by American gangster movies and Bob spends much of the movie dressed in a trench coat. The fact that not much happens for much of the film and what does happen does not seem very consequential may put some people off but I very much had my attention taken by the whole film and enjoyed it's style and character interactions. In it's own way, I found it very interesting and it is a film I could see myself far more likely to return to than the likes of the fourth Indiana Jones movie or Predators. Filmed in clear, crisp black and white. I liked the relationship between Bob and Paolo and the film has a certain world weariness and cynicism without being depressing (I would say that a few bittersweet things aside - it is very idyllic and romantic in it's way, despite the feeling that none of the characters will ever really go anywhere). A very nice little film for lovers of French cinema and noir influences. If you liked this, I might recommend Stanley Kubrick's The Killers (which has much more action) or the similar character piece of Paul Thomas Anderson's Sydney (aka Hard Eight) and of course more great works from Jean-Pierre Melville. Just do not go into the film expecting lots of action or for the heist to be a big part of the film. If you're in the mood, then this can be a good little film when it unfolds at it's own pace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable portrait of addiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have a remarkable portrait of a man who is dashing, suave, and together on the outside but who can't pass a second without drawing on a cigarette, tipping a glass, or tossing a card or die. This classic caper film is often mentioned along with "Breathless" -- and its protagonist, it seems, would suffocate if he couldn't indulge his addictions.The film draws you in like an addictive substance: You can't help but want to try it, and once you do, you're hooked. When Bob is on screen you can't look away. Presence like this is a treat. (Who is this actor, Roger Duchesne, anyway? I'd never seen him before and there's nothing but a 'stub' on him on Wikipedia. Dommage!) I loved this film but it leaves me uncomfortable and dissatisfied, though I don't fault the production. My discomfort centers on the sense of waste and missed opportunity that defines addiction. There is a part of Bob that wants to connect meaningfully with other human beings, particularly in a fatherly, mentor-like way. (Lacking a father and having an overworked, washerwoman mother he himself missed out on this kind of nurturing.) He takes stabs at trying to protect Paolo, the son of an ex-heist partner, and he tries to shelter the underage streetwalker Anne, but his efforts seem desultory at best. Bob can't focus for more than a moment or two on anything that could lead to intimacy. There's always that next drink, drag, or bet to pursue...As Bob tells the police commissioner, he's been "good" for the past 20 years, yet he rots in a jail of his own making. We see the extent of this devastation in the final scene when Bob rides in the squad car after his crew has been killed. To Bob it's just another day, another deal. He even looks younger, with his hair more graying than white at this point, as he hints at buying out the cops. It's only a matter of time before he's back at the tables. That's when he'll be breathing freely again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage French Crime Caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jean-Pierre Melville's carefully plotted heist caper "Bob Le Flambeur" (a.k.a. "Bob the Gambler") qualifies as an atmospheric exercise in film noir as well as one of the best French crime films about a robbery. During the first part of the action, Melville establishes the character of our ill-fated protagonist, while the second part concerns the planning and the execution of the crime. This vintage black and white robbery is reminiscent of the Hollywood film noir crime films and Melville does an effective job of setting up the robbery. Chiefly, "Rififi" scenarist Auguste Le Breton and Melville generate considerable tension because everybody, including the police, gets wind of Bob's plans. Mind you, this is a French language caper with English subtitles so only the most stalwart crime thriller aficionados may find this hold-up film enjoyable. The cast consists entirely of French actors and actresses, but the director, Jean-Pierre Melville, gained a reputation for making good crime films, including "Le Doulos" (1962) with Jean-Paul Belmondo, "Le Samoura?" (1967) with Alain Delon, "Le Cercle Rouge (1970) with Yves Montand, and "Dirty Money" (1972) with Richard Crenna.Bob (Roger Duchesne) has already served as stretch for attempted bank robbery and he survives on his ability to gamble and win, but he experiences a hard luck losing streak that leaves him temporarily broke. Meanwhile, he is a gracious guy who has helped out a lot of people, including Paulo (Daniel Cauchy) and Anne (Isabelle Corey), and he takes care of them as if they were his children. Bob is also close friends with a police investigator. It seems that he saved the cop's life when he shoved him out of the line of fire of a bullet. The police inspector genuinely cares about Bob and doesn't want to see him do anything stupid. Bob and his accomplicees decide to rob a Deauville casino. Ironically, the night of the hold-up, Bob wins a bundle at the gaming tables and loses all track of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as nature made him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film comes across as remarkably economical and compact considering that the whole first half turns out to be setup for a heist that never actually happens. The efficiency with which Bob is established as a neighborhood institution is even more remarkable for occurring alongside a whole other stream of sensual information - the amazing jokey score, the hypnotic use of light-dark patterns, the infinite telling details of character and setting - that set us up for what is to come. The percussive and uniformly brief scenes are also setup, giving way to a slower, lingering rhythm as the plot advances and the tension ramps up. This is the reverse of the usual progression and it works brilliantly, proof enough of Melville's mastery. The Bob of the second half is trying to escape his life 'as nature made him' (per Melville's great deadpan voice-over), and it's a rare filmmaker with the honesty and insight to show that the attempt is doomed. And to deliver that kind of insight with such a beguiling, offhanded humour - well, I've never seen anyone do it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Heist Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob le flambeur (1956) **** (out of 4) Outstanding heist film about an old-time gangster and gambler (Roger Duchesne) who finds himself broke when he hears that a casino will have a large sum of cash available for the taking. Even though his friends and even the police warn him against it, he decides to try for one last heist. The French noir genre seems to be growing more and more popular each passing year as film buffs continue to check out new, forgotten or need-to-be rediscovered films from the genre. I came to this one first as I had heard it was one of the greatest and it's somewhat hard to imagine, after seeing it, that anything else could really come close. Everything runs so smoothly that one can't help but be entertained by the events going on and especially the noir-ish acts of always blaming the women for everything that goes wrong. This film comes off so fresh and original that one can't help but imagine what it must have been like in 1956 when this stuff really was ground breaking. One of the many positive aspects is the terrific cinematography that constantly has the film floating around and really giving us a great look at the streets, the casino and various other important things for the plot. The way the music score just blends in so well with the cinematography is certainly "New Wave" but it still looks fresh all these years later. Melville's screenplay also offers up some terrific dialogue that really puts you in the middle of what's going on to the point where you feel as if you really are watching real professionals getting ready to pull off a heist. What also stands out are the performances with Duchesne who is wonderful in the title role. I really loved the laid back approach to the character and felt Duchesne had so much energy building up inside of him you couldn't help but keep your eyes on him and watch every little thing he did. Daniel Cauchy, Andre Garet and Gerard Buhr add nice support and it was fun seeing Howard Vernon in a small role years before his work with Jess Franco. Then we have Isabelle Corey who in my opinion steals the show. According to the IMDb she was only 16 when this was released but she certainly captures the sexuality of the role very well and she sizzles each time she is on the screen. It's certainly easy to see why these guys would fall all over her. I'm still very new to Melville but this here is certainly an impressive start and I look forward to checking out more of his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top Quality Heist Movie With Memorable Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Melville's entertaining heist movie is rich in atmosphere, style and flawed characters and it's these qualities, together with its moments of dry humour and amusing irony that make it so memorable. It's well documented that Melville was heavily influenced by American gangster movies of the 1940s and some evidence of this can be seen as the eponymous Bob wears a trench coat and fedora and drives a Cadillac convertible. Interestingly, however, Melville's use of location work, hand-held cameras and improvisation that are so effective in this movie, later became regarded as "de rigueur" by the French New Wave directors who followed him.As the story begins, a cable car is seen symbolically making its steep descent to the "hell" of Montmartre and Pigalle which are the districts of Paris that Bob Montagne (Roger Duchesne) inhabits. He's an ageing gambler and an ex-con who's gone straight for the last twenty years. He's well known by the people who frequent the nightclubs and gambling dens of the area and over the years has also gained their respect and affection.Bob is a fascinating character whose addiction is also his source of income. He's a gentleman who lives by his own code and often readily helps the people around him. Yvonne (Simone Paris) is the proprietor of one of the bars that he frequents and some years ago, he'd put up the money she needed to set up her business.In Yvonne's bar, Bob meets a young prostitute called Anne (Isabelle Corey) who's homeless and he gives her money, provides her with accommodation and gets her a job at a local nightclub to prevent her from falling under the control of Marc (Gerard Buhr) who's a pimp with a reputation for using violence to control his women. Bob sometimes lends money to those who need his help but he draws the line at lending to pimps who he regards as being contemptible.In the past, Bob has served time in prison for his part in a failed bank robbery and the son of his partner on that job, is now his protégé, Paolo (Daniel Cauchy) who admires Bob greatly and tries to be like him. When Paolo meets Anne, he finds her irresistible and they soon become lovers. Bob is also regarded as a friend by Police Inspector Ledru (Guy Decomble) because some years before, he'd saved his life by intervening when a gunman had tried to kill him.When Bob suffers an exceptionally long losing streak and starts to experience financial problems, a solution seems to present itself when his friend Roger (Andre Garet) tells him about the enormous amount of cash that's normally held at the Deauville Casino on the eve of the Grand Prix. Bob convinces himself that if he could pull off a heist on the day when there's normally 800 million francs in the safe, he could overcome his current problems and also achieve long-term financial security. He recruits a group of men including Roger, Paolo and a professional safe-cracker and then takes charge of the planning and rehearsals that follow.On the night of the heist, Bob goes to the casino before the rest of the gang but very soon gets sidetracked when he can't resist getting involved in playing the tables. The way in which his profound addiction to gambling affects what happens to him and the rest of his gang that night leads to the movie's very surprising and highly ironic conclusion.Roger Duchesne is charming and cool as Bob and his extremely strong performance captures beautifully his character's unique mixture of toughness, kindness and melancholia. The contributions of the rest of the cast are also superb."Bob Le Flambeur" has a good plot and an excellent ending but it's the quality of its characters and the atmosphere of their surroundings that ultimately distinguishes it from the more ordinary entries in the heist movie genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most of the Pigalle Blowing up the bank and robbing himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His fourth film leads author/director Jean Pierre Grumbach alias Melville in 1955 right into the Pigalle milieu in Paris. Before and after WW II Melville obviously knew this territory well and wrote an original script and wanted to paint as truthful a picture as possible. The story is about an aging small time gambler Bob (Roger Duchesne a post war movie star), who doesn't sleep with the girl he loves (Isabelle Corey as Anne, according to Melville 16 years of age at that time), but leaves that to almost everybody else. Bob is a loner, smoking all the time dangerous cigarettes, drifting through the night and always ending up in the restaurant Carpeaux for an early morning gamble. Looking into a rusty mirror , he mutters: , A fine hoodlum face ! ?One day he looses his heart to a fluff, tells her the morals as well as his young friend Paulo ( Daniel Gauchy), is liked by really everybody even the police inspector (great actor Guy Decomble), is always halve broke and supports the girl, that shows us some nice black under ware. Bob is long time out of the gangster business since he was caught and run in jail by the inspector, who has it seems not much to do, so he sends out the pimp Marc to find something worth wile going after. Bob drives an American V 8 convertible through Paris, the police rides a 15 CV and out of every bar one can hear some different music. And Henri Decae is the lighting cameraman as in most Melville pictures, and he just pulls the trigger of his hand camera to catch the nightly beauty and morbidity of the Picalle area.One night Bob is eventually totally broke and starts to plan a hold - up at the Casino of Deauville. He gathers a group of specialists (you can bring guns, but we don't use them) and being broke ? has to hire the money for the preliminary expenses from wealthy Howard Vernon (wearing obviously a false moustache and being almost a star in the fifties and the first leading character in Melvilles Film of 1947, Le Silence de la Mer ). Well, the inspector gets a hint because Paulo cant keep his mouth shut and wants to impress Anne, who doesn't love him at all, and stupid as she is tells the plan Marc. And it is the wife of the croupier, who tells the plan anonymously to the inspector. Many years ago Bob has saved the inspectors life, so the inspector runs around places to find Bob to tell him to stay away from the Deauville job. But the warning is too late. The action is supposed to start at 3 O'clock in the morning. To kill the time Bob is at the roulette and baccara tables, of cause starts to gamble and eventually blows up the bank and is late for the hold up. His beautifully prepared hold-up becomes completely unnecessary because he has just won the eight hundred millions in the Casino vaults by legal means. Paulo is shot dead by the police. Like a waiter the casino boy brings the money after the handcuffed Bob, who mentions to his friend the inspector, that he hopes that the money is safe with them....Actually a comedy, not very light hearted thou, and only because of the ending. A fine black and white picture (made with very little money) with one black man at the piano, all the rest are people between night and day between a thing called love and making somehow a living. It is a rather cool picture, a love letter to Paris; no fast actions; there is only one outburst of hate, when Paulo shoots Marc, to stop him to tell the inspector about the Deauville Raid. You can see nice details from the time one is missing for over forty years now, for instance the small 4 door Renault with the engine in the rear and the doors opening the wrong way. And I liked the two ladies dressed by Ted Lapidus in the bar, I liked the one - armed bandit in the closet, the three wheel mini car being purposely put in front of the oncoming huge convertible (that is pure Tati), early tourists in American sailor uniforms driving motorcycles, and the relationship between Bob and the Cop. One can hear and see, that they are in the same business.Buildings underneath Sacré Coeur are still, where they used to be. But nowadays the area is pretty well redecorated. Girls and lovers, gamblers and gangsters, inspectors and thieves, concierges and barmen are where they are supposed to be. You watch the picture and look into an authentic past, because Melville made a (as he would have said)?movie' about stuff he not only knew from books or the screen. The picture includes one of the best gambling sequences in film history. Toward the end when Bob is in the Casino and starts to win Decae films and catches some great moments at the gambling tables and puts them together to a summary of post war melancholy and oncoming Gaullism. Melville liked to have the film redone in colour. I don't. Still it was remade by Neil Jordan and called THE GOOD THIEF in colour and scope. I have my doubts if Melville would have liked that one. He cant object anymore. He was a conservative man. Michael Zabel, Offenbach/Rodenbach</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing "Bob Le Flambeur" for the first time almost 50 years after it was first made is like a breath of fresh air and you wonder how you might have felt seeing it fifty years ago. The way you felt seeing "The Usual Suspects" or "Reservoir Dogs"? Probably, or before the auteur theory came into vogue would it have been just another piece of Saturday night fodder? Well, weren't the suspects and the dogs just saturday night fever too, for young, hip audiences who clicked with the benefit of hindsight."Bob Le Flambeur" is a great film because it transcends pigeon-holing. Where did it come from? It certainly owes a debt to "The Asphalt Jungle" in terms of plot and to American cinema in general in terms of style, but how many American films of this or any other period were this stylish in getting inside the brains and feelings of their characters? Very few, actually. Or in using location in the way that Melville uses Paris? None perhaps, other than Jules Dassin who went to Paris and made "Rififi", more lauded but not in the same class as "Bob Le Flambeur".It's a heist movie that starts off as a character study so that we get to know Bob and Paulo and Anne and the Inspector who hounds them, as well as numerous supporting characters like the stoolie Marc, the unreliable Roulette-wheel operator and his greedy wife and Yvonne, who runs the local bar. Today movies will ignore the detail for the bigger picture but here, because we have been given the detail in spades, when the suspense kicks in, and believe me it does, it really kicks in.There are no stars in this magnificent film, (and none of the actors went on to international stardom) but the performances are superb, so much so that you care, not just about the principals, but about everyone on screen. Early days, but it may well be the best new "old" film I will see this year".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melville and the Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob, a middle-aged gambler and ex-con living in the Montmartre district of Paris, experiences a run of bad luck that leaves him nearly broke. Bob is a gentleman with scruples, well liked in the demi-monde community. He has unsuccessfully tried to rob a bank in the past, and has spent time in prison.Vincent Canby, writing in 1981, noted "Melville's affection for American gangster movies may have never been as engagingly and wittily demonstrated as in Bob le Flambeur, which was only the director's fourth film, made before he had access to the bigger budgets and the bigger stars of his later pictures." "Bob le flambeur" influenced the two versions of the American film Ocean's Eleven (1960 and 2001) as well as Paul Thomas Anderson's "Hard Eight", and was remade by Neil Jordan as "The Good Thief" in 2002. What I love about this is how the genre comes full circle. With the western, it had to go to Italy before it come back and be reborn in the United States. Apparently for the gangster film, it had to detour through France.Seemingly, American studios could not be inspired by John Ford or William Wellman until their work was properly recognized by some European counterparts in the 1950s and 1960s. But that is not surprising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above All Else, A Fascinating Character Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absent of the stylization of "Le Samurai" and not as gritty or violent as crime thrillers of the 60's, "Bob the Gambler", from Jean Pier Melville, is none the less an important film historically for it's influence on the crime genre, heist films specifically. However, how does it hold up as a film?Certainly there is sufficient build up to the heist. We see every step of the planning, with plenty of twists and turns leading up to it, and once things get started, the suspense is certainly there, though without giving anything away, the suspense doesn't come the way one would expect it to, but the tension is definitely there. There is violence, though not a whole lot, and it's obscured, so don't expect much in the way of high octane gun action.While the sections of the film dealing with the heist itself, the planning, build up and execution would all be enough to make this a fine film, what elevates it even more is the characterization. Bob is a a retired criminal, who all ready served twenty years in prison. Now friends with a cop and living seemingly straight, he's none the less prone to gambling and losing. He takes a father like role to Paulo, who aspires to be like him, and takes a liking to a young woman, Anne. He's seemingly a good person, willing to help others whenever he can. However, when he loses most of his fortune on a foolish bet, he gets a team together for a grand scale heist. This film is about more than a heist, it's about a flawed man whose vices will ensure he is never completely on the straight and narrow. Paulo also falls prey to his desire to win over and impress Anne, at any cost. The highlight of the film for me is the characters, fully realized and done justice by fantastic performances from everyone involved. I won't spoil the ending, but it's one of those endings that makes you completely rethink your earlier perceptions.Cinematography, while not as amazing as "Le Samurai", is still something to appreciate, with clear influences from American crime and noir films.SHould be approached as more of a crime drama than a full out, action packed heist film. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob le Flambeur plans a heist of the Deauville casino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A "flambeur" is a big-time gambler. One subtitle puts the title as "Bob the high-roller". Have you ever won big and then let it ride, either to a huge win or else to a big bust? That's part of being a high-roller, taking on those possible extremes. Bob loves to gamble, all night, and if he wins, he rolls high. Bob once robbed a bank and went to prison for it. He saved a cop's life once, and now that cop is his friend, as much as he can to a man who lives on the edge of legality and dips his hand into it now and then.The picture opens at 5 a.m. in Montmartre, a magical scene of darkness, the outlines of buildings, dawning light, street lamps, and neon signs. Paris is a magical place. Montmartre is both heaven and hell, we are told. The music begins with jazzy trumpet accompanied by strings and orchestra before shifting to accordion and street song and back.Our first view of Bob is in a game through an interior window against walls that are a black and white checkerboard. They match the dice he tosses. He is on his way home to sleep. He exits through a club where a vibraphonist plays. The wall decor is like a domino, points of light against a dark background, as geometrical as the checkerboard. Bob's white hair against the dark is another match. He looks at his "hood's face", straightens his tie, and walks away, past Pigall's. There is a dawn mist.Jean-Pierre Melville transports us entirely into another world. It's noir with softer edges. Toughness ameliorated by beauty and a code of morality. Look upon this movie as a friend, an old friend, whose ways are no longer the same. It is another age, now a remembrance, an experience.The story is almost secondary. The places frequented by Bob are closely linked to the character study, and to his planning for a huge heist. But the story is interesting and ironic too.If you are fascinated by this world, you will return to it again and again, and you will thank Melville for having brought it to life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Melville loved all things American. His passion for the films that came out of Hollywood were precious to him, in that those pictures affected him and the way he conceived to present his work. Although not imitating Hollywood, he improved his narratives by creating characters that captured his audiences' imagination with his cool vision of criminals at work."Bob le fambleur" is sort of an indicator for the big turn the French cinema wag going to experience with the arrival of the New Wave directors in the late 1950s. Their films were considered innovative, daring and different, but one does not have to go too far to realize Mr. Melville had been there ahead of all of them. Watching the film today, one marvels at the technical details employed by the director, as well as his camera angles. Take, for instance, the shots in which the sanitary trucks spray water on Paris streets. One almost feels being there, trying to step away from getting splashed!The screenplay by the director and Andre Le Breton, plays flawlessly because it feels real. The characters reflect an era of a bygone Paris where the night life was intense. Montmartre with its sexy clubs and night clubs were the haunt for the small time criminals that populated the area in the 1950s. We are given a glimpse at a different Paris even though its flavor has disappeared. The world of wise guys, prostitutes and the crowd they attracted are clearly depicted in the film.Melville, as he is credited here, took a big risk in the casting of Roger Duchesne as Bob, because of his problem with alcohol. It would be inconceivable to think of anyone else playing the cool Bob, but him. There are other rewards in the talented cast Melville assembled for the movie. Isabelle Corey, seen as Anna, was perfect as the young woman Bob wanted to save from the life he had chosen. She, in turn, was a pivotal figure in the story. Daniel Cauchy is marvelous as young Paolo, the man who admired Bob without any reservation. The supporting cast makes an excellent contribution.The black and white cinematography of Maurice Blettery and Henri Decae captured the lower depths of the Paris underworld which enhances the flavor of the film and ultimately, our enjoyment. The jazzy score by Eddie Barclay and Jo Boyer gives texture to the production. Ultimately, it is Mr. Melville's talent that brought all the elements together to give appreciative audiences one of the best pictures of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest gangster films of all time, only Rififi really surpasses "Bob the Gambler". Although Melville's work predates the nouvelle vague movement by a few years, this stunning film clearly paves the way for the movement with its innovative editing, fast pace, use of non-professional actors, location shooting and unconventional story structure.The energy these techniques inject is a far cry from the stilted, stage-bound dramas such as Christian-Jaque's Nana that were being produced in France at the same time.The character of Bob is well-drawn and his gambling addiction is by turns tragic and farcical (he even has a slot machine in his wardrobe).The momentum builds throughout but, like Hamlet, there is deceptively little action. The audience is left in suspense as they are taken through the planning phase of the audacious heist and then witness it unravel before it even begins.The 16 year old non-professional Isabelle Corey does an excellent job in a brave role. Her mixture of naivety and street-awareness comes across well, so the decision to use an amateur is well-justified.The noir lighting techniques and cinematography are still fresh in this film and the outdoor settings are what lend it the new vitality. This also reinforces the notion that this film is taking place in a real underworld, that you could go out tonight and walk around the very same streets in Montmartre and Pigalle as these gangsters inhabit.Of course, it is Bob's gambling addiction that also, expectedly, leads to his downfall as his one winning streak ultimately proves to be his unluckiest of all. Of course, that is contrived but it works well and, again, helps to build the suspense of the film.The ending is both fulfilling and subversive. Again, there is a hint of realism as the audience knows that, in real life, gangsters would be unlikely to succeed in such a scheme and that so many criminals are foiled from the outset. The ending is rapid and encapsulates the energy and freshness of the film as a whole. Bob is left standing, the old man who can no longer keep up with the energy of the new world and burnt out by his gambling.Melville proves himself to be a true auteur here and sets a pattern for Godard, Truffaut and co to follow. In that sense, this is a revolutionary and highly-satisfying film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is "Bob", There is "Le Flambeur", And somewhere between both ... there is "Melville" ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a strange film! Jean Pierre Melville's "Bob le Flambeur", released from 1954 to 1956, is a puzzling result offering two views that couldn't have been more opposite."Bob le Flambeur" is the movie that REALLY introduced the French Nouvelle Vague three years before Truffaut's "400 Blows" and Godard's "Breathless". It paved the way for a totally new cinematic style, less academic, more detached, jump cuts, hand-held camera, long tracking-shot and introspective narration. So despite its advanced age, "Bob" feels like a breath of fresh air on the 50's screens, no stars in the sky but a little wind blowing a new kind of cinematic expression. It's ironic that the Nouvelle Vague is said to have inspired America's New Hollywood movement in the end of the 60's when its most significant director was inspired by American film-noir. Cinema is like life, a series of new beginnings, of new reinventions.OR"Bob le Flambeur" plays in a different league than the close-to-perfect "Army of Shadows", let's face it. Although one can love the narration by Melville, describing Montmartre as a world between sky and earth, heaven and hell, the rest was a display of amateurish acting, and dialogs that didn't ring with the same authenticity as in Melville's later films. The editing, the shooting, the death scenes are not the film's highlights either especially when you take into consideration that the same year, a 28-year old director named Kubrick made a masterfully edited heist film named "The Killing". But while I thought the ending of "The Killing" was weak, "Bob le Flambeur" got better as the narrative progressed.IN FACTThe appreciation of "Bob le Flambeur" depends on the expectations. I, for my part, thought that "Bob le Flambeur" carried a strange bit of greatness, floating somewhere between the two visions I described. Both are true but both don't convey the true nature of the film, which is something innate to Melville's vision of cinema, art and men. In a way, "Bob le Flambeur" carries many aspects of the classic film-noir and as a movie made by a fan, it can even be described as a masterpiece of copy in its recreation of the gangster underworld, yet the fan made a movie that inspired many filmmakers, and reinvented the heist sub-genre. When the copy becomes Art, there's no other way to look at the film as the creation of a man who, despite everything, remained true to his nature.THE SET-UP"Bob le Flambeur" starts with an assemblage of archetypes retreated by Melville's introspective writing. Bob, Robert Duchesnes is the loner, an ex-con who retired from crime before War, a man with principles, whose only flaw is to gamble not only the money he has, but the money he hasn't. That's what "Le Flambeur" is about and "Bob" definitely belongs to another breed. Take his best friend for instance, a cop: Melville knew from his experience in the Resistance that the line between right and wrong, legal and illegal, could sometimes become uncertain. The generation gap is also indirectly highlighted by the flaws of the younger characters: Marc the pimp who'll turn out as an informant, Paolo (Daniel Cauchy) the young protégé who'll reveal the heist to impress the beautiful blonde, the scene-stealing Isabel Corey as Anne, beautiful indeed but definitely not the same caliber of dignity than Yvonne, the older bar owner. Some are defined by their principles or absence of principles, Bob is defined by his nature. Bob is a gambler, he's in a losing streak but believes in winning, in eight: his lucky number. So when he learns from his friend, Rene the ace safe-cracker that Deauville Casino's safe holds 80 millions franc and is more vulnerable at the morning, Bob decides to push his luck.PLACING THE BETSThe heist' preparation is original and impressive, there's a whole sequence when Rene experiments the safe-opening operation with a stethoscope inter-cut with shots of a panting German shepherd. These remarkable displays of perfectionism are quickly undermined by Paolo's blunder and when Anne tells Marc about the heist, we know she ruined everything. And this is when the film catches the viewers off guard, featuring a series of events that elevate the film into a masterpiece of character study. Isabel tells Bob about her mistake and takes one hell of a slap without sobbing, the heist is almost canceled off until Paolo redeems his fault by killing Marc. The heist goes as planned and the gang starts 'working' unknowing that they've been betrayed by the croupier's wife, ironically the only one who didn't belong to the criminal world. Times change to the worst and maybe "Bob le Flambeur" is less about honor among thieves than dishonor among so-called good citizens.CHIPS ARE DOWNAnd when we expect the plan to fail because of the wife, it's Bob himself, the mastermind who orchestrated the heist in a real-life chalkboard, who used the most scientifically accurate method, who ruins the project by simply playing and keeping on his winning streak, causing everyone's demise and Paolo's saddening death. The film plays with all the conventions of a genre, only to provide a classic on its own, getting better after each viewing.The flaws are there but "Bob le Flambeur" shines as a powerful character study about a man who embodies a certain code becoming more and more obsolete, a certain fashion of life, and through gambling, the very attitude that would cause his demise and ironically could save him. Bob didn't play to win but played against the idea of losing, just like Melville shot the film during two long years, despite financial problems, shooting against the idea of not fulfilling his dreams."Bob le Flambeur" is the quintessential Melville film, something about the idea of remaining true to your nature ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a big Melville fan, "Bob Le Flambeur" is disappointingly amateurish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm quite a fan of what I've seen of Jean-Pierre Melville's stylish and quiet rendition of gangsters. Unfortunately, the charmless Bob the Gambler falls flat. The qualities I've enjoyed in his subsequent films, which I focused on the most, were incredibly inconsistent and near amateur. The grating cinematography mistakes stood out the most, not because of the framing, which was often nice, but the position of the camera from shot to shot completely lost spatial awareness and clearly unintentionally broke rules that this film could not get away with ending up as a huge distraction. It was packed with inexplicably jarring editing, if mostly due to the cinematography, if not then there seemed to be hints of homages to the mediocre gangster films of the '20s and early '30s. There was lots of unsettling axial cuts, time jumps and a pointless use of wipes and irises, which mostly felt ridiculous and destroyed any tension the film could have had. It also had bizarre musical cues in the score that rendered the film near parody.However, I did enjoy the moral compass regarding how Bob earns money, and sees how others should earn money. It was a plot arc that wrapped up very nicely and intelligently, even though due to the style issues, I struggled to invest in the character. There's a very interesting network of characters with interlocking problems which sometimes worked quite well when I could figure out who was who, but unfortunately it didn't emphasise the hierarchy enough for it to matter. Overall, the erratic technical nature works against the films intended tone, and ends up just a mess with some neat ideas that Melville would later develop better in his subsequent films. I don't know why this is acclaimed, perhaps it was beyond its time, but it just doesn't feel like a professional effort. I suppose it could be considered an experimental film, but this was the trial and also the error. And a lesson I can learn from as well, since it proves what kinds of mistakes can ruin a whole film.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The setting is Pigalle, the red light district of Paris. We are in nostalgic prewar France, where automobiles jam the streets and life is bursting. Sailors pick up girls for a "promenade sur le moto." Montmartre, the Greenwich Village of Paris, is heaven. It is also hell. And home to our hero, Bob. Bob is a Mafioso who goes from one watering hole to another playing games of chance. He is nocturnal: he stays up all night and returns at dawn, only sleeping when the sun has risen. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses, but he always carries himself with a certain swagger. We learn that he robbed the Rimbaud bank twenty years ago, a bankrolling heist. But Bob is not like Al Capone. Bob is of the old sort of gangster, the debonair romantic who wears a tux and is retired from robbing banks by cunning and not by force. Bob is friends with the police not as a snitch, but as a life saver (he pushed the inspector, played by Guy Decomble, out of a bullet's path). He says, "The mob isn't what it used to be. They're all swine."This classic?"Bob the High Roller" in English?is a film noir look at gangster life in prewar France. Bob is Robert Montagné, played by the wonderful Roger Duchesne, a suave night owl who plays cards and robs banks. But Bob is not a typical gangster, and this film is not a typical cops-contre-robbers shoot 'em up film. On the contrary, Duchesne is a sultry, world-weary type. More to the point, he earns our sympathy. Rarely do characters on the wrong side of the law evoke such affection. He respects women. At one point, he lets Anne, a recently evicted woman, stay at his flat. Women give Bob humanity. He doesn't like pimps, and stops females from becoming lowly street crawlers. He has a sense of humor, too. When asked his profession, Bob replies with a smirk that he works at the Ministry of Agriculture, in the Equestrian Section. Bob loves horses.Bob, recently broke after losing his last 200 francs at the racetrack learns that a vault in a casino at Deauville, a seaside town in Normandy, contains 800 million francs. He assembles the team to crack the safe and escape without firing a shot. Bob plans out the heist in a junkyard with chalk lines to mark out the walls and safe location. In an amusing twist, Melville plays with reality by shooting a scene "what Bob imagined"?in which the casino is held up, only it is empty except for Bob's crew.Score &amp; set. One outstanding aspect of this film (apart from the superb writing, directing, lighting, etc..) is the setting. Every setting in "Flambeur" is shot on-site. We see the stone facades of apartment buildings, the natural beauty of Normandy, and the seedy nightlife of Paris. This technique allows for a more realistic, personal glimpse into French life. We see real people in real places doing real things. We are submerged in Bob's world like nothing else. Another strong trait of the film is its score. Eddie Barclay and Jo Boyer did a fantastic job setting the mood of scenes with soft, reflective music or trumpet-blaring adrenaline pieces. Jean-Pierre Melville is not a conventional film noir auteur like fellow Frenchmen Henri-Georges Clouzot or Jacques Becker. Untrained, young (he was 39 when the "Flambeur" was released), and minimalist, Melville tried to bring a big movie feel to small-scale productions. "Le Flambeur" was shot and edited with a budget of ten and a half times less than the average film at that time. This small budget stands as a stark contrast to the high budget look and feel we find in his film. It is truly a gem, and worth watching for any film buff or fan of the "Oceans" series with Clooney, et al. According to Roger Ebert, it is the first film of the French New Wave. In part, he inspired the New Wavers of the 60s with his real-life settings, low budget, and independent mise-en-sc?ne. Melville's classic has withstood the test of time, particularly since bad guys today almost never have any redeeming traits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time quite recently on France's TV Monde and found it exhilarating, years ahead of its time, and like Rififi something of a precursor in terms of heist movies. Roger Duchesne has a commanding presence -- and performance to boot -- as Bob the gambler but he is more than ably accompanied by the rest of the cast. This stylish, inveterate yet principled gambler has no luck at cards or, for that matter, at love but he cares for others and enjoys the admiration of the local top cop who really tries to prevent him coming to harm. When Lady Fortune finally smiles upon Bob it also makes him late for the heist, an event that precipitates the ending. This storyline is deceptively simple as there is much to enjoy in the building of the characters that surround him. The direction by Melville (who only added forenames Jean-Pierre later] is as impeccable as you will find and the photography quite stunning despite some amateurish touches. My feeling is that if you care for movies you should not miss this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Melville has a lot to answer for; had he not turned out such a great professional low-budget-shot-on-location movie as this then amateurs like Godard may have been content to watch instead of attempt to MAKE movies. That to one side this remains, at more or less fifty years old, a great film (though the print I've just viewed has clearly seen better days and actually ignited during the screening. Melville was heavily influenced by American 'gangster' movies and didn't care who knew it and it's arguable that the bulk of his stick-of-gum budget went on cigarettes as virtually no character is seen without one for the duration. In those innocent days all Melville had to do was put Roger Duchesne in a trench-coat and snap-brim hat and the audience could have written the 'back-story' for themselves. A great percentage of Melville's triumph in his first polar is in the atmosphere, the 'feel' of the milieu - I know the area in question quite well but I didn't get there for a good thirty years or so after Decae's camera had shot this valentine and though recognizable it was definitely a victim of progress, like Bob himself, who epitomizes the thirties of Gabin, Prevert and Carne and finds himself in a world of Vadims. So many posters have itemized the plot line that it would be superfluous to do so again, suffice it to say it is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is extremely polished and well-made. It stacks up very well to even the best American film noir movies and is about the best French gangster film I have seen. Apart from THE KILLERS, DOA and possibly KISS OF DEATH, it's with very few equals----except for THE KILLING and RIFIFI. THE KILLING has a suspiciously similar plot and it came out a year AFTER BOB LE FLAMBEURe could be said for RIFIFI--so I assume that these plots were "heisted" or it was simply a remake. Yes, there are a few differences, but the basic plot line is pretty much intact. Though, because this was a French film, a few gratuitous boobs were tossed into the melange that you won't see in THE KILLING and only see briefly in RIFIFI. You certainly would NOT have seen that in Hollywood in 1955! I think another reason I liked the film so much was also due to when it was made. Had it been made just a few years later (when the French New-Wave movement began in the later 50s), the artistic touches and excellent camera work would have been abandoned in favor of Godard's or Truffaut's style (as seen in movies such as Breathless and Shoot the Piano Player). I, for one, prefer the older and more artistic style of noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob Le Flambeur (the gambler) is played by Roger Duchesne in a performance that is as cool, concentrated, and amusingly intense as Jean-Pierre Melville's direction is. This is a film that's about a heist, but it's not primarily so. Bob is the main guy, "a legend of a recent past", who makes it his pleasure (and perhaps curse) to use whatever money he has at the tables and at the track. He even has a slot machine in his closet. And as the aging Bob, he also keeps an eye here and there over the young Paolo (Daniel Couchy, in a subtly amateurish but impressive performance) and the beautiful Anne (Isabelle Corey) as a sub-plot between them unfolds. Bob, meanwhile, in the midst of his danger of losing all he owns, gambles a big one - to knock over 800 million in the Deauville casino using the (old) professionals from before gangsters changed in France. What unfolds from there is no less than remarkable storytelling and style with pinache.On a budget that must've been ultra-low for the times (perhaps not El Mariachi low but perhaps more or less Clerks' budget), Melville, along with his cameramen Henri Decae and Maurice Blettery, the shots and images are magnificent. Even when shooting on streets there's an American feel that Melville is fusing into his own French-Parisian rhythm, and it never crosses into the dangerous realm of parody or (worse) of a low-grade B-movie. The sense of suspense is kept just right, the humor that does pop up (the kind of slick humor one would see in a Bogart movie) is timed to not over-stay, and the pace is tight while some scenes move slow, but in the kind of slow pace that doesn't meander a bit (like, say, in Breathless). When the climax comes, we don't know whether to root for Bob one way or the other, but one thing is certain, Bob will be remembered. Classic A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob le Flambeur is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the story of Bob le Flambeur, a reformed gambling man/con-artist who's down on his luck and dreaming of a big score. When an idle remark alerts him to the opportunity to take the Deauville casino for its entire 800 million Franc-vault however, he can't refuse...It's a heist movie from the days when audiences hadn't been overfed on diets of second-rate cool like Confidence and the Ocean's sequels. While its age and our inevitable familiarity with this sort of criminal underdog movie make the story a little predictable, Melville's stylish direction gives it a freshness fifty years on that even its most recent of modern counterparts tend to lack.And a lot of it is down to Melville's vision. His camera captures the essence of what makes these movies cool: the black and white noir atmosphere, the sharp suits, the hats, and of course, the obligatory drinking and cigar smoke, and combines them, often in single smooth shots, giving the characters and their environments an element of stylish cool that they'd otherwise lack.As a result, it's a movie that places style over subplot, with the majority of the characters never really becoming much more than types or fringe players. However, the movie is tied together by Bob, the titular flambeur, played with understated flair by Alain Delon. He exudes a cool authority and dominates the film, and while he is clearly an addict, his apparently casual approach to his victories and defeats quickly draws you in.While the story is predictable and precious few of the characters engaging, Bob le Flambeur is not the best film you'll ever watch.But it sure is cool.</fullReview>

While plotwise it lacks the finesse of the thematically similar Rififi (1955), it certainly still has its own qualities.Released in 1956, Bob marks Melvilles entry to the crime genre but is radically different to his later gangster films in many ways. Instead of taking the highly-stylized minimalist approach which defines most of those movies, Bob is an entertaining, quite playful and even slightly comedic work.Especially remarkable are the cinematography and the main characters which embody an incredible amount of coolness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob le Flambeur review: The plot was a complex saga. The film captured some brief shots of Paris in a noir mood. It gave a classic sensation to the picture. The movie didn't have a gripping tone. The characters had a deep nature that was underneath the surface. In addition I loved the vehicles that were driven for an example, the Cat-lax, and other stylish 1950s vehicles. I am in shock that Jean-Pierre Melville had directed that movie because it wasn't as great like his other titles such as 'Le Doulos' and 'A cop'. I was supremely disappointed. Sadly the substance was weak. But then again it was the picture he had choreographed before those two films in the 1950s. That title didn't have enough scenes of pure French scenery unfortunately. The costume and production designing could of been at it rich climax. But on the other hand my ears were trapped when I heard the Jazz soundtrack that was played by expensive instruments. I could easily tale that it had a powerful Hollywood inspiration. It had a strong French style I give the motion picture a 5 ? 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding noir, but which version?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favorite films. I saw it in Boston around 1982 when the film was released, it seems for the first time, in the US. The acting, the script, the astonishing performances from actors unknown to most US audiences, the modernity of it all...and Isabelle Corey. Well, the French have a word for it.Paris, as always, steals the show to a certain extent, but that is one of the things (besides Isabelle Corey) that makes it worth viewing repeated times.The one thing that I am perplexed by is this: when I saw it in 1982, I am quite sure it had a *completely different, and happier ending*. What I recall is: The gang gets into the casino and holds the staff hostage as planned. Bob is late, but gets there in the end to see them trying to open the safe...but there is some complication with the locks and they fail, and decide to run for it. They make it outside, where the Commissaire and his men catch them. Paulo didn't die in this cut. They are all arrested, and as they're being put in the police cars, out come the pageboys carrying all the banknotes Bob won at the Chemin de Fer tables...so Bob knows they'll be alright in the end.In this case, I think the scene in the Criterion release where Melville comes on the voice-over and says "This is how the hold-up was supposed to take place" was actually seen at the end as the hold-up itself in the version I remember. As it is now, it's quite bizarre and something of a non-sequitur to see this scene placed, for no apparent reason, earlier in the film. This alternate ending also explains the odd situation several people have commented on, to the effect that Bob is seen after Paulo's death appearing not so concerned or saddened as we all think he should be.So it seems to me that Melville made two versions, and that perhaps for some markets it was felt that Paulo had to die, since he'd gunned down Marc the Slimeball a few hours earlier.They just do not make films like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title character is an aging gambler and supposedly reformed gangster who finds himself on a losing streak and decides to rob a casino. As is the case with most films of Melville, the pace is leisurely - too much so. To the fans of the director, he can do no wrong, but he spends too much time on mundane events. Hardly anything happens for the first third of the film. The plan for the robbery is then put into motion and things become a bit interesting but it is not well sustained. The main attraction here is the alluring Corey, making her film debut as an oversexed teen. Apparently the young actress was plucked from the streets by the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Bob le Flambeur' (= French for something like 'Bob who burns things down') is a competently made French film from the mid-1950s.Although never &amp; nowhere brilliant, 'Flambeur' entertains from beginning to end. It provides a well-woven story, set in competent acting &amp; shooting. It also shows elements of 'noir', which was pretty fashionable a decade before.A special word for young blond actress Isabelle Corey, whose career was considerably pushed forward by 'Flambeur'. Although Corey definitely adds color to this black and white film, one cannot miss that in her looks &amp; behavior she copies a lot of young Brigitte Bardot. To put it more precise: in 1956 Corey was seventeen, Bardot twenty-two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film noir is regarded as a precursor to French New Wave cinema. It is the story of one Bob Montagne, the gambler of the title. Bob is not seen as a hopeless and addicted loser, but of a higher class - stylishly dressed in suits and often wearing the iconic overcoat and fedora. Bob is also kind hearted - early on he takes in a (quite attractive) young woman, not for sex but to give her a place to live. Bob is cool to the max.After some losses leave Bob pretty much broke he finds out that a nearby casino stores large sums in a safe prior to certain events and decides on a big heist that winds up involving a small army of accomplices. The film then concentrates on the planning of the heist and complicated relationships among the characters, not all of whom are involved in the crime. The story line is suitably involved to be of interest, with a nice twist at the end, but I felt oddly detached from the whole thing. No feeling of tension is ever developed. The heist involves cracking a safe that has four independent locks. In one scene we see the safe-cracker decoding combinations on a proxy safe by using a stethoscope - we watch as he laboriously listens to all four of the locks. We got the idea after the first one already. But then later we go through the same procedure with the stethoscope replaced with an oscilloscope - again going through all four locks. And when Bob goes to the races we don't even get the excitement of a fast-paced horse race but rather a harness race. As the horses trot along we get the feeling that the director is making efforts to tone things down, to purposely drain the story of excitement. The black and white photography is nicely done - I particularly liked the checkerboard walls in one of the rooms. And the 1950s Paris street scenes in Montmartre are a great backdrop. In fact Bob's apartment has a clear view of Sacré Coeur.The unique approach recommends this film, but if you are looking for intense heist movies, New Wave Cinema, or film noir, then there are better choices. But, maybe this is one of the few films that encompasses all three of those genres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is strikingly like "Rififi" which was reissued last year. Both movies have tough, hardboiled Dashiell-Hammett-like male characters who dominiate over the eye-poppingly beautiful female ornaments in their surroundings and talk in short, sarcastic metaphors. There is a strange sequence where they are practicing cracking a safe where the camera keeps panning to the financier's German Shepherd, for no apparant reason...pure cinematographic style, much like in Rififi (although I can't put my finger on a specific equivalent scene). Lest I repeat myself, the women in both films are really something. They are dressed and photographed in ways that are far more alluring than one is accustomed to in US films of the period, and their general 'look' seems to have foreshadowed US fashion by decades. The female lead in this movie has a very 1980's 'do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An obscure delight, one of the original caper flicks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reportedly this flick was locked away in a safe for years but was thankfully retrieved by some film buff archivist. It was original and innovative when I saw it thirty years after it was made. The characters are richly developed and inhabit a hip Parisian beatnik world filled with Pernod and cigarette smoke. The film was shot in black &amp; white and the lighting is beautifully done. Several scenes shot at night on wet Parisian backstreets and inside small cafes create the perfect ambience. The plot line involves a plan to rob a casino. The characters' individual motives for getting involved in the caper are artfully explored without sentiment. However, we learn to enjoy the protagonists, especially the taciturn Bob, and delight as the action unfolds.Bob le flambeur is a real gem. It will leave you aching to visit the night-time world of neighborhood bars and artists' garrets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark crime caper in France</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob (Roger Duchesne) is a gambler without a lot of luck, and a reformed thief, pressed into pulling off a daring robbery at the Casino at Deauville. There are lots of complications, especially involving the pretty young girl Anne (Isabelle Corey) who Bob takes in but doesn't sleep with. Bob has a kind of sleepy charisma, and even the detective inspector likes him. The French seem to like this motif?it's a lot like Jean Gabin in Touchez pas le grisbi. The filming was done in between other projects as Melville could raise the money, and he uses actual street scenes in Pigalle, shot with hand-held and bicycle-mounted cameras, years before the Nouvelle Vague "invented" the techniques. Ironically, the robbery fails because of the weaknesses of some of the conspirators, just as Bob is winning big, for the first time ever, in the casino. The Hollywood remake, The Good Thief, is almost completely different, except for the general outlines of the plot--so, because the second one has its own heated atmosphere and character motivations and plot complications, it makes more sense to consider them separately, on their own terms, and to like them both.</fullReview>

It is a pity the print on the rental DVD i had was fairly poor but the story line and the pace more than made up for the lack of technical quality. Bob is the kind of guy you just don't see anymore on film, a sort of Robin Hood type who is loved by all, even the cops love him.The plot is helped along nicely by a brisk dialogue and some lovely comic moments.Not a film to be taken too seriously but with a character as likable as Bob it really doesn't matter.

		<shortDescription>Bob, a high-roller from Montmartre's glory days, decides to ante up one last time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this classic film by Jean-Pierre Melville, Bob (Roger Duchesne), a brigand from the glory days of pre-war Montmartre has served hard time due to his refusal to use violence in a famous bank robbery. His techniques made famous while in prison, Bob returns to Montmartre to find it changed into a bourgeois wasteland. Finding racketeering too dangerous a trade, Bob turns to gambling and finds himself rendered sterile by his compulsive gambling. Finding himself on a long losing streak, Bob decides to end the drought when alerted to the possibility of pulling off the biggest heist in history--the 800 million franc robbery of the impenetrable casino in Deauville. When things don't go exactly as planned, Bob is lured once again by chance. What will be the result?A classic tale of the chasm between old and new, pre-war and post-war and the inability to adapt to change, Melville makes this very clear in the opening scenes with a masterful shot of the funiculaire separating the basilica of Sacré Coeur from the red-light district of Pigalle, accompanied by a musical scale implying descent and Melville's voice over saying Montmartre represents two worlds--heaven and hell.Belonging to the old world, Bob remembers the days of plenty, the pre-bourgeois, pre-nazi days of prosperity, finding himself blasé and used up by the new world. Having all but given up on himself, he has taken in a protegé Paolo (Daniel Cauchy), who he attempts to form in the old method, with an abhorrence of the pimps, sharks and outsiders who found the war a prime opportunity to bring their instituttions to decadent Montmartre. Having allowed himself to be imprisoned to save the life of Paolo's father, Bob, who knew no father growing up, becomes the paternal figure for Paolo, surrendering everything to him, including the love of Anne, a gorgeous young woman "well-developed for her age" (Isabelle Corey, then only 16 years old).Realizing he'd ceded everything to Paolo, which is represented by the image of a broken Bob returning home at the early hours of the morning to find Paolo asleep in his bed, having triumphed at seducing Anne and hitting the jackpot on Bob's personal slot machine--something Bob had yet to do; Bob decides to surrender games of chance and after a 20-year hiatus from crime, return for the big payoff.Tipped by a nightclub owner and gambling accomplice, Roger (André Garet), Bob, Paolo and a team of safecrackers join forces with Roger in the seemingly-impossible task of cracking the Deauville casino's state-of-the-art safe. When a tough, no-nonsence Parisian police commissioner (Guy Decomble), who'd befriended Bob when he'd saved his life also, is clued in on the robbery, he does all he can to stop the robbery without having to place his old friend behind bars. When things go awry with the heist, Bob is lured once again to the stakes of chance, showing the impossibility of living in two worlds.In a plot thickly interwoven with intriguing characters, sub-plots, love, envy, deceit and passion, we have a tale that clearly depicts the separation of the old world from the new and the inability of existing in both. Good/evil, old/new, heaven/hell, chance/action--many binary opposites work together to create this masterpiece. A bittersweet ending decides the fates of the endearing characters, Bob, Paolo and the lovely Anne, completely dismantling all that was forged throughout the film.Film noir meets the game of love and chance in Melville's masterpiece, one of the greatest films of all time whose influence can be found in all that has come after. A benchmark in the crime genre and a classic in camerawork with the shots of Montmartre, the roulette wheel, etc., this game of chance, with its binary opposites and characters torn between two worlds is a must see for all lovers of cinema and French film noir and policier films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-So Film Noir At Best, Re-Make Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't "cool" to like an American re-make over a European original, but that's the way I feel about this one. The remake, "The Good Thief," was simply more interesting. Perhaps since I saw the latter right before I saw "Bob," it made this one disappointing, since this did not have the story twists I found in the modern-day version. And, hopefully, another viewing will change my mind.Isabelle Corey, who was not a 15-year-old as reported in several film noir publications, but in her mid-20s, was nice on the eyes and Roger Duchensne, as "Bob," the lead male also was interesting.The cinematography is pretty good but I've seen films noirs a lot better, not only in the photography but in heist stories. On the whole, I felt this was really overrated and overpriced, DVD--wise.If you want a good French film noir from the same year, rent or buy "Rififi"" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing about how much of a masterpiece it was for years, finally seeing "Bob le flambeur" disappointed me a bit. I am an admirer of the French New Wave cinema on which this was a massive influence and am a big fan of Melville's later crime dramas "Le Samourai" and "Le Cercle Rouge" (which are both the classics this is made out to be). I guess I went into this film with expectations far too high or thought it was going to be a hard hitting crime drama. In reality, it is a caper comedy.That being said, it is one of the wittiest and most clever caper films I've seen. As usual, Melville's direction is perfect and is easily the best aspect of the film. The dialog is very well written also, particularly the final meeting between Bob and the police inspector. Also, Isabelle Corey is one of the sexiest women ever caught on camera. If this film had been released to the US when it first came out, she could've become an international star. Still, there are some aspects of the film I found to be frustrating. One of them are the characters. Bob is built up to be a fascinating character when introduced, but you never quite understand his motivations for his actions later in the film. Also, Paolo was annoying and seemed to whine too much. Finally, the ending seemed abrupt and clashed with the previously light-hearted tone. And while it is a very well made and intelligent b-film, it is still at heart a b-film. Its entertaining and amusing, but not nearly as good as "Breathless", "Rififi", or Kubrick's "The Killing". Don't go in expecting a masterpiece like I did and you'll probably enjoy this much more. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic perhaps but still entertaining, chic and cool minor caper film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob is an old gangster and unrepentant gambler who haunts the many gambling dens and casinos of the city and beyond. Despite his modern associates, Bob still has the code of ethics of a gentleman and still has time to take youngsters under his wing, such as the na?ve youth Paolo and the beautiful young drifter Anne. This does not change the fact that Bob is nearly broke, so when he hears that the local casino had almost eight millions francs in the safe before the Grand Prix, he ignores his previous bad luck with robberies and sets about planning to steal the lot and get away clean.Shown recently on FilmFour (the free cable station that does show some good film now and again), this film was screened as part of demonstrating to modern viewers that caper movies and "jobs gone wrong" are not new genres that Hollywood has a dominance over. In this claim we see this film which does feature many of the stalwarts of the genre in its sympathetic criminals, cop/criminal friendships, well planned jobs going bad and so on. The delivery is a nice homage to the gritty cities of American noir but yet mixed with a sense of the New Wave of French cinema that sees it lacking the polish and shine of your Oceans 11 etc. The outcome is an amusing and engaging little caper film that moves along well enough with a good consistent air while also moving into darker territory at times.It is not perfect and I personally do not see it as the classic that many others claim it to be but I did find it enjoyable. Melville's direction and writing is the main part of this working as he creates this world and characters with seeming ease. The film looks great and the camera moves well around the sets and locations, providing a real feel for this life and the places. The dialogue is engaging and allows the cast to gives solid performances even if they perhaps don't have very detailed characters. Duchesne is the heart of the film and he is cool without being untouchable; a sturdy man you do, like a professional reviewer noted, feel like his character is not doing the robbery to get the cash so much as have the chance of pulling it off in a dinner jacket. Cauchy is less of a presence but works well with his na?ve character. Corey is a joy. Not only beautiful and light but effortlessly carries off that unique uncaring sexuality that (stereotypically) make French women so appealing and also such hard work. Decomble, Cerval, Buhr and others all provide solid support.Overall then, not the classic that some would have you believe and I do think that it being French helps with the mystic that some modern viewers give it. However it is still an enjoyable crime caper film with an atmospheric yet light hearted delivery that works well even as the material gets a bit more serious. Plus, in fairness, it is very chic and cool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melville's heist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people credit Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer or Truffaut with beginning the French New Wave, but they'd be the first to tip their hats to Jean Pierre Melville (Godard gave Melville a cameo in "Breathless"), who seems to have kicked off the New Wavers' preoccupation with crime films with "Bob the Gambler", a film made a good four years before the other upstarts began even contemplating their first features."Bob The Gambler" stars Roger Duchesne as Bob, an elderly criminal who oozes cool. He's the classic romantic loner, respected by police and perps alike.Melville shuns Bob's flaws and seems content to romanticise the gambler's criminal life. Bob is getting on in years and has lots of wisdom to offer. He also has his own personal code, refusing, for example, to loan money to a close friend (Paulie) solely because the guy beats his wife.Later in the film, when a friend approaches Bob and Paulie with a chance to rob the Deauville Casino, Bob quickly jumps at the opportunity. He's a gambler at heart, after all, and the risk appeals to him.Unfortunately, the one bit of wisdom Bob can't teach Paulie is never to squawk to a dame. Paulie thus falls for an alluring young woman and tells her all about the gig. In typical noir fashion, she spills the beans and the heist gets ruined. End of story.Thematically, there's nothing new here. The characters and plot, while watchable, have been rehashed by countless other films and TV shows. The ageing gangster. The righteous criminal. The last heist. The cocky upstart. The girl who ruins the heist. Noir fate as gambling. We've seen it all before. But Melville's film was nevertheless one of the first to set in stone the conventions of the genre. Beyond this, his lead character draws us in, his film's heist is engaging and his film fades out with a classic final line.7.9/10 - Though not as good as "Rififi", "The Killing" or "Asphalt Jungle", this is nevertheless a classic of the genre. See "Man on the Wire" and "The Good Thief". Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bob le flambeur" was probably the most influential of Jean-Pierre Melville's auteur cinema. It was an innovative and independent film made on a low budget. Influenced by American motion pictures, Melville was pivotal for the French New Wave. Hence, there's a lot of history to this little B-movie.It's set in Montmartre, Paris--home of Bob Montagné (played by Roger Duchesne). Bob is a high roller, a compulsive gambler. But after cleaning out, he decides to heist a Deuville casino. Bob is a gentleman hood; he wears a suit and tie, a trench coat and hat. He's "an old young man"--a grizzled, old school ex-convict, whose cool lack of concern for his own faults leads him astray again. Duchesne fits into this role with ease; he conveys more with facial expressions than he ever says with words. I also enjoyed Guy Decomble's performance as Inspector Ledru, who has been friends with Bob ever since Bob saved his life. In a film where almost every shot has someone smoking, Decomble's smoking is the most artifice; he carries on a conversation with a cigarette in his mouth as if it's a sucker. It's a good film noir, yet it's still a B-movie--awkward and deficient. The plot and character development were wanting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this with an open mind and was (early on) happy to see my beloved France (Montmartre) in the 50's. I was interested in the prosaic live-and-let-live attitude of the early reels, in which Bob talks a young gal into moving into his place but extracts no favor from her. But as it turned into a heist film I became less interested and jumped over at least three chapters near the end. I find the "heist film" genre to be dead on arrival. There isn't one of them that I like. They range from "merely bad" to "execrable."Like noir, this depicts a protagonist moving through an immoral underworld but nonetheless Bob's personal moral code is unveiled over the course of the movie. Rather than the usual noir implication of a jaded world view and a world that responds in kind, this exists as a chauvinist world view. Ostensibly it's about a casino heist, but it implicates a world of p-whipped guys with crap self-esteem who get jerked around by greedy or dumb women. The women vary from simp to retch, with no femme fatale to speak of; just women who've gone numb or feral over their social cages. Every last one of my guy friends are under the thumb of their wives like this to a greater or lesser degree. It isn't pretty."Bob" has the same deliberation and fatalism of Le Trou. Bob's buddy Paolo's death scene is so badly overacted that it's one of the funniest things I've seen in years. I was howling.</fullReview>

The acting is decent, but I don't really expect to much in the way of acting from films of this era. The film just has this style and grace that many other films just can not capture, especially today. This is not especially a heist movie, it is more of a movie that follows a story around the heist.

		<fullReview>After I finished watching this film, I checked on the cassette to see how long it was. To my surprise the film only was 98 minutes. I could have sworn I just sat through an epic tale of at least two and a half hours. To say the least, it was a very long 98 minutes. Melville used an interesting narrative technique, which makes me think Godard used to watch his films. I also was very impressed with the way in which he made a heist film, but one where the heist was an after thought, and took up very little time of the story. Melville lets the viewer into the head and the heart of each character before throwing them out into the heist, so we feel very comfortable with them by that point. The actual heist was very disappointing, however, and the death scene was so exaggerated it was comical. Watching bits and pieces of this film would be great, as there were some great moments. Overall, however, I was not interested the majority of the time, and was very happy when the end of the movie was announced. Rating: 25/40</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob le Flambeur is only of passing interest. With the kind of high art that exists in European film, this film feels superfluous. What is its use? Is it an exploration of the crime genre? An homage? A parody? If it is any of those, it is just barely. It seemed more to me like a standard heist film with a couple of peculiarities. One of those peculiarities, the musical score, I would rate as excellent. There are a lot of neat little things to hear on the soundtrack, like the tiny bells we hear at one point when Bob flips his coin. Once in a while the editing or cinematography or direction would turn up something interesting. I like the neat downward wipe from the old woman who plops down on her chair to Bob and Anne in Bob's apartment. Some of the camera angles were great. I liked the scene with Bob in his triangular kitchen.What Bob le Flambeur lacks, though, is any characters with whom to identify. None of them are well developed. The film actually has a pretty good first act. When I first met the characters, I liked them. But they never went anywhere. Bob, who is, of course, the main character, is given a somewhat built-up past, but his present character and his motivations were, to me, often vague. Whatever character I saw in him I must have, as I later (during the film) realized, inferred from other films that are either very similar or directly referencing this film. Polo should have been more well developed. He had no real history, and his actions seemed to do nothing in the way of his development, but rather were only useful for the advancement of the plot. Likewise Anne. She provided the best hook, since the actress who plays her is very beautiful, but her character is little more than a plot device. The little character that she had was squandered. Her situation seemed interesting, but it never went anywhere. All the other characters were more or less unmemorable. The detective was somewhat interesting, but I never got enough information to feel anything about him.Two other films were constantly swimming in my mind as I grew more and more bored during this film: Stanley Kubrick's The Killing and P.T. Anderson's Hard Eight. The Killing is one of Kubrick's least interesting films for precisely the same reasons that I dislike Bob le Flambeur: it is stuck in the genre of the heist flick, and comes nowhere near passing the boundaries that its genre sets up for it. The heist flick is actually more of a sub-genre, and the more "sub" you get, the fewer variations there are. I was sure all through the film that The Killing was made before Bob le Flambeur, but it actually came out a year later. Either it takes a lot from Bob le Flambeur or I am right: heist flicks have no ability for variation. The jury is still out on P.T. Anderson. All three of his films, Hard Eight, Boogie Night, and Magnolia seemed great when I first saw them, but they feel weaker every time I think about them. My opinion on the quality of each of his films changes often, and my opinion on which one is most valuable changes, too. Hard Eight may be his best film. I did not realize, though I should have assumed, that its plot was stolen from somewhere else. And that somewhere else happens to be Bob le Flambeur. It doesn't steal everything, though. In fact, I think the argument can be made that what is taken from Bob le Flambeur is actually improved in Hard Eight. Hard Eight contains a lot of the same elements of Bob le Flambeur's first act: a gangster whose age has demoted him to mere gambler has a young protégé. A young woman who is or is about to become a prostitute comes into their life, beginning to flirt with the older of the two, but ultimately "given" to the younger by the mentor. Also, there is a hot-shot young hood who tries to sell the older man out. This plot line occurs at the beginning of Bob le Flambeur and does not develop past the point where it effects the plot. Hard Eight does something a lot more interesting. In both films, the young woman and man make grave errors. In Hard Eight, these errors help strengthen the relationship of the young couple.</fullReview>
