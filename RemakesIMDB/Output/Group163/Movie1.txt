		<shortDescription>Drastically underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After bizarre attacks on a Japanese freighter, first the French then the U.S. learn of the existence of an apparent modern "dinosaur". When it's suspected that radiation from nuclear weapons testing in French Polynesia may have instead produced the monster, biological radiation specialist Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is called to the scene. While investigating the monster's path of destruction, a new sighting arrives--just off the coast of New York City! It's no secret that Godzilla has been much maligned. Even Fangoria editor Tony Timpone stated in an editorial that he thought it sucked, and he's usually willing to give movies the benefit of the doubt. The reasons why director Roland Emmerich's version of Godzilla is hated are as varied as people stating opinions. But I tend to think that there is also a strong bandwagon effect with this film that will be tempered by time. There are already signs of a number of people giving it a second look and lessening the severity of their criticism.The chief complaint seems to come from a very vocal but relatively small crowd of fanboy purists--they dislike that Godzilla is different here. In the Japanese films, made by the Toho production company, Godzilla is a guy in a rubber suit who stomps on models of buildings and such. He tends to lumber, as irrelevant military attacks on him provide pretty fireworks. Most Godzilla films feature him fighting some other monster, "professional wrestling" style, and Godzilla arbitrarily falls down and gets back up as he is attacked and attacks with various "death rays" from his mouth, eyes, etc. Now that might sound like I don't like the typical Godzilla film, but that's not true. I like them quite a bit, but a big part of the reason why is that most of them are very cheesy. I'm a fan of bizarre cheese/camp, and you get tons of that in Godzilla films.But I'm not a purist. To me, there's no good reason why Emmerich's Godzilla needs to be similar to the Toho incarnations, which in fact are often quite different from and inconsistent with each other, too. At this point, I see Godzilla more as a recurring character type--think of the various instantiations of Dracula or Frankenstein throughout the 20th Century. The Toho films can't really be seen as chapters in a single, long story. But whether their arguments are wrong or not, the fanboy purists are at least noisy and prolific, and too many people are followers.If Emmerich would have given us a guy in a rubber suit, acting just like the Toho Godzillas (not "Godzilla"), with the typical gobbledy-gook of a Toho script, this film would have bombed even worse (if we can call a 100 million dollar film that made a profit a "bomb") and the fanboys would have still found something to complain about. Even though I love the Toho Godzilla films, too, we can't deny that they do not tend to be bestsellers on video in the U.S., despite the fact that they're readily available for purchase.So what Emmerich gives us instead is an epic, expensive-looking film that spans a number of genres, features more coherent dialogue and subplots than a typical Toho Godzilla film, and showcases a redesigned, mostly cgi cast of monsters, where Godzilla looks and behaves much more like a "real" giant, mutant lizard. For those of us who are not purists, who do not care if our opinions match the majority, and who evaluate films on all or their technical and artistic levels, it's difficult to deny that Godzilla has many merits.For example, the cinematography in this film is gorgeous. The sound design is superb and the soundtrack (score and songs) works well with the film. All of the action sequences, and they comprise a large percentage of the film, are expertly staged--Emmerich doesn't resort to darkness, blur-cams and overly quick cuts like many other directors. It's always easy to follow the narrative during action scenes, it's always easy to see what's going on, and it's always coherent. That goes for the non-action scenes, too--the entire film is ingeniously designed in terms of the progression from one sequence to another. Also, the cgi is amazing--it's often difficult to tell where it stops and mechanicals/models begin.But the story is great, too. Broderick's Tatopoulos is an attractive anti-hero, a nerdish scientist who solve dilemmas with his professional knowledge. The other hero is Jean Reno as Philippe Roache, a humorously enigmatic French "insurance agent". The obligatory romantic subplot, involving Tatopoulos and Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) surprisingly avoids clichés, and Timmonds provides a launching pad for an all-too-honest satire of the media.Satire is high up on Emmerich's agenda. Godzilla not only satirizes the media, but the military, New York/New Yorkers, film critics, and even monster movies. While the film is simultaneously giving us a lot of genres--sci-fi, horror, adventure, war film, drama, etc. the most unexpected motif is the almost cartoonish, spoof-like humor. Godzilla is more frequently laugh-out-loud funny that anyone expected it to be. It's not just one-liners and overt jokes, although those are certainly present, but the amped up intentional absurdity of situations such as the final taxi cab "chase".Even if you think that Godzilla has some internal problems as an artwork (and I agree that there is a slight clunkiness in parts of the narrative flow--it caused me to subtract a point), there's no way it deserves the trashing it's received so far. This is at least a well-made film on a technical level, and if you have any taste for slightly campy sci-fi/monster flicks, you should find much to enjoy here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I've had enough. Godzilla was a GREAT movie, and I'm just sick and tired of all the critics and others who view the movie as a complete disaster due to its lack of a story and other problems.Personally, I don't care. The movie, from day one was meant to be just a big effects laden action movie. It's just for fun. I understood the story. The movie should just be viewed as a fun, blow everything up in your way movie. Don't be so hard. Sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

You have to appreciate the work that went into making this creature look so lifelike. This movie had spectacular special effects and a pretty decent story line. I thought this movie was great. I didn't find the acting to be all that bad. I would recommend watching this movie before you come to any conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the first "scary" movies I saw; a cherished childhood memory, actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really do, genuinely enjoy Godzilla. I have watched it on numerous occasions for a long time now and I always think it is an incredibly fun and entertaining movie. The first time I watched it though was when I was around four years young. It was one of the first, as I called it then, scary movies I watched.I actually will never find the strength to call this film horrible, even though my opinions on it have of course lowered a lot over time, because I watched it when I was so little, and I thought it was the best movie ever. This film is still really enjoyable, because it's value doesn't decrease as much as the person who watches it entertainment does, but it still sickens me to know it has such a low rating and many look down on it, while really it should receive more appreciation.I might have lowered my opinions on this film, but it is still a pleasing film that does not deserve the rating it has. I didn't see much of anything wrong with it, even now, and I just thought it was suspenseful and exciting, somewhat more suspenseful than a lot of other movies that have been made, with a lot of fun performances and excellent CGI. Godzilla, yet classified as a horror\suspense, was actually a touching film and was sad in some parts, as well. I will never understand how someone could hate a film that's just meant to be all around fun and enjoyment. It is still my favorite out of the original and newest remake.Two thumbs up for Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Size DOES Matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been almost five years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you, when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't dissapointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people (and Godzilla fans) that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's "Godzilla".There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' atleast, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you, you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about, afterall.And what was wrong with the monster itself, Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in alot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being a laugh-fest at the theaters.What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original, that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts, but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got alot of attention, unfortunately, and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy this film.This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects, there's nothing quite like it.So take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as "GODZILLA".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this was fun. I don't know why people whine about it so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, being a longtime fan of the GODZILLA/GOJIRA films as a youngster, I remember seeing this with great anticipation. I, unlike a lot of people, was not at all disappointed. This film was exactly what I was hoping it would be at the time. Sure, it certainly wasn't as charming or as funny as the films I loved as a kid, but it was a lot of fun. I loved the action scenes, the look of the monster was crazy to me, and the plot was simple enough for a first time viewer to get right into. Seeing it again 10 years later, I had the same reaction. My opinion of this film hasn't changed one bit. I guess everybody's complaints stem from how this has no charm or any kind of attempt at being cute or original. I guess that's understandable, but I still don't see what everybody's problem is. This was supposed to be a fun, exciting, and action packed thrill ride. That's all it is, no more, no less. I personally think that it succeeds at what it achieved to be perfectly. Matthew Broderick may not exactly be an action hero, but his character sure was quirky and funny. Jean Reno was as good as usual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don`t know what people expected from this movie. High drama, perhaps Shakespearean dialog. This is an all out action movie that deserves way better reviews than it got. This movie could have been horrible, but the characters were pretty well fleshed for a movie of this type, and the makers actually went for the pathos angle with the creature. Rather than make Godzilla a giant monster, they gave the creature a personality with its behaviour, a personality that can best be seen at the Madison Square Garden explosion. For anyone to not find that scene poignant, they must be heartless. Add to this the great acting, and the "scientific" explanations (which was more than Independence Day ever managed) and this is a grossly under-rated movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the other comments about this film, and while I might agree with them from a critical point of view, the fact remains that this movie was NEVER meant to be a critic's favorite! We are not talking Oscar-material here, not even for special effects. OK, so it's nothing like the originals, and it has a skimpy little plot and no cinematic depth. But y'know what--WHO CARES! I went to this movie to be entertained, and I wasn't disappointed. It's loud, it's quasi-scary, it had explosions and giant lizards, it had cheesy characters with cheesy names and all sorts of good stuff you expect from a fun, no-brainer movie. C'mon, were its predecessors any better? No sex, no graphic violence (unless you count the poor thing's demise at the end), minimal profanity--I was able to take my daughter to see it and not be embarrassed! Today you can pop it in your DVD player or VCR on a rainy Saturday, make some microwave popcorn (just keep your pet lizard away from it!) and kill about 90 minutes with the family. The only part I had a problem with was, they made the beasty so personable, so NICE (it never INTENTIONALLY kills anyone, y'know), I couldn't help but feel sorry for it when it died at the end. They even gave it KIDS, for Pete's sake! As a fellow parent, I actually sympathized when it found out "they trashed the Garden". I was hoping for a sequel with the hatching egg at the end, but sad to say, that got scrapped. Anyway, my final word is: Get over it, folks! It wasn't MEANT to be taken seriously! Once you get past that, you can enjoy it for the cheap theme-park-ride it was meant to be. I love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What were some of you expecting? Shakespeare? Tennesee Williams? Its a movie about a giant lizard in New York - just accept it for what it is! Its entertainment and no more - and on that level (at least for me) it works just fine! Its's not "realistic" enough? Again, how realistic is a giant lizard supposed to be? It's a FANTASY movie! Besides, I thought the special effects were pretty impressive! And its not as if the ORIGINAL Godzilla movies were good, with their actors in rubber suits and laughable, ridiculous "monsters" (gamera, mechagodzilla, etc etc)- the Godzilla in THIS movie was an animal, not a monster driven by a need to destroy things! I didn't think Matthew Broderick was bad at all - although I DID find Animal's girlfriend extremely irritating with her shrill voice! Really, I didn't think this movie was bad at all - no, its not a profound meaningful work or art, but then who expected it to be? It's an enjoyable diversion - that's all anyone should expect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was wrong with this movie? Absolutely Nothing! This is the best Godzilla movie ever. The other ones was a MST3K movie. They are bad. But this one. I LOVE IT. The special effects are out of this world. Now Godzilla 2000, I do not know if I am going to like it because it looks like the old Godzilla. We just have to wait and see. Now, I heard people say "Animals would not (also cannot) duck." They are absolutely wrong. Animals can duck. Now if you see a missile or a bullet heading your way, would not duck? Yes you would. (I do not know about some people but I would.) I would recommend this movie to anybody how loves movies, action, and adventure, and drama. And for someone who loves to watch special effects.

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was still in high school and I was interested in watching the old Japanese Godzilla (a guy in a lizard suit used over and over again). Because of that, I didn't have very high expectations for it, but that was before I learned to treat movies as their own stories. Now, as I watch this movie again (at about the first time Godzilla takes the large batch of fish), I find that the movie is a very good attempt at story telling.However, after watching it with a friend in college, a friend who lived in New York for much of his earlier life, I learned a few things about the movie that makes me think that it's one very well written continuity error.It seems to me that the writers tried to make New York a very fictional place, either that or perhaps some of them had never even been to the City that Never Sleeps. One example of this would be the layout of the city itself, like when the helicopters are chasing the big guy between the buildings. The city looked more like a maze rather than the grid of buildings that it really is. Perhaps the writers and miniature set designers did this on purpose to give the helicopters a sense of dread should they get lost. New York, after all, is a very big place where anyone can lose their way if they're not careful.Another part would be when Godzilla jumps into the Hudson river and encounters the two or three nuclear submarines ready to blast it with torpedoes. It depicts the river as being as deep as parts of the Atlantic when in reality, it's actually only about 15 feet deep. Don't get me wrong, it's a cool idea, especially since the Japanese Godzilla always emerged from the depths of the ocean. Perhaps it was to make him feel more at home, or to show his true amphibious nature by swimming through the river like an eel.Then, there's the final scene where Godzilla's chasing our heroes over the Brooklyn Bridge. I'm not sure whether the big guy actually weighs less than he looks or not, but anything that big would have done more damage to the bridge than just shaking it around a bit. One step on the Brooklyn Bridge by that thing would have torn it apart. I can understand though that it would be the only thing that could tangle it up for the F-18's to shoot it dead, but a more realistic method of entanglement would be for it to run down the river and slam into it like a tennis court net. But then again, just the fact that they maid the river about a league deep would make it hard for it to run along it.Godzilla's size comes into perspective once again when our heroes find the nest in Madison Square Garden where the big guy's laid his eggs. I know the place is big, but there is no way he could fit perfectly into the basket ball arena without doing anything more than ripping the floor out. The ceiling and roof would have been completely demolished and the halls would have been smashed through.Keep in mind folks that this is the point of view of someone who's only seen New York through one form of media or the other, so if there's anything anyone wants to add to the list of errors, than just submit them to my account.In all fairness, I still find this to be a good attempt at story telling. I hold to my rating of 8/10 for writing and production, but only a 2/10 for continuity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot does matter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie proves several things: there is no sure thing in life, many very stupid people work in Hollywood, and plot does matter. "Godzilla" was supposed to be the monster hit of 1998, overwhelming audiences with its hype and special effects. But when word got around, it's no surprise that it was quickly forgotten (or at the very least, people TRIED to forget it). The story is a carbon copy of thousands of past movies, the characters are one dimensional cardboard cut outs, the dialogue is completly ludicrous, and the special effects aren't very special. There are only two, slightly original elements of this story: Godzilla shows up in NYC, and it's pregnant. Neither of these is enough to carrying this overblown movie though, especially the NYC angle, which is spoiled because it appears they shot this movie during the monsoon season. Avoid this one if at all possible and rent the original instead; at least its camp is somewhat entertaining, while the remake just disappoints.</fullReview>

He certainly part ironic, comic, the environments are very well linked to those of fantascientific and the result can be considered as satisfactory. It is a shame that here there are elements that bring more than 7 film ridiculous as the army of darkness and films such as van helsing a miserable 5. Shame! I disagree with the standards is happening here, I am not convinced. In some cases there are good reviews, in other see that there are some 'too many prejudices against certain films!

		<shortDescription>Truly Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vaguely remember watching this movie in 1998 when I was still in high school, and even as a kid back then I thought it was awful. It came on two nights ago so I figured 16 years has passed so why not watch it with a more critical eye. From the very beginning when Broderick was approached by the identified men in the helicopter and transported to the Philippines, I lost interest. The men in the helicopter were supposed to be mysterious and authoritative and coercive, instead they looked like 2 badly dressed Hench men. Broderick is shown the initial footprint made by Godzilla and it looks like a colossal lizard foot print, then they fly over a trail of other footprints that look like they were made by a chicken? 0_0 All the characters sounded and acted the same; like a bunch of bumbling idiots. I felt like I was watching an episode of the Three Stooges. Maria Pitillo was the worst offender; she was the dumb, vapid blond who always had this look on her face like she was constipated. Behold Godzilla reveals himself and he is a T Rex? Wait a sec now I'm watching Jurassic Park? You're telling whoever is responsible for the CGI could not come up with a more original looking creature? This mess of a movie is not even suitable for TV. It was unoriginal, uninteresting and uninspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie that is how it should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is amazing. I honestly don't like much the original Godzilla movies, because the creature is presented as apparently unreal. My view of Godzilla is, that it's real animal. Some people maybe wanted to have laser eyes and other robot like stuff. Personally I don't understand that. This creature is amazing animal with personality, spirit and intention. I like big animals and this is my favorite one. I like how Godzillas creation is scientifically explained. Another thing I like about this film is, that it doesn't have just one main plot but there's three of them. One interesting thing shown in this movie is approach of the humans. It's basically "We want to control everything or if not, than destroy it." Which is shame. The special effects are amazing Godzilla really behaves and look like real creature. I like what is happening in the whole film, but the end feels sad to me. As I mentioned before Godzilla had intention which was never bad. It never killed anyone intentionally unless it was in self defence. So I can rate it only with 10 stars. I thing that director achieved perfectly what he wanted and what I wanted to see. It's strongly underrated (firstly when I went to IMDb i thought that it would be among best 200) so don't let the rating avert you from this film. Just look at the rating of other people here. It's mostly from 8 to 10 stars or look at the awards it have. Only first 2 from Razzie Awards was bad, but there are many more which are positive. Godzilla is one of my heart movies. It's interesting, that after release, everyone was like it's bad but as time went, it started having good ratings. People just expected something else, but after some time, they started to look as it meant to be. So don't do same mistake as the others did, watch it for what it is, not what it should be (for others). I doesn't see it as a sequel. I see it as new completely separated movie. There's one thing that sucks. Creators meant to create 2 sequels of this movie which was scratched after bad reviews after it's release. Which is really shame, because it deserves sequel and I would be eager to see it. So at least I have this one. So thanks to everyone who made bad critique for this movie (for Sheldon from Big Bang Theory this is sarcasm). Only thing I'm left with is, that they would change their mind and create the sequel which they meant to create.It's always nice to sit and spend time watching this movie.Thanks for reading this review. I hope it was helpful :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emmerichs best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla is an underrated film. It is directed by Roland Emmerich the man behind mediocre space adventures stargate and Independece day. Some people say Godzilla is his worst film to date well let me start by saying its a hell of a lot better than either of those two. The story is Nuclear tests have happened in France and the radio activity has come of on some of the Lizards inhabiting the islands. Fast forward some twenty years and we learn that a giant dinosaur creature is attacking boats around the globe. It comes to Manhatten were it wrecks havoc and there are quite a few fun sequences along the way. Thats all I will say its vague but I hate spoiling movies. The creature looks cool indeed and 90% of the time the visual effects are of a very high standard. The story is solid if a little simple, but at least it ain't covuluted a la stargate. The acting is a mixed bag however with Hank Azaria and Jean Reno in fine form while Matthew Broderik and Maria Pitillo putting in appalling performances. Some of the characters are unnecessary and annoying such as Harry Shearers Charles Caimen and some of the military guys. The finale is great and the film is on a par with the previous years equally underrated The Lost World Jurassic Park. Its a good movie for kids as it never gets to scary and always remains entertaining, but it also works for adults as Saturday night entertainment. Well I enjoyed it anyway, so sit back don't take it to seriously and you to might find yourself enjoying it to</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally unrealistic movie..!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some friends of mine were discussing why they didn't like some movies. They complained about people being morons to see that kind of crap! Well apparently they saw those movies too so I take it they're morons too? Hehe.. And c'mon.. Movies are an escape from reality for an hour or two.. Do you expect everything to be "realistic"?It reminds me of when I saw Godzilla (1998).. There was a guy in front of me with his (never to be his) girlfriend, on what I assume was their first (and hopefully last) date. He complained and moaned about how unrealistic this piece of crap was. Yes, I do agree; a big lizard eating New York is as silly as believing that the World trade centers (and building 7) went down without controlled demolitions (but that's another story)..But I couldn't help my self from mocking him on the way out as he continued to complain to the poor girl about how unrealistic it was by adding: "For an example, do you really think Godzilla could dodge those missiles..?"Let me get this right.. He accepts that a lizard mutates from nuclear experiments. He believes that it swam to New York. He accepts that she laid eggs even though there was no Mr. Godzilla. He also could cope with the friggin' thing running around and eat chunks of the Big Apple.. But when she dodges some missiles he reacts..!? Unbelievable..So when you see a movie, don't believe it, enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the blockbuster films that are critically condemned by the media, this is one of few that I personally enjoyed. In fact, I don't really understand why people DON'T like this film, other than those original Godzilla fans who were hoping for something more in the vein of the original movies.If you just take this film for what it is, you find an engrossing (yet simplistic) storyline, IMO some rather strong acting from all the regulars, a good soundtrack, strong final chapter (although pos a bit too long) and some clever dialogue at times. If you want to condemn Jurassic Park 2 or Independance Day, find with me (they are pretty crap), but Godzilla is a thoroughly enjoyable film, enjoy it for what it is, not what it could/might have been.Cheers, Andy Ydna</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ouch. I show up at the theater, innocently expecting a movie about a big lizard running around eating people. Unfortunately, I get a movie about a bunch of poorly-written characters trying to deal with Godzilla. Come on, Godzilla is who we all came to see, not a bunch of pathetic characters! The damsel in distress flops her way through every scene, amazing me with exactly how little energy she can have. I don't even see Godzilla until about an hour or so into the film (yes, I know, that was a marketing ploy for the commercials to make people want to see the movie, but once you're in the theater, they've kind of got you), and I'm in serious pain from the gargantuan plot holes. Godzilla leaves his/her home in the middle of the Pacific, swims through the Panama Canal and around Florida to New York because that was the most convenient place to lay eggs??? Matthew Broderick is brought to the group because he specializes in mutations caused by radiation, but when he suggests that Godzilla is perhaps (this is a shocker) an animal mutated by radiation, everyone acts shocked and thinks he's crazy! What??? This movie is just so horrible until the end, so my suggestion to anyone who hasn't seen it is to show up with only a half hour left in the movie. That's the only possible way I can see someone enjoying Godzilla.</fullReview>

And Spielberg (in most of his films) did the whole open mouth look of awe to death, but we get even more of it here, at least they stole from a good director. The indestructible (almost) taxicab was such a leap of faith that, well, I can think of no adjectives to even barely describe it. If Ed Wood had a hundred million dollars this is what he would have made. Without a doubt a strong contender for worst movie ever. See it only if you have time to kill.

		<fullReview>This is in fact a really decent movie in my opinion. Sure the human characters can be annoying at time,that doesn't mean it is a bad flick. Now that doesn't mean I like the movie, it is decent but think to yourself, what is really wrong with this movie?- Follows more on Jurassic Park then Godzilla - Rain Overdose - Annoying Human Characters - And much more.The reason why a lot of Godzilla fans hate this movie, is not for the reasons above, it is just the fact that is called "Godzilla". If it was renamed something else (or renamed 'Zilla' to 'keep' it in the Godzilla Movie Family) then this movie wouldn't be as hated. But still if you are able to push the flaws somewhere else and tell your brain that this isn't a Godzilla movie, then I encourage you to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cinematic Junk Food.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1998, Godzilla got an American make-over by "Independence Day" director Roland Emmerich and audiences haven't stopped complaining since. Rather than make the atypical Godzilla film, Emmerich and his co-conspirator Dean Devlin took the "Jurassic Park" approach and turned the mega-monster into a really, really big T-Rex and instead of using aliens, bad weather or the apocalypse as an excuse to destroy a city, decided it would be best to watch the beast all but devour Manhattan. In the rain.The first thing that will likely hit you upon your first viewing of "Godzilla" is "well, that wasn't so bad," but then you come to the ultimate conclusion that, well, it wasn't as good as it could have been, either. Emmerich, who surely knows how to turn out an entertaining popcorn flick (often at the expense of logic and character development) puts on a good show here, with solid special effects, fun chase scenes and lots of lots of destruction. Matthew Broderick takes the lead as a scientist brought in by the military to try and tame the savage beast. For the most part, the film works, but where it really falls apart is in some of its atrocious acting (Maria Patillo, I'm looking at you) drawn-out plot and it's seemingy endless series of endings. Seriously, the movie feels like it's over once it hits the hour and fifty minute mark, but intead overstays its welcome by becoming more ridiculous by the moment and not knowing when to stop.Perhaps a better editor could have tightened up the film and made it more enjoyable to the end. Hell, one can't imagine why Columbia Tri-Star didn't step in and take it down a notch, when most other studios are all too eager to trim big and bloated block-busters. Given the time and the patience, and with the right mindset (more specifically -- the mindset that is earned by checking your brain at the door) "Godzilla" is an overall entertaining film with its redeeming moments, but is perhaps one that could never live up to all the hype.On a side note, the film's famous ad-campaign featured the tagline: "Size Does Matter." Well, in spite of the innuendo, the film certainly supports that theory by proving that a film too big and too long simply doesn't cut it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 20 foot giant lizard can disappear in New York City?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla, one of the major monster classics that we all know and love, mainly of course with the old badly dubbed Japenese films. As badly made those films were, they were still incredibly fun because of all the camp. It was just a good time to watch those movies and Godzilla was just freaky looking and scared the heck out of you. So naturally the men who created the big time special effects movies like Independence Day and Stargate would naturally try and re-create the gigantic lizard and you guessed it, put him in today's New York City. Now who are we going to rely on to save us? Arnold Schwartzenegger, Syvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Jackie Chan? Nope, Ferris Bueller, er, I mean Matthew Broderick. He plays a nerd in this movie, so who better to save us? Godzilla is barely recongnizable as he is just a CGI love fest where it seems that the creators were not even close to what Godzilla really looked like in the old films. Oh, this was a bad movie.A Japanese fishing ship is attacked by an unseen, giant monster that attacks from below the water: only one sailor survives. Traumatized, he is questioned in a hospital by a French scientist as to what he saw. His only reply is Godzilla. Dr. Nick Tatopoulos, an NRC scientist, researching the effects of radiation on earth worms, is interrupted by the arrival of an agent of the U.S. State Department. He is sent to Panama, escorted by the military, to observe the wreckage of the recovered Japanese fishing ship and a set of massive dinosaur-like footprints in the grassy soil. The Frenchman is also there, observing the scene and introduces himself as an insurance agent. Aboard a military aircraft, Tatopolous identifies skin samples he recovered as belonging to an animal "unknown to science". He dismisses the military's theory that the creature is a reawakened dinosaur, theorising that its origins in French Polynesia make it a mutant created by nuclear testing. An old man is seen fishing on the dock. He takes a bite from his fishing rod, and a big wave comes toward him after a few minutes of trying to pull in his line. The big wave happens to be Godzilla, and he emerges from the dock. Godzilla then travels to Manhattan and creates havoc in the city, killing dozens of people. Godzilla is revealed to be a gigantic, bipedal lizard that towers over much of the New York skyline. The city is evacuated and the military attempt to kill Godzilla, first luring it out with a huge pile of fish (the creature's staple diet). It takes the bait, but is scared off by small arms fire, but oddly enough, it's just not working on the giant lizard.That's pretty much a good enough "summary" of the movie, there's more in the movie than that, but it's kind of pointless to mention as this movie was just pointless to make. It's just badly written, the special effects are way over the top and obvious to anyone, and the actors are just so out of place it's insane. Now is this the worst movie of all time? I wouldn't say so, but it is just a bad movie over all, I wouldn't really recommend it. Godzilla just doesn't belong in America, especially since our government is stupid enough to constantly loose a gigantic lizard in NEW YORK CITY! So I wouldn't recommend this film, it's just a stupid way of killing time, you could be doing more useful things like the dishes.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can never hate this film despite what everyone says</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I was about 6 years old and I loved dinosaurs at the time. Seeing a cool looking giant lizard walking around New York was eye candy to me. I can never hate this film because it was the film that introduced me to the king of the monsters, even though it tried to be but failed. I understand what everyone says but I feel like its my duty to try to defend this film. I'm not gonna act like its a masterpiece, its not, but it is entertaining. Is it a Godzilla film? yes. Is it good? It's watchable to say the least. Does it stand as a great Godzilla film? no. It's far from perfect but not to the point where its God awful. So I don't think its right to hate this film. I've seen plenty of other Godzilla films like Gojira 1954, Godzilla vs King Ghidorah, Godzilla Tokyo SOS, Final Wars, and when it comes out on theaters, Godzilla 2014 :3 If someone told me to write down the names of all the Godzilla films I've seen, I'd add Godzilla 1998.</fullReview>

The other actors were part of the back ground. (The actors in Independence Day were better??? Look once more that film).- "not enough blood"; "not a monster". It was amusing to see the "human" side of a "monster". I hope next time, Godzilla 2 will give you more blood- "not logical sequences"; "impossible situations"; "the President was not implicated"; "Godzilla won the helicopters and avoided the soldiers" etc No. There was no a "superman" Hero to save us from the "bad" monster. Yes, there were some foreign (French) agents operating in US soil to fight the Monster. (Pardon)Reading the rating of the film (5,1) I had decided not to see it. But one day between various films we chose to see Godzilla. All four of us ENJOYED VERY MUCH THE FILM.Last week we have seen "The Mask of Zorro". Excellent acting, very good production, "old style" adventure, very nice actors, very beautiful sets but all four of us considered Godzilla a BETTER FILM!</fullReview>

However, i'm amused that Godzilla gets such low notes, especially since it is much better than his mind numbing efforts: Independence Day (1994), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), and 2012 (2009).Godzilla fulfills its purpose, especially since it used to be a fun flick to watch in the year of its release. Not a masterpiece, it is the one you go to see, have fun and forget when you get out of the theater. There are a lot of movies that tried very hard but failed to achieve this, among them the three aforementioned titles by the same author.There might be something we're missing in comparison with Japanese original, yet the transfer to Hollywood seemed successful to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla had the Lost World Curse. It was so anticipated, that it could never have been the movie we were hoping for. Remember the previews, one entire year early, at Men in Black? The commercials at midnight on New Years Eve? The "Size Does Matter" billboards that appeared anywhere and everywhere when Summer 98 approached? What kind of movie could possibly live up to that hype? The backlash was pretty bad. Just as soon as the movie opened, there were people who were dying to see it, just so they could say 'guess what? Godzilla sucked!' Well, guess what? Godzilla didn't really suck. It wasn't the summer's biggest or best, just like Hollywood hoped, but it was still a decent monster movie. Godzilla wrecked New York City, and that's exactly what I paid my money to see, so I was pretty happy. It seems silly to include a love story, and yes, we do get Matthew Broderick as a scientist trying to re-hook-up with his ex-girlfriend, virtually the same time as he's trying to stop Godzilla. But it never slows the movie down, there's still plenty of Godzilla smashing buildings and stepping on cars and swatting helicopters. It's a good thing Devlin and Emmerich left all that stuff in. The movie ends with a shameless opening for Godzilla 2, although now there's talk of cancelling the sequel because the backlash was so loud. Well, I hope Sony does go ahead with it, because there's definitely room for improvement.</fullReview>

There are ideas lifted straight out of other films such as 'The Lost World' and the whole thing reeks of commercialization with its digs at Disney and other such companies. The wafer-thin plot is down there with the worst of the Japanese Godzilla films and the film is very over-length. The monsters here are computer-graphics, and it shows - they're just so bereft of character or realism. The big creature is barely visible through the grey skies and rain and its face, complete with Desperate Dan chin, makes it look comedic rather than frightening. The babies are just laughable and are quite obviously CGI graphics.A wasted opportunity. Even the badly-dubbed, atrociously-edited Godzilla '85 was better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most irritating movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish sci-fi/action movie producers would hire decent writers and directors; people capable of providing realistic and interesting characters. The effects in this film were somewhat satisfying and engaging, but the main characters (with the exception of Hank Azaria's character) ruined most of the scenes.Audrey, the "love interest" for Matthew Broderick's role, is perhaps one of most irritating female characters I've ever seen on film - shallow, stupid, totally lacking in judgment, and she runs like "Gloria" from Body Double; a film not known for its satisfying female characters.What's perhaps most sad, except for the fact that she miraculously manages to triumph (sort of), is that the director tried to make Audrey lovable and appealing to the audience, as a vulnerable, sweet, yet misguided woman, despite her effective ability to alienate the interest and care of most female AND male audience members. How could they not see their blunder and correct it by feeding Audrey to Godzilla at the end? I have never been to a movie wherein I eagerly joined audience members chanting "EAT HER!" We were disappointed.And why, I wonder, did they think it was a good idea to name 4 or 5 of the French characters "Jean-_____"?A recommendation to any aspiring directors: make sure the annoying characters get eaten, and if you really insist on naming 80% of your French characters Jean-something, at least have them laugh at themselves for it IN the movie - don't just hope people will notice and think its funny, because they won't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An enormous, radioactively mutated lizard runs rampant in Manhattan.This was directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich, best known for directing "Independence Day". Whether or not he is a good director is hard to say, since he spends his time helming large disaster epics that owe more to things blowing up than a serious plot and character development. This is no exception.James Berardinelli wrote, "Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-Manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind. The script isn't just 'dumbed down,' it's lobotomized. Godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone." Indeed, as much as the film was panned by audiences and critics, even earning the Golden Raspberry for worst film of 1998, it also won a positive award: the Saturn Award for special effects. So Berardinelli nails it when he points out the film's strength. That being said, effects alone can never made a film good.Roger Ebert (who is lampooned in the film) wrote, "One must carefully repress intelligent thought while watching such a film. The movie makes no sense at all except as a careless pastiche of its betters... You have to absorb such a film, not consider it. But my brain rebelled, and insisted on applying logic where it was not welcome." Well played, Ebert.</fullReview>

As an average movie-goer, I have felt entertained though having some problem with its run-time. I have seen people comparing this with some Japanese Godzilla movies, and making negative remarks. Honestly, i feel that Japanese Godzilla movies look pathetic, and make no-sense at all. Technically, American Godzilla is far superior to them. Even, i don't have a problem with characters; you can see these kinds of things in every superhero/sci-fi/disaster movies.

		<shortDescription>King of the monster movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get the flack Roland Emmerich's "Godzilla" (1998) receives. The criticisms come in two forms or a combination: (1.) Godzilla purists complain that the monster is different than the one in the classic Godzilla movies, and (2.) others complain that the film is what it is -- a story about a 200-foot tall dino-lizard attacking New York City.As far as the first point goes, so it deviates from the Japanese Godzilla, so what? The hailed 1982 version of "Conan the Barbarian" deviated a lot from (creator) Robert E. Howard's version but that didn't stop people from loving it. Or how about "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan" (1984), how faithful was that to Burrough's book? "Godzilla 1998" is an American re-interpretation, what's the big deal? Besides, the behemoth as depicted in the 1954 original "Godzilla" was actually cute. The last time I saw that film it was impossible for me to take Godzilla's attack seriously -- he was too cute! In other words, the filmmakers HAD to change the monster's look to make him more threatening-looking. As for the second point, this is a film about a giant lizard attacking a city, why would anyone expect "Ghandi"? My title blurb calls this the "king of the monster movies", and so it is! However, the tone is more akin to Indiana Jones than the ultra-serious vibe of, say, "Aliens" or "War of the Worlds". Remember the scene in "Jurassic Park" where the T-Rex chases the vehicle? "Godzilla" has a similar scene except that the monster is 200-feet high rather than 20-feet. Remember the great velociraptor scenes? "Godzilla" has similar scenes except that there are a couple hundred creatures rather than just a few. In short, "Godzilla" is like "Jurassic Park" on total overdrive. This may make it less realistic, but it's arguably more entertaining. In my opinion it is: although the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park" are great, the story isn't that compelling and the characters are weak. "Godzilla" by contrast has more drive and a better cast.Speaking of the cast, Matthew Broderick plays the likable protagonist, Maria Pitillo his wannabe-reporter girlfiend, Hank Azaria a photographer, Jean Reno a French military officer intent on destroying the monster, Kevin Dunn the American colonel in charge of the New York operations, Michael Lerner the mayor of New York and Lorry Goldman his aide. The latter two amusingly spoof Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel evidently because these critics trashed Emmerich's previous two films (and I agree that "Independence Day" was lame).Speaking of Roger Ebert, he of course gave "Godzilla" a very low rating (1.5 Stars) and criticized it like so: "Going to see "Godzilla" at the Palais of the Cannes Film Festival is like attending a satanic ritual in St. Peter's Basilica. It's a rebuke to the faith that the building represents." But isn't this the same same guy who gave 2005's "King Kong" a perfect rating? What's strange with this is, as cartoony and unrealistic as "Godzilla" is, "King Kong" is at least three times worse in this regard; in fact, it's like a live-action Road Runner cartoon (Remember that moronic brontosaurus stampede sequence? Or how about the scene where one guy shoots the big bugs off another guy with a machine gun? You can't get any more stoo-pid). And yet Ebert praises "King Kong", but "Godzilla" is supposedly a terrible film. Not only is this absurd, since "Godzilla" is the better film, but it reveals a double standard. Maybe Ebert is good buddies with Peter Jackson, who knows?Broderick and Reno shine here and the rest of the cast are effective. The weak point is the women. Maria Pitillo is a quality female protagonist, very cute, but the filmmakers don't do enough with her. Vicki Lewis plays a scientist but her role is very minor. And Arabella Field's role is even smaller (although that's not necessarily a bad thing since her character is so annoying). Needless to say, weak job on this front.The film also has an entertaining soundtrack, including some "Kashmir."FINAL SAY: "Godzilla" is just a great turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast flick. It has the fun air of Indiana Jones and The Mummy films. It takes the concept of a giant monster attacking a city and goes totally over-the-top, but not to the ridiculous extent of Jackson's "King Kong" cartoon. Lastly, if you think the only menace to the city is the 200-foot tall creature, you're wrong! The film runs 139 minutes.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is absurd! This was one hell of a movie and it doesn't deserve anything less than 7 stars.I remember watching this film as a kid on a VCR. I loved it very much even then. Ever since its been on TV several times but now I finally got a DVD and saw it all over again. It still is amazing! First of all this was one of the better films of Roland Emmerich. I've seen most of his other ridiculous films like 2012 and The Day after Tomorrow. Compared to those, this one's a masterpiece. I've seen the Japanese versions of Godzilla films as well and Apart from GvsKG(1991), I didn't like the other films in the series. This American version of the monster just made more sense, as a dinosaur and as a member of Reptilia, than a toy-model of an clueless and purposeless (like it was born only to destroy Japan), erect-standing, fire-breathing, frog-leaping (Yes Godzilla leaps like a frog in some films) sorry excuse for a dinosaur. Having seen a lot of Japanese films under world-cinema, I must say their films are very good but I'm sorry to say that I find their Godzilla films just pathetic. Its like watching Super human samurai on Nickelodeon. This one, on the other hand, was an edge of the seat thriller film for all those sci-fi geeks like me and by now most of you might have seen it may be tens of times but this is me glorifying this film to those who haven't seen it. There is a 2014 version of Godzilla in the making. Hope its even better than this one. I can't wait to see that next year. Well, what do you know, time flies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judgement Day for Mr Emmerich!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to say to FUTURE WATCHERS: DON'T GO IN THERE!!!! This 'movie', in fact called "Jurassic Park 3-Spielberg-is-too-expensive-let's-try-emmerich", is the most disgusting movie I ever saw in my whole life! There is NO Godzilla to be seen in the whole movie, thus I cannot imagine the title of the film...Mr Emmerich must have read the wrong script... Well, I admit that some of the sound FX were really good, but this doesn't make a film. I waited for nearly two hours to see any Godzilla - but none did appear. The visual effects can be seen in all earlier Emmerich films combined with Titanic. Nothing new. Just boring. OK, now some facts: if you compare Emmerich's budget (about 120 million U$?) to the cost of ALL JAPANESE GOJIRA-FILMS TOGETHER, you will see, that it is less than his. But each of the original films is indescribably better than this DINO-movie... I don't like it a bit. And, as true Godzilla fan (I've seen nearly all of the films more than once), I hope that Toho Inc. will never again give the film rights away to Hollywood or anywhere else than Japan.But the worst message was that there could be some more movies done by Emmerich dealing with Godzilla. Here I can only cite from the first poster I saw last year on the net:"GOD HELP US ALL!"Amen.[lordbre@gmx.de]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Personal Review of "GODZILLA (1998)."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, let me just start of by saying this: I am NOT going to try to force others to feel the same way about this film as I do, NO. But I do have to be honest here and just come out and say it: I am seriously SICK AND TIRED of all of the negative hardcore Godzilla purist BULL HONKY that "Godzilla 1998" keeps getting! I mean, to simply say "I don't like this movie," state your valid reasons why (in a NICE and RESPECTABLE manner), and just leave it at that, I can honestly accept viewpoints like that. But what I can't accept are many hardcore Godzilla fans taking the TriStar film WAY to seriously, OVER-BLOWING their negative opinions on it to RIDICULOUS levels, and treating the movie like it shouldn't have existed. THAT I CANNOT except, and trashing a movie like this in that exact manner SERIOUSLY CANNOT BE.OK, with that said, I just want to say that I am a true fan of "Godzilla 1998" and I always will be. NOBODY is going to force me to think of this film differently, NOBODY. Now do not get me wrong, I WAS familiar with the classic Toho Godzilla and I truly LOVE the original Big G and everything that has made him a cultural icon. I like to think of Roland Emmerich's 100% American take on Godzilla (which is what it's SUPPOSED to be in the first place)as a very fun, entertaining movie that has a well-executed plot/story that actually makes sense (for me at least), very well-developed human characters that are relate-able as real people and move the narrative along, and a creature that IS a very realistic depiction of Godzilla.Now I've heard about the scientific inaccuracies related to this film, and I say that conventional scientific thinking DOES NOT APPLY AND IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO APPLY. You see, in this movie, even though Godzilla (or "Zilla" as the film's creature is now called) is a mutated marine iguana, that's just what he is, a MUTANT. He's MUTATED. Conventional scientific knowledge and facts about real-life marine iguanas honestly DOESN'T APPLY because Godzilla (a.k.a. Zilla) is a MUTANT. His entire anatomy and body structure has adjusted to suit a very different lifestyle &amp; diet. His reproductive system has also developed in a way it which it's SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT from how most other reptiles reproduce. Plus, "Zilla" has to have SOME WAY of spreading his species, so the way the movie handles it makes sense. And by the way, about the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park?" If you remember from that film, SOME of the dinosaurs TRANSFORMED THEIR GENDER AND BECAME MALES. In "Godzilla 1998," he has the ability to REPRODUCE ASEXUALLY, there's a difference between the two. Finally, the Baby Godzillas (a.k.a. Baby-Zillas) are NOT rip-offs of the "Jurassic Park" Velociraptors! They look EXACTLY like their parent, only in baby form, people! SHEESH!Now I don't know about anyone else out there, but I believe the main reason for the negative bashing from both the hardcore Godzilla fans and the critics is that people keep comparing this to the Toho Godzilla series when really, "Godzilla 1998" SHOULDN'T be compared with the latter and I don't think it's supposed to be compared with the Toho films at all. This, to me, is a 100% American, alternate universe version of the same character of Godzilla. I repeat: A 100% American, ALTERNATE UNIVERSE VERSION OF THE SAME CHARACTER OF GODZILLA. That's how I see it, and there may be folks out there who see this in a similar fashion. It's NOT supposed to be compared to the Toho films at all because when Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin set out to make "Godzilla 1998," they had it in their minds to give America IT'S OWN GODZILLA while keeping their version true to the original in some ways. For example, "Zilla (I personally call him Godzilla, but that's just me)" does have a breath weapon. I really DON'T CARE NOR SHOULD IT REALLY MATTER what exactly comes out of his mouth. In my mind, as long as something deadly comes out of his mouth, then Godzilla USA has a breath weapon just like his Toho counterpart. Also, most conventional military weapons really DON'T do any thing to stop him; they just leave tiny scratches on his body. Not even submarine torpedoes could kill him! And even though "Zilla" didn't completely destroy all of New York, he truly DID DESTROY stuff in general (vehicles, villages, boats and a fishing ship). Finally, there are plates on "Zilla's" back just like his Japanese counterpart. Should it really matter what exact shape the plates are? I say 'NO, NOT REALLY' to that. Bottom line, if this film's creature has a breath weapon, is near-invincible, and has plates on his back, then he's good enough for me as GODZILLA. Most others will disagree with me on this review, but that's truly OK. I really do respect other people's opinions on "Godzilla 1998" even though I don't agree with them. All I wanted to do here is put in my own personal two cents about this film. And while it's fan-base isn't nearly as big as the one surrounding the Toho series, TriStar's film IS loved &amp; supported by a good number of people (myself included). And really, that makes me smile!So in conclusion, I personally give "Godzilla 1998" 5 out of 5 stars in all conventional areas of film-making, cinematic storytelling, character &amp; relationship development, and action &amp; creature design/animation. So this is me, signing off. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly Godzilla but still entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge Godzilla fan, I was stoked to see this when it came out. And with the advent of the new Godzilla film with Bryan Cranston being released, I thought I'd revisit this one for nostalgia's sake. Many people complained that there was no script for this movie, but with a Godzilla or giant monster movie, I only expect the monster to wage war against mankind and destroy property while doing so, and that's what I got in this movie. The effects are great, the monster looks cool, and the reveal of it being an asexual creature that gives birth to loads of smaller "Godzillas" only adds to the fun. The whole sequence in the demolished Madison Square Garden is the best part of the movie for me. Now for the less-good things about the movie: Matthew Broderick is the scientist in the movie who is brought in to consult on the nature of the monster. His performance is, well, typical Matthew Broderick. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy when he's playing in his natural zone but that type of character doesn't really translate for a movie like Godzilla. He's too lighthearted for this. That said, his ex-girlfriend, played by Maria Pitillo, is terrible in this. She's shrill and too over-the-top and had me wishing she would get stomped by the monster. Her best friend is a waste of film also. However, Hank Azaria does a good job as the best friend's husband, who is a cameraman for the station that Pitillo works for. His humor somehow works in the movie. He plays scared in a funny way and it's welcome humor. The great Jean Reno is government agent from France who has a stake in Godzilla's appearance in New York. All-in-all, looking past Broderick, Pitillo, and her best friend, this movie is great entertainment. It's not exactly the Godzilla we've all come to know over the years but just have fun with the monster stuff and you'll be all right. P.S. I was tempted to deduct a rating point for "Mayor Ebert" and his right-hand man, "Gene," obvious clones of Siskel and Ebert, but their parts weren't big enough for me to rate the movie further down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller Versus Godzilla!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only did "Independence Day" writer &amp;director Roland Emmerich and long-time collaborator Dean Devlin reboot the Toho Company monster property Godzilla for American audiences but also they left the Japanese almost entirely out of the story. The French are responsible for conducting nuclear tests in the Pacific that mutated the reptiles living on the islands of French Polynesia. The radioactive materials changed one of them into a skyscraper tall predator that asexually reproduces itself, about twenty or more eggs at a time. The American military and the French Secret Service work hand-in-hand to defeat the eponymous reptile, but neither know that they are working the service of the other. Caught in the middle between enigmatic, undercover, French Secret Service Agent Philippe Roaché (Jan Reno) and strident U.S. Army Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn of "Transformers") are Dr. Niko "Nick" Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick of "War Games"), wannabe television news reporter Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo of "Chaplin"), and television videographer Victor 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria of "Homegrown") who are trying to survive, get a story on the humongous beast, and kill it. "Aladdin" co-scribes Ted Elliot and Terry Rosio contributed to the story that Emmerich and Devlin wrote. When Emmerich and Devlin aren't trying to make us laugh, they try to convince us that ordinary lizards could mutate as a consequence of nuclear radiation and turn into leviathans. The real-life lizards that inhabit these islands served as the prototypes for their Godzilla who barely resembles the Toho character. First, this Godzilla looks more like Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" dinos. Second, this Godzilla doesn't breathe radioactive fire. Third, Godzilla shuns Tokyo as his usual stomping grounds and plunges into the Big Apple where it lays eggs galore in Madison Square Garden. Emmerich and company weave a romance into the action with Audrey struggling to rekindle her botched romance with Nick. Nick, it seems, still loves Audrey, but she had to find herself a career before she would marry him. Not long after the military bring Nick in on their project, Audrey meets him and takes a videotape that reveals the origins of the monster. Unfortunately, the comedy undercuts the horror and Godzilla emerges as a resourceful but goofy looking creature. The showdown in New York is consistently exciting with swarms of "Blue Thunder" like attack helicopters unleashing their firepower on Big G. Ironically, in the words of the mayor, the military does more damage trying to kill Godzilla than Godzilla does. There is a clever ending, too. Broderick is ideally cast as Nick, and Azaria looks believable as a news videographer. Godzilla lurks in the background at different points and then stomps Manhattan with a vengeance. Shots of Godzilla's gigantic feet recur through this 143 minute monster epic. One amusing scene that stands out involves a little old guy who goes fishing off a pier and hooks Godzilla. Emmerich ratchets up the suspense and tension near the end of the film when our heroes find themselves trapped in a building with dozens of young Godzillas that have fed but are about to fed again. Another amusing scene has Nick turning over a gumball machine so that the dinos wind up slip-sliding away. "Godzilla" earned just shy of 400 million internationally and it is flawed but spectacular reboot that didn't kick hard enough to warrant a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very watchable compared to current releases.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it's not a particularly thoughtful or artistic film, no sane person expects it to be. It is a competently made and very watchable monster-disaster film, much more so than the voguish Cloverfield, which has stunningly bad characterisation, and a distinct lack of narrative structure. As a film, Cloverfield is woefully underwritten and the monster looks awkward and derivative of the creature in the excellent Host.The action sequences in Godzilla are far more intricately choreographed, and the monster is more convincingly rendered, which is saying a lot considering the CGI is ten years older, but then a number of modern CG films seem to trade fidelity for hyper-kinesis, so that everything is moving too fast to make out details, which is just conning the audience; there are very few money shots, like the Brachiosaur in Jurassic Park.There is a corny aspect, but it is charming, and not hopeless hokum, like 2012, which is probably the worst Emmerich film i've seen, and i've seen 10,000 BC.Like a lot of films of the mid to late nineties, there is assumption that the audience still have a respect for story, and most nineties films of this genre stand up quite well to the dross like the later Star Wars prequels, Transformers, Skyline and Clash of Titans, which have no sense of writing talent behind them, and the characters are just types.Even the effects of newer films look poor, due to aforementioned hyper-kinesis/ shaky-cam visuals.Why is it that most modern event movies are so poor on all fronts?</fullReview>

And Godzilla's got lots of them.I don't know, why do people watch a movie, if they don't like its style in advance and write later stupid reviews comparing the film to completely different ones or expecting things, which are absolutely not the part of that type of movie (like here criticizing the actors).So if you like spectacular monsterfilms, Godzilla is your film!

Godzilla's huge size was the most horrific sight. I could of course understand the story since I was young &amp; was only fond of the movie because there was the huge beast. But when saw it 7 years later in Hindi version, I completely enjoyed it. I also understood the whole story. It was marvelous. The things I liked: 1.The sinking of the fishing ship. 2.Dr. Nick singing the song:"I'm singing in the rain" 3."It's Tattopolus" 4.Godzilla's first appearance. 5.Dr. Nick standing on the footprint. 6.The climax where Philip(Mr. French) drove boldly &amp; Dr. Nick gave a nice shock in the beast's mouth. 7.O'neil's action. Roland Emmerich should be given credit for making the film a must watch. I now have DVD of the movie. I had read the subtitles from which told the quotes in no.2 &amp; 3. Movie people, please watch the film, It's great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It felt like this take on Godzilla was advertised for 2 years in advance of its actual release, every time (it seemed) I went to the cinema I was awestruck by little teaser trailers, in fact the one of the old guy fishing and hooking Zilla is a personal favourite...SIZE DOES MATTER! Love it I do. Sadly as most of us now know, the film didn't meet fans and critics expectations at all, but was the film done down by the hype and an expectation of a masterpiece for the genre?Well it didn't help that is for sure, but taking aside that problem, the film only glimpses at what might have been. It has many great points that seem to have been forgotten, so sadly we are all too aware of the film's failings on the makers behalf. The build up in the film is excellent, the makers mount the tension in steady strokes, doing what all classic monster movie makers do, they have you waiting with gripping expectation of the creature by a series of scenarios and inventive dialogue. The sound is incredible, making it an essential viewing for those who cherish home surround cinema, while some of the shots and destruction of New York are well worth the viewers time.But then? Well they throw the good work away by turning the film's focus away from the big lizard to a story line that was only fitting for the cartoon version of Godzooki. Thus rendering the film as a poor man's Jurassic Park, which quite frankly doesn't sit well. Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria all deserved better scripting, hell we all did!It's not the evil stinker some would have you believe, it does have its moments of both good and bad, it is, by definition, very much a film split down the middle. 5/10</fullReview>

Admittedly this is not one of those movies.Godzilla (1998) is a MOSTER flick. I watched this film with little expectations and was delightfully surprised. The movie brought me back to simpler times as a child when I was enthralled by moster movies. Thanks to incredible computer graphics, the monster was sleeker, smarter and more agile than those of the older generation Godzilla movies. Don't let these modern updates make you lose sight of a movie of this genre's basic plot and purpose: BIG BAD MONSTER THREATENS THE CITY- PEOPLE MUST KILL THE MONSTER LEAVING SUFFICIENT DOUBT OF ITS DEATH TO ALLOW FOR A RE-MATCH!So many people have cited a lack of a plot to this film. I'd love to know what they are talking about. Perhaps the plot was not intricate enough to satisfy them, but there certainly was one.If I may stray from this film for a moment consider that by today's standards, "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" wouldn't last past the first showing, yet I'm sure everyone reading this review has seen it and can picture the "Gil Man" in their minds eye. Consider "Frankenstein" &amp; "The Mummy", can't you just hear Boris Karloff's eerie voice saying "ankh senama"? No, these movies wouldn't hold up by today's standards yet they remain classics.If you're a monster movie fan, rent this one. It's worth the three dollars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies =]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember seeing Godzilla the first time, but it is still ONE of my favorite movies of all time. They make Godzilla MUCH more then just a crazy monster who wants to rule over the earth. All she wants to do is raise her family, she cannot help it if she is super huge. And it is obvious she loves her children for when she is dead you can see the sadness upon her expression as she looking at the humans who killed them off.It's also very heartbreaking when they finally kill her. I think they should have taken her to an unknown island so she can live peacefully.I've also seen the 'other' Godzilla movies. like the one where Godzilla is 'fighting' another creature. These movies SUCK. I mean my 6 year old nephew could make a better movie then those &gt;.&lt; Those make me SO angry. The ONLY good Godzilla movie is THIS one. All the other ones are poorly made. They should have stuck with this one and never mad the other ones I luff this movie &lt;3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who criticizes this movie as horrible, or ridiculous.. is themselves ridiculous. What could you expect from a movie about a huge walking lizard that is bigger than buildings? Why on earth would you walk into the movie thinking you were going to get reality? I cant get over my frustration with morons who constantly criticize fantasy/fiction films. GODZILLA offered exactly what all the hype said it would offer. It was a big bang action flick with a huge walking lizard. Expect "Gone With The Wind" you are just an idiot. I suspect most of the people who criticized this film really liked it, but are too jealous of somebody elses cool idea and success that they have to cut them down. Either that or they are trying to hard to be a film critic.. which is just a worthless job so why be one?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While many don't appreciate this movie, it has to be the best Godzilla movie ever. Why? The graphics are an essential part of making any movie good and this movie has what it takes. There is a good storyline and at moments, the movie is fast-paced.The acting is great. From the beginning, suspense is filled and the movie leaves you yearning for more. I've hated every other Godzilla movie because I don't like their "old" look and they seem very tense and boring. This has to be the best Godzilla movie and therefore it is a 10 compared to every other version out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; The Bad Of "Godzilla'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capitalizing on the success of the Jurassic Park films, here came Godzilla. Can it be this was out eight years ago? As often, especially with re-makes from classic films such as this '50s sci-fi one, there are a lot of "good" and "bad."THE GOOD - Great special effects with some tremendous action scenes. The story is generally interesting and I liked the characters played by Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. The strange creatures look pretty real, especially Godzilla's offspring. Despite all the violence there is no blood or gore, but I still think it's way too intense for kids and should be rated "R."THE BAD - Mostly annoying lead characters, some of which are painted as unrealistically dumb (the mayor and the sergeant). Maria Pitillo, as the lead female, is especially unlikeable and I can see why she never made it in on the big screen. The action and the noise gets to be too much, wearing out the viewer after awhile. Almost all of the last 40 minutes are pure action as the dinosaurs keep coming, one after the other after the other, even when they presumed dead. The filmmakers just don't know when to stop! Some of the chase scenes are too hokey as the people would have killed for certain. There are a couple of stupid sex remarks which serve no purpose in the film and too much usage of the Lord's name in vain, which also isn't needed. Like the King Kong re-make, it's too much action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many people, I wasn't fond of this when it was first released. Revisiting it now nearly twenty years later I can say my opinion has changed quite a bit. It's still not a great Godzilla movie, at least not how I quantify that, but it is an enjoyable "big monster movie" on its own merits. The special effects are great, the action is pretty well staged, and the music is surprisingly nice. The only real problems for me are that the cast is a little too goofy at times (I think they were going for some kind of Jurassic Park humorous/serious blend) and the movie does run a little long. Overall, though, I think it's an entertaining movie that deserves a second look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this is a dark, rainy movie that has it's issues with portraying Godzilla as a true villain. Secondly, the scale is way off in terms of humans sized up against the big lizard. The leads have a tough time of it too. There was also zero time for preview and fixes to be applied by Sony so it had to be released as it was.For me it was one true virtue, a life-saver. On September 11 I had walked down from the 101st floor, south tower to the 74th floor, south tower which was where I was when that tower was hit - 4 floors below that fireball. I briefly turned to look, decided against it and came back to the staircase when I saw a huge gasoline fed fireball expanding in the hallway. After realizing that this was BAD indeed, I looked at the staircase door. BLESS JEAN RENO for the line : RUNNING WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.So this bad movie saved my life. Not bad really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst giant monster film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I used to think that there couldn't be a bad monster movie. However low the production costs of a film, however cheesy the acting, the sight of a monster eating or killing people would always make a film great fun to watch. Of course, I felt like this back in the days before I saw abominations such as WES CRAVEN'S MIND RIPPER or METAMORPHOSIS. But I never thought that I'd be sitting in a cinema watching a multi-million pound monster movie which was utterly dire. And sad to say, GODZILLA wins the award for worst monster movie ever.I'm not talking about worst in terms of cheap special effects (hell, I love those films), there is no status attached to this film when I say that. It's just bad, and difficult to watch. I felt quite embarrassed that I was in the cinema while this played. My friend walked out halfway through and that's saying something. The worst thing was that it was summer, the hype for this film had been played up a lot and I was really looking forward to it. The trailer looked excellent. Although word on the 'net had been bad, I thought "How bad can it be? it's got a big monster in it!" Now I can look back and shake my head and think how wrong I was.The film reeks of two things: commercialism (witness the numerous references to Disney and the like) and, unfortunately, Americanism. Godzilla was created due to French nuclear testing - excuse me? The film is full of bland American jingoistic losers who walk around and smile and think they're the best. The worst offender is "pretty boy" Matthew Broderick, child star of the 1980s, who appears to think he's the best thing since sliced bread. The female lead is also bubble-headed and atrocious, no wonder blondes get a bad name. The only competent actor is Jean Reno, French star of LEON, who gives a tongue in cheek performance. We know he's not really taking this film seriously and he stands head and shoulders amid his co-stars, acting all of them off the screen at once (including Godzilla herself).As for Godzilla, there's no man in a suit this time. Instead we get state of the art computer effects which look truly horrendous. I don't want to watch a video game, I want to watch a film! Sadly, the special effects are pretty much ripped off JURASSIC PARK, so any surprise or awe we may have had when that film opened in 1993 has completely gone now, especially with so many CGI-fests filling our cinema screens. There is exactly one good scene in the film, where the heroes are stalked by lots of velociraptor-like monsters in a train station, which is effective and enjoyable to watch, but seeing as this is ripped off JURASSIC PARK too there's not a lot to commend.All in all, this atrocious rubbish proves once and for all that Godzilla should be left to the Japanese. There are no rubber-suited maniacs, no incredibly bad dubbin,g and most of all no rubber dummies falling out of windows here. If you're looking for monster movies go elsewhere; this film is an abomination and typical of the trash filling the cinemas these days. All special effects, no plot, acting or anything else. What a bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not Godzilla. On its own, the effects are really good and the story is alright, but the acting is still pretty bad. Now you may be thinking, "you're just a Godzilla fanboy! It says it in your username!" Well, I am, but just watch one of the original films and you can easily see the comparison. The atomic breath, the size, the stance. But I'm here for the review. Basically, they chase Zilla around New York until he gets stuck in the Golden Gate bridge and is SHOT DOWN BY Missiles. If you've seen the original and like the original, you might enjoy this, but not as a Godzilla film. As you may know, you cannot kill Godzilla with missiles. You can only TRY to CONTAIN him. I'm not saying that the original Godzilla films were better, but just because it was made in America doesn't make one of the best! I mean, I'm just criticizing this, but don't get butt hurt when others have other opinions. In my eyes though, this is the worst "Godzilla" movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing what Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich did with Godzilla in 1998, it almost made me lose hope for our species. You would presume, in a Roland Emmerich film, you could at least count on high end visual, but nothing in this film looks or seems remotely real. I am not a realist who demands that a given sequel, remake, prequel or reboot, must be faithful to source material, I'm not a purist in any sense of the word, Roland and Dean managed to alienate both Godzilla fans of old and new, would-be fans simultaneously. By not adhering to old lore AND replacing it typical Hollywood tropes, they've made a film that has no appeal and zero percent rewatchability. In the 1990s, this was almost as bad as it got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, some movies don't improve with time. This one was made 5 years after Jurassic Park and didn't show an improvement technically, but neither that nor faithfulness to some 60s rubber suited actor effort is what bothers me. And sometimes nostalgia actually makes you forgive and forget. I actually thought it would, and was surprise it didn't.My problem is that it's so shallow and dull. All of its flaws, technically or otherwise, would have faded if it would allow anyone to be sucked in. But instead, it reminded me of my experience in theaters - basically turning me from fan to non-fan of Reno and Broderick. That takes some effort. I can't think of anyone in the cast that I liked at all. That's pretty bad, and it's the director's fault.If you ever wanted to see a story that you can predict from the disc cover to the end scene and want to hate everyone in it and be bored by boring scenes, boring lines and boring screenplay while you're at it, this is the one.It is terrible. I mean it's a movie, it has some form of story, actors say lines, but it's just completely pointless to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I REALLY hate this movie. Not just because it's a bad movie, though it most CERTAINLY is, but because of the mindset behind it. I love monster movies, but what I DON'T love is when somebody makes a monster movie SOLELY as an excuse to watch high octane action, explosions and apocalyptic destruction. "Godzilla '98" is a movie completely devoid of a single speck of intelligence or an ounce of heart. A movie with nothing to say, no deep themes to examine, no characters that compel you or grab your attention. Nothing but a 2 hour 19 minute destruction derby complete with bad jokes and bad acting.Matthew Broderick is UNBELIEVABLY lifeless and wooden as the film's lead Niko Tatapulous. I can't even say that I hated his character because he's just so devoid of any personality or identity that I can't bring myself to feel ANY emotional connection to him, positive or negative. The rest of the cast are pretty much a bunch of tokens; the token girlfriend without a personality, the token mysterious foreign guy (In this case French) without a personality, the token slimy boss without a personality, the token stereotypical New Yorker without a personality and so on. Apart from Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert and Lorry Goldman as his assistant Gene, (Who to be perfectly honest were the ONLY source of entertainment, comedy or joy to be found in this giant Kaiju turd) all of the performances in this movie are just devoid of care, interest or emotion. Even Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer (In perhaps the only role of his career where I would genuinely consider him to be not only annoying but ungodly so) and Jean Reno can't bring an ounce of life to this garbage. I honestly feel a little sorry for them.The script is one of the most paint-by-numbers, clichéd, lifeless scripts I have EVER seen. You can predict every single plot point and every single forgettable character's uninteresting arc from beginning to end. Gee, will Niko end up getting back together with his ex? Will the military save the city from Godzilla without any major casualties? Will token ex-girlfriend quit her job after getting fed up with her slimy boss? Will Mayor Ebert end up getting fired? Will the token French guy complete his quest to find the perfect cup of coffee? If you didn't answer a groaned "Yes" to all of those questions then please...Seek help.Speaking of the script, this movie is FILLED with plot holes. There are too many to count, and it's folly to go through every single one, but here is the big one; nobody can seem to find Godzilla in New York...How?! He's a giant lizard who leaves a pretty damn obvious trail of destruction EVERYWHERE he goes. Surely you'd be getting reports of his location like crazy wherever he was.But the worst thing about this movie, the absolute WORST thing that brings this movie down to a truly special level of awful is the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla. I don't mean his design, which I actually think looked downright awesome, or even the CGI, which I also thought was really, really impressive. I mean Godzilla as a character. In a GOOD Godzilla movie, Godzilla always has some kind of deeper meaning or social commentary behind him. Whether he represents the destructive nature of mankind with their nuclear programs, or vengeful Mother Nature reigning down on mankind after their destruction of the natural world, or even as something of a guardian angel that brings hope in times of fear. Godzilla in this movie has no deeper meaning. None whatsoever. All Godzilla is in this movie is a giant CGI abomination that merely exists to blow stuff up and cause as much destruction as possible. If Michael Bay's action scenes were a character, they would be the Emmerich's Godzilla.And finally, we have the ending. Many people have commented on how ridiculous it is that Godzilla was killed by the military, and how either he'd have to escape, or be killed by another monster. Those people are 100% right. Godzilla's death is anticlimactic, unemotional, forced and the King of the Monsters ends up going out like a pansy. "Godzilla '98" can't even get the SIMPLEST things right.I don't think I've seen such a clichéd, unoriginal mess take THIS little chances in years. There is nothing to remember, nothing to entertain you and nothing to compel or grab your attention. It may not be one of the worst movies of all time, but it is certainly one of the most soulless and unintelligent. The fact that somebody who didn't even like Godzilla was hired to direct the character's very first American movie downright disgusts me. Hollywood; stop making monster movies just to show monsters and destruction. Either have a point, have a story and have characters or leave the monsters we know and love alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A guilty pleasure monster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Emmerich directed reboot of Godzilla gets a lot of venom spewed and for good reason. It's clumsy, rips off Jurassic Park and other films, has bad jokes, and just overall feels manufactured. However, I can say that I can have some enjoyment out of this movie mainly in that special guilty pleasure kind of way.Good: Destruction wise, it fits the bill. Lots of chaos is shown here and some of the effects are still pretty cool. The score has a grandiose feel to it which works as well. Like I said, the movie is really cheesy and that is where most of the entertainment value comes from. Honestly, when was the last summer blockbuster you saw where most of the cast was made up of the cast from The Simpsons?Bad: This movie has a lot of flaws. The movie rips off Jurassic Park unabashedly. All the characters are walking buffoons that talk in jokes most of the time and it always falls flat. Broderick, while an out of the box choice to lead a big budget monster movie, feels miscast. Maria Pitillo was annoying and lacked any chemistry with Broderick. The Ebert and Siskel parody characters never works and comes off as childish. The movie can also get really slow at parts.Overall, this is not a good movie and can be easily torn apart in every department, but I still can have some fun with it on a campy level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla is a film that's special effects can't really make up for certain flaws in the story department. The effects look exceptionally realistic but looking past that, there's a increasingly tedious story. Because of the seemingly stretched out last half of Godzilla, the feeling of suspense is all but diminished. Perhaps an example of the devoid of suspense in Godzilla is the involvement of numerous eggs (I won't emulate on this because I don't want to give much away) which gave the notion that by the moment they were sighted, they would very soon crack and there would trouble everywhere you turned. There are also certain areas in this movie that are confusing. You may consider that there are certain flaws in terms of logic, but there is also a certain point in which the movie apparently tries to turn Godzilla into a sympathetic character. This point in the film is very brief and is not very convincing. Along with that, there is a lack of depth in terms of character development. All in all, Godzilla makes for some good (albeit mindless) entertainment but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only redeeming thing about this flick is that it made me think about what in the original films provides viewing pleasure (and it's true that most of them, technically, aren't very good). See _Godzilla vs. Monster Zero_ for sheer, shlocky, antenna-helmeted hilarity -- this movie lacks the campy elements of the later flicks in the original Toho series, and also lacks the genuine apocalyptic fear of the '54 film. One of the freakiest things about the original is the fact that Godzilla resembles no real animal -- vaguely gorilla-like but the color of atomic fall-out and completely instinctive, non-conscious, like a shark. Emmerich mistake #1: making Godzilla look like a lizard made him banal, too real-world. Mistake #2: giving him (her? it?) a maternal instinct did the same thing. Emmerich's monster isn't a stand-in for the mystery of splitting the atom -- it's just a real big critter, and nothing about that is interesting at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I voted 8 for this movie and that may surprise you. The reason is very clear : I went to see this movie not for the great actors (hard to find) not for the great dialogues (where ?) but for the great special effects created by Sony Pictures. I combination with the Sony Dynamic Digital Sound system (AKA SDDS) the result was superb.(PS.: I'm not a Sony employee if you might think that...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sent my comments two days ago and only then I read the comments of other users. I agree with the one who wrote that Godzilla is a better film than the 1998 Titanic - a by-product of very succesful marketing.An international audience (i.e. "non-American") is not interested if the President was informed or not and so on. I am not a Godzilla fan and maybe this is the reason why I (and all the members of my family - young and older) enjoyed the Godzilla (1998) film.I have seen the original Japanese film (many - many years ago) but the Emmerich film has nothing to do with that kind of film.(To note: I did not like the scenario and the actors in the "Independance Day" film by the same Director.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Action Godzilla Movie For Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder why so many people did not give this movie its proper merit in terms of some great Special Effects, Action, the Monster Godzilla itself and the good acting by Matthew Broderick and supportive casts. When I watched this movie in 1998, I watched it as a standalone Godzilla movie, not relating it to the Godzilla comic books or cartoons... and to my surprised it was great for its year of release, surpassing the special effects i expected to see.When I watched new Godzilla 2014 movie, it was as if I'm watching a cartoon movie again at the cine. And... and.. Godzilla was just the supporting cast in the new movie lol :P At least I expected 45 min of Godzilla out of a 1hr45 min. I did not see a full close view of Godzilla itself.Godzilla 98 seems way higher quality special effects and better disaster movie than the 2014 movie.In terms of entertainment I give it an easy 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Box Office Hit Crippled By Negative Press</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich's Godzilla isn't the Toho character we all know and love. It's a beautifully crafted reimagining of the famed monster rendered to life with the artistry of CG for American audiences (although Godzilla went on to become the third top grossing film of 1998 based on world-wide box office). Critic however were not so generous. Reviews were largely negative and generations of fans who adored the original Toho movies were greatly disappointed by the changes rendered in the creature design and Emmerich's approach to the material. Toho has since adopted the film into the Godzilla universe, rebranding the monster Zilla. Zilla went on to a popular animated series in addition to appearing in Godzilla: Final Wars. As for Godzilla 1998, it remains an action packed adventure despite the negative press. Well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable monster movie. But bad Godzilla movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the critically acclaimed GODZILLA 2014, Hollywood had attempted an Americanized remake of the classic Japanese monster back in 1998. They turned to Roland Emmerich, the man responsible for turning old B movie genres (alien invasion, otherworldly adventures and genetically enhanced soldiers) into big blockbuster hits. Hoping that he would do the same for the giant monster movie. To that end, Hollywood gave him Godzilla, the much beloved Japanese giant monster, to remake to his vision.Americanized, neutered and changed beyond recognition, GODZILLA came out as a decent monster movie, but a disappointing Godzilla movie. That issue lies in the portrayal of the titular Titan. Gone is the thought provoking nuclear disaster allegory, replaced by a feeble "man is the real monster" Aesop. Nuclear tests in the 1960s gave rise to a giant mutant bisexual lizard. This creature makes a beeline for Manhattan where his arrival is met with mass hysteria and chaos. Named "Godzilla" by the media (thanks to a misinterpreted comment from a dying Japanese sailor), America sends wave after wave of military hardware against the beast, causing more destruction than ever but failing to bring it down. Into this chaos comes dr Nick Tatopolus, an expert on radiation mutations. As the military tracks the monster through new york's concrete jungle, nick discovers that the creature may not be the only one of its kind for much longer. The hunt is on with French secret agents, a budding romance with a wannabe reporter and a parody of some well known movie critics all thrown in. The first thing that stood out for me in this movie was how enjoyable the scenes with the human characters were. Like INDEPENDENCE DAY, Roland Emmerich peppers this movie with a healthy dose of humor. This makes the one dimensional characters less of a pain to sit through. Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn, Henry Shearer, all renown comedians, shine in their respective roles, delivering appropriate drama and laughs. Even Jean Reno does well as the offensively stereotyped French agent Philippe. Their scenes are fun, making an overall cliché ridden story more enjoyable than it is. Only the lead characters turn out a tad flat. Dr Nick, played by baby faced Matthew Broderick, brings his best "wide eyed" expressions to play as a man child caught up in the wonder of this giant beast yet running for his very life so he does not become dinner. Wide eyed shock, wide eyed awe, wide eyed terror, that seems to be his only expression. And the redundancy of Maria Pitillo's character Audrey cannot be understated.Of course, the true star of any Godzilla movie is Godzilla himself. This leaner, faster, velociraptor inspired look by designer Patrick Tatopolus is a terrific looking beast brought to life by cutting edge special effects. For a 1998 production, the effects still hold up well till today. The creature is elegant yet menacing, grand yet grim, with twin rows of fierce spikes on it's back, unbelievable agility and that trademark big chin that is common in Patrick Tatopolus' designs (eg: underworld's Lycans, pitch black's creatures, outlander's moorwen). However, it just isn't Godzilla, the unstoppable force of nature. It shows none of Godzilla's powers, nor his intelligence, nor his durability. Where the original Godzilla would be unfazed by missiles, smash tanks and planes out of his way, and carry on, this remade Godzilla squeals, runs and hides! Perhaps it would not have gotten that much hate had it been billed as a remake of THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, rather than a Godzilla movie. The basic plot of a lost giant creature drawn to New York and ultimately taken down by sheer luck and superior military firepower already mimics the broad strokes of that stop motion classic. Godzilla can easily pass off as a redesigned Rhedrosaur. But alas, here it is billed as a Godzilla movie. As a Godzilla movie, Roland Emmerich's multi million dollar blockbuster would rank in the lower thirds. Better than the likes of GODZILLA VS MEGALON, GODZILLA's REVENGE, GODZILLA FINAL WAR and GIGANTIS THE FIRE MONSTER. But compared to the rest of the Heisei era Godzilla movies, the early millennium era, and especially the original 1954 classic, this American remake is a disappointment. So disappointing in fact that the titular Titan of a lizard has been officially renamed "Zilla" by the original creators of the Godzilla franchise. I for one enjoyed this purely as a modern monster movie. It entertains, it has cool special effects, and it is good fun. Nothing much else though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is "guilty pleasure" fun indeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1954, the new film "Godzilla" hit the theaters in Japan and made an impact that nobody foresaw or thought would have happened. Sure, in 1933 the famous King Kong was released but Godzilla was still an inspiration for many monster films to follow. These movies include the classic 1954 movie, "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and even more recent films including the 2006 South Korean film, "The Host" and "Cloverfield" from 2008. So many monster movies world-wide have been inspired by the original Godzilla movie.In my mind, around the 1990's, we were long overdue for an American Godzilla film for many years. It is true that in 1956, there was an American production of Godzilla, King of the Monsters! but it had mostly the same footage from the original Godzilla to introduce the monster Godzilla to an American audience. It would seem that a new American version would surely find an audience in the States and create a new audience so to generate sequels.In 1998, an American version of Godzilla was indeed released. It came with a risk because of the past history of Godzilla movies and it also needed a big budget to properly depict this large monster. In the end, this movie version of Godzilla is mostly hated but I was able to look past this.After a sudden and mysterious attack on a Japanese vessel and also some big footprints found in the Panamanian forests, Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is contacted by the U.S. State Department who discovered a giant mystery which a monster we later called Godzilla and who's main target for attack is the Big Apple, New York City. This is an attack that later turns into much more.At the time of the movies release, director Roland Emmerich was coming off the huge success of Independence Day and there was much hype surround this film because of that. He brought Matthew Broderick in for the lead role but I believe Broderick is a questionable lead because he has never been the action film actor and his inexperience in this genre shows in this movie. Emmerich also casts popular television actor Hank Azaria as Victor Palotti as a funny guy but he mostly meanders around and is not very funny. Maria Pitillo is the love interest of Dr. Tatopoulos but her acting here is a mess and she gives some clear reasons as to why she's not around in films any more.At first glance, it seems like this is a simple plot but the plot does have some substance. Even though New York City comes off as a simple setting, the film does give us many interesting shots of the city during it's action scenes. The action scenes don't really stand out and the ending is tiresome but the action here is enough to get by. Popular actor Jean Reno plays an very interesting French secret agent which adds a foreign spy angle to this new Godzilla.What's becomes even more interesting about this American remake is the Godzilla creature itself. Godzilla sure looks like a dinosaur and that maybe is understandable considering this film was made during the heights of the popularity of Jurassic Park. The special effects here are hit or miss. The film does sets itself up perfectly for sequels but these were late canceled due to the poor audience reaction to this movie. There is also a baby element which later turns into a type of biology lesson that involves asexual reproduction. As you can see, the substance of this movie is kind of all over the place but it sure does add some elements to a film that could have easily been too simple.In the end, this is a somewhat standard Roland Emmerich film. The movie is very dumb at times and has many problems but in the end Godzilla works in a cheesy kind of way. This was a silly action film from the 90's that I wish had found it's audience. This is "guilty pleasure" fun indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats with all the hate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the days of being a young child, Godzilla was everything to me back then. Of course I had to order all the films off of ebay or be lucky enough to find one at the video store, but this was easy to have seen. As a child I was completely thrilled by this film and even cried at the ending when I was young, but have since turned my back on to it after I read all these reviews hating it, what were they looking for, the meaning of life? Get real it's a monster movie. I finally picked up the Blu-ray and I must say it was still a blast, I recommend the Blu-ray, it enhances the action scenes very well. Sure the characters were mediocre and the dialogue is a hit or a miss, but I can look past that. The visual's still look decent and the special effects are cool to see. This film is not a Godzilla film, he is very different from the original, mainly he can be injured from missiles. I kind of like his design here, it's not bad. The ending was a set up to a sequel that never happened. But of course there was the animated series. I would have loved a sequel were he fought another monster. Comparing the two Godzilla's is a no brain'er, the Japanese one is superior in every way. I could go on for a few more paragraphs of talking about this, but instead I'm going to cut it short. It's a fun movie and is very entertaining. Give it a watch, but keep in mind it's just a monster movie and should not be viewed as anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does Hollywood insist on so many dumb, infantile endings to films. And they all lived happily ever after. Yuk. The film starts well, the monster is realistic and the attempts to kill it entertaining mainly because they don't succeed. Of course the whole thing is preposterous and we aren't supposed to take anything about it seriously. The humorous comments make sure of that. OK so how shall we end it some executive said. I cant believe a writer could have thought up such junk. The original Godzilla is so much more satisfying - the idea that this monster is just a juvenile. This film starts to go downhill with a series of ridiculous and predictable near escapes and Spielberg copying. Suddenly the monster can't catch a taxi. It can crush a tank but not a taxi and it goes on in the same unbelievable way. Really silly. And it would take a psychoanalyst to say why the slaughter at the end should be something we are supposed to enjoy. Does anybody?I was ready to give it a 7 because although as predictable as any other Hollywood film, it was well done until the denouement - suitable for 11 year olds. Disappointing because of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Plot less Piece of Trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I expect anything from this movie? Roland Emmerich directed it. But the original Godzilla was just so good, why can't it ever stick true to the original 1954 version? This film was not what Godzilla was meant to be. A total disaster on most levels of quality. This truly is the Godzilla film that was never supposed to be made. Why the film was remade was beyond me, but it was just straight up bad.There was no plot to the remake of the classic film we all know. It was basically meant to be based around the "new" design of the beast. There was nothing alike from the original Japanese version to the American remake. Godzilla was the beast, okay that's one thing but what else was there? If you are going to base a film off of another at least give a few names related to the first one. No names of characters were mentioned from the original. Nothing stuck true to the great original.Godzilla in 1998 was strictly dedicated towards the use of CGI. The effects were impressive but the way Gojira was designed was nothing at all like the 1954 Gojira. Knowing Emmerich I knew there would be a tremendous amount of CGI involved, but there was so much that the plot became unbearable, well that is from what plot there ever was initially. Little to no plot was explained along with the origins of Godzilla like there was in the original.The final thing that was poor about this film was the acting. Maria Pitillo was awful in this film. From her so called "crying" to, well everything else was just so bad. I don't know if it was just bad directing or if she was just naturally horrible. Either way, she was a bad choice for the role. Speaking of bad choices, why is Matthew Broderick in this? From his famous role as Ferris Bueller I never suspected he would be a scientist that is trying to stop a giant reptile.The movie was just overall bad. It was a bit entertaining to say the most of it and there were impressive effects. But that isn't all a film needs to be good. Emmerich doesn't care about a film being good or bad. This film could be shot in red and yellow colouring and he still wouldn't care because he just wants to get money. Do NOT see this atrocious, plot less piece of garbage Emmerich considers a movie, even if the title draws your attention.Just to sum it up, there was horrible acting and Godzilla didn't look anything alike what he did in 1954. Not to mention there is no plot whatsoever, kind of basing itself off of all the other ones and letting those story lines take its place. But the film is supposed to be a remake so it just throws a curve ball and if you haven't seen the original, well then you don't really have much of a chance when it comes to understanding what's going on half of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hollywood's most expensive sci-fi B-movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious that Roland Emmerich's GODZILLA (1998) aims to update the old and sometimes campy Japanese man-in-a-rubber-suit monster movies as a blockbuster disaster flick for modern American audiences. And who better to do it than the man behind the blockbuster alien invasion flick INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996)?(Emmerich would direct later world-in-peril films THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004) and 2012 (2009).)Emmerich's movie brings the giant Atomic Age reptile to contemporary New York City (instead of Tokyo), a move designed to engage U.S. audiences. In Manhattan, among the skyscrapers and tunnel system, the creature has found an ideal hiding spot. Between the ginormous reptile swinging his tail around and the army offensive, much of New York is laid to waste. (Which is interesting to see, as this film was made prior to the 2001 tragedies, when it was alright to destroy New York landmarks on screen.)GODZILLA stays pretty close to the tradition of the low-budget sci-fi B-movies of the 1950s (started by THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953), etc.), albeit bloated with blockbuster dollars. The story follows the tried-and-true formula: scientist/military personnel track an unknown threat by piecing together reports of unusual activity across the globe, monster appears in heavily populated and well-known urban setting, initial attacks on the monster prove futile, etc., etc. Set up as a summer tentpole, this movie takes the formula of its B-movie forefathers and expands it into a 139-minute extravaganza of exciting action and special effects.As with those earlier films, the star is the monster. The characters serve their purpose, but are merely pieces to the puzzle. Cookie-cutter archetypes. Here the cast includes Matthew Broderick (FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF) as The Scientist Who Figures It Out, Kevin Dunn (TRANSFORMERS) as The Colonel Coordinating The Attacks, Jean Reno (LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL) as The Mysterious French Agent, Maria Pitillo (GODZILLA) as the Love Interest/News Reporter, and Hank Azaria (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN) as the Fearless Cameraman. The characters in the 1950s B-movies were often bland, but the characters in GODZILLA are sprinkled with little quirks. Broderick is eccentric and has a name nobody can pronounce (Niko Tatopoulos). Azaria is the prototypical Italian Knicks-loving New Yorker, and he wears a hat. The mayor (Michael Lerner) is a celebrity lookalike with a sweet tooth. The army sergeant (Doug Savant) is humorously unsure of himself. Vicki Lewis (TV's "NewsRadio") adds charm to the research team and Harry Shearer (THIS IS SPINAL TAP) plays a slimy TV news anchor.The acting is second-rate and the script is full of the clichés viewers have come to expect from these types of films. The money was spent on the special effects. The story does touch upon some interesting things, like using modern heat-seeking missiles against a cold-blooded target, Godzilla underwater, and the possible threat of baby 'zillas. There's an ominous atmosphere to the proceedings, and many fun little moments. Matthew Broderick is an odd choice for the leading man in an actioner like this, but he's amusing at times. Jean Reno's character is pretty cool. It's no ALIENS (1986) or JURASSIC PARK (1993), but the movie is exciting despite its flaws.The visual effects are the real show here.Taking advantage of the latest technology, this new GODZILLA sought to thrill audiences with a spectacle unlike any other. And the big-budget effects are pretty effective overall. They certainly did the job at the time, following in the footsteps of recent action/disaster movies. An advancement from the rubber suit, the CGI Godzilla was ambitious, but looks something less than photorealistic to jaded eyes today.Purists were disappointed by the film's redesigned Godzilla and the New York setting, as well as the whole pregnancy thing (among a laundry list of infractions). They claimed that Emmerich's giant monster movie bore little resemblance to the long-running Godzilla franchise. The original Japanese GOJIRA (1954) was a cautionary tale about atomic power, inspired by the WWII bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Sequels introduced new monsters and alien creatures to the colorful Godzilla world. This updated version is a run-of-the-mill, modern-day, effects- laden disaster movie. Although there are moments that attempt to evoke a certain sympathy for the misunderstood monster (? la KING KONG), this movie is all about knocking buildings down and chomping on helicopters.I was reminded of GODZILLA (1998) while recently watching the low-budget THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953). BEAST is the groundbreaking monster-attacks-city movie about a prehistoric dinosaur who goes on a rampage after being awakened by hydrogen bomb tests at the north pole. Featuring wonderful stop-motion animation creature effects by Ray Harryhausen, BEAST predated the earliest Japanese Godzilla movie, possibly influencing the entire genre. Perhaps the biggest connection between that movie and this one is that the giant reptiles choose to attack New York City, after wreaking havoc in the ocean. Other similarities probably come with the territory. In redesigning the iconic Godzilla and placing him in New York, GODZILLA comes across more as a remake of BEAST than the Japan-centric Godzillas.Many viewers seem disappointed in Roland Emmerich's GODZILLA, but I must say it does its job. It is very much like Emmerich's other awe- inspiring destruction flicks. This time, instead of aliens or natural disasters, it's a towering radioactive lizard. Seen apart from its famous brand, this is a fairly entertaining popcorn movie. Big lizard, large-scale property damage, explosions, cutting-edge visual effects, thrills and chills. What more do you need? Admittedly the plot and characters are nothing very special, but the action keeps you interested. Sometimes it's good just to sit back and enjoy the magic of the movies. Extraordinary tales brought to life. An escape from the hum-drum real world. GODZILLA does alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK for starters i'm probably the only Godzilla fan in the world who liked this film. the plot concerns a group of scientists (Dr. Niko Tatopoulos ,Dr. Elsie Chapman and Dr. Mendel Craven) who have been rounded up by Colonel Hicks to study Godzilla an iguana irradiated by nuclear tests. it is also the first of its kind and it decides no make NYC it's nesting grounds for the thousands of eggs it was soon to lay. here in NYC is also where we find Audrey Timmonds nick's college girlfriend and Victor "Animal" Palotti a camera man who is a friend of Audrey. now since Godzilla invaded NYC obviously it would be the news story of a lifetime so Audrey and victor decide to try and get it on tape and victor is almost crushed by Godzilla's foot in the process. soon after Godzilla's first attack mayor Eberto (played by none other than ...well Eberto)decides to evacuate the city and find a way to put a halt on Godzilla permanently. meanwhile hicks nick Elsy and craven decide what the best way to stop Godzilla would be the nick suggests that the best way to stop Godzilla is not to force him out but to draw him out. so they decide to use mountains of fish so Godzilla will smell the bate and come to them. the plan works but also backfires seeming as Godzilla escapes destroys 4 choppers and in the process destroys the Chrysler building. after this happens we see nick and Audrey in the tent discussing the creature when Audrey decides to steal a top secret tape of Early footage of Godzilla never seen before. then after her story is seen on TV by the army they decide to boot him out of the assignment. as nick leaves new york Audrey tries to apologize but unfortunately nick isn't so forgiving seeing as this is the second time Audrey has emotionally scarred nick.after this happens the army hunts down and finally manages to kill Godzilla with the shot of a submarine torpedo. when nick leaves NYC the cab driver kidnapped him and tells him his name is Philippe Roche and wants to find the eggs that Godzilla has laid as much as nick dose. when they are seen at the base of Philippe and his men it is soon discovered that they are not alone and that victor has been spying on them. after this discovery victor decides to tell Audrey that nick is planning to destroy the eggs and he wants Audrey to come with him to tell the world of nick's heroics surly enough she agrees and they follow nick and the others to Madison square garden where the eggs have been laid. soon the thousands of eggs begin to hatch and Audrey and victor meet up with nick and Philippe where they participate in a chase throughout the garden and are hunted down by the baby Godzilla's. soon they find a camera hooked up to the news station Audrey works at and they use it to contact the army for help. it is then discovered that they have less than 6 minutes to escape before the building blows up. our heroes get away but a shocking discovery is made that Godzilla never died and chased nick and the others to the Brooklyn bridge where they all take place in a car chase across the bridge.soon the army is notified and finally destroy the creature on the bridge as our heroes just manage to escape. but after Godzilla is dead it turns out that there is one last egg and it was set up for a sequel that never happened but there was an animated series that continued the story that i also highly recommend. all in all i don't get Way everyone hated this film so much i can understand being disappointed by the fact that Godzilla doesn't have his trademark atomic breath but other than that its a fun entertaining movie and is Roland's finest work in my opinion. great flick check it out.</fullReview>

It doesn't even deserve to have part of Godzilla's name in it. The army beats the monster, excuse my language, but WHAT THE CRAP! The army defeats him. 28 Japan Godzilla movies Godzilla doesn't care about the army, they are just like, poking him! But in this movie, Godzilla gets hurt by the army. Most people that say that this movie is awesome have just never seen the rich quality of the real Godzilla movies. And then we see that Godzilla had 200 babies. He only had like 2 from the original series! The one thing that makes me want to set fire to places that sell this movie is the fact that Godzilla has those spikes on his back that normally would've powered his fire (or nuclear) breath! Not including that is seriously like making a spider-man movie when he doesn't shoot webs. I think that Japan is lucky that this wasn't their movie, because such a crap film can only come from us here in America! Personally, i hate this movie more than anything you could possibly imagine.

		<fullReview>Godzilla is the 1998 remake of the old, classic and loved 1954 Japanese masterpiece, called originally Gojira, and later transliterated as Godzilla. As the original, the basic plot is pretty simple, on the model established since The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms, the first ever film to feature an "Atomic Monster"; this time, a nest of a non-identified Reptile (universally recognized as an Iguana, although there's little to no actual proof shown in the film) is accidentally shoved off with a nuclear bomb during the Experiments done upon the French Polynesia in 1995-1996, resulting in an embryo mutating into a 50 meters tall Dinosaur-Esquire Monster, that leads to the Big Apple.The new Godzilla is designed by the Tatopoulos Man himself, the one great man behind Monsters such as the Pitch Black Creatures, The Cave Mutants and the Werewolves from Underworld. No wonder, Tatopoulos did a really great job with his vision of Godzilla. He made a fresh, imposing design while respecting what made the original great. This take on Godzilla looks noble, somewhat like a Dragon (not in case since it was the intention), with all those spikes and rock-like textures. The Monster was brought to life through a mix of Computer Generated Effects, done by Centropolis, and practical Animatronics, created by Tatopoulos Studios in collaboration with KNB EFX. I still have a hard time telling which is which in some shots, especially with the new Blu-Ray release which is astounding. The primeval Beast was agile and graceful on screen. The Actors chosen as the cast are good ones, especially Hank Hazaria. Charismatic as usual Mr. Reno. Sympathetic Broderick. The whole film is a sharp piece of Entertainment, maybe the best delivered from Roland Emmerich. On the controversy... At a certain point of the film the protagonists discover that the creature has nested (it reproduces asexually) in no less than the Madison Square Garden. Totally a case, the eggs hatch right after they arrive. Being what they are, the newborns eat fish just like their parent, but seeing the people have walked on their food all along, they smell like fish and so the babies begin to chase them. This is sort of a reason to compare (thus downgrade) the little Godzillas to the Jurassic Park Velociraptors. Quite honestly, the only possible similarities can be found in the physical aspects, because the two creatures behave a whole bunch differently. While the former ones are intelligent strategists that rely on ambush to capture their prey, the latter ones are chaotic and stupid beings which just go after food and nothing else. But hey, those are newborns, what do we have to expect? Those ain't adults. Besides that, the original series did have representation of Young Godzillas - In particular it should be noted that Godzilla Vs. MechaGodzilla II features as well a Baby Godzilla the size of humans, exactly like in the remake. So, this is simply a new take on the Baby, what's the problem? The main issue most Godzilla fans have with this film is indeed that the creature is different than the original, that the anti-nuclear message with this Picture was practically flushed away, and that the monster dies. I see where they come from, but what has to be understood with this film is that this is a remake. Remake means remake, not sequel or reboot. Remake means re-conception, and this is exactly what this Godzilla is: a re-imagining of the Japanese Icon. Apparently different, but close in the heart. With recent visions I spotted some nice homages to the original films (particularily to The Return of Godzilla), along with other references to Alien, Jaws, Alligator, The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms and a bunch more film. The remake uses a similar choice to the 1986 The Fly, with the same basic plot as the original but with a brand new develop and execution. Both films are different from what they come from, but are still two fresh and innovating films. This is in fact the reason on which true remakes are made: have a different take on the subject and see how it turns out. Films like Quarantine (remake of REC) are useless because they bring nothing new to the Cinematography Mythos. Besides this, Godzilla died 2 times during his career, and bitching about him dying by 12 missiles that in a such smaller quantity blew up nothing less than the Madison Square Garden is pointless if you ask me. Regarding the origin, it's practically the same, and the anti-nuclear message is still here. In particular, Jean Reno signed on this film properly because it had an ecologist metaphor. The success of the film at the box-office, despite the tremendous fan backlash was a good thing for TOHO, since it produced a new film the year right after, called Godzilla 2000. It should be noted that in this film, Godzilla is much more reptilian and there are a lot of scenes that remind of the 1998 remake. This ain't a case I bet. Anyway, in Godzilla Final Wars, there appears a monster similar to the American Godzilla - called Zilla, because according to director Ryuhei Kitamura, the American remake "Took the God out of Godzilla" (?). This new monster however should not be confused with the American Godzilla because there are some substantial differences - it is a reference, more like a spoof, but not the same creature.I feel this movie is truly underrated. It really isn't bad - it is a classic story infused into a modern film, and because of this I feel it should be respected more. It got a lot of new fans into the franchise and made TOHO spawn yet another series of its films, not to mention the sweet Animated Series that acted as a sequel. Just see it with an open mind, and you'll enjoy it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An underwater prehistoric reptile emerges from the depths destroying ships and people . The monster terrorizes New York and its Great Apple, breaking buildings and everything to get in its ways. A researcher named Niko Tatapoulus(Mathhew Broderick)along with the army and air force commanded by a general(Kevin Dunn)track down the giant monster. Another various characters cross paths with the giant mutant, as a French agent(Jean Reno)and two reporters(Hank Azaria, Maria Pitillo).This is a roller-coaster ride plenty of action-packed, thrills,chills and breathtaking scenes. Funny moments and frightening entertainment when happens appearance Godzilla. Ending scenes located in Madison Square Garden are silly copied from Spielberg's Jurasik Park. Patrick Tatopoulos design creature is well and brilliantly made. Stirring and moving musical score by David Arnold.The motion picture is middling directed by Roland Emmerich. It won Golden Raspberries to worst sequel/remake and worst support actress to Maria Pitillo. Finale leaves door open for an inevitable follow-up but still no realized.Another movies about the Japanese monster, always produced by Toho productions and with rubber suits,miniature sets, are the following: the classic Gojira(1955),commercially hit in the US by Inoshora Honda; Godzilla king of the monsters(1956); Godzilla raid again(1959); Godzilla vs the sea monster(1966)Jun Fukuda; Godzilla vs Smog monster(72) Godzilla vs Megalon(1976); Godzilla vs Megagodzilla(1993); Godzilla 2000....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie but not Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the best films in the giant monster genre. The special effects are fantastic and the monster if highly believable. I fully agree with everyone here praising the movie. But I felt I needed to explain to those folks who don't understand why so many of the original fans don't like the film.By any monster movie fans standards this would be an utterly loved classic if you had given the monster any other name. Many of the fans name this monster GINO (Godzilla in Name Only) and that about sums up the real reason they hate the film. Through all the iterations and different directors in the Toho films, cheesy as they can be, Godzilla (Gojira) developed and maintained a very distinct character. He is an unstoppable force of nature to which humanity is a mere annoyance that at times he deems to help but mostly puts us in our place for overstepping our bounds.Its fairly obvious early on that the writers and director of this movie made no effort to understand or capture that character in their creation. Perhaps that can be forgiven since their stated goal was to try and create a Godzilla that moved and acted like a real giant lizard would act and they largely succeeded but in the process they totally lost the 'soul' of the original character. Their creation has a soul and personality to be sure but its just not Gojira's.I remember watching the movie in the theater for the first time with my wife during the scene with the helicopters chasing the Godzilla through the maze of buildings. I leaned over to her and said the first thing that came to my mind, "Godzilla doesn't run from helicopters" He just doesn't. He might change direction out of annoyance but not run away.I think most hard core fans will admit in private that this is a good film but publicly they just can't get over what they see is a completely wrong portrayal of a beloved character.TOHO even played off on the comparisons between this Godzilla and the original by pitting her(?)against the original in Godzilla: Final Wars in one of the most one sided, quickest defeats in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A monstrous mixed bag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: It's all spectacle, no thrills. The final hour is satisfying though. Rated PG-13I have to admit that back when I was a kid, I really loved watching "Godzilla", mainly because I'm a sucker for monster movies, especially dinosaur films. Another reason is that film criticism does not apply to me yet. Now that it applies, I began to see the real colors of "Godzilla", a weak and flawed film the relies too heavily on effects than plot, pacing and interest. The second half is somehow exciting, but it's the overlong and boring first half that's the problem. If you have it on DVD, you can just fast-forward it to the good parts, but trust me, the first half is darn long. So long (and boring) it almost chews up the entire running time of the film.The problem of "special-effects vs. good story" is not something new to director Roland Emmerich and co-writer/producer Dean Devlin, who made INDEPENDENCE DAY. But ID4 didn't bore me because it was fun as it is, GODZILLA on the other hand spent too much time showing us the giant lizard's feet than forming much action or human characters among them.Another thing about this film, is that it tries so hard to be another "Jurassic Park", adding, of course, the rampage of the baby Godzillas and an enjoyable final chase scene. interesting thing about the film. Obviously, it's no "Jurassic Park", and even not "The Lost World: Jurassic Park". It is, mainly, a large lizard movie that focuses more in "destroying" New York than giving audiences what they came for.I'd be lying if a say I didn't enjoy this film. It somewhat takes off on the second half, but getting there is just far too long, even for someone (or something) as big as the big "G". Rating: **1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Japanese Godzilla cannot hold a candle to American version. Special effects and sound bytes are top notch. Maybe a little to graphic for small children. This is a must have movie for Home Theater enthusiasts. Way to go Hollywood. Godzilla purist's may be disappointed with the new and improved Lizard King, but I say to bad. Look at it this way it just may force Japan's movie makers to try and up the ante if they ever decide to resurrect their boy. I give the animators of this movie an "A+" grade for the seemingly real lifelike depiction of their monster. He beats the pants of the original muppet wanna be puppet reptile. I hope that the makers of this flick do decide to outdo themselves with a string of sequels of this new much more truer and believable version of this sci-fi classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it except for ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this since it didn't turn the creature into a monster. In the original the creature is a monster that wants to kill all the Japanese ... for some reason or another.In this remake Godzilla isn't a monster any more than the shark in Jaws. Yes it is dangerous and yes it is trying to survive but it has no intention like in the original.Besides the de-monsterization of the creature the discovery and realization of the creatures existence was done based on a scientific foundation - which is rare in the movies.So I liked this remake quite a bit except... for the blonde. The blonde utterly ruined the movie for me. #1 our hero is smart, hard-working, dedicated and focused. He's got his life together after being coldly dumped by none other than ... yep you guessed it - the blonde.So he's doing well when all of a sudden the news puts him on TV about some creature no one has seen but everyone is talking about. All of a sudden the blonde (whose career is taking a nosedive) sees him on TV and decides she loves him. (Remember she dumped him for her career... how convenient that now she chooses him.) If it wasn't for the forced and incredibly superficial needless worthless and pointless role of the blonde, this would have been a great movie... so I controlled by dissatisfaction for this detestable ingredient and decided the movie is better than all that ... yet no one agrees. :/ 9/10-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla the friendly lizard creature versus his Fruedian alterego</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant special effects really bring Godzilla to life in a way that far surpasses the original films and only fails to compete with the parabolic meanings behind the classic, although some grate comic performances and witty dialog make the transfer from low budget mayhap to blockbuster smash hit more bearable in a film which has been underrated by most critics.Where most misinformed critics go wrong is to project some sought of romanticised view of Godzilla as `man's best friend' and `defender of the innocent' (as if he were some 100ft tall Lassie compared to the original incarnation who tore up everthing in his path) or classify it as a farcical monster movie which is thankfully not what it is aboutin keeping faithful to the original. The black and white classic, which started the whole thing off, was trying to explore very relevant concepts before it became a ridiculous B movie franchise. It confronted a philosophical paradoxic in human nature as man is both a creative and destructive creature which is culminated in the symbol of the atom bomb in bothnfilms. The atom bomb which in the original film releases Godzilla from hibernation is the closes thing we have to witnessing the explosion, which scientists say, birthed our universe all those millions of years ago. Godzilla symbolises a part of mankind's duel nature, a repression of his psyche which had lad dormant for thousands of years and had been supposedly tamed over centuries of Enlightenment and rationalism but in fact the very thing which unleashes this creature is one of man's greatest scientific discoveries and greatest human disaster.So what is more poignant than this creature arising out of a post war Japan to as a result of man not learning from his mistakes and takes on the persona of man's self destructiveness even in the midst of peace time.For some very obvious reasons this is a story that is almost impossible to rival in terms of its parabolic significance as it was released in the wake of the events of Horroshima and Nagasaki in a climate of what in hiensight of the arms race seemed even more relevant with the MADness (Mutualy Assured Distruction) policy of the US. So what have the writers of the new film done but tried to accommodate some allegorical comment while really concentrating on a monster movie that would blow over the public. The theme of recompense is central as the creature is nature bitting back at mankind who has abused her and in the new film in a subtle plot twist [possible spoiler alert] Godzilla through asexual reproduction posses a even greater threat of replacing man as the dominant species. Where as in the originalfilm it took a new weapon that could match the atom bomb in it destructive potential but developed ironically enough by a pacifist we have a final balance of the two forces when the creature is destroyed and all trace of the new weapon which apeases this conflict in taking the life of a willing participant in the creation of new scientific wounders which manipulated to a destructive end. In the new film we do not have this reconsiliation there is a relationship built up between the creature and Broderick's character which convey the overwhelming sense of awe and respect for the creature prooving he may have understood the irony even if the writers have not. It is all culminating in the final scene with the creature outwhitted it seems it is only Broderick who has really recognised the creature for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I saw the original classic 1954 movie "Godzilla;" "Godzilla: Final Wars;" the 2014 "Godzilla" reboot; and now I have to see this. How was it? It was not the Godzilla that everyone remembers. This is not Godzilla. Today, many people that talk about this movie will refer to the monster as "Zilla" instead of Godzilla. The monster does appears in "Godzilla: Final Wars," which it is now being part of the Godzilla universe. With that said, the movie was produced and co-written by Dean Devlin along side co-writer and director Roland Emmerich who has directed movies such as "Universal Soldiers;" "Stargate;" "The Patriot;" "The Day After Tomorrow;" "10,000 B.C.;" "2012;" and the classic popcorn entertainment "Independence Day." Emmerich has done a horrible job and he should never had directed this movie because he was not fan of any the Godzilla movies. Also, the look of the Godzilla looks nothing like the King of the Monsters that everyone loves and remembers. Oh, the CGI of God...oh, I'm sorry "Zilla" looks pretty much awful because it looks like that you would see on the Syfy channel. Although, there may be some practical effects but the CGI looks by far the worst. The story itself is horribly written, and some of the jokes don't work for example where Matthew Broderick's character looks at all fishes being putted together in a big pile, and turns to one of the soldiers and said "That's a lot of fish." How is that funny? Its not! Oh, even most of the cast that I feel sorry for are very much given a bunch of bad dialogues which makes most of the characters look stupid. I am not counting Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno because they are like the only two characters that I like, but at times might be given a bad direction. Same goes to Maria Pitillo, who is not only given a bad direction but a bad performance. However, I do feel bad for the actress, and I don't think she was that bad. Despite on what I say about giving most of the cast a bunch of bad dialogues and making characters look stupid I do say that the acting in this movie is not bad. I also don't mind the song that played during the movie's end credits "Come with Me" sung by Puff Daddy featuring Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page. Oh, I also thought spoofing Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert was very unnecessary because Emmerich did that intentionally because Siskel and Ebert never gave their movies a positive review. I know that many directors don't make movies for the critics, but they could at least just respect their opinion on a movie that they criticize on. Also, maybe just deal with criticism that whether he or she accepts it or not. I wish I can go on more about this movie, but everything else that many fans of Godzilla had already pointed out this movie on why this movie sucks. Overall, this is not Godzilla and it is not a fun popcorn entertainment as "Independence Day" was; but it is not the absolute worst movie of 1998 because I think the "Psycho" remake is the absolute worst movie of 1998, which I will review it for another time. For right now, stick with the original classic 1954 movie, and some of the other "Godzilla" movies. Even the 2014 reboot. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. Oh, and by the way, how dare they rip things off from an awesome classic Steven Spielberg movie of the 90s "Jurassic Park."</fullReview>

And Godzilla rocks, taking out nuclear submarines and apache gunships and the US armed forces look like they actually are trying to kill Godzilla rather than the half assed non efforts of the 2014 bunch who think the quickest and safest way to transport a bomb is by train, when it turns out its small enough to be easily transportable by fishing trawler!

		<shortDescription>Definitely NOT a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I was all set to write a review on the movie defending it from all the negative flack it gets and I admittedly assumed that when I logged on here all I would see were negative comments. Actually, I scrolled through two pages and found not one negative review, all positives, so I guess no defending is necessary! So I just want to add that this movie in NO WAY deserves all the criticism it gets. I am an avid fan of the original Godzilla series and have a subscription to G-Fan, so I totally appreciate most of J.D. Lees's comments and opinions. I just do not get the backlash against this movie, except for probably ONE reason. The name.I think most folks were expecting basically a remake of the original Godzilla, same look, same mannerisms, same often-times hokey behavior, and when they didn't get that, they complain and moan. I agree with a previous poster here....if Roland et. al. HAD done that, made a creature that was just like the original in THIS day and age, the movie really WOULD have gotten lambasted and shot down. Besides, they already TRIED that once, remember? (anyone recall GODZILLA 1985??.....practically a carbon-copy of the look of the original monster and if I recall, it wasn't exactly a blockbuster!). So the film makers tried something new, totally updated effects (and no one can deny that they were excellent), an interesting plot, a new twist on the original, a cast of likable characters...and it gets totally ripped apart.Which brings me to my original point I wanted to make. The name. I honestly believe that if the film (and monster) had NOT been called "Godzilla", just called "Monstersaurus" or something, and not been made to appear as the iconic monster from our childhood, the movie would have done great in more people's eyes (well, at least on the level as other similarly-themed films like INDEPENDENCE DAY, TWISTER, and such). The kiss of death for many people was that they felt the movie was trying to "pass off" this monster as "Godzilla". And they didn't like that.......they didn't like the idea of totally changing the look and actions of a very iconic pop culture figure.So yeah.....had the movie been called something else and not associated with Godzilla in any way, I think the outcome would have been way different. Because, there sure wasn't much else to complain about in this movie! It was great!! Just my two pennies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla starts as a Japanese cannery ship is attacked by something massive from the depths of the Ocean, the following day a Japanese crew-member talks of 'Gojira'... US atomic energy commission biologist Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is an expert on radiation mutated lifeforms &amp; is asked by the US military to assist them on a case where a giant footprint has been discovered, a footprint that couldn't have been made by any known living creature. Shortly after a giant lizard tramples his way through Manhattan causing death &amp; destruction as he trashes the place. Tatopoulos &amp; the military headed up by Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn) are hot on it's tail &amp; are determined to destroy it although that proves harder than first thought as Gojira is fast, strong, aggressive &amp; very intelligent. Meanwhile Niko's ex girlfriend news reporter Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) sense she can get inside information on Gojira, which ends up being mispronounced by the American media as Godzilla, this gets Niko into trouble, taken off the team &amp; discredited even though he thinks that Godzilla may have laid eggs which will hatch soon, overrun the city &amp; eventually the world...Co-written, co-executive produced &amp; directed by Roland Emmerich I have to say right now that I loved Godzilla &amp; for that I make no apology whatsoever. Obviously based on the creaky old Japanese Toho series that featured Godzilla this big budget American take on things has NOTHING to do with them at all apart from the Godzilla name which is more than fine with me. Everyone who dislikes this Godzilla seem to 'fondly' remember the originals but I firmly believe that they are really overrated, the special effects are pathetic, the English dialogue &amp; dubbing are unintentionally hilarious &amp; I think most people these days would have a hard time liking them &amp; I also believe that people say they like them because they probably have good childhood memories of them. Anyway, I thought this Godzilla was everything that I want to see in a monster film, it moves along like a rocket, it's never dull or boring &amp; delivers some of the best popcorn entertainment I've ever seen. The special effects are spectacular even today, there isn't much of a story but again I remind you that the Japanese Godzillas didn't either, the character's are likable even the comedy relief Mayor &amp; his sidekick, you can actually understand the dialogue &amp; the film just provides wonderful monster sized fun! Was I the only one who felt just a teeny weeny bit sad at Godzillas death? Call me a softie but I liked the big fella &amp; felt sorry for the guy when he never actually deliberately set out to kill or even hurt anyone, he was just doing what came naturally. On the negative side I felt it went on for a bit too long &amp; I just couldn't get past the fact that someone could lose a gigantic monster in New York, it's not like someone might not notice it walking down the street, is it? I mean it's big enough for someone not to lose it.Director Emmerich gives his audience a brilliant &amp; exhilarating roller-coaster ride of thrilling set pieces from helicopter gunship chases, a fantastic taxi cab chase through the streets of Manhattan, explosions, underwater sequences, dozens of baby Godzillas running around Madison Square Garden, a great ending scene set on a suspension bridge &amp; some cool shots of Godzilla trampling his way through the streets of New York. The film has a certain gloomy atmosphere as it is always raining, in fact 2.4 million gallons of water was used for the rain during filming. That's a lot of water.With a supposed budget of about ?125,000,000 this had a massive budget which shows, the special effects are brilliant &amp; are still among the best ever put on film. I love the new Godzilla design even though many didn't. One thing I must add is that I hated the soundtrack, I found it totally inappropriate &amp; just didn't suit the on screen action at all, it seemed more suited for a romantic film, very strange. The acting was OK, Pitillo was cute, Jean Reno was cool &amp; Simpsons fans will spot voice regulars Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer &amp; Nancy Cartwright here.A lot of people hate this film which is fine, I really couldn't care less what other's think because films are all about personal opinion &amp; my opinion of Godzilla is that I loved it &amp; thought it was everything I wanted it to be. I can't recommend it as so many people seem to dislike it &amp; I appear to be in the minority, I still think it's brilliant though, it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich's Godzilla failed with geek-boys who were mad the film didn't feature a man in a rubber suit. It angered elitists because they couldn't imagine themselves enjoying a film about a giant lizard in a city. However, I found myself pleasantly surprised with this picture, and that is why I am coming to the defense of my friend Godzilla. The Japanese can keep their guy in the rubber suit, I like this Godzilla, because he's mean and ugly and he has cravings for fish. I like the way he storms through New York City like he owns the place and decides to give a little hell to Matthew Broderick, Hank Azaria, and Jean Reno.I found Godzilla had exactly what I expected out this type of picture: havoc! I walked out of Spider-Man yesterday very disappointed. I felt disappointed because it wasn't able to have fun with itself like most summer pictures do. I walked into a store, and their I saw my old buddy Godzilla sitting on the used DVD rack. I picked the little guy up, took him home, and enjoyed the hell out of him. Just like a summer popcorn film should be: BIG, DUMB, AND FUN. This movie is a hoot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable movie to watch. For those of you out there that have written reviews and have used words such as "contrived", "characterization", and etc. you really shouldn't have wasted your money or time seeing the movie in the first place. These people are so full of self importance that they would go to the lengths of rebuking a monster-movie for it's intellectual worth. It has no intellectual worth. It's a monster movie. That's not difficult to understand, and for those of us who don't place ourselves on a pedestal, we can just enjoy it for what it is - a Godzilla movie. For those of you who had enjoyed Godzilla movies previous to the US version, then there isn't any reason not to enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was in my opinion okay. Wasn't as great as ID4 which was also created by the Godzilla crew. It was not the greatest but Godzilla was more unique than the Japanese version. I loved the starting with the scenes of nuclear explosions, even the music during this scene was awesome. The rainy gloomy atmosphere was good but a bit over done. The helicopter chases were superb and Godzilla's breath made you stare in awe, he/she should have used it even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply can't understand why so many people give this film such low marks. It is the best Godzilla film ever, and it is so packed full of excitement, entertainment and effects that it ranks amongst the best of most other genres as well. If the film is being judged on its plot or its literary profundity then that is as daft as judging Remains of the Day on its special effects or Bambi on its social commentary. This film set out to be about a big monster running around New York and it does it wonderfully. I watched it first at the cinema in a front row seat and the buzz of that hour and three quarters is still with me! This is the best monster film there is and any one who argues will be forced to watch The Land That Time Forgot until they change their minds!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed this back when it came out (was in college and had to work the night everyone else went to see it), but have always been told I hadn't missed anything. I got re-interested after the new one was released. I was disappointed with that one. I had no real expectations for this one, therefore I didn't find it all that bad. I liked it slightly better than the new one. For one, the cast is way better, or at least they're used better. Matthew Broderick is miscast, but he's not bad. Jean Reno is great. I liked the lead actress, Maria Pitillo (who won a Razzie for her effort). Sure, she's not a great actress, but she's nice to look at. Half of the Simpsons cast is represented. Michael Lerner plays Mayor Ebert (with his tall, bald assistant, Gene). And Vicki Lewis. Man, I miss her. The special effects haven't held up that well, and the action is ridiculous, but it's mostly fun. Like the new one, there are too many long stretches without monsters, which kills the pacing dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla is a better film than I had expected. I brought this film for a cheap price because I wanted to see if this film was entertaining. It was for the most part. This film revolves around a giant monster the size of a dinosaur destroying New York City and having many babies. I think that the plot was pretty good. Some things don't make sense, but this film is just meant for fun. The acting is a little shabby and weak. Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno are fine. Maria Pitillo does need some acting lessons. The soundtrack is great especially the end credits music. The technical stuff for Godzilla was great. The special effects are decent. This film can be scary to little kids. I rate this film a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the french nuclear testing, a lizard that mutated into a giant, fire-breathing creature. This huge monster is headed to New York City as for it's birthing place for its huge brood. An wimpy biologist Niko Tatapoulas (Matthew Broderick) is hired to tracked down the beast and has a connection with the creature. When a mystery man (Jean Reno) and his team are only ones know how to deal with the monster with the help of Tatopoulos. But an noisy ex-girlfriend of Tatopoulos (Maria Pitillo) and a cameraman (Hank Azaria) are along unexpectedly for the ride.Directed by Ronald Emmerich (The Day after Tomorrow, Independence Day, Stargate) made an extremely silly entertaining film that is loosely based on the 1956 Japanese picture. Although Emmerich's style of the film is similar to the original version of King Kong, Jurassic Park and even Q:The Winged Serpent. The story isn't first-rate and most of the characters are shallow. This was an box office disappointment in the summer of 1998. The movie goes on too long but it's fun, nonetheless. Screenplay by the director and Dead Devlin (Universal Soldier). From a story by Ted Elliott (The Mask of Zorro, Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl, Small Soldiers), Terry Rossio (Aladdin, The Puppet Masters, Shrek), Delvin and director:Emmerich. Super 35. (*** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! i can't believe all of the negative comments about this movie. i loved it and bought it. it was nice to see a believable godzilla for once after seeing all of the cheesy originals as a kid. i think that alot of the negativity is from "gojira purists". that's bunk. to whoever said that americans shouldn't make a godzilla movie. BZZZT!!!!! japan has made king kong movies!godzilla '98 gets it right. the sfx are great. this aint' no rubbersuited monster destroying toys. as to the "lack of personality" alot of people speak of, godzilla isn't a gameshow host... it's a wild animal! it's even mentioned in the movie that few actually seemed to watch. '98 didn't have an agenda... it was simply following instinct. it does have a personality too. it's smart. it learns from experience and adapts. i guess everyone missed the helicopter chase where '98 outwits the pilots. at the very end, '98 also gets extremely cheesed off. i guess everyone missed that too as well as the touching unspoken "why?" line at the very end.i liked the more serious trying to be realistic approach much better than any "gojira" film. i really liked the humor alot too eg. "all of the guns and we didn't do anything" "that's not true... we fed it"and why does everone rag on the leading lady? she's HOT HOT HOT! i love her full pouty lips. she makes me feel naughty when shen has a lollypop. LOLeveryone has their own opinion about the film, but i think the makers have a genuine affection for gojira and wanted to improve upon it with a more believable big budget homage. i think they succeeded.all the sly nods to jurassic park etc. are fun too. my favorite is the theatrical trailer take on "bambi vs. godzilla" where godzilla stomps on a t. rex skeleton in a museum. it's too bad they didn't include it in the film. it's hysterical.if you watch the film, don't compare it to the original cheeseballs, but watch it as a serious attempt to make godzilla more beliveable.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several recent reviews of Godzilla (1998), I can only assume that there are too many movie enthusiasts who can't just sit down and enjoy a movie. Until now, the best Godzilla movie was "One Crazy Summer" Yeah, that's right. Bobcat in the Godzilla suit stomping on a miniature city, smoke bellowing out of his mouth from a lit cigar that was tossed into his costume. How hilarious was that? A lot funnier than the negative reviews. Maybe everyone was expecting Oscar winning performances like those in the original Godzilla movies? Or maybe some were thrown off when the dialogue matched the lips? I know, the humor in Godzilla must have been totally lost on those who could not get past their own objectivity. Such taboo! Such BS! Don't bother watching anything newer than 1959, you might be entertained!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla is a giant, nuclear mutated lizard. With that, how could anyone possibly take it seriously? This goes for the "old" Godzilla (a giant, nuclear mutated extinct dinosaur) as well.I have loved the "old" Godzilla movies since I was 7 and in all honesty, they are terrible. The acting doesn't even make it up to the level of "poor." The effects are laughable at best. But what they are is fun. This is the same as the "new" Godzilla. This time there is no man in a big rubber suit. The monster looks just plain good. And at least there is some sort of reason for it running through NYC instead of it crashing through a city because it's in a foul mood. The reason may be full of holes (why NYC, Tokyo is closer. How'd it KNOW about cities in the first place?), but at least there's a reason.All of the negative things that have been said about this movie thus far have been some of the things the older versions had been praised for. And while there are obvious rip-offs of other movies, remember these are the same makers of Independence Day, a film that didn't have one original idea, but is a collection of other science fiction movies. This is apparently the producer's method of making movies. People can see this as ripping off -- negative -- or see it as an homage to other great films -- positive.I'll buy this movie. I'll sit and watch it over and over again. I'll laugh at all the rotten parts. I'll have fun doing it. Sometimes that's the whole point of watching movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America butchers Godzilla once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1954 Japanese classic film Godzilla is very good as a horror film and a fun movie, which was thankfully recently given Criterion treatment. Alas, in the West the film has not always been available in its true form. In 1956 it was butchered thoroughly, massively edited and manipulated into Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, a goofy movie in badly dubbed English. If that weren't enough, in 1998 the Americans decided to butcher Godzilla again, with a movie about as bad- Godzilla, by the makers of the smash hit Independence Day (1996).Because of my love of Independence Day as a youth, when I saw Godzilla '98 in theatres I assumed I had to like it, and tried to convince myself it was a good movie, much as with Batman and Robin the year before. Time has made me realize how much of that was self-deception, however. Godzilla '98 is loud and often stupid, and the action scenes never really blew me away. Most of the damage to New York City in the film is done not by Godzilla but by the army trying to kill the creature. The moments of comic relief all fall flat (we were supposed to be rolling over laughing every time someone called Broderick "the worm guy"). The movie repeatedly pulls the same tricks, with people thinking they're clear of danger before Godzilla pops up suddenly again. The dialogue is often painful, as adult characters interact as if they were children ("You were supposed to be my friend, I trusted you.")Some parts defy logic. Why can't the military ever actually shoot Godzilla? Are we really supposed to believe Godzilla can pick up a car in his mouth and crunch on it but the car and people inside it are still functioning? The Nostalgia Critic also did a good job illustrating how the "Babyzilla" scenes imitate the raptor scenes in Jurassic Park (1993). Admittedly, I still love this movie's soundtrack. "Macy Day Parade" by Michael Penn and "Untitled" by Silverchair are beautiful songs, though unfortunately they don't seem to be in the film itself, which favours "Come With Me" by Puff Daddy which is only sort of okay because it sounds like "Kashmir." The special effects are mostly good, although we don't actually get a good look at Godzilla besides his feet. The movie also had an attractive ad campaign. One commercial showed Godzilla stepping on and destroying a tyrannosaur fossil, and that unfortunately isn't in the movie either. Ultimately, Godzilla '98 has none of the charm of the Japanese original, and is more of a cliché Hollywood disaster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wesconnosehny wrote one of the shortest, funniest reviews of this movie.I'm a huge monster/sci-fi fan, but after seeing 'Godzilla' in a theater on opening day, I felt oddly ambivalent. I didn't hate the movie, neither did I fall in love with it. The film was okay, but nothing special. As with 'Independence Day' and '2012,' 'Godzilla' was crammed with tankerloads of expertly-rendered CG imagery, but the film had very little magic, or heart (or soul). It didn't fire my imagination the way I expected it to. It didn't inspire the sense of awe I was looking for. Godzilla him(her?)self just looked like a bigger version of the pet iguana I used to have--nothing remarkable there--and the human characters were so flat and forgettable, it was hard to care what happened to any of them. A couple of lines of pithy dialogue don't make for engaging characters. It wasn't the fake-looking rubber shark that made 'Jaws' such a success (the special effects weren't that great), it was the script and the characters--things that had nothing to do with special effects.I read that Roland Emmerich insisted on having Godzilla be able to run really fast. Which, again, would be very accurate if Godzilla were an iguana. But to me, one of Godzilla's most compelling qualities is that he is ostensibly so massive and powerful, he's not afraid of anything and doesn't have to run from anybody. If Emmerich wants to push the 'realism' issue--which is a mistake--I would argue that no reptile, no matter how big or fast, would be able to survive or outmaneuver a squad of F-14 fighter jets. (The conundrum, of course, is that the bigger Godzilla is, the harder it would be for him to outmaneuver them.) 'Jurassic Park' set the CG bar pretty high. Since then, CG effects have become so polished and prolific (and overused?) that they're a dime a dozen. They've lost their 'wow' factor. (Except for 'Avatar' maybe.) Perhaps I've seen so many fantasy/sci-fi movies that I've gotten a little jaded, but it takes more than just a few ingenious digital effects to impress me these days. During the fighter-jet chase through the maze of Manhattan skyscrapers, I felt less like I was watching a movie than a giant first-person shooter game. If I'd wanted that, I'd have played with an X-box. (At least I'd have had the fun of doing some of the shooting.) I wasn't disappointed with 'Godzilla' because it was all that bad, but because it just wasn't all that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a ship is attacked at sea by an monster that is suspected to have a politically damaging source of origin, Matthew Broderick is called in as an expert in the effects of radiation on lifeforms.From the start Jean Reno, an insurance investigator is hot on the tail of Broderick and the creature to get some answers of his own.Now Matthew Broderick has a great knack of appearing in bad films and delivering poor performances (e.g. Inspector Gadget, The Cable Guy) where Jean Reno is pretty much the opposite (e.g. Leon, Ronin) Thank god when Reno appears in a film that is - Shall we say, less intelligent and full of cheese, he can still deliver an believable and serious performance.In Godzilla it is quite literally only Reno and the special effects team that emerge with the credit of hauling this film out from the depths it seemed so desperate to reach.Anyway, that's enough of bashing this movie - What about the good points? I hear you ask. Well beneath the cheesy dialogue and the simplistic story, there is a fun action film, crammed with great visuals and plenty of action. But seriously, that's all it is; a very expensive bit of fun, Reno's strong performance and the stunning special effects cannot make this film anything more that.6/10 I enjoyed it for what it is, and as a cheesy action flick it's OK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, despite all the money that this movie somehow made, this is pure garbage from start to finish. The story is as non existent as much as the acting. In retrospect almost everyone ever involved with this now regrets the final product. There's no point in me summarising the plot as it's been done and there isn't much of a plot anyway but I wanted to at least weigh in on why this is so abysmal. I've watched this several times and each time I'm left scratching my head over what the hell is everybody doing. It struggles to be funny with several running gags throughout the movie but they all come off as being lame attempts at cheap laughs. Like bad dad jokes they just get more and more annoying as the movie digs its own grave while trying to generate a laugh. I was never sure which was worse, the various cast constantly mispronouncing the name Tatopoulos or the head of the French secret service trying and failing to get a decent cup of coffee. There was just so much in this that never made any sense and the whole thing seems to be an exposition in how not to make a movie. I could never work out why the U.S ground forces in and around New York were all controlled by a bungling and inept Sergeant of all things; I'd expect a Lieutenant or Captain at least. Why would a worm scientist be the go-to guy for a reptile? Why not a reptile specialist? If you're in a helicopter and Godzila is chasing you, why fly straight? Why not go up? Why can't the French secret service speak English properly? Why do an Elvis impersonation under the guise that all Americans speak that way? And why would that fool anyone? How does a giant lizard manage to make it all the way to Manhattan, creating mass devastation along the way and not have the story leaked to any number of media outlets? If the tape of the first sighting was so security sensitive why was it left unsecured and in the hands of a civilian so anyone could get at it? Why would an animal as large as Godzilla assume that NYC, one of the most densely populated islands, is the best place to spawn after it's been relentlessly attacked since it got there and it's an unnatural environment? How would a lizard, regardless of size, know what a submarine is or how to destroy one using their own torpedoes? When the baby Godzillas are roaming around, why are they seen eating popcorn when their diet is mostly fish? The French guy is the one who's driving the taxi during a crisis and knows how to get to the Brooklyn Bridge! What's worse is that Godzilla also somehow knows where the Brooklyn Bridge is, manages to get there first and pops up in the right spot in order to cut them off! And it goes on and on like this and it never redeems itself until the credits start to roll. I can accept a big dumb monster movie but I'd still prefer it to showcase some kind of logic and have a plot worth following. I think everyone in this was miscast and for me that made the movie even more painful to watch. The combination of Godzilla destroying every building it touched or grazed against coupled with the whiz-bang U.S military gleefully destroying everything else, makes for good special effects but does little for common sense. This didn't have any of the essence of what gave Godzilla such a dedicated fan base in the first place and highlights that Hollywood directors should leave well enough alone if they're not going to be bothered with doing justice to an iconic character. It's little wonder they never ended up doing a sequel, it would've been like trying to remove glue from hair after this colossal debacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was OK when it first came out and thought the same after watching it again a little while ago. Funny how you can't please some folks; the picture took it's fair share of hits by the fan-boys who slammed it for one reason or another back in the day. As a dinosaur loving kid growing up in the Fifties I got hooked on these flicks with the original 1954 "Godzilla", or "Gojira" if you will going with the Japanese translation.Watching today however brings an entirely new perspective to the story. The first view one has of the Manhattan skyline with a clear image of the Twin Towers only three years before it was brought down by terrorists got a sobering response from this viewer. The destruction wrought by the monster on the streets of New York was in it's own way oddly prescient of the calamity brought to bear on the city on 9/11. One of the characters even references the 1993 World Trade Center bombing to bring that arc full circle.I recall thinking at the time of the movie's release that Matthew Broderick was the wrong choice to play the lead here, but once again, time has mellowed out my reaction to that. He did a credible job along with the supporting cast, and the minor twist with Jean Reno's character was handled cleverly. What I had a little trouble processing though was how a lot of the characters in the story had a tough time making a phone call a mere eighteen years ago, when today the ubiquitous presence of cell phones makes it possible to communicate at a second's notice. Not to mention citizen journalists posting videos on youtube; it really makes you think.In deference to the film's critics, I do realize there was some extraordinarily goofy stuff going on in the picture along with the mayhem. Gunning the taxi out of the mouth of the resurrected Godzilla was a stretch by anyone's estimation, but hey, when it comes to monsters, action and big guns, I guess anything is to be expected. Even if you have to blow up Madison Square Garden to save the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had missed this version of Godzilla back when it came out. More recently I saw the one with the MUTOs so I felt compelled to see this one also. They can't really be compared because the focus in each is entirely different. On DVD from my public library.The lead character, other than Godzilla, is Matthew Broderick who plays biologist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos. He has established his reputation and he is called in when very, very large footprints are discovered. Eventually these are found to belong to Godzilla, looking a lot like a very large T-Rex dinosaur. They find some tissue after the monster does some destruction and with the hormones present figure he, it, is about to lay eggs and needs to find a nesting place. And, he, it, logically chooses Madison Square Garden, the famous sports arena.Jean Reno is one of my favorite actors, here he is Philippe Roaché heading an international group interested in the monster. Also Maria Pitillo as Audrey Timmonds, former classmate and lover of Tatopoulos and now trying to make it as a reported.Overall this is a well made movie that entertains. I especially like the underwater CG scenes of Godzilla swimming.SPOILERS: When they find the next they estimate that at least 200 eggs have been laid and, if they are allowed to hatch and escape, at their breeding rate would quickly overrun the world, snuffing out humans as the dominant species. Drastic measures are called for and the military manages to destroy the nest building with planes and missiles. But as the movie ends we see one last egg, and then a young Godzilla breaking out of it. Sequel?</fullReview>

It's not meant to be that realistic anyway. I love this movie, I really do. It's funny and I love Matthew Broderick. This movie is about Godzilla. A big lizard, basically. After atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific, Godzilla makes it's way through the Panama Canal. They call a scientist in, Niko Tatopolous, to help investigate what the creature is. They figure that the giant lizard was created by the atomic bomb testing. Who knew? Godzilla makes its way to New York City where he destroys the city. Everyone, including the combined U.S. military, must come together to try and figure out a way to eliminate the unusually large reptile.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10: Great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be honest, this is a silly movie, especially when the story revolves around a 400ft high mutant lizard roaming the streets of Manhattan, but to be honest I consider this film one of the truest forms of guilty pleasures, largely because it's a perfect disengage- brain film.What's the chestnut? Following nuclear tests on islands in the Pacific by the French, a lizard egg doused in radiation mutates into the giant monster known as Godzilla, which starts attacking fish carrying cargo ships, runs a rampage across Panama, before arriving in New York City, where pursuing scientist Niko Tatopoulos believes that the creature is planning to create a nest and give birth asexually to even more of these reptilian monstrosities.Indeed critics and fans alike decimated this movie upon release, calling it just a mindless orgy of violence and explosions with no logical story or interesting characters to back it up, and they may have had a point there. It really is a silly film, with the aforementioned explosions and violence, and the fact that there are enough holes in the plot to sink the Grand Atlantic Fleet. The characters are also fairly dull, with no discernible features about them apart from the generic traits of nerdy scientist, cold and calm secret agent, typical RomCom love interest and relationship with such, etc.But if I'm brutally, brutally honest, if you want an action film with a simple A &gt; B plot that revolves around just defeating a gigantic monster in the city of New York, with all the violence and explosions as standard, then this is the film for you. It's not a film that requires the slightest semblance of thought, but as a film you can switch your mind off too and simply watch the action unfold, it's really not that bad. I certainly enjoy it, and I do get quite invested, with CGI that in places is a bit ropey but on the whole not that bad to help me along.To summarize, I'd recommend this film to people who just want a standard action movie to take 2 hours out of their rainy Saturday afternoon, as for those who desire a film with a bit more thought and logical sense, this is not it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't that bad of a movie when you look at the movies we have today. I find this one to have more story and better characters then the new Godzilla. And Godzilla himself got a rather neat and sleek look!OK. The story isn't great, the characters are silly and a male Godzilla being able to vanish in a city to lay his eggs. Yeah. I get you. Its very silly.But that is what makes it great! Its not trying to be identical to Japanese Godzilla. This one isn't a laser beam breath GOD! It is simply a animal trying to find a place to nurture it's offspring. The people in the city will serve as snack for the kids!The actors are aware their roles are silly and it shows. Only a couple of them had poor acting. They are all slightly silly and goofy and even likable and memorable.Godzilla is pretty likable himself! Hes not going after humans as a food source. He eats fish! And lots of fish! If you get under his feet...well that's a shame but he wont target you(unless you murder his children!). He can take damage, he flees and fights for his life. He mourns and wants revenge for his lost children and walks in a trap doing so.All in all. Its a silly movie with quite a bit of action and you get to see the monster a lot! unlike most of todays movies. Just don't turn it on and expect a movie with great plot and similarities to the Japanese Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do have a soft spot for this movie, as I watched it when it first came out, and I was a kid, so I loved it.But now, I wouldn't really recommend going out your way to see it. If it comes on the telly, and there's nothing else on; yeah go for it. Otherwise, not worth it.I goes on far too long, and also I really thought the idea of Godzilla being pregnant was utterly ridiculous. After that, it just turns into Jurassic Park, with hundreds of dinosaurs running about. Should thought about wrapping it up when they first hit the monster. Although it would have made for quite a short movie if they had done that. Maybe some more action to fill in the gaps. To be fair, there is A LOT of destruction, and New York gets pretty much obliterated, but more of that, and more combat with the beast would have been better, rather than crawling about hiding from mini-Godzillas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know many people didn't like it, but I thought it was hilarious. This movie was not intended to be some serious sci-fi look at mutated lizards, but rather a humorous look at the whole situation. Matthew Broderick did an excellent job in a character that seemed to be written for Jeff Goldblum. I can't say the same for Maria Pitillo though -- the role seemed to be perfect for Sarah Jessica Parker, but I don't think any actress could have saved this nasty little creature. It's best we ignore her and focus on the true comedic genius in this film -- Hank Azaria.The plot is a little weak admittedly in its use of "scientific facts", but come on -- "Independence Day" pulled some pretty big mess-ups too. For sheer comedic value, this is an excellent movie to watch, although it does lose some of the effects if watched on the television -- this movie should be watched for the first time on the big screen. For excellence of comedy, hilarious actors (including the shiver-in-his-boots soldier, played by Doug Savant), and basic on-the-edge-of-your-seat fun, I give this movie a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

Ok, the people/actors got in the way from time to time but nobody cares about them anyway. You don't watch a Godzilla movie for the actors, you watch it because you want to see a giant nuclear lizard laying waste to cities. G 98 is that.

		<fullReview>Finally a disaster movie that is not a disaster itself! This is the most fun I have had in a cinema since the Fifth Element. The makers of the film have been consistent in their approach, they have gone for an entertaining film with LOTS of special effects and they don't take themselves seriously for a second. This is where the strength of this film lies. Many critics have complained about cardboard characters and no originality, well in my view, that's the whole point! This is made as a FUN movie, the thousands of clichés are there quite intentionally. It is the action and Godzilla himself that "carrie" the movie. If you tried going for character development in this film, you would get a ridiculous clash of styles. In a film where a several hundred feet tall lizard is attacking New York, any attempts at seriousness at any point would just be out of place and ridiculous (Armageddon springs to mind). As a European, it is also nice to see for once an American disaster movie without any of the sickening quasi-patriotism that so plagued films like ID4, Deep Impact and Armageddon. Emmerich is improving with every movie he makes.</fullReview>

I have yet to receive even a simple form letter in reply.Columbia Pictures Corporation 10202 Washington Boulevard Culver City, CA 90232 (310) 280-8000Attn: Consumer Relations Department Re: Godzilla To: Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, Columbia/Tristar Producers &amp; Executives, et. al.Have you all lost your minds? Has the moving making fire really gone out of your souls? Are you so motivated by merchandising tie-ins and opening weekend grosses that you have forgotten how to make even a mediocre film ?A little over a week ago, my brother and I went to see Godzilla. I had prepared myself to be less than overwhelmed after reading several scathing reviews. But hey, these were the same guys that made "Independence Day" and "Stargate," so how bad could it be? I wasn't, however, prepared for such a dismal, depressing example of all that is wrong with movie making today.Honestly, did any of you actually read the script before going forward? Did you think the running gag involving "Gene" and "Ebert" was actually funny? Or that you were being clever by having everyone in the movie mispronounce Matthew Broderick's character's name. Every one of your characters were flat, uncompelling. I found myself cringing during the "quiet" moments that you apparently thought would give these people depth. My brother actually put his head between his knees to stifle his snickers.Those quiet moments, however, were almost preferable to your hackneyed portrayal of the military. Why do filmmakers find it necessary to present us with unflattering portrayals of our Armed Forces as well as wholly ignorant depictions of military weaponry and procedures? You two have made films with military themes in the past, so I know that you know how to get at least half right. But please, two missiles will not cut the Chrysler building in half, nor will a couple of rockets obliterate Madison Square Garden. Furthermore, an emotional wreck of a sergeant would not be put in operational command of ditch digging let alone the destruction of a radioactive mutant crocodile. Did you even bother to hire a military advisor? Did you listen to him?I've never written a letter like this before, but I just wanted you to know that you took what could have been an exciting story, gave it a GREAT ad campaign, and failed to deliver something even remotely interesting. Given a reported budget of $100 MM, one would think you could have afforded to hire the extra talent required to make a good film. Apparently this is no longer one of your priorities.Cheers!</fullReview>

This is over-hype and draping office buildings and hotels in downtown L.A. with these ads simply adds to the embarrassment. As for the film, yeah it definitely wasn't their best. "ID4" and "Stargate" were vastly superior. The acting was questionable and the "Jurassic Park" kitchen scene in Madison Square Garden was... oh, never mind. Let's just say that the creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves for that. The movie has two major things going for it. Jean Reno and Godzilla himself. I really liked the new streamlined appearance of the big guy and considered it a major improvement over the "rubber suit" look. Not the worst movie I've ever seen but it sure could use some fine tuning.No sequels please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to consider myself a devoted fan of Godzilla, as I love the classic movies. While this new one falls short of deserving such revere, I do believe all the negative reviews are uncalled for. True, some of the casting left a lot to be desired (Pitillo and Broderick come to mind). But this Godzilla movie does something that NONE of the classic one did. It shows Godzilla as a creature, not a monster bent on creating havoc. As with all creature-features it's only natural to root for the decline of humanity at the claws of nature's creation. But here we're shown two creatures, humans and Godzilla, how are striving to survive. Humans attack Godzilla because he's (or she's) destroying our homes and businesses. Godzilla only attacks out of self defense, and later out of revenge over the death of its young. Aside from the National Geographic aspects, the special effects deserve an Oscar nomination, if not Oscar himself. Godzilla looked and behaved in a believable manner. Not since Jurassic Park has this occurred. One final note, for a 'pitiful, weak story' GODZILLA is in the top-five take of 1998's summer grosses. Roland and Dean, if you do a sequel as planned, really reconsider casting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching Godzilla, I felt that the director had fun with the material. I know a lot of people, namely Godzilla fans, always daydreamed or imagined Godzilla chasing a cab around the Big Apple, and that's what we got, in a very satisfying way. I felt Godzilla did everything I would have wanted him to do. The movie was a bit more satisfying than "The Lost World: Jurassic Park". Although the movie does have it's faults: the characters aren't interesting, and the cab chase, although very enjoyable, seems out of place. When Godzilla first arrives in New York, it's interesting how Emmerich uses the camera to film his arrival. Only showing his legs. It's a great touch. In the end, I was satisfied with the action and the special effects (way better than Independence Day's, although ID4 was a bit more enjoyable), but not with the characters. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living proof that hype can kill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with fairly low expectations, having endured a year of hype followed by 2 months of bad press. Although it was by no means good, it was nowhere near as bad as I expected. The flaws, though huge, should have been obvious and easy to fix : total lack of suspense buildup in the beginning, some truly awful dialogue (Matthew Broderick isn't a bad actor but anyone seeing him here for the first time would think he was retarded), Maria Pitillo, and the fact that Godzilla is cast as a victim rather than a menace. So instead of feeling like the good guys kicked butt and killed the evil monster, you feel like the good guys weren't so good and killed a big, but essentially harmless creature. During the best scene in the movie (the helicopter chase) I was cheering for Godzilla! Broderick's character was a problem - his feelings about Godzilla were never clear and he was far too wimpy to be the hero. Ultimately the movie is (just) saved from being a total waste of time by star turns from Jean Reno and Hank Azaria, and by some great special effects and action set-pieces. It did manage to hold my interest through all 140 minutes. But with just a little more time spent on the script it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a very large disappointment. First of all Matthew Broderick was not a good choice for the role of Niko Tau.. whatever. He is much more suited for roles in movies like Ferris Bueller and Addicted to Love than an action hero. I also felt that he wasn't motivated to make this a memorable role for him. (Watch his facial expression and hear his voice when he discovers his tape has been stolen.) As long as we're talking about the tape, why did they want to keep Godzilla's origin a secret anyway ? They should have been more concerned about the lizard itself. The Audrey character was terrible too, and was there merely for T&amp;A. The only two people who showed any real emotion in their roles were Hank Azaria and Phillipe Bergeren. Unfortunately they were under-used and the two of them should have easily been the best choices for the main characters , because we could have done without the "lovers reunited" subplot. Our hero has been shrunk from his Tokyo kin, and now instead of a rubber suit is a CGI character. I didn't really think he looked all that bad, compared to a real iguana anyway. The human characters trying to stop him caused much more damage then the lizard itself, and they should have tried other strategies than simply "point and shoot." At the end of the movie the writers try to make us feel sorry for the creature by showing us that it was "just doing what nature intended it to do" but it just doesn't work. A sequel probably will be made, and if it does I hope that there are new characters and writers, and most importantly, I hope they bring in another giant creature for Godzilla to duke it out with. This is one of those movies where you should just wait until it comes out on HBO instead of paying to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good thing that I watched this movie back when I was just another stupid kid who had no idea that this monster was a Japanese creation plus actually ended up enjoying it a lot &amp; used to rewatch it whenever it aired on TV. Looking back now, it's nearly impossible to ignore the countless shortcomings but blame it on nostalgia, it still remains a guilty pleasure.Reimagining the legendary monster of Japanese cinema in Hollywood style, Godzilla tells the story of its titular character; a giant irradiated lizard that travels to Manhattan in search of a new home and wrecks havoc all over the city. As the US military tries to deal with this new monster, a scientist, a mysterious French guy, an aspiring journalist &amp; her cameraman conduct their own investigation.Co-written &amp; directed by Roland Emmerich who simply has a knack for insulting the human intelligence with his illogical, nonsensical &amp; insipid features, Godzilla is no exception from his other works in the disaster genre for it completely slaughters the legacy of the monster, is so ridiculous that it's laughable for the most part, is filled with truly annoying characters, and yet has a quite enjoyable side to it.The direction is pure Emmerich, screenplay is terribly written, New York City never gets one moment of sunshine, visual effects looks badly dated, Godzilla's design is still quite impressive even if it doesn't share any resemblance with the original beast, camera-work isn't that bad, editing provides a fine pace, David Arnold's score is pretty good, and the performances by the cast is lame for the characters they play are dull &amp; soulless.On an overall scale, Godzilla is an absolute atrocity from a storyline perspective for it ends up making a complete mockery of its subject matter and is going to be a painful sit for any fan of the original franchise. A dumb motion picture filled with towering set pieces &amp; hollow characters that throws in one lifeless sequence after another from start to finish, Godzilla is a disaster of epic proportions but it doesn't mean that you can't have fun watching it. A guilty pleasure is a guilty pleasure after all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite "Godzilla" Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film gets a lot of hate from hardcore Gojira fans, but I was nothing less than blown away by this movie. I grew up with the Japanese Gojira movies and was very fond of the character and concept by the time this movie came out, and when I saw Godzilla (1998), I was instantly in love. The use of CGI allowed Godzilla to come to life in ways that had never been used before. I LOVED the redesign, and still do. We were presented with a creature that resembled therapod dinosaurs, a much more believable design than Gojira, who had to be designed around the ability to fit a person in a costume. The creature also arguably had more believable behavior; most animals will either flee or retaliate when attacked, and Godzilla does both, rather than walking through a barrage of military weaponry unscathed as Gojira is so infamous for. While that image does create an intimidatingly powerful monster, it never struck me as believable and I preferred Godzilla's reaction to Gojira's for that reason. While Gojira was indestructible (other than in a few Japanese films, including the first) Godzilla was not, and was killed by twelve missiles. Mutated and radioactive or not, surely a giant lizard/dinosaur has to have blood vessels and other vital bodily systems that can be damaged by such powerful weaponry, and if you take away Gojira's ability of rapid-healing, that could easily result in fatal wounds. It was a more realistic end result. I understand that judging a monster movie on realism and believability might seem ridiculous, but it all comes down to personal opinion, and I definitely prefer a sprinkling of realism in my monsters. Godzilla provided that. Monster movies are taken with a grain of salt, since they ARE monster movies, but in my personal opinion, the more realistic the monster is portrayed, the more impact the movie will have on me and the more I will like it. I like to watch movies like this and be able to think "this probably wont happen in real life, but if it did, it would probably go something like this" and that is exactly what happened with Godzilla (1998). Another aspect of the film that bothered people was the sub-plot with the offspring of Godzilla. I always viewed them as a way of making the situation feel more hopeless for the human characters, in place of Godzilla not being an indestructible force of nature as in Gojira films. The babies worked for me, in that respect. They finally killed Godzilla, or so they thought, only to uncover two hundred offspring hatching and ready to begin rampages of their own, and it became a race to contact the military so that they could destroy the babies before they escaped into the city, all the while having to dodge the hungry mouths of the little Godzillas. Realistically, would the human characters have escaped and completed their mission without a single baby escaping the building before it was blown up? Probably not, but that wouldn't have made for a very satisfying ending, so I can excuse that. It could also be argued that its unlikely that an egg survived the explosion, and while I was initially not happy with that result since I wasn't aware of the fact that they were setting up for a sequel that would be scrapped, it spawned my favorite childhood cartoon series, so I can excuse that too. The story of Godzilla (1998) was paced well, in my opinion, and it worked - it might have worked with some tweaks if the sub-plot with the baby Godzillas was left out, but it did work with it as well, and I don't think it brought down the quality of the movie at all. It had just the right balance of monster action and focus on human characters to keep me happy. I watch monster movies to see the monsters, and Godzilla (1998) showed enough of Godzilla to leave me satisfied, even enough to create enough of a connection to make me feel genuine emotion for the creature when it died at the end. In short, no, this is not the same Godzilla everybody had been used to. He looks different and behaves differently and is not indestructible. But don't let that deter you from giving this film a try if you haven't already; a lot of the hate honestly feels unwarranted and a little too severe, and you may find that your opinion of the film might not quite match up with the more vocal Gojira fans. In the eyes of this particular Gojira/Godzilla fan, everything just worked, and it made for an entertaining movie about a monster finding itself among civilization, people reacting to the monster, and the monster reacting to the humans' reactions towards its presence. Godzilla (1998) doesn't get the credit I believe it deserves, and outside of the vicious Gojira fans on the internet, everybody I know has loved this version of Godzilla. Give it a try, and you may not be disappointed. Even if you aren't happy with it, at least you watched the film and made up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Best Godzilla Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla is a Japanese franchise but Hollywood made it look cool there are so many out there before this &amp; after this including the new 2014 release is a no match for this because this is really a good film for anyone to enjoy.came out in 1998 &amp; in those times VHS was high there was a free gift promotion launched by a biscuit company in Pakistan my cousin won a VHS of Godzilla and he showed me around 2001 i guess those days i was not into movies as i was 11 years old but again i saw it recently with the new 2014 Godzilla of Elizabeth Olsen this film surpasses any version ever made.The plot:after the test of atomic bombs in south pacific the result is a large lizard is born called Godzilla the lizard runs around new york city destroying anything in its path.The cast:there is not much acting scope here but Jean Reno did good acting as always.The direction was great by Roland Emmerich there is one funny scene that is my most favorite when Godzilla destroys a car &amp; the wheel just pops out of it &amp; goes far away the camera keeps filming it.Just please don't listen to critics &amp; haters do give this a try you will get some entertainment &amp; info about what Godzilla is.Overall its a one time watch good film my rating for Godzilla 1998 is 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Lizard action pretty good but double climax destroyed the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Roland Emmerich brings us the legendary lizard. Godzilla rises from a South Pacific atomic bomb test, walks across Panama, and attacks New York City.Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is studying worms after Chernobyl disaster. Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) is his college sweetheart and lowly assistant at a TV station. Hank Azaria is the cameraman, and Jean Reno is French secret service. Together they battle the big lizard and a whole lot of less-big lizards.First off the location is too ridiculous. Godzilla start from the South Pacific and cross oceans just to go to NY. I didn't know he had relatives there.The action is pretty good. It's definitely Godzilla size. But a lot of little things are annoying like the miniature building background. I don't think they could make them any faker than when the helicopters were chasing Godzilla.Most importantly, they did a double climax. Basically they killed all the lizards in Madison Square Gardens. That's the climax. They need to wrap things up and send everybody home. Instead they resurrect Godzilla to tack on another 30 minutes of action where they have to kill him again. It destroyed the tension and that's so important in an action movie. That 30 minutes at the end is completely self-defeating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent special effects, but that's about all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people hate this adaptation of the classic movie. While the film is tolerable, it certainly is a disappointment. The screenplay is the biggest problem. It's very derivative and predictable, yet has dumb characters and some poor dialogue. Parts of it obviously copy "The Lost World" and the scenes in the nest of hatch-lings are obviously copied from the raptor attack scenes from "Jurassic Park." Since the monster on the loose story has been done so many times, they should have had a few original ideas. In spite of all the shortcomings, the film has its good points. It makes good use of the New York City locations and has excellent visual effects that provide for a few good scares and chase scenes. It wasn't the worst movie in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me quite some time to come to my senses, but I'd actually come to enjoy the terrors of Toho's GOJIRA movies- even the slow ones, wherein our hero gets very little screen time- when I was blown away by this version. Gone were the low-budget, cheesy effects I'd come to expect from a kaiju movie: everything was slick (and no doubt expensive), from the cinematography and fx to the music and performances. The original GOJIRA addressed some serious issues (like the effects of atomic radiation) and the 1998 GODZILLA made it all too clear that some of those 1950s issues are STILL serious issues. In terms of filmmaking, GODZILLA, more than any previous giant monster movie, gave the title character the gravitas he deserved: one actually FELT that this was a giant creature stomping through a modern day metropolis; it was handled realistically and logically and I was so impressed by it that I went back and saw it a second time on The Big Screen. (The live-action GIGANTOR and the first two JURRASIC PARK entries are the only other giant-on-the-loose movies that I can recall that gave one the impression that the giants were REAL.) GODZILLA may have lost some of his charm, but he gained credibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre-ly OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla (1998) was not great, but it wasn't terrible. I am a major G- Man fan, and this movie monster gives me and us a different perspective on the radioactive icon. Now, as a monster overall, it was decent, but as Godzilla, now that's pretty hard to accept. His trademark characteristics shown in all of the Toho movies kind of disappeared with this monster (let's just call it Zilla): its size was drastically altered and shrunk, its atomic breath was...just fire, and you really couldn't see it coming from the mouth, so it's really to tell if it is atomic (fire) breath. Oh, and also, its immunity to being killed by the army has vanished. Anyway, back to the actual movie. Like I said, it overall isn't a TERRIBLE movie. However, I feel there are some acting problems, such as line delivery. And the movie really focused on the relationship troubles of two people, and a little less on Zilla. On the brighter side, there was a good amount of action, and the computer graphics weren't too shabby. All in all, this was a mediocre-ly OK movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>14 years now after this movie originally came out - First of all, wow time flies I can't believe its been that long.. Anyways, the critics ruined this movie for so many people. After watching it again for the first time in years now in 2012 I fell in love with this movie all over again as I loved it when it first came out.. This movie is a tried and true blockbuster film. It really does have everything - I mean, what else can you expect for an over sized lizard taking on Manhattan? I actually enjoyed it so much I watched it again this weekend.. I just had nothing else to do, and started watching it and couldn't stop for the second time. Yea there were many clichés, comical story arcs and some story arcs not needed.. But, all in all the writing was tight, didn't leave anything feeling forced and a very enjoyable movie to watch. I almost wish this movie was coming out this summer and gives me something to look forward to, in going to the theater on a hot summer day.. Again, I still can't believe its been 14 years as I still can remember the advertising for this movie, the Mc'd cups, and "special meals", the posters, etc. Anyways, since its been so long and I now have become a huge fan of this movie, I just wanted to give it some proper justice! A great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it be relevant, it be here. Pumpkin Swirl's Blog of Everything HomeAbout Me « Resident Evil ReviewResident Evil: Apocalypse Review » Godzilla (1998) ReviewIn 1998 Godzilla was being hyped as the biggest movie of all time. If you can't remember just imagine back in 2009 when Avatar was released and it was hyped beyond belief and predicted to break box office records. Zilla was predicted to do the exact same thing in 1998, but it eventually fell short and is considered a flop by most. I on the other hand think it's a damn good movie. It has everything I want in a big budget action movie. But that's REALLY why people hate it. Because they don't look at it as a summer movie. Instead they look at it like it's supposed to be an epic like Lord of the Rings, a drama featuring a giant lizard, or a big ole tub of cheese like the Japanese Godzilla movies. This means that there's two kinds of people who hate on the 90s Godzilla. Nerds who love the crappy Japan version and movie Nazis who hate everything. I mean seriously, what do you expect from a movie about a giant lizard who is running around New York City? I personally got what I wanted from it. A fun action packed movie that kept me entertained for a few hours.The picture about is another reason a lot pf people hated the new Godzilla. They hated him because he wasn't the bulky, slow moving, guy in a suit that is the original Godzilla. I personally think that Roland Emerich's Godzilla looks 10 times better than the thing below.90s Zilla looks much more vicious and bad ass than Tokyo Zilla. I will admit though that if I was a big fan of Japan Godzilla i'd be very disappointed at the American design. But I'd also realize that most Americans (myself included) wouldn't pay money for the pure cheese plots that Japanese Godzilla movies have. Yes, Zilla battling another monster could be done okay if the right director did it but I think they took the right route by making this one a movie about Godzilla attacking a city. If you watch the 90s cartoon they make Zilla Jr. exactly how you want him anyways. So don't bitch about the movie version. As if a giant lizard would emerge from the Hudson river and run around the city and the mayor would say "ohhh lets make friends just in case another monster ever comes along."Overall I thoughly enjoyed the movie for what it is. I enjoyed the bad acting, the story, and the very well done action scenes. This comes from a guy who really likes man vs beast movies though so IO'm probably just a little bit biased. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to sit down and have a good time watching a movie for a few hours. It's great for that.4/5The above review was taken from my blog so it might not make total sense, but I think it gets the jist of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla was a great movie and one of the best of Roland Emmerich. Firt of all Godzilla is not a guy in a rubber suite anymore but looks like and moves like a realistic living thing.Don't get me wrong in this but for the 50s a guy in a rubber suite and no script was OK and passable but wanting from a new movie to be exactly as an old one is absurd.Secondly no death rays no trying to destroy as many buildings as it can and at the end you find out she just wanted to nest in New York, you almost feel sad for killing it in the finale.So i give it 10 out of 10 for being excellent in every technical aspect good acting and for being exactly what you should wait for a movie of this kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder why so many people criticize this movie very much. I have seen many science fiction films, and really happy, excited to see Gozilla. Attractive content, the acting is not bad. However, despite being released after a period of two parts of Jurassic Park, which had pretty good skills in creating dinosaurs like real life, then techniques in Gozilla still not perfect. I'm just not happy about this aspect, Gozilla somewhat rigid, less is realistic to make films, giving viewers can still feel something is not true in the Gozilla. Anyway, for the cinema in the late 20th century, this really is a film great entertainment for those who love adventure genre films, science fiction, and especially about dinosaurs like me.</fullReview>

How this can upset so many people just because Godzilla didn't look like someone wearing a rubber suit for once is beyond me.The majority of complaints seem to be that this version of Godzilla looked and acted realistically like an animal rather than a cartoonish monster ...again ...after 20 (I don't care enough to look it up) other Godzilla movies to watch if that's what you really want to see. Well I say there's room in this world for both the silly and non-silly takes on the Godzilla franchise.My only complaint is the same one I have about almost every Hollywood action film in that the upper military command and politicians are portrayed to be complete retards who ignore both the scientists and common sense; but I think by now we all know to expect that sort of weak plot device by now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emmerich is The Lizard King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am AMAZED at how people constantly dump on Emmerich's Godzilla - probably his best-crafted film, overall, and a really sharp piece of entertainment by any standard.What more could you *expect* of a film by this title? This Godzilla is both a reverent remake and a very welcome technical upgrade of those silly Japanese films. Humor perfectly balanced against thrills. Better characters than usual for an Emmerich flick. Great action sequences, credibly embedded in real-world locations. Even a bit of sympathy for the big green lizard. What the $&amp;%#@ else do people want???Oh, sure... this ain't yer Papa-san's Gojira. So what? Aside from the very first black-and-white film (and then only in its original Japanese version), that series was a joke almost before it started. Emmerich's Godzilla is a more athletic beast, but it's actually believable enough to be frightening, and it's got a personality that actually works. (Could it really hide down in the subways? Hm, let me get my tape measure... Oh, wait a minute: who cares??)I could have done without the Siskel-and-Ebert in-joke, but hey, Emmerich deserves a chance to have a little fun like the rest of us. And it balances out, anyway, against his hilarious use of the French secret service. (Why the French? Why *not*? In all those James Bond movies, why do the British always have to solve the world's problems?)I've enjoyed all of Emmerich's films enormously... though I do find Independence Day a bit hard to take. (Just a smidgen too much humor in that one.) Even 10,000 BC surprised me, improving a great deal on a second viewing. (A question of expectations; I was looking for a semi-remake of One Million Years BC.)These pure-entertainment, CGI-heavy films may seem trivial, but not a lot of directors can crank them out as reliably as Emmerich. He'll never be mistaken for another Fellini, but so what - the opposite is equally true. While I certainly do like to pull out La Strada or 8-1/2 every decade or so, I've watched my DVD of Godzilla at least a half-dozen times... it's an E-ticket carnival ride I'll never get tired of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla is underrated. I don't mind it, but it is underrated. The acting isn't the greatest and the film doesn't have the best story, but it is lot of fun to watch. This film also mimics a lot of Jurassic Park scenes. The film has a giant mutated iguana migrate to Manhathan to nest her/his eggs. The monster doesn't destroy as much as you would think, in fact, the army destroys more than the monster does. The acting as stated earlier is bad, but then again, this is a Roland Emerich film, its popcorn entertainment, not a multiple Oscar winner. Some of the scenes seem impossible but overall, its a fun, action packed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla - The ULTIMATE Collection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is for all Godzilla/Gojira fans! Truth is, if you're not a Godzilla/Gojira fan then when you watch a Godzilla/Gojira movie you most likely see a guy in a 'rubber suit' walking around a 'cardboard' city breaking things. If that is what you see then ANY Godzilla/Gojira movie is going to be stupid. If you're a fan, if you see more with your imagination, then this really is the ULTIMATE Godzilla Collection. Classic Media has done an AMAZING JOB with their "Classic Godizlla" series. In each disc you get not only the cut American-ized version but you also get the uncut ORIGINAL Japanese version and more! For Godzilla fans you can't get much better than this discs. I've been a Godzilla fan my whole life but had not seen the original, uncut, Japanese version of the film until Classic Media released Gojira. Watching the original Gojira alone makes this collection worth the price tag. Gone is the 'campy' feel and the very bad dubbing. Gone is the American inserted scenes. What you get in Gojira is an honest horror film with massive destruction. Gojira is nothing more than a force of nature that cannot be stopped (*or can he!?). In truth, Gojira is unlike ANY other Godzilla film. As for the rest of the films, again, Classic Media does an amazing job of letting all Godzilla fans get what they have wanted for so long, the original, uncut, Japanese films (*along with the American-ized versions as well.) If you've NEVER watched a Godzilla/Gojira film in the original Japanese then I highly recommend it. In doing so you'll get a lot less camp, not terrible 'dubs' and an almost whole new tone. Put on the subtitles, sit back and enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla is the American version of the crazy Chinese/Japanese original series. Who else but them could come up with a name like Godzilla. It's good that the Americans decided to keep this name rather than choose their own- it probably would have ended up being called Josh, or Todd, or The Big Dinosaur From Somewhere Unknown! The only other similarity is that Godzilla still loves to stomp around cities crushing buildings and eating puny earthlings. The bigger the building the better- The Empire State Building must be worth at least 200,000 points alone. Not to mention the mono rail and the chewitts bonus received when lifting trains off the tracks.The story goes: America has been experimenting with nukes in a sea far away. The creatures in the sea and on land are affected and mutated. Skip forward fiddy years and a huge earthquake has ripped through the ocean floor somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle. A bunch of scientists go out to investigate the strange aftershock readings and find some bewildering things, such as giant footprints. It soon becomes apparent that the quake has awoken a giant dinosaur which was created by the nukes years before. The dinosaur is angry and wants to destroy mankind! It is swimming to the nearest city and so begins a race for the scientists to prepare the city for attack, but who would believe a story about a giant monster? Of course Zilla arrives and begins punching, kicking, and chowing its way through London with relish. The effects are something truly special. It feels like you are really there, running between taxis, feeling the rumbles of the monsters footsteps. You look up, way up and see its massive jaws towering far above- it must be as big as 3 men! There is much action, excitement, and funny, and some scary parts. Baby Godzillas chase hapless fools through a hotel and into the sewers. We turn to night vision and don't see much; all we hear is some odd screechy noises. When the characters turn they see they are being followed by lots of yellow eyes in the darkness and so begins a terrifying chase through the London Subway. One girl gets bitten and subsequently explodes from her wounds. Meanwhile the Big Daddy climbs the London Eye to get away from all the helichopters shooting at it, but nothing seems to stop it.This is vastly superior to the original Black and White films. Firstly it's in colour so it's more believable. Secondly, they try to make you feel sorry for G'Z'A in the original, but here he's just a big nasty brute who must be destroyed. Let me ask you- if you were being chased by a monster, would you turn round and ask it why it was so angry, and if it's mother never hugged it? No! You would kick it in the gunells and be gone! If this film had been made before the originals then it would be held in higher regard than those ones, but unfortunately they got there first. I don't know who starred in this movie, but I think Geoff Goldbum was there and Matthew Modine.Best Scene: The tension between the boss of the scientists and the army boss is great throughout. The quote "I'm running this Monkey Farm now, Frankenstein!" is the highlight, just before Godzilla jumps in the window and pulls his legs off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes you heard me. I said this movie is SEVERELY UNDER-RATED. Why? I don't know. Maybe the Japanese couldn't stand to see a Hollywood Godzilla and all of them came on IMDb and gave it a 1 (after all, it does have 5, 000 1's!) which is completely ABSURD as a lot of the Godzilla movie's by the Japanese that I have seen have literally SUCKED. S-U-C-K-E-D.MechaGodzilla fights Godzilla? Why can't they just shoot the thing with Missiles. Godzille fights an alien monster? WoW. Godzilla returns all were linear and had pathetic acting and choreography.Now Hollywood decides to make its own Godzilla. Okay, Hollywood are known to take good things and turn them into bad things - like what they are going to do with REC and what they did with Vanilla Sky (sure it was still a great film, but if you watch the original you might change your mind). But seriously, Hollywood SUCCEEDED THIS TIME! Godzilla did offer a good start and a good end. Sure the film is rather unrealistic, but it is - entertaining and fun to watch. The storyline is good, the cast of characters in my opinion was perfect - Jean Reno as hard man was good. Only thing I didn't like was how they didn't exactly explain where his character was from. But I guess that adds to the excitement of the story as it does make the viewer interested from the start about Jean's past.Overall Godzilla is a solid action movie with the occasional joke. Any monster, action, thriller and horror fan would thoroughly enjoy this movie.Don't listen to the no obs who hate this movie thinking it's a carbon copy rip off. It isn't. And it deserves a much better score than 4.7.</fullReview>

The bright colored eyes definitely subtracted from the overall feel of the creature.The creature only ever appears at night, i don't know maybe CGI doesn't work during the day or something.Worst of all the infant reptiles' movements are exceedingly robotic in many scenes, and smooth in others.The dialogs are bland and mostly snappy responses followed by action, the movie is completely LOADED with cheesy scenes/strategies of defeating the monsters/lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "Godzilla" is like watching a low grade Jurassic Park film. In fact, "Godzilla" is like a Jurassic Park for Dummies book. It is just that dumb and just that absurd. Director Roland Emmerich knows in his heart that the film will suck. So what does he do? He adds spectacular visual effects that astound you from start to finish.The visual effects in this film are so amazing that you finish watching this film just to see the next action scene. That is a bias for me though. Any movie with a gunshot or explosion already has the chance to redeem itself from a bad plot, bad actors and bad dialog. I am sure that by reading that last sentence you already know what elements "Godzilla" has. You will not care about the plot or characters; you will just want to see the next New York City landmark be destroyed. For example, when the Chrysler Building is blown to pieces by the humans, yes humans and not Godzilla, it is so amazing to watch. Watching buildings explode is probably the highlight of this film, though. Do not pay attention to the useless dialog or plot.There really is not plot to "Godzilla". Emmerich's last laughable sci-fi film, "Independence Day", was stupid, but at least it had a plot. This film is basically about Godzilla making his way through New York City and destroying landmarks. Why? So he can nest and make little Godzilla babies who will grow up and take over the world. Is this stupid or just plain bad? The writers could have had Godzilla fight Mothra or one of those other mutated creatures. We have Matthew Broderick, Maria Pitillo, Jean Reno, and Hank Azaria as main characters. Just as a forewarning to my readers, if you begin to focus on the characters and their significance, you will hate this movie. Do not even focus on Kevin Dunn's terrible performance as Colonel Hicks.Kevin Dunn, oh where do I begin? Every Roland Emmerich film has a character that is so annoying that you want that character to die. He is a terrible actor in this film and is so terrible because he takes his role so seriously. He should have read the fine print on his contract saying "please do not be serious about your role; it will make the audience sick". Of course, though, he did not, and I was nauseous.The new and improved Godzilla looks good, but has one slight problem. It never has one particular size. In one scene Godzilla is forty feet long; in another he is 150 feet long. My personal favorite is when Godzilla emerges from a destroyed Madison Square Garden and goes from forty feet to 150 feet in one shot. Once you see it, you will agree."Godzilla" is eye candy for the na?ve four and five year old boys of the world. Expecting an adult audience to take a movie like this serious is stupid on the producer's part. If you plan on watching "Godzilla" I have the following tip, watch it with someone so you both can laugh at it. I watched "Godzilla" alone and it was lucky enough to achieve a very mediocre score. There is nothing good or authentic about "Godzilla"; it is just bright lights and visual effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Roland Emmerich Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most disappointing aspect of this movie was not its almost-always crappy special effects, below-F-grade acting, or even the script that was probably written by a twelve-year-old with ADD. It's the fact that this piece of crap was the work of movie-making wizard Roland Emmerich.It's astounding how bad this movie reeks compared to Emmerich's other groundbreaking titles, such as Stargate, the Patriot, and the Day After Tomorrow. Granted, this movie may be good compared to other Godzilla movies, but to anything else it's a C-level monster flick.Am I being too hard on it? I don't think so. I usually give movies more leeway than most, and it's surprising because I thought I would love this movie. I'm a sucker for giant reptiles roaring and blowing up buildings and stuff like that. But this was poorly done, for many reasons.One: the special effects. This movie must have been released the month that computer graphics started being used, cause this is some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. Except for a few instances (when Godzilla's underwater, for example) you almost want to barf at how fake it looks. Almost every time you see Godzilla, and especially his babies, they're nothing more than cloudy animations that stand out against the background. Emmerich's other movies seem to have jaw-dropping effects, so this came as a surprise to me as well.Two: the sound. There are three explosions where you hear the same effect of a tiger roaring. Almost every time Godzilla opens his mouth, you hear an elephant, perhaps mixed with a lion or a car engine. I bet the sound effects team had a blast at the zoo during their one week of work. I would've liked to hear more imaginative and original sounds...something that sounds more like a dinosaur than that stupid frikkin' elephant.Three: the acting. Whoever thinks that Matthew Broderick delivered a stunning performance in this movie obviously hasn't seen any others in their entire life. I have seen better acting in high school...no, middle school productions. It's almost as if they rehearsed for one night, then filmed everything and got the heck outta dodge. Nobody in this movie carried out their full potential as an actor. It makes me cringe.And I could go on and on about the script (nothing was funny, by the way), the endless clichés (some idiot gets hired by the government, finds his long-lost love...even the egg hatching at the end), and everything else about it that belongs in the "miscellaneous" category of stupid (Godzilla NOT eating Matthew Broderick in the first fish scene, starting the car with a knife, and the old Asian man somehow understanding the Frenchman's English, thus uttering the name of the creature).That being said, the only reason I took the time to finish the movie and write this review was because I rented it for $2.50 and spent almost two hours watching it that I know I'll never get back. Please take this as a warning. If you appreciate movies and expect much of them, this film will only disgust and disappoint. If you're a devoted Godzilla fan (non-purist, by the way) that doesn't really care about plot line, acting, etc. and can stand to see the crappy special fx (as well as listen to overused animal sounds), go right ahead and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the low rating?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps fans of the original were expecting a guy in a rubber suit to go destroying a toy city? This movie was actually quite good and pretty flawless when it came to the critical special effects area. Sure, its mostly popcorn fun and it has plenty of cheese but I'd like to ask people criticizing this movie about how many movies of the same scale (no pun intended) they've made? Godzilla itself was pretty realistic and the designer had done a good job. Broderick and his girlfriend were a bit annoying but tolerable. There are some dumb jokes to but all this is overshadowed by one fantastic effort at a movie which I would imagine, would be quite difficult to emulate from the Japanese version. All in all, I really could'nt ask more from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absorbing modern B-Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite difficult, despite the apparent universal ease of its audience, to view Roland Emmerich's very well-made and neat B-movie 'Godzilla' in a negative light. From the opening titles, which clearly explain the origin of the title antagonist with a series of smoothly juxtaposed archive images of radioactivity tests and nuclear-bomb detonations with the French national anthem fading to nothing in the background being replaced by David Arnold's incredibly underrated score (and talent), is to me, a signal that this film is going to be of a very high quality and a riveting two-hour ride of escapism. And I turned out to be quite accurate in my title-sequence-induced hypothesis. The film does seem to me to be a successful homage to the original 'Godzilla' movies (for example, representatives of the nation that created the franchise are allowed to be the first of the monster's victims, Gojira is mentioned; something that apparently was part of the 'Godzilla' franchise and references to the original movies are made with shots of TV screens showing one of the movies) or if not that, a successful modern-take on a highly-dated franchise. However, I do not know how valid my opinion will be to actual fans of the original movies as I have not actually watched any of the original movies, but am evidence of the fact that this film stands alone as an original Hollywood blockbuster rather than an homage or remake of its Japanese counterparts.The film's story was pretty standard for a B-movie; an illegal scientific incident from the past has scientifically devastating effects in the future, in this case, French scientists having nuclear tests decades ago inadvertently fused the DNA of a number of reptile species that grew with its mutation to an extraordinary height and proceeded to attack a human-inhabited location, New York. Consequently, scientists and the military become involved to resolve the situation as well a cool French Secret Service agent who wants to cover up the evidence (that being Godzilla) of the French nuclear tests years ago. With appealing stars (a number of whom seemed to be from the cast of 'The Simpsons' for some reason) that played their roles well and inspired a sufficient amount of sympathy for me to want them to survive, rather than Emmerich's latest disaster flick, 'The Day After Tomorrow', in which in my opinion, the ice age was the hero.Running for approximately two hours and twenty minutes, the film was a highly watchable epic of a film that absorbed me completely with the first half or three-quarters of the film given to the monster, and the other quarter to its terrifying offsrping. It is this latter portion of the film that displays Roland Emmerich's talent for creating suspense that verges on being Spielbergian as it is very similar to the scene in 'Jurassic Park' where the velociraptors are hunting the children. But despite the detachment of narratives, the film does not seem misjointed regarding this split, it is similar to the split narratives of 'Jaws' where the first half was on the shore and the second was out at sea. The continuation of events was flowing with its icing-on-the-cake-like accompaniment of David Arnold's always enjoyable orchestral genius that rivals the likes of John Williams'.With gripping tongue-in-cheek action sequences, which are usually chase-sequences and a believable romance made appealing by an attractive female lead and Matthew Broderick's pleasant easy-going on-screen persona, the film is one that can be watched again and again despite pedantic responses from fans of the (highly dated) original movies.Ultimately, the question has to be asked; how can people like Peter Jackson's messy and over-long 'King Kong' and not like this tight, lean actioner?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable popcorn movie... just as all other Roland Emmerich (who according to me is "The people's director" to prove my point note that Emmerich won Audience award for the best director at the European film awards) Yes it is highly commercial. The graphics are good. The special effects may be the best ones that year. The movie is not too violent - makes it ideal for all ages. I has got laughs. The music is good too. Not judging it - but the movie is not for those who want to find some meaning. It is pure entertainment. It's called sci-fi but its only fiction not science. People go watch it. Its good entertainment.There is also a bit of politics. Emmerich was very careful not to stress on the nuclear tests as it could lead to unwanted attention on the sub-plots.Ted Elliott(story) &amp; Terry Rossio (story) and Dean Devlin (story) &amp; RolandEmmerich (story) Dean Devlin (screenplay) &amp; Roland Emmerich (screenplay seem to hold to the Shakespeare method of making subplots for realism instead of Aristotlian principle of here and now. But they are careful not to get too much into the subplots to take away the electricity - good job! The acting was bad (flat). David Arnold won the BMI film music award for his music as he deserved. David Bloch and April Webster did a bad job finding the crew. The sound effects were good then again all technical aspects of the film were good. Over all it is a good movie.

		<shortDescription>Where's Ghidora and Gamera?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isn't Godzilla (alongside some kid or group of kids) supposed to be the hero of the film? With the exception of this and the first film, Godzilla is the pseudo-savior of Tokyo. Albeit, while he levels half the city, he is always doing it to defeat the real villains or monsters. This film didn't have that. Heck, there is only one or two Japanese people in the entire film.Real Godzilla films have the following... ~Godzilla is breathes radioactive fire. ~Godzilla never actually intends to destroy the city. It is always a side effect of his fighting the monsters that want to destroy the city.~The movies are always based in Japan, primarily Tokyo.~Godzilla fights other monsters. These other monsters (Ghidora, Megalon, space Godzilla) are the real bad guys.This film did not have any of that. Part of the whole appeal of the real Godzilla films is the cheaper graphics, the man in a lizard suit, poorly dubbed voices, and NO Americans. (I don't hate us, it's just that we have a tendency to want things our way only)Let's face it, the only thing really going for this was the clean look of the film. And as a final thought, why DID Godzilla go to New York? (New York belongs to King Kong) Why didn't he go for Los Angeles or Seattle? Both are closer to the south pacific.Verdict: Godzilla belongs in Tokyo, facing other monsters, whilst destroying parts of Japan. This film is not a Godzilla film. It's sci-fi film that resembles Godzilla films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time a few days ago. I gathered immediately that it was going to be silly. Overall I consider it a nearly complete waste of half an evening, although I refused to watch the last 20 or so minutes, so I don't know how it ended (other than the obvious conclusions).I liked Godzilla and its offspring - I could have happily watched them for 3 hours. I did not like most of the rest of it. I definitely did not like the star-crossed-lovers bit (Niko and Audrey's reunion). I did like the Mayor and his assistant, particularly the bit about "no sweets before the election".It did remind me somewhat of Evolution (David Duchovny, Julianne Moore), which I liked very much - that was also silly, but done much better.I was quite happy with the CGI, although my date thought it was cr*p. I snorted at the helicopters which didn't seem worried about hitting each other as they fired. I found the French Secret Service guys excruciating.And so on.Godzilla itself gets 3, the rest (actors, plot) get nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He gives Godzilla (1998) a 5/5. I agree with him if the overall scale is a 20. He sounds like a 6 year old in his analysis. This movie was absolutely TERRIBLE! The best and only good part was when the the tug boats or fishing boats (whatever they were) got pulled under the ocean. Other than that, it was a ridiculous cgi remake of Jurrasic Park, which by the way wasn't that great of a movie either.From a story line perspective. Godzilla 1954 was immense compared to the joke of 1998. First of all, it was a real monster movie that is pretty scary. If you are the type of person that thinks special effects makes a great movie, than you are probably too young and naive to know any better. Sorry, but that is the way it is. Come on, a high speed chasde through NY in helicopters? What a joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After scoring a huge hit with ID4 everyone expected Roland Emmerich to really impress us with this movie. Godzilla had a lot to live up to. It disappointed on every level imaginable. The only way to enjoy this is as purely brain-dead nonsense. Think about it and you'll realize how bad it is. So seriously, switch your brain off.The problems mainly lie with the fact that Godzilla himself is very unremarkable. He's just a giant lizard. Hardly threatening. And like Matthew Broderick's character says, he's not evil-he just wants food. It's hard to consider him a baddie when all he does is accidentally trash New York. Plus he moves and looks too much like the Jurassic Park T-Rex to be particularly impressive.None of the characters are interesting either. Which makes the 'character building' scenes completely useless. That time could have been put to much better use in this 140 minute long film. Only Jean Reno comes away with his dignity intact (can you believe he turned down playing Agent Smith to be in this?). Though it is cool to see Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria (Principal Skinner/Kent Brockman and Moe/Apu) in a movie together but they don't get much screen time.In comparison to ID4, Emmerich's direction kind of falls flat. Remember the public reactions as huge spaceships descended upon New York and LA and how everyone kind of watched in hypnotical awe as panic arose around them. The same could have been used in Godzilla but far too much of the movie has New Yorkers acting completely indifferently to a 1000 foot reptile hopping through the city. And I know those Apache helicopter scenes featuring the 'miniature' buildings are supposed to be an homage to the Japanese Godzilla flicks but here they look completely stupid and seem like they belong in a different movie. They just don't fit in with the rest of the film and it's very distracting. That could have been handled a lot better.The ending sets up story for two sequels which never happened because of massive audience disappointment. A shame kind of since Emmerich could have learned from his mistakes in this movie and made a sequel that is much better.I own the Superbit DVD of Godzilla (only available in Region 2 at the moment) and the DTS 5.1 sound is awesome. With every pounding footstep of the big lizard the living room booms and shakes. Plus the 2.40:1 anamorphic picture is flawless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Emmerich must have thought, bigger is better ! Well in this movie it is. T-rex is for kids, Godzilla is here. If there was an Oscar to be given for the best CGI character, Godzilla would definitely have won it. An action movie should be about explosions,(gun)fights, pursuits and most importantly, a seemingly invincible hero. A plot or a difficult story just distracts you. (thats why they invented drama) This movie has it all, it is a thrill-ride that keeps you on the edge of your couch from the beginning to the end. Put your home theater set to the max and feel the movie almost like he is ravaging your own living room. The hero in this movie is of course Godzilla himself and in the end I really felt sorry for him. After all, he is not evil, he is just trying to survive. Unfortunately Emmerich made two mistakes: the first was not to erase the the whole whining role of Audrey Timmonds from the script, and the second was the casting of Broderick and Pitillo. Maria Pitillo rivals with Tea Leoni for the most annoying actress to walk the face of the earth. But hey, thats just a small part of this movie.

		<fullReview>I will be honest-I wasn't expecting much from Godzilla back in 1998. Before I saw it, I was expecting a routine dinosaur film. After all, there have been many dinosaur movies made an most are similar to each other.However, Godzilla seemed far superior. From the moment Godzilla rises from the sea right to the end scenes, everything is superb. A lot of people have commented how this movie is all special effects but I think it's more than that. There's a lot of great stories within the film. For example, Jean Reno's character works for the French government and believes that his government are responsible for awakening the creature so he is basically there to clear up the mess.There are some great scenes throughout particularly at the end and there are great performances from all involved. Godzilla himself is an intriguing creature-see the film to find out why.All in all, Godzilla exceeded my expectations. I'm not a fan of most dinosaur films but Godzilla was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hype is gone now...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a huge fan of Godzilla since as far back as I can remember. I remember that every Saturday I would go to the Blockbuster Video and rent "Godzilla vs. Gigan" or otherwise known as "Godzilla on Monster Island". It was my favorite Godzilla movie for numerous reasons. Along side that, I also rented "Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla", "Terror of Mechagodzilla", "Godzilla 1985", and "Godzilla vs. Biollante". After that, as the Internet was growing increasing popular and easier to use (this was just about four years ago), I would often go to different web sites and basically catalog anything I could get about Godzilla and every single other monster that the "Big Guy" has ever been affiliated with. Then, during one of my usual cataloging sessions, I somehow came across an advertisement for the new Americanized version of "Godzilla". I automatically knew that this was going to be good. I also knew that since this was coming from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin whose two previous films "Universal Soldier" and "Independence Day" I was a fan of. The movie was also going to star Matthew Broderick, who I had been a very big fan of since "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". Anyway, I eagerly waited for that special day (May 19, 1998) to come. Finally, the big day came and I went to see it. Boy I was blown away by this masterpiece. It had everything I expected from it: action, more action, and the brand new "Godzilla". I came out of that movie theater a very proud customer. During this films run at the movie theaters, I saw "Godzilla" a total of six times, each time getting better and better. Also during this time, I grabbed up every single piece of literature about the movie as I could get as well as the films soundtrack, which featured music from P. Diddy (who people need to just back up off of) and The Wallflowers. I even bought the action figures (only the Godzilla and his offspring, forgot the human action figures). Then I patiently waited for the VHS to be released. That day came and I got the VHS. It was just as good as it was in the theater.But that was then (1998) and this is now (2002). That is four long years and believe me, a lot happened during this timeI've recently and very carefully looked back at those years (1990-1998) and I wonder, "what happened?" You must also remember that this is coming from a DIE HARD Godzilla fan. Ever since all the hype from this movie died, I feel so did a piece of my childhood (I'm only 16). I've been reading some of the bad and good things about this film and I feel that I agree with some of them. My readings have brought me to several of the following conclusions about this movie. My first realization is how Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have tarnished the Godzilla name. Godzilla has been one of the best things to ever happen to western audiences during the 1950s through the 1990s. Despite the hilariously bad dubbing and some corny story lines, somewhere inside, there was a lot of fun to be had and some serious topics to be discussed. Since 1954, Godzilla has basically become an icon and has stood as a testament to the post-World War II era in which nuclear testing on Pacific islands was very common. Godzilla himself, who is a product of nuclear testing, has stood as a symbol and as a constant reminder of man's tinkering with things that should not be tinkered with. Godzilla is a menace plain and simple, but somewhere in the mayhem, we saw a truly tragic creature that was only doing what it could to survive simply because of man's carelessness. This explains why Godzilla acted so fiercely towards newcomers such as King Ghidorah or Mechagodzilla, because he was defending his home. This brings me to the "new" Godzilla, which in the movie is nothing more than just a big lizard who eats a lot of fish. I heard that in an interview with Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, that they had attempted (and with very poor results) to make this Godzilla more like "animalized". This basically means that they had tried to make Godzilla seem like the animal he is: a lizard. This Godzilla only defended himself when he felt threatened, ran at the sight of the army instead of stomping them down, was vulnerable to attack (the original wasn't), and lastly, what the hell happened to his atomic blast? Oh yeah, it was the fire. The biggest difference between the two Godzillas was the whole with thing with reproduction. The old Godzilla had only one child, while this Godzilla laid eggs. What the hell? I've heard a lot of people pan this, saying that the baby Godzillas look a lot like the raptors from "Jurassic Park".My second realization was the somewhat questionable casting. Matthew Broderick is arguably an obvious choice for this film. Even with his somewhat geeky looks, he does have the wit and charm of someone who could play a scientist. Jean Reno plays a French mercenary who is on assignment in New York, who is there to clean up his country?s "mistakes", that being Godzilla and his offspring. Jean Reno is good as a hit man like in the "The Professional" but not as a mercenary whose only role in this movie is to serve, as someone Matthew Broderick's character has to look to for help. Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer, who both regularly play characters on the animated show, "The Simpsons", are good as the cameraman and sleazy news anchor. My biggest problem with the both of them is that they aren't given a lot to work with in this movie. Hank Azaria seems only here as a little comic relief and Harry Shearer is only here as someone to laugh at when he gets told by Maria Pitillo's character."Godzilla" is really at best, failed potential. In the hands of another action director like John Woo or someone around those lines, then maybe this movie may not have turned out to be something so bad. I mean, I really used to like this movie, but I question the motives behind it. Aside from all the recently discovered faults that I've found with this movie, I still give it a six out of ten for providing me with the entertainment that I found necessary to satisfy my interests in Godzilla.I still reflect on those days when Godzilla was my idol, my only escape from reality, and the only thing that primarily interested me. I really hate to say it, but this movie unfortunately did it for me. But, despite my newfound un-interest in Godzilla, I still have all of the information and collectibles that I gathered over the years and I occasionally look at them.</fullReview>

Godzilla is worse than Indepedence Day.Any film,no matter how unbelievable it's storyline can suspend your disbelief in the right hands.This film was in the wrong hands big time.The "Yeah...but it's only a flick" answer doesn't hold up.For the obscene amount of money put into this bloated mess,you would at least think they would try a hell of a lot harder!For an example ,check out "Gorgo" a 1961 british film,or a dozen others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this thing on video because i felt incomplete not having seen this monster (of a) movie until now. I now feel like it was a waste of time..It just drags on and on with poor dialogue, flat undeveloped characters, bad acting (Broderick is detestable), over-used special effects and the lack of a plot whatsoever.Let's pray nobody picks up the idea of creating another one of these monstrous cult remakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film for the first time and disliked it so much I had to review it to get it off my chest. It is the most morally bankrupt film I've seen in a long time. The only likeable character in the film is Godzilla himself. What's worse is you are obviously supposed to feel sympathy for him, but later in the film !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!!, when his young appear, they are shown as relentless Alien type predators. Then Godzilla reappears and is sympathetic again. His death is played about as tragic as it gets while not one of the humans (perhaps with the exception of Jean Reno's character and the young soldier O'Neil) is remotely sympathetic or has any redeeming features whatsoever - so quite what are we supposed to think? And this is no Starship Troopers either where you are supposed to think twice about the gung-ho aspects - this is just BAD. I spent the whole film rooting for Godzilla to bite everyone's heads off and raze New York to the ground. The film-makers obviously had no idea what they were trying to say other than let's make money. Do not give them another penny in rental or purchase. I've watched war films that were less harrowing. I'm only glad I didn't see it as a kid or it would have upset me for months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I think we are missing something here. Wasn't Godzilla supposed to be the good guy. The big lizard that saved Tokyo more than once when the people were in trouble. So why not has Godzilla suddenly become the bad guy. I just don't get it. It's probably the army's habit of treating anything they don't understand as a national threat and want to destroy it.Highlights of the movie were the street chases through Manhattan. You got the army throwing everything they got at Godzilla and not even a scratch, they even lost some of their own men and weapons. And they went and did it again! Gives new meaning to military intelligence. And since when can a torpedo lock on to organic material. Great move evading those torpedoes Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were never gonna get thrills on a par with "Aliens". That film had a director whose personality (and possibly ego) was big enough to sit alongside that of the franchise and not be overshadowed by it. Godzilla has a big tradition in Japan, and sadly, with this film it has been reduced to a Saturday matinee type feature.Aliens also had a star who had been made into an icon by the success of the first film. The closest we come to a headliner in this picture is a moonlighting Jean Reno. Brooding and vaguely charismatic he may be, but he doesn't have the ability to anchor the audiences attention firmly to what's happening onscreen. Despite some manful efforts from the cast, the film struggles to stay afloat without the influence of a major star.An average attempt at a big-budget crowd pleaser, which has some impressive moments but doesn't deliver the end product we perhaps had a right to expect given the source of its inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My pick for the worst movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt compelled to post a review of this movie after reading some other reviews that referred to it as, "Not that bad."It IS that bad, and worse. From the terrible plot, riddled with inconsistencies, to the acting (everyone) which made my fourth grade's production of The H.M.S. Pinafore seem Tony award-worthy, to the dialogue which was inane when supposedly serious and pathetic when supposedly funny, this film sets a new standard for drivel.The special effects are ok, but come nowhere close to saving this film. If you want to see good special effects, there are literally hundreds of movies you should spend time watching rather than this one.If you are thinking of renting this movie, do not. In fact, if you come across the package for this movie sitting on the shelf in the rental store, turn around and run as fast as you can in the opposite direction and pray that you did not get close enough for the aura of black energy emanating from the box to poison your soul.This was the only movie for which I have ever left the theater before it was over. I left at the very end -- I didn't want to walk out after the theater lights came on and run the risk of being recognized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers* Like it'll take a genius to figure out this movie.This movie deserves to be insulted as much as the nonsense silliness TPM brought us. Then again this is the same crew that brought us Independence Day.Godzilla is what every big action director dreams of. An idea that is just too good and perfect to go sour packed with all of today's finest technology and SFX. It's an instant money maker, or you get cow dung like this product.The plot is so simplistic it's even funny! A typical minute lizard gets bombarded with radiation from a nearby nuclear explosion and presto instant giant lizard. Years have gone by and so has the explanation how it got to be where it is now and it needs to find a suitable place to lay eggs. By sheer luck it chooses the Big Apple. What better place to destroy and have your babies? Enter Mathew Brodeick the scientist to save the day.This movie defies intelligence, even the slightest. There were so many questions raised from this film, and we're not talking the ingenuity of the plot here. How does this mockery of Godzilla gets so huge and yet so small in different scenes? When did it acquire this ability to change size? Why was it so conservative of it's nuclear breath? Why did missiles from fighters kill it after all that ammunition and weaponary including missiles dumped on it earlier only annoyed it? Here's a lesson for you, do some research on the subject before spending your generous budget on garbage.The acting, well, that's what they can do best from the c*** they were given. I mean if you look at it after watching it once, what story was there that you need Grade-A performances? I particularly detest their attempt to ridicule Siskel &amp; Ebert with that pitiful gag in the movie. What credibility do they have of their past movies that would even give them the right to say what they did were good films. Ebert was right. Deven and Emmerich made horrible films with it's technical SFX as it's sort of savior in the box office.Godzilla pretty much reeks of everything but good eye candy. Was it fun? Once again, hit that mute button and turn off your brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre,yet an enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla is a good film for the whole family to enjoy. The lack of blood and gore make it suitable for the young'uns (though you may want to tell them not to say some of those naughty little words) straight up to the elderly. As for the film itself, what kept it from being a classic monster film and one that could be forgotten in a few years is the lack of intelligence of the people. To start, the poor old fisherman in the beginning he stands their so long waiting on godzilla to turn him into a fishersmear I thought he had died standing there with his hands on his face.The next example of sheer stupidity (the next example I'm going to tell you about, not the next example of unsmartness in the film by the way) is our nations army/air force, they did so many stupid things I thought it was a joke, for instance, at one point they had a group of men armed with M-16's,yes,you heard right,no,this is not a joke they had M-16's to fight a 300 foot tall monster they brought M-16's,why, those things barely work on people. Ok, the last bit of dumbness I will address,are our next country neighbors the frenchman, when Nick, and that french fella were trying to get clearance into the city, a guard stops and asks him, why they were there and who they were Nick talks to him instead of the French guy (when the French guy should have spoken by the way)the guard blows up at Nick because he's just a soldier and not a high ranking officer (he's actually neither but)anyway, the guard asks frenchie overhere could was something wrong with him and he says in a fake southern accent "Why, no sir." now my question is if he could fake an American accent why didn't he do it to begin with? I could go on and on but I won't. Oh one more thing if it sounds like I don't like the its not true I love the French. These French in Godzilla just didn't play intelligent parts. Cest'la vie(whatever that means)!</fullReview>

It's too long, the dialogue is contrived, Matthew Broderick went on acting holiday and whoever wrote this must of have been drunk.

In all of it's 2 and a half or so hours about ten minutes is good, the parts with creature(s) but that is all. Devlin has been quoted as saying that he wrote ID4 in four days, my question is did he write this in one of his lunch breaks?

		<fullReview>"Godzilla" didn't fare well in the theatres after being way over-hyped and people said it relied too much on special effects. True, it did rely on a lot of special effects but the story was mostly like all the other Godzilla flicks, nothing really changed except that now the monster is computer generated instead of a guy in a rubber suit and he wrecks havoc in New York City instead of Tokyo. The Japanese involvement in this film is very limited with only the beginning having them power a ship through a storm. The cast is ok. Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria were the only good actors in this. Maria Patillo cannot act at all, and the rest of the cast was just there, no particular reason whatsoever for the storyline. The real star of this is Godzilla. The way he destroys the city is awesome. He jumps right through buildings, his tail wipes out anything that comes in contact with it while crushing New Yorkers with his huge foot. Lots of action in this. Explosions are plenty and there is some humor in it too. If you are expecting this to be like the old Godzilla, think again. If you want to see a good action flick, rent it.</fullReview>

Yes, the characterisation is a bit shallow. But so what! Did you enjoy it? My answer is an emphatic YES!!!

Someone said it right when he/she said: 'the number one Hollywood rule: thou shall not ask too much from the viewers intelligence'...Godzilla is fun and entertaining for people that like all the standards with some cool fx. (Personally I found them a bit disappointing). He who wants something new should NOT watch this movie...I want to make clear that it's not a jurassic park ripp-off. The T-Rex is not Godzilla at all. Could this have been a good movie? Sure!! Better lines for the actors (they weren't bad THEMSELVES), a story that rocks, believable events, a perfect music score and better settings would have made this movie a blockbuster with high ratings.

The exception to this was the acting of Jean Reno, who's always the sauve, tough and adept international man, this time in a "friendly" role.Some New Yorkers liked this film, in as much as it's always a kick for us to see our town get blown up by the inept military that's chasing this monster.

		<shortDescription>Technically disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I must say that I'm disappointed. Very, very, VERY disappointed! This was supposed to be a major blockbuster, at least including some nifty action and on-the-edge-of-your-seat special effects. How disappointed I got.The movie wasn't even technically superior, and as for the acting - the french guy "Roach" was really the only performance that came close to - well, anything.Matthew Broderick's acting sucked, and so did most of the rest of the crew. The only part that was mildly amusing was the supertanker and the fishing boats - and that's all in the first 15 minutes of the movie.Boring, boring, boring!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this and I must say I wasn't impressed.It appeared to be lacking in just about every department excluding sfx of course. I was only watching it on a 14inch tv so that didn't do this flick much justice, but it was still...disappointing!!Odd storyline, sort of non-storyline but then with flicks like this you dont really watch em for plot content, do ya??I did find the holes in the plot as big as the Empire State Building, although I DID my best to ignore them! Stuff like this:1) submarines in rivers shooting torpedos 2)helicoptors that fly forward not up to get away 3)huge 1000metre lizard hiding in subways 4)huge lizard laying hundreds of eggs in a building and going totally unnoticed 5)lizard travelling (i mean swimming) all the way to New York U. S. of A to lay its eggs...the cliche list is endless!!There was also a lot of Jurassic Park, Lost World etc so there went all sense of originality. From the makers of ID4, I am not surprised!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could there BE a worse monster movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well now. We're all familiar with the age old movies whereby an oversized monster wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting metropolis. Godzilla '98 tried to update one of the more popular of these movies to the 90s by adding spectacular effects, a kickass soundtrack and removing all traces of plotline.. and let's not forget our hero Matthew Broderick (who's acting career peaked with Ferris Bueller's Day Off and should have ended directly afterward). Unfortunately, the movie lacked pretty much EVERYTHING that made the old b-grade flicks worthwhile. Godzilla '98 lacks atmosphere, character depth, acting skill (acting, period?), context, lastability and watchability. In general, the film gives Godzilla a bad name. Take my word for it, this is not what a regular Gojira movie looks like! This is a new kind of B-grade movie -- The high budget, but unbelievably AWFUL b-grade. The movie genre that can never attract a cult following.Could there BE a worse monster movie?Read the comic instead ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He still looks like a man in a rubber suit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The special effects are amazing, and the action scenes of the monster thud-thudding through the streets of Manhattan chasing or being chased by humans are extremely well put together. Matthew Broderick has just the right tone of amused irony. It drags whenever the monsters are off-camera, however, and that unfortunately includes one long section in the middle I wouldn't sit through again if you paid me. The thing I liked best about the movie was the way the whole thing is shrouded in darkness and rain. I don't expect many to agree with that, but it made it bearable for me. In fact, as the movie went on and I realized it was never going to clear up, my respect for the makers of this movie went up. They probably did it to avoid having to show the monsters in broad daylight, and saved themselves a ton of editing thereby, but the effect when you watch it is of someone pulling off a deliberate stunt just for the sheer artistic fun of it. The other thing I liked about it is the way the big monster still looks a little bit like a man in a rubber suit despite being a state-of-the-art computer animation. A nice touch, which we can always hope was deliberate.</fullReview>

There were no Oscar worthy acting performances here, but most of them do a sufficient job, and I was especially impressed by Frenchman Jean Reno, who was really a funny, interesting character to watch. Godzilla isn't the greatest movie, but it is a great one to watch on a boring, Friday night. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ranks as one of the worst films I have ever seen. Usually I can find a film enjoyable, but in Godzilla's case I was amused by how stupid it was. I actually had the choice in a video shop of Godzilla, Jackie Brown and U.S Marshalls. I do not know WHY I chose Godzilla.Examples of stupidity of film: 1. Godzilla is in one scene able to breath fire, but never uses this ability anywhere else. Why? 2. Near the end of the film, Matthew Broderick and co. shelter in a tunnel crossing the river in NY. Godzilla gets around by tunnelling through subway tunnels to make them bigger. Why does it not do this now?There are so many other bad points I can't mention them. This film was an appalling waste of ?3.50.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From the makers of Independence Day".That line tells that this movie is probably not going to be very good. I wasn't disappointed. It was almost worse than ID4. And that's an accomplishment.The movie felt like a combination of "JP2: Lost World" and "Aliens" arranged in the manners of ID4. I'm amazed at how much of ID4 we can see in this one. The main character could be the same guy basically. A forgotten scientist who gets drawn into the big events. He's still in love with his long-gone girlfriend. By the end of the movie they get together again. (btw, that annoyed me as hell! I really hated that girl, he should've chosen the other one).I don't think the acting was very bad. There were many good actors in the movie. They just had a bad script.The basic idea of the movie is not a bad one. I like the concept of "Huge Godzilla-monster goes downtown New York". You could do something very interesting with that. But it's sad to see that idea drowned in moronic characters (the french somewhat excluded) and drama effect after drama effect. The dramatic effects should support the story and not the other way around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie and expected a dramatic movie of a walking disaster in New York (why NY?), screaming people with lots of blood and gore, the thrill of a hunt, the fear, but instead I see a bad comedy. Okay, lets be honest, some special effects (some) are not bad. And I think that Matthew Broderick is not a bad actor, but not in this movie. He looks like the paperboy from across the street. The US army looks like the students of Police Academy. The crowd on the street react like: "Oh yeah there is a monster, I almost forgot". I can go further with the bad and illogical things in this movie but that all has been said in these reviews.I have put the DVD back in the box where it belongs.Now, where is that Predator DVD?

		<shortDescription>Arguably the worst movie of all time - also the most over-budgeted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Godzilla expecting good things. I came out of Godzilla contemplating all the other things I could have been doing instead of sitting in the cinema bored senseless.With one of the biggest marketing campaigns I've ever witnessed, Godzilla was also the biggest flop. When tedium began to set in, I reassured myself that at least I was in for a treat - special-effects-wise. Nothing like a good big lizard thing to entertain for at least a while.Unfortunately, Godzilla herself does not make much of an appearance for most of the movie. A foot here, a snout there, the tip a tail just disappearing round the corner.The script was also a disappointment. Not that I expected much from an action flick (remember Independence Day?) but the plot-holes in Godzilla were too much. I refuse to believe that a giant lizard capable of demolishing sky-scrapers can simply disappear into the depths of the subway system without leaving a trace.I was also forced to wonder why Godzilla somehow managed to forget that she could breathe fire when the carload of stars was within range. Seems awfully convenient to me.And if the single 'joke' of the movie - the 'worm guy' thing for those of you who have seen Godzilla - was used one more time I would have been forced to shoot myself.Unlike flicks like Independence Day, Godzilla's poor script and disappointing special effects were not helped by the actors. Godzilla featured some of the most annoying performances I have ever seen. Ever.Steer clear of this one, folks.</fullReview>

This movie has some of the best and creative action sequences i've seen in most of the movies in the great summer of '98. The cab/chase part is probably the best part of the movie. I admit the acting is very bad and the cast is NOT an A-list but they are not the star of the show. Godzilla is. The visual effects are some of the greatest i've seen. I love the way Godzilla smashes all the buildings trying to run and the part when the Madison Square Garden gets destroyed looked REALLY good.Forget about plot. Who needs it unless your some geek who always needs an inhaler. If you really enjoy to just sit back with a great movie and don't like to think than you should see this. If not than don't watch it. If you liked Independence Day you might like this but don't expect great acting or a strong cast like Independence Day. Watch it anyway. But please give Godzilla a chance.

		<fullReview>I was so disappointed in this movie, that I was actually angry when I left the theatre. I'd anticipated it for so long, due to the great PR campaign and the enjoyment the old hokey Godzilla movies gave me, that I couldn't believe it was so bad. It seemed like the director was going for character development regarding the two leads, and completely missed the boat. And why was Godzilla always in the dark? What I could see of the FX was good; were they trying to hide something? Also, I wonder if they might have been trying for a JAWS-like effect, by not letting us see the creature early in the picture. MST3K lampoons movies that are so bad that you laugh at them. I don't think they'll even bother with this one. It was just a "nothing" movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I rented Godzilla so I could see Jean Reno, because he was so good in Mission: Impossible. Turns out he was one of the good things (and by that I mean the *only* good thing) about it. The bulk of the film is running from Godzilla, chasing Godzilla, tricking Godzilla, finding out we weren't really tricking Godzilla, and finally, not really caring what happens to Godzilla because we suddenly have Godzilla's bouncing babies to worry about. Most of the dialogue is clumsy, over-used or unnecessary. There are also some lovely sub-plots (the budding romance between Nick and Audrey, Audrey's struggle to get ahead in life, Nick unbelievably ANNOYING quest to get people to pronounce his last name right) that do a great job of making the movie very cheesy. But to say *something* in the movie's defense, if you are in to special effects it could be fun to watch, and if you like Jean Reno (or "Rambo") his character is really great, and ALMOST makes the movie worth seeing. But not quite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A roller-coaster of a thrill ride, yet with a detracting sub-plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie completely blew me away. It definitely wasn't what I was expecting, which worked in both good and bad ways for it.First: the effects. Uncanny. True, there were some rare occasions where the monster looked almost as campy as the old Japanese movies, but overall, I'd put them just under Jurassic Park. From the first half-hour onward, until the credits rolled, the whole movie seemed to be one gigantic climatic scene, leaving my heart beating almost twice as fast as when I first sat down to watch it.Second: the plot (&amp; sub-plots). The plot going on through the entire movie of the three friends and Matthew Broderick, as well as the whole deal with the news station, really killed the plot for me. It seemed that Maria Pitillo was just whining the entire movie. Her character was a complete waste of film. The movie should have concentrated on the team containing Broderick and Vicky Lewis, whose character could have been evolved much more than was.Hank Azaria was good in his role, and Jean Reno was great, although the sub-plot with the French really could have been smoothed over and explained in more detail; it stuck out like a sore thumb. Also, the entire Madison Garden scene seemed to be ripped off from Jurassic Park, however it probably was the most intense scene in the whole movie.And how could we forget pudgy Mayor Ebert and his bald friend Gene. What was with that? Probably the single stupidest thing in the whole movie. The only reason I could see for putting them in here is to garner points with Siskel and Ebert. Terrible idea.Overall, I did enjoy the movie, but it could have been improved immensely by revamping and/or removing some or all of the subplots. Let's hope they fix their plot problems in the sequel.Out of 10, I give it a 7.</fullReview>

Watch "Jurassic Park" or "JP: the Lost World" instead, this film does nothing but rip off these films among others (such as "Alien" and "Hunt for Red October"). The reason the entire film is in the rain and/or in the dark is to hide the poorly done not-so-special effects.Except for the noble attempts (despite the script) by Jean Reno and Hank Azaria, no one who starred in this trash should ever star in a movie again.

This film finally shows a Godzilla/Godzilla-monster that many people, who never really were fans nor impressed by the earlier Godzilla films and creatures, can love. The idea of taking Godzilla in a more realistic way was just great and it gave us the more realistic, cooler, and more lovable animal-like Godzilla that many of us always wanted. It is a thrill ride from the beginning to the end. I can literally watch it anytime.I really recommend this masterpiece of a monster/Godzilla-film. You can't do more than love it! The film really have great scenes with great animation and other special effects, it has all from cool, awesome, thrilling scenes to great love scenes, especially between the two characters that are played by Maria Pitillo and Matthew Broderick, they really were the best ones for the roles in this film, it's unforgettable, in a good way. There are really many great ideas and details in this film which many, especially haters, doesn't notice or just simply ignores, which is sad because of the genius story which makes this film so very special and which have inspired later Godzilla films and merchandise and really has an amazing legacy behind it. I recommend this film to everyone! It's certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible horrible horrible. Really sad Hollywood makes this garbage. People fell for it, and the movie made money, because they got sucked in to thinking this was a godzilla flick, not a big lizard, who looks just like Alien, running away from bad acting, plot holes, and horrible writing. I'm not a big fan boy of old school godzilla but the fact that Toho reverted back to the old style, and tri-star never made a sequel proved that this was a flop. If they wanted to make something clever they could have down it Cloverfield style but with Godzilla. Or like this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sbzpz0qxXc At least there is a new one coming out in 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Americanisation" and "blockbustering" of a Japanese legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Godzilla since my early childhood. If read many books, played many games, collected many cards or little figures or whatever and watched many Japanese movies about this legacy...And then, I watched this American remake. They should have never touched this Japanese legend...The charm of the Japanese movies with people wearing the costumes, artificial miniature cities created brick by brick in long hours to get destroyed during one scene by a giant guy in a latex costume, the appearance of so many funny monsters, aliens or armies, the political, social, environmental or simply anti-war context of several movies... all of those things are not present in this movie. The few characters are kind of superficial, the most important scenes are entirely created on the computer and Godzilla doesn't look like the original one, but rather like a silly rip-off from the "Alien" movies. Everything that made the Japanese movies special and interesting is missing in this movie. That's why, even though most of the actors had signed for two sequels, there has not been a second American movie about Godzilla - thanks! The only thing this movie was good for was the fact that it brought the legendary Japanese monster to a larger public. And it was good to see an entertaining action movie (if we forget about the Japanese context) with some ice effects in the cinema - but nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Skipping all the rubbish at the start of the movie, the movie properly starts with a man fishing at the end of a pier in rainy Manhattan. He catches a fish! Oh it's a bigun! The fish is putting up a fight, but he is reeling this bad boy in. Oh no wait IT'S FREAKIN' GODZILLA and Godzilla is hacked off. But suddenly the 1000 tonne monster who is as tall as a skyscraper runs off and disappears... in Manhattan... and this brings me on to my first point.Through out the movie Godzilla frequently comes out of nowhere and does some godzillarly stuff then runs off again into Manhattan and disappears. I don't know that much about Godzilla, but I doubt he employs the tactic of a black man in Philly and does drive-bys.Another problem with the movie is there is a giant monster running around, destroying Manhattan... so who do the US Army call on for help? a Dinosaur expert? a weapons specialist? No, a guy who researches worms. To add insult to injury, this worms expert completely ignores the US Army and enlists the help of the France's answer to the CIA, Jean Reno, but that's okay, because he is as cool as a cucumber.Overall, I'd have more fun attaching jump leads to my nipples.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, Iam sick and tired of people bashing this movie. It has great action, a decent story, decent acting, and incredible visuals. How much worse could it get? Godzilla is about a lizard that was mutated by all the nuclear testings going on in the Pacific. It then travels too New York for an unknown purpose. Godzilla then makes landfall and wreaks havoc on the streets of the Big Apple. They set traps too try to kill Godzilla, but to no prevail. The main character than gets a blood sample and found out that "he's pregnant", and that he came to New York too nest. I won't say anything else. I think people didn't like this film mainly because they say that this Godzilla didn't have the spirit of the original. Well duh, if it did, than people wouldn't remember the older Godzilla films. All in all, a good film that should definitely be checked out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now to the Several Bad Points.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only so far American directed and produced Godzilla film. Dean Delvin (producer) and Roland Emmerich (director) were the idiots behind this film and this movie is a sheer disappointment to me on several levels. With such a big budget, of course being an American film, they were so many possibilities crushed by these two 'geniuses'. To begin this review I'll mention a few positive notes. A very few. First off, obviously, the special effects and budget is bigger than any Godzilla film before or after it. The CGI is put to good use and GINO (Godzilla In Name Only) does look decent. There were some all right action scenes, but nothing to get too excited about. And that's about it...Now to the bad points. For starters, this shouldn't even been called a Godzilla movie. GINO looks nothing like Godzilla! Instead of seeing the imposing reptilian, original, looking-monster we get a mutant iguana who is now an asexual T-Rex with no heat ray with NO HEAT RAY!!! Who also is from time to time actually running away from the military! Also, none of the other G-films exist in this film's timeline, not even "Gojira"! Not a single reference or at least a cameo is made to any G-film or Japanese monster cinema in general! How crappy is that?! Secondly, I didn't like the cast, some who were bad actors. They only added to the non Godzillaness of the movie. Thirdly, the mood of the film is horrible. Godzilla was a victim of the H-bomb test. An invincible incarnation and physical manifestation of the Atomic Bomb. Even in the kiddy and campy days, Godzilla wasn't the giant mutant tarantula or grasshopper of the American 60s and 70s monster films. He was a different type of monster who broke the formula, something original. GINO is just the modern CGI version of those American crap monsters, a giant animal who was killed by jets pathetically. Which brings me to my next point- GINO is too weak and cowardly. Godzilla was invulnerable to tank shells and missiles and did not fear them. He in fact crushed them like bugs. Most of the actual city action/destruction was thanks to the military's bad aim, not GINO. Who, as mentioned before, runs away!! WTF? He wasn't even a threat really. Just a misunderstood giant asexual lizard who's only danger to society is comparable to that of multiplying locust and rabbits.I see Dean Delvin and Rolland Emmerich's whole scheme: Make a modern day giant monster film and to ensure its success they needed to use the name of the most popular monster on Earth: Godzilla. That's all they did, use his name. Those two had no respect for Godzilla, or the Japanese sci-fi genre at all. If they had, it certainly wouldn't have came out like this. That's one reason why I like "Godzilla: Final Wars". We finally see the real Godzilla blast GINO off the face of the Earth in a brisk 30 seconds!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>legendary... waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich does not make movies. Roland Emmerich is a human resources specialist in charge of devising schemes to hire thousands of carpenters, painters, explosives experts, CGI hacks, and marginally employable actors in constructing showy, noisy demonstrations of Hollywood's ability to donate money to pop-corn vendors.The big tip-off to the rip-off is that the monsters here are just plain ugly - and not in a monstrous sort of way but in a "worst graphics I've seen in a computer game" way.The story, a ponderous, overblown, overlong remake of 'Beast from 20,000 Fathoms' (uncredited) doesn't seem to have any real focus, stumbling along through B-movie clichés, pseudo-romantic comedy, Spielberg-style action film, without much terror or monster-bite. The dialog is sub-childish, which is why the actors avoid wasting whatever little talent they possess in trying to energize it.The original Godzilla films may be dated - the whole Godzilla phenomenon really belongs to the 20th Century - but at least the Toho left a body of work that stands as something of a legend.There's something legendary about Emmerich's film, too - it's a legendary waste of time and money. Don't waste yours over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disaster movie in all the sense of the word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think about this movie, the first word that comes to my mind is disaster. Why? Not because of the events caused by Godzilla, not because the destruction of the City; but because of the messed caused by the script and the typical Hollywoodesque situations.Overall, the plot is not that bad but it's poorly executed. To make this worse, the action is fast paced but not that spectacular like say, "Independence Day" or "Men In Black". We don't care about the characters or their sub-plots, we only care about good old Godzilla who happens to have minimal on-screen time and never manages to make a decent appearance.The important situation is that the movie is visually stunning and is held by memorable sequences (the eye for example). Plus there were many interesting things behind the movie: the MTV support that always helps a movie to be successful, the Puff Daddy "Come With Me" song (poor Jimmy Page), and of course the monster itself.I would only recommend this movie if it airs on Sunday morning or when you don't have anything else to do. Overall, a mediocre disaster or monster movie that didn't have economic success because it never defined where it tried to go.</fullReview>

Instead the producers and directors were so intent on having so many inside jokes and "bon mots" that the story is just lost. Also, having so many comedic actors was distracting. Matthew Broderick? Harry Shearer? Hank Azaria? More suited to light comedy fare. Not a disaster movie. Which ended up making this a disaster of a movie. And what was with all the rain? I felt drenched after watching this. I hope that someone somewhere decides to update godzilla, and do it the way it should have been done this time. With a sense of responsibility, and without putting in silly grudges. And with some decent acting. A nice script. God...the list goes on and on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and it made me hate this movie even more. Not that Godzilla could ever be Cloverfield; Godzilla requires back story and context whereas Cloverfield completely avoids both, but when it comes to sheer monster butt kicking, Cloverfield shows Roland Emmerich how it SHOULD have been done. WOW, did his version of "Godzilla" SUCK.I'm still mad about it... nearly 10 years later and I can still remember the abject disappointment I felt walking out of that theater. I was a Godzilla fan since I was probably 6. Watched the cartoon every Saturday morning (Godzookie!). Started getting into the TOHO movies when I was a teenager, then, THIS piece of crap hits. The CGI wasn't bad for it's time, but, like pretty much every Emmerich movie, the script and plot were ATROCIOUS. Too bad he didn't have the sense that J.J. Abrams has; make an awesome 35 story monster, then get the hell out of the way. Instead we got dialogue like this:NICKYou just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.AUDREYThat was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.NICKMost people don't.AUDREYI'm sorry you feel that way.Audrey turns and walks away. Nick regrets his behavior and calls after her.NICKWait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea? OH GOD... I think I'm going to get sick all over again... I don't remember who the actress was that played "Audrey" but I think this movie pretty much sunk her. Thankfully, Broderick's career survived.

		<shortDescription>And settle for less? I think not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, you'll read lots of critiques ranging from people who are purists of the Gojira franchise to those with less expectations for a monster movie. I've read some reviews here that sound frustrated about purists not being satisfied. They want them to accept the movie for what it was. A special effects laden movie and nothing more.Well.. I'm going to say one word followed by reason. "NO"Gojira fans deserve much better for a movie that claimed itself to be the revolution of Godzilla just because of its use of amazing CGI.This movie bombed. Pure and simple. It sucked and you will have more agree to that than the otherwise. The film director took a beloved creature which was created in Japan based off of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Radioactive residue turning a lizard into a mutant giant monster.The sole idea here, was that the monster was basically created by our stupidity with warfare activities that took place a long time ago. Something that emerged from our wrong doings. A giant monster karma of a problem to put it in short words. This monster wasn't evil. But it had the instincts of an enraged creature seeking exploration of its surroundings and clashing with humans for the second time.The film, Godzilla 1985 (Gojira 1984 in japans aka Gojira Returns), pretty much successfully set that idea and created a very respected, inspiring and intense movie that was ahead of its own time. The 80s.This new American Godzilla film however, changed and denied 80% of the original creator's intention and turned our beloved monster into gargantuan mush.And for those who are saying "who cares, its just a monster movie", you're a disgrace to the G-fan base whether you care so or not. Therefore your sub-standard ideals about movie quality no longer hold weight to me.I'm the kind of person that pushes a job until it cant be pushed no more. I'm all about top notch quality. Not just visual quality, but EVERYTHING quality. Story had to be much better than this nonsense. It could have been good. Really good. But it really wasn't. It just wasn't. The special effects, amazing in its own respect to the artists behind them, did not aid the movies direction. The major disrespectful approach to change an iconic monster into a chicken legged giant iguana, really let a lot of fans down and with good reason as that thing just wasn't God'fricken'zilla.However... had the film been renamed to its actual now fan labeled name "Zilla", I would have not had been received as badly. Dropping any expectations and possibly even appreciating this movie only as a second rate monster movie. Which would probably have helped it in terms of reputation.And yes, I do understand that this monster is no longer called Godzilla in Japan either. It is now known ONLY as "Zilla" by the Japanese. It was so iffy, they couldn't take in what the American bought license did to their beloved monster. I mean, let's be honest. When the news first leaked out about an American release of Godzilla, we were all hyped up expecting that same powerful iconic nostalgic feeling we got in the 80's when Godzilla first hit Hollywood theaters. IT WAS HUGE NEWS!Thats why many including I, feel this movie was a let down. Quality is everything. As a creator myself, I live by those words. If you adapt to low quality or moderate quality and tell yourself "it was good"... then you will never taste the fruit of a truly great quality production. And Im not going to discuss the Japanese G movies as those were understandably being made on low budgets. What do you expect with little money. :/ But for an American film, I really expected something that would have embedded itself in my memories as well as the memories of our kids today. Sort of like what Godzilla 1985 was back then.Alas, not this time. My chime. And Im sticking to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear. There are some films that probably seemed like a good idea at the time but with the cold hard light of hindsight shouldn't have ever been made. The complete waste of time is a case in point. Forget all the camp action of the classic Toho Godzilla cycle; there is no thinly veiled post Hirosima nuclear paranoia here, no guys in rubber monster suits jumping on plastic kit tanks and swatting 1:72 scale jet fighters off wires. Instead we are faced with some impressive but sadly predictable set piece action sequences, Matthew Boderick with a sickening romantic sub plot, Jean Reno on auto pilot saving the day and Jeff Goldblum rehashing his role from Independence Day and not really giving a damn. In fact this film IS Independence Day but with a large lizard replacing the evil aliens. And yes, just like every other Robert Emmerich film, the good guys win. They zap Big G with the aid of a couple of subs and the Brooklyn Bridge, blitz Godzilla's nest (of course leaving an opening for a sequel) and go home for a slice of 'Moms Apple Pie'. This film not only lacks the camp humour of the Toho originals, but also misses the point of the doomsday monster as mankind's indestructible nemeses, alway there to return to make humanity pay for his crimes against nature. Inshort avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what if it's not the big hit like Star Wars or the huge Oscar winner like The Godfather. Not every movie can be that. This is still good. It's not the kind of movie where everyone who watches it says "Oh my gosh that was the best movie EVER I just have to watch it over and over again!" But it's not the kind of movie where five minutes in you're wondering "Uh, what is this crap?" But after reading some other comments I'm going to try to respond to a few."He doesn't have the screen presence of the original!"Of course it doesn't have real screen presence! It's a computer generated image. But the original was a guy in a rubber suit in a model city. That's about as fake as they come. At least this movie used real locations and put the monster in. Of course since people have nothing to base a fifty story lizard off of it looks real enough. The original is just a guy dressed as a lizard. He moves and acts like a person in a suit. This one actually acts like a giant lizard. If a lizard was fifty stories or so that's probably how it would act."Does he breathe fire or doesn't he?"No! But do real lizards breathe fire? It's hard enough explaining how a fifty story lizard came to be. They don't need to complicate it anymore by having to explain fire breathing."How hard is it really to pronounce Tatopoulos?"It's a joke people! A running gag. If you saw that and didn't hear how it's pronounced could you do better?"The story is unrealistic."It's a movie about a giant lizard. How realistic is it supposed to be? John McClane gets through all of Die Hard with no shoes. Indiana Jones seems to single handedly defeat every single German that comes at him. Axel Foley can solve any crime in Detroit and Beverly Hills. Movies aren't made to be realistic. They're to be entertaining."He goes down way to easily."They seem to hit him with a lot before he actually goes down. Torpedoes, missiles, machine guns. He takes a lot of damage before he dies. Also I think he kind of gave up after all his kids were dead."All the baby Godzillas look like raptors."Alright I'll give you that one. The whole thing with the babies probably could have waited till a sequel to do. It does seem to drag on the movie a little longer than it really needed to be. It doesn't really have you looking at your watch waiting for it to end. The movie is action-packed enough so you're not thinking about the time too much."It's too much like Jurassic Park."You could say the same thing about Star Wars and Star Trek. But those two seem to get along fine."He only runs, he never fights."He has no weapons. He's an animal. Not a person. He could stomp on them I guess but that would probably make him an easier target. He's not stupid. If you were to start shooting things at your cat or dog and it hurt it would it attack you? Probably not. It would probably run from you."It's just not the original."Neither is The Mummy with Brendan Fraser. But for some reason that one's considered a great remake. Both pretty much do the same thing. They both took the basic idea of the original and applied it to a different situation. They couldn't just do exactly what the original did or you get just another Psycho remake. They took the idea of a lizard, enlarged by radiation, coming to modern day America, and how America tries to deal with it. People have seen all those campy monster flicks. You don't keep eating the same breakfast cereal every morning. You got to give audiences something different than what they expect."He doesn't destroy enough."What do you want him to do? Just walk around destroying everything he sees? He's not there to destroy the city. He's there to live, to make a nest. You don't go around destroying your household. He's trying to make New York his home, not a garbage dump. He could go around destroying everything, but for what reason? It would make no sense to have him mindlessly destroy everything."It's GINO (Godzilla In Name Only)."LIGHTEN UP PEOPLE! If you really wanted to see a guy in a rubber suit attacking Tokyo then watch the Japanese movies. This is supposed to be different. It's supposed to not look like the original. If you want to see the Mummy as a well-known member of society then watch the Boris Karloff Mummy. If you want to see the Mummy turn into a wall of sand then watch the Brendan Fraser Mummy. If they did have a guy in a rubber suit you would all be complaining that "It's just copying the original, it's not doing anything different."This is a great movie if you just give it the chance. So at least watch it once. It seems that it's just one of those where you either love it or you hate it. Don't go in expecting the original. The original is a classic in it's own right. It's a good action film that you can take your kids to without worrying about blood, gore, violence, language, etc. The worst part (violencewise) is the ending, which only shows Godzilla getting hit with missiles. Other than that it's pretty clean.It seems to me that there are plenty of people who do like this movie. I like this movie. I bought it. I would like to see a sequel. I think it was well done.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb entertainment but it works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course most blockbuster are 'dumb' and over-the-top movies, with a simple and silly story and shallow characters. "Godzilla" however really pushes it at times. The movie is at times insulting to our intelligence and the story and storytelling is heavily lacking. Still "Godzilla" does what it's supposed to do; It brings more than enough entertainment to have a pleasant evening.The movie has almost totally nothing to do with the Japanese versions of Godzilla (or better said; Gojira.). It has a totally different atmosphere, feeling and approach. "Godzilla" is a very Hollywoodized version of the well known Japanese creature. No wonder most of the fans of the Japanese movies were extremely disappointing with this movie and perhaps even mad. Still, if you have to judge the movie for what it is, you still come to the conclusion that "Godzilla" has an entertainment value.It's too bad that the story and storytelling of it in the movie are so weak. The movie is incredibly simple and the movie lacks some fundamental things, a movie of this proportion needs. The movie lacks a real good and likable main character and exciting memorable scene's. Sure there are action-sequences in the movie but it honestly isn't something that we haven't already seen before. The movie lacks a real feeling of danger and panic. I mean, hello there's a giant lizard walking loose in New York, causing mayhem but yet nobody is busy surviving or is in real panic. Some of the elements in the movie are unbelievably bad and insulting to the viewer's its intelligence. It's just all too simple to leave a real lasting impression. Also the dialog is just plain bad at times.The special effects are good. Seriously, come on what is everybody complaining about? The special effects are convincing, especially considering that this is a 1998 movie. Yes, the movie is made deliberately dark and rainy to conceal the fact that the special effects aren't that advanced yet but hey it works doesn't it? It might not all impress very much but it's all very convincing looking.Roland Emmerich certainly isn't a bad blockbuster movie-maker but he really pushed it with this movie at times. There are still some good and entertaining moments in the movie which all still makes this movie a very watchable one. Also the musical score from action-movie composer David Arnold is quite good.Good enough entertainment, that perhaps deserves just a little bit more credit than it's getting right now at the moment.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but too Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I don't consider this a Godzilla movie at all. No wonder Godzilla-fans call this Godzilla "GINO" ("Godzilla In Name Only"). This is because the Godzilla here doesn't look like the real Godzilla at all, but more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. I just don't get why Hollywood so often have to make own versions that tend to be worse than the originals. Anyway, if you forget all the Godzilla-stuff, then this is an OK disaster movie. Taking place mostly in Manhattan, New York, I guess everyone can figure out what happens. The movie is entertaining and has some good special effects, but I think they should have ended it much earlier. The last 20-25 minutes was really too much, as it had been more than enough action in the movie before that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Really Awful!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry to say this is one of the worst disaster flicks I've have ever seen. The monster looks fake cross between the Alien and a T-Rex. I'm actually watching it right now and I can't believe how bad the acting is. The whole opening scene is dumb Godzilla is supposed to be a dinosaur not a mutated iguana. Also so far nobody has gotten eaten nor does it look like much damage to NYC at least in ID4 the totally wrecked NY. too bad that they couldn't have created something similar to the original movies. Also the scene with the baby zilla's is a bad rip-off of Jurassic Park.If I could I would give this hunk of junk 0 stars!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of the big green monster I was excited when this movie came out. What could be better than a new Godzilla flick, in English, fancy graphics and set in my home city? Everything. I'd rather watch the old 70's Godzilla cartoon than this, at least that was slightly funny.This movie made me wish I was blind and deaf. I gained a greater love and appreciation for a cheesy green suit with a man inside of it. I never knew I would miss that so much. This movie proves one thing: Better graphics doesn't make a better movie.I honestly regret seeing this, and add it to the top of my "Movies that should not have been made" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent underrated G-Flick **** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been almost 7 years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you, when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't disappointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people (and Godzilla fans) that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's "Godzilla".There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' at least, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you, you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about, after all.And what was wrong with the monster itself, Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in a lot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being a laugh-fest at the theaters.What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original, that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts, but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got a lot of attention, unfortunately, and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy it for what it is.This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects, there's nothing quite like it.So take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as "GODZILLA".</fullReview>

I should have waited for all the negative reviews to come pouring in. Ferris Bueller is in this movie, but that doesn't save it. Hank Azaria can't save it! The special effects couldn't save it. Jean Reno didn't even need to be in it! The monster looks faker than the old-school "man-in-suit" version. Somewhere in the middle of this movie it turns into Jurrasic Park in Madison Square Garden. Now MSG does not have the greatest rep. I mean the Rangers suck so bad they haven't made the playoffs in 7 seasons! But still... No need to disgrace the place with this garbage! Poo on a stick. I would criticize the plot but there was no plot. Big monster comes to NYC and thrashes it. What is with this new trend in movies where NYC get trashed? Why not Memphis or Atlanta? Why is it always MY beloved city? Think about it. All those meteor movies, disaster movies, etc. Its always the Empire State building falling or Grand Central burning up. Enough! Godzilla should be trashing Tokyo! OK, so if you don't believe me, go watch it. Go ahead... I'll wait... ...Done yet? OK. Was I right? It sucked? I TOLD YOU! Oh well.

		<fullReview>Basically the movie is about a shallow drama between an ambitious and underhanded news reporter and a wimpy scientist, and you end up not giving a damn about either one of them. The fact that Godzilla is trashing New York in the background is given secondary importance, and after knocking down a few buildings he gets caught up in a suspension bridge and stays there anyway.This movie could easily have gone places, but as it was it's ineptly handled and falls flat on every level. Not nearly as entertaining as an original 70's Godzilla movie. This was simply a merchandizing vehicle, and a rather sad one at that.Rate 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't want to see this movie because I have heard and read too many bad things about Godzilla. But anyway, I watched it yesterday. The movie was so stupid and boring, what I can't find enough words to describe it. The plot was incredible lame, love story between Dr. Tatoupolos and Audrey so weak! But, more importantly, whole cast team looks incredibly poor. I really wonder, how Rolland Emmerich, who directed Stargate, Independence Day and The Patriot (not a great movies but highly entertained and well shot) could make so bad movie. Watch Jurassic Park movies (second and third of course not so good as first but they are at least watchable) or original King-Kong instead. Not recommend to anyone, except huge fans of monster's movies. Maybe they can find something interesting in this true disappointment. Personally I suppose that Godzilla is a strong candidate for worst movie of the year and excellent example that visual effects without good story and acting mean only waste of money and nothing more.My vote: plot 3, cast 3, sound 5, visual effects 6, stupidity 9 - overall 3,5/10 Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

They are clearly far more interested in big CGI lizards and things going boom, and they can't even get those things right (the CGI, though technically impressive, does not look at all real).Think of all the films Wes Anderson could have made with this one crappy movie's budget, and weep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One or two times I've ended up in an arguement over "Godzilla"; I think it's like 2 hours on a non-monotonous - try saying that 5 times on a row really fast :)- roller-coaster. The plot is as foamy as cotton candy, but I find the key characters likeable (especially Reno and the title monster). There's eye-popping FX, a swift pace and a good sense of humour. The movie doesn't take itself seriously, but a lot of people seem to take- specifically this- seriously! They're bashing "Godzilla" with almost rage, but movies like "Armageddon", "Tomb Raider" or "Mummy" are done away with a simple shrug of shoulders and "Well, I just didn't like it..." Well, I like Godzilla. Four stars out of five.SPOILER: Especially I liked the multiple endings, and how the (pretty lame) "T-Rex as Godzilla"- finale of "The Lost World" gets payed back in spades with "Little Godzillas as Velociraptors". THAT right about sums the attitude of this movie up... great popcorn flick!PS. Hey, mr. Lucas, action and coherent material do matter...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll risk getting stoned to death by saying....I liked this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone hates this movie pretty much unanimously, but because I have a bit of a reputation for liking that which everyone hates, I'll say I liked "Godzilla." The special effects were good, the characters pretty well-developed, the acting top-notch (especially from Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno), and the story feasible, despite some minor indescrepencies (such as how Dr. Tatopoulis was able to figure out Godzilla was pregnant using a pregnancy detector designed for humans?! Gimme a break..). The only problem I had with this movie is that hardly any of the characters were likeable. The Mayor, the army, the navy, Dr. Tatopoulis' girlfriend, the girlfriend's boss....they were all a bunch of jerks, to put it mildly. The only characters I liked were Dr. Tatopoulis himself, Animal the cameraman (Can't go wrong with Hank Azaria!) and the Frenchmen (okay, I just liked the leader and the two who survived the initial Baby Godzilla attacks). Everyone else were annoying, stupid, and mean. I've never been that big a fan of the original Japanese Godzilla movies (beyond the chilling original, "Godzilla 1985," and the cute, funny "Son of Godzilla"), so in my own opinion, this is an improvement over the B-grade popcorn flicks everyone says are so great.I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why oh why did I not heed everyone's warning about this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with my expectations set at a very low level, this American 'interpretation' of Godzilla was genuinely painful to watch.Yes, I knew it would not be the same as the good ol' Japanese Goji films I'm familiar with. It's drastically different, in fact. The American Godzilla is a good deal smaller than the oriental original, and also a bit more polite. Whereas any kaiju monster worth it's salt would go ploughing right -through- the buildings of whatever city it'd find in it's way, Ameri-Goji has been brought up well and politely walks along the streets, merely scratching one or two buildings. Heck, with the way the buildings actually tower over the monster instead of vice-versa, it's not surprising that the military end up doing more damage than the monster does. Seeing a skinny lizard taking a walk along some American buildings I've never heard of is not my idea of a fierce monster turning a giant metropole (preferably Tokyo) into a sea of fire and debris. Compared to the Asian example, the American Goji is a monster-wimp. While initially disappointing to anyone who likes proper giant monster flicks, this different approach is not the problem. If they had done a different-style monster movie that was actually any good, the whole world would not be spitting vomit all over this film. Alas, they screwed up very royally. As soon as any of the characters opens his mouth to utter a sentence from the hopeless script, the whole thing falls to pieces."But it's a giant monster movie, so of course the plot is a bit daft and the characters aren't fascinatingly deep! It's what you should expect!", is the standard rebuttal to anyone pointing out this film's multiple flaws. Only it doesn't work so easily. You can aim for a light-plot, silly 'fun' movie and get that wrong too, after all. And that's just what happened here; you can tell whenever the writers thought they were being terribly witty, exciting or even thoughtful with a certain line. And you can also immediately tell how wrong they were. When the characters make an attempt at being funny, likeable or showing some kind of personality (maybe even -shock!- character development), they fall flat on their faces with a loud thwack and only appear... well, stupid, really. They look stupid, sound stupid and behave in an incredibly stupid fashion. And when they're not being dopey, they're downright detestable. Matthew Broderick plays a whiny git who's face you'll want to smack in, "Animal" is the biggest cretin to have ever walked the earth, and then... there's Maria Pitillo. Oh, the sheer horror of it. If there is a silver lining to the cloud of this movie, it's that we can rest assured that she has forever killed off her "acting career" with her downright ridiculous under-performance in this film. It says a lot when one person manages to stand out as the absolute worst spot in an overall extremely bad movie.Even the monster itself isn't safe from the bad script. Here and there, attempts are made to evoke sympathy for the creature as being just an animal trying to survive. It doesn't work, though, and ends up looking like everything else in this movie - an embarrassingly failed attempt at being clever and cool. But then again, it's difficult to get really excited about a monster that's really just a big load of computer pixels on the screen.There are so many other things terribly wrong with this film that one could fill an entire book with it (actually, that has already been done with the novelisation of this movie). Honorable mention goes out to the ludicrously ill-timed cuts from scene to scene which show especially painfully in the beginning of the film, and look utterly dreadful. Other examples; the monster is a wuss, for the aforementioned reasons - far too small and tame, hardly destructive, and possible to kill by puny helicopters. And that calls itself a kaiju? Or some typical American arrogance in an attempt to make the French look like a nation of evil psychopathic snobs - but even that goes wrong, as Jean Reno turns the joke around by being the only one in this film who seems to be somewhat in his right mind, lost in a sea of idiotic Americans. And the list goes on. It's just all depressingly dumb and all too obvious that this film fails hopelessly at anything it attempts. Maria Pitillo may not be able to act out a crying scene to save her life, but even she probably cried real, convincing tears before the finished product.Unless you're looking for good documentation on how -not- to do a movie, stay well away. Any of the 1970's kiddie-oriented Godzilla movies, with their ridiculous special effects and daft plots floor this sad attempt hand-down (the 1990's and 2000's Goji films blow this into orbit by just breathing at it). Quite simply because the staff knew what they were doing and had put some effort into delivering films that, while not deep or intelligent were plain good fun. There's a right way and a wrong way of doing everything, after all. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this since it played in theaters in 1998, but if memory serves me right, the title sequence was low-key and evocative, very well-done. But after that, the picture goes way down. Matthew Broderick is miscast horrendously as a heroic type, and Maria Pitillo is a terrible actress, playing an absurd character. As in "Independence Day", the producers start off with the attack, so that there's nothing really to climax. The Japanese Godzilla and his ilk and all those wonderful 1950s monster mashes always had the delirious rampages in the final acts. The film has an annoying rainstorm in New York City during most of the proceedings, and is almost always at night. Is this to cover up inadequate CGI effects? The trailer seen months before had the famous Godzilla roar, but here he looks or sounds NOTHING like the Japanese classic dragon/tyrannosaurus/stegosaurus. The creature breathes no fire, makes little sounds or even tramples buildings. He even disappears half-way through the film! The climax is assinine since a taxi can not outrun a 200-foot animal.

		<fullReview>I have just watched Godzilla on DVD and had to add a comment on this film. I remember all the fuss over the team from ID4 making a bit of a stinker with Godzilla. I for one was pretty happy after seeing the film in the cinema (at least three times). I expected to see a large lizard smashing things up and that was pretty well what I got. Having now rewatched Godzilla on DVD I have to say that there are some really outstanding moments. The effects in general are very very good and sound is impressive, this might be down to the DVD transfer but they are only really as good as the original so the original must be pretty damn good. I still find myself rooting for Godzilla and the ending is very sad indeed. Only two complaints the baby Godzillas are a complete waste of time and the human characters tend to fall into that category too. So for a smashing good time with the best CGI monster to date give Godzilla a second chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I've already commented on this movie, but I'd like to respond to some of the indignant defenses I've seen since. I didn't go in looking for "Gone With the Wind," "The Sound of Music" (ugh!), or "American Beauty". I went in looking for a summer blockbuster in the "ID4" &amp; "Jurassic Park" tradition. What I got was a summer blockbuster in the "ID4" and "Jurassic Park" tradition THAT WASN'T AS GOOD AS EITHER.Special effect movies are like a drug, anyway--the next high has to be better than the one before. In this case, said high didn't even come close. "Jurassic Park" had my pulse pounding a lot harder than "Godzilla" did, or could. When you have worthless effects in a special effects movie, you're in trouble.The plot was not only derivative of movies, it was derivative of BOOKS. The whole find-the-hidden-nest thing is straight out of the end of the novel version of "Jurassic Park" (the sequence didn't make it into the movie). The numerous rip-offs from other films would be fine IF the creators were trying to do a spoof, as Wes Craven did in "Scream." As it is, they're just betraying their creative bankruptcy and hoping we won't notice. I go to movies to be entertained, not insulted.That leaves the acting, and I'm sorry, but even in effects movies it should be less pathetic than they are here. Take Laura Dern in "Jurassic Park" and Maria Pitillo here--is there even remotely a comparison? The "Star Wars" scripts were equally clunky, but Harrison Ford never phoned in a performance the way Matthew Broderick does here. Jean Reno is tolerable, but only just.All in all, "Godzilla" has very little to recommend it. If you like it, fine, but if you're really honest with yourself, you'll see that it takes a distant second place to almost every other movie in its class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are back alley muggings and then there's Godzilla. The biggest rip off from a movie this decade. Highly hyped and highly anticipated, this movie was an absolute disgrace to movie making. The best way to describe this one is that Godzilla shows up and then a bunch of stuff happens. Nothing in this movie made any logical sense. I think this is the second movie that I felt like getting up in the middle of and leaving (the first was Mortal Kombat 2). At no point in this movie did it look like Godzilla was in the city of New York, all the buildings that Godzilla was running by or through look the same. The computer effects were horrible and Godzilla himself looked horrible. Half way through it it turns into Jurasic Park's raptor scence. This is another movie thrown together for the sake of making a movie. They hype the movie, made a good trailor for it and throw in a half decent sound track and a load of merchandise to take advantage of all the naive, less eduacated citizens of this country that work hard for their money. If there is such thing as education than this has to be the opposite. This movie kills brain cells and there should be a health warning on it. Absolute idiocy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to ruin one of the most successful formulas of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up with the real Godzilla series and Ultraman. A childhood spent on these movies and shows proved one thing to me, Americans can't do stuff like this. Well, the American giant monster movie that calls itself Godzilla (not to mention the aborted American Ultraman series) proved my theory beyond a shadow of a doubt. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich succeded in botching one of the most successful movie formulas of all time. These two jokers claimed to be fans of the original movies but you wouldn't be able to tell it from this movie. It's bad enough that their monster doesn't act like the real deal but he doesn't even look like him either! Godzilla is one of the single most recognizable movie characters in the world but the filmmakers decided to use the tired old "we are Americans, we can do it better" argument. Well they're Americans all right and they gave us just about the lamest exscuse for a movie monster ever to be seen on the silver screen. The powerful Godzilla who plows through anything and everything in the real series is replaced with a goofy looking CGI beast who runs away from a fight like a coward. And don't get me started on Mathew Broderick. I can't think of anything more insulting to the collective intelligence of the human race that to cast this pathetic exscuse in movies. Bottom line is this, the Japanese and the Japanese alone make good giant monster movies. It's something no one else can do and the American movie proved it. Devlin and Emmerich finally got the critical and box office beating they deserved for Independence Day with their giant monster con job. At least one good thing came of this. Toho realized their mistake and decided to start making the films again themselves. Thank God for small miracles.</fullReview>

I don't know why before the movie they didn't just have a little monologue from the director taunting "You're all stupid for coming to see this!". That's the way I felt when I left the theater. Now, aside from the fact I didn't know whether or not we were supposed to feel sorry for the Godzilla, or whether it was supposed to be scary and evil; I found it to be rather....shameful. I feel as if Hollywood thinks that if there is cool special effects and lots of explosions, it won't matter that the whole story line stinks like last weeks trash on a hot July afternoon.</fullReview>

An American, high-budget translation of the classic, campy Japanese "Gojira" movies, this time overrevamped with computerized polygonal special effects and an obnoxiously loud soundtrack. The best part of the movie was the taxi that never died - it was chomped by Godzilla, fell off a highway, crashed into walls repeatedly -- and still ran great! That part provided all the amusement. The rest of the movie was substandard -- from the braindead journalist to the horrible comic situations.

One moment he's frolicking in a subway tunnel, the next he's obliterating a skyscraper. It's as if they couldn't decide whether they were going for a T-Rex look or... well, Godzilla.I'd say more, but I've already given the movie more attention than I'd care to.(The scariest part of the movie?

		<fullReview>The chance to introduce a Godzilla for the next generation is completely wasted in this over-length and under-developed film. The plot, such as it is, involves an iguana mutated by French nuclear testing. The giant lizard instantly makes for the heart of a city to lay its eggs. Slightly odd behavior. The 'storyline' is down there with the worst of the Japanese series, the characters are all just cardboard cutouts of the kind usually found in bottom-of-movie-barrel Friday the 13th-type slasher films, the plot is ridden with holes and there is a stunning lack of originality, the producers having lifted ideas out of everything from Jurassic Park to Aliens. The big monster itself is hardly visible through the rain and grey skies, but maybe that's for the best seeing as it looks so ridiculous with its gangly arms and legs and Desperate Dan chin. The baby monsters are just laughable, obvious CGI creations. There's no sense of awe or danger in the film, it's all just one long vehicle for CGI effects which often fail to seem real. Tedious, uninspiring and forgettable. Commercialism at its most sickeningly blatant.Size does matter? Strange statement from a film which requires the viewer to have an IQ of less than 10 to capable of fully appreciating it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely the spectacle of a movie like 'Godzilla' is its raison d'etre? Even if it's unevenly cast, badly scored and overlong you should leave the cinema with its set pieces etched into your brain. 'Godzilla' is so far from being even a quarter-decent B-movie that my sense of wonder was finally only inspired by the ineptitude of its makers. For anyone who thinks that making a brainless, fun, monster movie with a big budget is easy, look how badly it can all go wrong! I felt as if I were watching a first,lazy, REALLY lazy cut with all the flab and the extraneous dialogue and needless subplots and cutaways left intact. The effects are nowhere near good enough to stand up to close scrutiny: (check out the scenes of Godzilla v. submarine and see if there is ANY sense of scale conveyed whatsoever.) The pacing is the worst I have ever seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie, and I've seen plenty of ropey movies in my time. But beyond all of this, the greatest sense of the movie I was left with was one of sadness and sympathy for the tragically brilliant Hank Azaria who acts as if he thinks he's in a movie 700% better than the one he's actually appearing in, for Maria Pitillo and her thankless wet lettuce role, unfairly savaged half to death in most of the reviews I read at the time of release, and Jean Reno for bringing his brand of dignity to a film that in no way deserved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Godzilla" was a movie I was expecting to be really great. After "Independence Day" (the BEST film of its kind, in my opinion) I began to look at Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin as two of the best up-and-comers in their genre. Then I read where they have somehow decided to take the drama element out of their scripts. I'm sorry, fellas, but it was the drama of your earlier movies that made them so great and different. It was the characters that you actually can relate to and care about. In "Godzilla" there is nothing to grasp onto. No dimensions. Not even a slight sense of realism.Let's see if I can sum up this lazy, size-is-everything movie. There's a boyfriend who is a really bad actor who likes a blond girl who is an even worse actress who has a couple of annoying friends that just kind of stand around and try to make the audience laugh. There's a hunter guy with an accent who really looks like he can lend a lot to the situation until the action actually begins after which he really doesn't do much of anything. There's a played-for-laughs mayor who also tries to slay the audience with his humor and fails. Oh, yeah, there's a really, really big lizard, too.So, that about sums it up. You have no reason to subject yourself to this horrible mess of a movie now. Save yourself the money and self-respect. Rent "Independence Day" and pray Roland and Dean come back to their senses.</fullReview>

Uh oh, it lays eggs (it's a-sexual!) in madison square garden. Submarines chase Godzilla down in the East river (or wherever it was) and blast it with missiles. It dies but we're not sure. Then eggs hatch (200 of them) with Ferris, his pretty ex-fiancée, Hank Azaria, and french hero guy in the Garden. But godzillies get blown up without Ferris and everyone else dying. Ferris kisses the girl. But soft, Godzilla lives, and he's pissed. But Ferris and friends out-race it and lure it to the Brooklyn bridge. It gets blasted with missiles on the bridge when it gets tangled in the support wires. It dies, heroic cheers ensue, the end...But soft! A baby godzilla egg survived the blast! Part 2 look out!Now you don't need to watch it. Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.ok, now for the comment: this flick annoyed the hell out of me. Here's why:-about half-an-hour is wasted to show people with wide eyes and dropped jaws, frozen stiff every time they see the thing. I realize people probably would indeed be frozen with fear, but for the movie and our sake, RUN! We don't need to see them stare every single time.-it took an hour before we saw the damn thing's face.-for God's sake, helicopters can fly vertically.-cliche, cliche, cliche. It's only an action/fantasy movie, but for crap's sake, they could have used different methods in presenting this movie to us. eg, different lines, camera angles, methods of keeping us in suspense. I was rolling my eyes in the first minute of the movie.-basically, it's been done before, only Speilberg actually presented a movie with newer methods of suspense, and too many films after it have ripped him off, this one was the last straw.I actually yelled in the middle of the movie, out of anger, because I was so ****ed off. Every line, every scene, every camera angle, every character, was played. The effects are fine but they were done 4 years ago. I have a feeling that this movie was meant to be a cult classic. You know, bad but yet people love it. Well, I hated it. After careful consideration, I've determined that it's my most hated film. Well, at least it affected me. Movies are supposed to do that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really amazed: Roland Emmerich dared to actually turn Godzilla into the most ridiculous rip-off of "Jurassic Park". And a poor man's Jurassic Park it became. We see T-Rex in New York, for 2 hours. If the special effects would have improved compared to the original there would have been at least a minor reason to see this trash. But they didn't improve. In fact , they are much inferior - that's probably the reason why 90 % of the CGI effects take place in darkness and pouring rain. To conceal their unrealistic looks. But then again, who would complain about the effects if the film was thrilling and fun ? We have an extremely weak script here that bores us with cardboard characters who keep saying the same old unoriginal lines over and over. It's really hard to keep yourself from thinking "I could have written this when I was 10". At the premiere I attended in Germany, about 1/4 of the audience left the cinema prior to the ending. I wasn't one of them, but I wish I hadn't wasted 2h of my lifetime with such a boring, unentertaining film. I'd hope Emmerich will spare the world with a sequel, but of course he won't.</fullReview>

Being a fan of the old, cheesy yet lovable Godzilla, I was shocked with the lack of care that had been taken in the preservation of this film icon. While the big lizard may have been cliched and kitched, the images of a man running around in rubber suit destroying cardboard cities contained something this SFX-driven film does not. Soul. Roland, I think it's time to go back to go back to Germany and learn to make films that are driven on plot, rather than flashy special effects. You've done it once before (with Moon 44) and I'm sure with a little effort and patience you can do it again.The scariest thing about Godzilla is that Emmerich and Devlin have been approached by Sony to create their rival James Bond series, should MGM loose it's pending court case. This I find much more frightening than any 50 foot tall, mutant lizard that decides to go romping through my backyard.</fullReview>

Next, onto the real star, the lizard. It was one of the least frightening things I've ever seen, and nothing more than a stripped down version of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park. The only device in the movie that appeared to take more than ten minutes to come up with, Godzilla the creature was one big yawn. Nothing in this movie was original in the least.

		<fullReview>Gojirah, or Godzilla as he is known in the west, has always been a bit of an embarrassment to the rest of us Lizards. He likes to brag about how popular and well-loved he is in Japan but the evidence in the west is far from conclusive. Let's face it, Godzilla films are what you watch after 14 pints of lager and a chicken vindaloo, late on a Friday night on channel 4. If you hadn't drunk 14 pints of lager there wouldn't be any conceivable reason for watching a Godzilla film. Ever since I heard that Roland Emmerich was going to remake Godzilla my question has been ? why? Now I've seen the film and I still want my question answered ? why make a new, very expensive film about some has-been reptilian for whom we lost all respect many years ago? We'll probably never know.The plot, such as it is, finds Godzilla munching his way through Manhattan whilst Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and assorted military types try to hunt him down and kill him. There are two types of military involved ? the usual Americans and the French secret service (guess who). Broderick is pretty good and Reno is too, though he only seems to ever play variations on his Leon character these days. Broderick's love interest, played by Maria Pitillo, (don't ask me, never heard of her) is very very irritating and sets back the cause of women's liberation by several decades. It's noticeable in this film that the women are all idiots. Mind you, so are all the men. A couple of the military guys are quite well portrayed but in general the characterisation is abysmal throughout.The film, like many these days, is too long. The first half hour in particular is so dreadful that I really thought about leaving. But then it picks up, at least in terms of action. The effects are pretty good though not the best I've ever seen. Godzilla being pursued by choppers through the Manhattan skyscrapers works well though when you stop to think about it you can see that they really are models and not skyscrapers. Godzilla chasing various folks through Manhattan is also good, especially the final chase. But I have to concur with the chap I overheard talking to his mate in the Gents after the film ? "I liked the bits with the little 'uns in best." Yes, not content with one Godzilla, Emmerich also serves us up with several hundred freshly hatched Godzillaettes for our brave heroes to battle it out with.The egg scenes are pinched from the first Alien film, no question. (Godzilla's head is surprisingly like the Alien head too.) The flashlights used in these scenes even simulate the strobe effects in Alien. The little Godzillas are basically Spielberg's raptors but lots of them. Actually I think Emmerich does it better than Spielberg and the raptors, sorry small Godzillas, are the highlight of the film. As you might expect, Reno, Broderick and co walk unscathed through the raptors whilst minor French secret service types get eaten, even though they are not wearing red jerseys.Anyway, it was nice to see uncle Godzilla back on form. Don't bother turning up until the film has been running for 30 minutes, don't expect too much but enjoy the effects and the mini-Godzillas. Oh, and I bet you 50p that you can guess what the very last scene in the film is before it ever arrives.PS Please resist drinking Pepsi, buying a Swatch watch or renting a video from Blockbuster on your way home from the cinema. This film has the most blatant product placements I have ever seen and they really intrude in several key scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monster of a Bomb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I distinctly remember the ridiculous amount of hype surrounding this re-incarnation of the beloved Japanese classic, prior and during its theatrical release. Sadly as well, I remember falling victim to it myself.*********The Following May Contain Spoilers*********I'm certain there are countless reviews that go into the Infinite reasons of why this is so bad, so for me going into yet another tirade of such things as the terrible script, lack luster performances, poorly sized perspectives (in one scene the monster crawls through a subway tunnel, in the next hes stepping on sky scrappers), etc. etc. would be redundant. Suffice to say, it is one of the most catastrophic bombs since the dropping of "Little Boy". With apologies to the Japanese people for making what surely seems like a callous comparison to the actual devastation on Hiroshima; I hope the knowledge that in someway this could be seen as an indirect and small form of vengeance, gives some comfort to someone, somewhere, because it certainly offers none in its viewing.If you choose to witness this horror, you should do so knowing full well that it would be easy for anyone to classify such an act as a masochistic one and the humiliation you will feel afterwords may not be of the type you can live with the rest of your life. Take it from someone who actually shelled out money to see this,if the monster could actually defecate, this film would be about the size of it. Though I believe this stinks far worse than that might.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful film that insults the legendary Japanese monster and his fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before one even reads this review lets get one thing straight. This is not and never will be a Godzilla film. This was Hollywood yet again taking a name and using it for nothing more then profit. Or lack there of. Recent films and TV used for name value have also proved to be pure failures or garbage such as Garfield, The Honeymooners (maybe the worst), Kojack, The Manchurian Candidate, Charlie and the Chocolate factory and to many to mention here. If anything it is a poor rip-off of many films, including The Beast from 20,000 fathoms, that was done much better back in the day."Godzilla" starts out in south pacific with French nuclear testing that mutates some islands and some iguanas at the same time. Years later some Japanese fisherman are attacked and their boat sunk. Devlin had to throw in the Japanese fisherman scene to have more than just the "Godzilla" name to his creature......it didn't work. Soon a monster is spotted near the Panama canal and they call in a bumbling worm scientist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Broderick) who is also an expert on atomic energy. After looking at a big footprint he concludes that its a big mutated iguana. It heads north to New York where it makes its appearance and runs through the city for the rest of the movie. The military somehow can't manage to find the creature (yeah I'll buy that) and when they do, they fail miserably to even hurt it. Watch as advanced weapons seemingly miss this creature and hit major buildings in NY. Dr. Nick discovers that the beast is pregnant and is going to make a nest. Dr. Nick soon runs into his old flame Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) a wannabe reporter who is a failure and eventually back stabs Dr. Nick, taking a top secret video for her breaking evening news report. She spills the beans about the monsters asexual reproduction (give me a break) getting Nicko fired from the military committee. Meantime some French have been watching everything and kidnap Nick to go destroy the monster and eggs. The reporters tag along and they find the nest in Madison square garden and the Jurassic park rip-off begins. They manage to escape only to be perused by a now angry monster parent, but lure "it" to the Brooklyn Bridge where F-18s finish it off with some missiles. Nick looks into the creatures eyes and mutters some nonsense reminiscent of yet another movie, King Kong. But of course they do leave an opening for a sequel. Thankfully it hasn't happened.As a life long Godzilla fan you can imagine I was more than upset when this film came out. Not that it was any surprise. I had know through G-Fan since 1996 that this film would be garbage and it was confirmed as more time went by and pictures were revealed of this so called "Godzilla". This is not a Godzilla film in any way, but just a badly written generic monster flick that seems to rip off many films while ruining the legend from Japan. This was one of the most hyped films of 1998 and yet I knew it would fail and it did. Devlin had claimed how "Godzilla" would be far superior and better than the old one. How is that, by running away from the military, not having his trademark radioactive ray, being killed with one rocket and laying eggs? A complete disgrace. The design wasn't all that bad for a creature, but not Godzilla. From the script to the acting, almost everything in this film is just awful. The acting is really bad, the blonde cant act and Broderick is not only terrible, but plays a really stupid scientist that one can't possibly believe would be smart enough to be in the position he is in and defeat this creature. I was surprised that Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer didn't start spouting Simpsons lines halfway through the film. Also, the American military is a complete failure when trying to kill or find the creature. How about follow the foot prints? Through out the movie there are many attempts at humor that fail on all levels. When watching this film, you'll find that much of it is joke, not that the concept is that serious, but the Original Godzilla was somewhat. The script and dialog are terrible, along with a movie that is much to long and relies heavily on movies of the past for ideas. Godzilla (obviously), the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, Jurassic Park, and a little of Kong at the end. Devlin and them ripped of War of the Worlds to make Independence Day. That worked out well I thought, but they failed miserably with Godzilla. The only area I give some credit to in this film are some of the special effects. I am not a fan of CGI by any means, but they were not bad in this film. Even today the CGI in this film holds up to more recent films that have been made. Although that's not saying much. Overall this is a poor film on almost all levels and was a opportunity squandered by Hollywood on what should have been a true Godzilla film. Overall 1 stars out of 10 stick to the Japanese version. Avoid the album as well its infamous for Puff Daddy destroying the legendary Led Zeppelin song Kashmir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody look out, It's NOT GODZILLAAAAAAAA!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year after the success of The Lost World Jurassic Park, This monster flick is what destroyed the dinosaur franchise of the 1990s. I mean really! Just look how ridiculous this version of Godzilla is compared to the real thing. What the hell was Roland Emmerich thinking? Doesn't he follow any of the Godzilla movies at all? This giant mutated iguana or Godzilla wanna be does not compare with the real big G at all! At times like this, I'm just glad that I don't work for Hollywood movie companies. If we wanted a new Godzilla movie I rather have him look like him, Not a poor imitation of him! I can tell that this movie will be long forgotten. These movie makers try too hard! To say the least. That's it! dinosaur movies are doomed to extinction! Period. Watch Independence Day instead. It's a much better Sci-Fi flick. Godzilla 1998 is a complete insult to Harryhausen's monster hit, Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Godzilla 1998 is the worst thing to happen to an icon since New Coke! This film should have been called "Iguana, When Nature Calls". I think the toys that Trendmasters made from this film look a lot better than the monster itself in the movie! Believe me!! This movie makes Juassic Park 3 look like a hit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad... but maybe very bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible spoilers*Let's start with 10 points and count down from there as follows:The first time I watched it I had expected some complete crap but was positively surprised and it was quite fun to watch. I had almost forgotten the entire movie until I watched it again today... bad mistake that I did! Because the real reason for why I didn't remember much of it was because there ISN'T much to remember! There is in fact apart from the first 20 minutes nothing new or unpredictable happening for the rest of the entire film! -1pI liked it that the movie had some humor sprinkled about but for the rest...? The military was stupid, in fact so stupid I wonder how all those guys made it there without shooting themselves by accident on their first day?! Why at all attack a "tall as a skyscraper-creature" with any kind of handguns? Why not just some massive rocket launched cyanide canisters or whatever else?? Because then that thing would have died rather quickly and the viewers wouldn't have been tormented for 2 hours! -1pAlso: The funny thing is that whenever it wasn't necessary any 'zilla, whether small or tall, could run like hell and be quick, but at the time when the food (our heroes) were right in front of their jaws they mainly stood about pretending to be extinct or something! Ever seen a crocodile in a feeding frenzy? I'd say that 20 saltwater crocodiles in Madison Square garden would have given us more action in this movie than these 200 or what 'zillas did! -1pNext thing that irritated me was those helicopter pilots! Still shooting with their miniguns or vulcans or whatever they had (shooting straight at the buildings in front of them) eventho big 'zilla had already speeded around the corner and wasn't visible anymore.... STUPID -1pReno is a cool actor, but what the hell were the French doing in the US staging some secret operation to kill a beast that was the main focus of public attention? Where they maybe thinking that if they killed 'zilla quickly (in the middle of NY) nobody would notice the animal and subsequently not blame the French? -2pThe French agents were just as stupid as the Americans. -1p2 rather equal scenes with ships being destroyed and then a completely stereotypical-non-funny-predicable scene with some old guy fishing on the peer catching big 'zilla, the lure cast out 10 feet ahead of him, the hook getting caught by 'zilla and then the monster speeding at him from 1000 feet away??????? Come on! *Big sigh* so how far did that old man really cast out the lure? 3 or 1000 feet??? -1pWhen the beast was caught in the suspension cables of the bridge it was almost down to a crawl, but when it fell its head fell to the ground... about what? Half a mile further ahead? It really seems that the length of the creature was variable whenever needed for some stupid semi-SHOCK effect. -1pThe little ones did attack (or try to attack) the heroes because of what? Because they smelled like fish! Why did mother/father Godzilla not attack Tatataatapopolous? Didn't he smell like fish after having been part of that fish pile orgy in the middle of the street? -1pAm I down to a total of 1 point yet? No actually I am on 0... So before I put any more effort than needed into razing this rather flavorless movie to the ground I better add that I enjoyed it one time, as mentioned in the beginning, but I will never enjoy it again. It's a bit of a pain that movie! Let your six year olds watch it, they might still get surprised or excited or frightened... unless they haven't watched Steve Ervin (or however his name might be spelled (god bless him)) wrestle with some crocks or unless they haven't watched all Friday the 13th or TCM yet or any other B movie that is slightly more realistic and chilling than this very costly and unnecessary B movie!Good day!</fullReview>

All you people are complaining about bad writing and less than good acting well suck it up. I can assure you the original wasn't exactly L.A. Confidential.

		<shortDescription>More fun than The Phantom Menace (that's not saying much, but still...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On its release, the reviews of Godzilla were depressingly predictable. Excited by pre-release, 'Lost World' bashing hype (the museum trailer is still one of my favourites of all time), a great number of people were obviously disappointed that this was, well, just another monster movie.I have to wonder what these people expect to see when they go to a film like this? I, personally, don't enjoy British gangster movies, so I don't go to see them. If you don't LIKE monster movies, why go and see one?Godzilla is a monster movie. Devlin and Emmerich obviously know the rules for making monster movies, and follow them religiously. Hence, you have a close encounter with the beast, then you're introduced to the ensemble cast of dopey but likable stereotypes (none of whom are the star, naturally), before the creature emerges from the deep to stomp through a famous city and lay it to waste. The effects are great, the musical score is a blinder, and there are more than enough memorable scenes of monster-mashing mayhem to keep this G-Fan happy. It's certainly more fun than Phantom Menace or either of the Jurassic Park sequels. You just can't win making a film like this unfortunately, as so many people are going to immediately turn on it for reasons of their own. It's a shame, as I for one would like to have seen what they would have done with a sequel or two. Oh well, back to Japan for the Big G. At least they love the big lug over there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wholeheartedly agree with the other commenters that say this movie is really bad. It's so bad it's insulting. The script, the dialogue, the acting, not even the special effects are that good. Some are all right, some are very unconvincing. The parts of the dialouge that are supposed to be funny are everything else than funny. No, if you want fun you have to look for other things.Like, the main character says something about them using something to lure Godzilla in. Close-up on three fish lying there nicely stacked. I mean come on! This is like watching a Leslie Nielsen movie.Another even better example is when the main character is speaking about the baby godzillas being born pregnant and could take over the world as the dominant species. They cut to those slack-jawed kids sitting there listening to it, I laughed so hard! It's not quite worth it sitting through all the drivel just for these parts, but still. No, have a look at the original Gojira from the 50's. Great stuff compared to this incoherent tripe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This all-American version of the Japanese fantasy classic is one heck of a Giant Monster Movie (with every cliché in place) which plays more like an unofficial entry in the Jurassic Park series than a genuine "Godzilla" film. The movie's true source is neither Toho nor Spielberg, but Ray Harryhausen and Eugene Lourie's seminal The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), of which Eiji Tsurabaya and Ishiro Honda's original Gojira/Godzilla, King of the Monsters (1954) was itself an uncredited reworking. With its conventionally wooden characters and empty story, the Columbia/Tri-Star CGI epic is an accurate tribute to the traditional matinée entertainments of the 1950's. Emmerich's popcorn Godzilla is no work of art but an awareness of the golden era of Grade-B Sci-Fi films may be necessary to appreciate and enjoy it for what it is. It appears that the film was targeted at an audience that lacked that awareness.</fullReview>

The plot is so thin that it shouldn't even be mentioned. It almost seems like the whole point of this movie was to do some kind of we-can-do-jurassic-park-too technological masturbation. I just don't get it. This movie has already (even with same english title) been done some dozens of times in Japan (and Jurassic Park II wasn't too far from it either), so why bother? It's not like we have run out of ORIGINAL ideas and REAL plots...

		<fullReview>How can this be a Godzilla movie? Where's Raymond Burr as the big fat gaijin? Godzilla has been awakened by French nuclear testing in the Pacific and proceeds, for some reason that only a giant, fire-breathing 100 meter tall lizard would know, to New York City to lay his (her's? its? whatever?) eggs. Dr. Niko Tatopoulis (Matthew Broderick who is completely wasted in this role), an expert on radiation mutated life forms is called in to find out exactly what has been leaving this trail of huge 10 meter long footprints pointing at New York. Jean Reno plays Philippe Roache (an even more criminal waste of talent than Broderick's role), an agent of the French government who is trying to cover up the fact that it was the French who woke up this 100 meter tall lizard. This movie is great video fodder if you can get it at "Two for the price of one" night at your local video store, and it will test your Dolby system to the limit, but in the end it is funnier than it is frightening and the only reason why I could give it even three stars was Reno, who somehow manages to come off as a serious character in what is otherwise a very silly movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, messieurs Devlin and Emmerich have done it again. I was 100% certain they couldn't come up with anything worse than the utterly dismal Independence Day, but these guys always seem to come up with the goods. Godzilla must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of all, it's a nitpickers' heaven; the script is chock-full of illogical skips and jumps, nonsensical ideas and just completely stupid in-duh-viduals. The photography looks like a TV -show, the actors (in the broadest sense of the word) have been left completely without direction and despite the loud action, the movie's boring you to tears in less than an hour. When the movie had been running for 75 minutes, a friend of mine leaned over and whispered "This has to end soon. I can't take much more of this", to which I replied "only an hour more to go". He got up, collected his jacket and left. I used to think that Matthew Broderick was a passable actor. Well, no more. While he was horribly bad, it was nothing compared to the female lead. In one scene, she is sitting on a bed, sobbing. I couldn't tell whether she was supposed to be faking it and trying to get some sympathy from the other person in the room, or whether she was actually trying (and failing miserably) to portray a woman crying. Even the most preposterous faults in the script are too numerous to go into here, just go and find a nitpicker's website and laugh yourself silly. I'm going to see the movie again, this time armed with a print-out of the script's faults and ready to ruin the movie for everyone by pointing out the faults in a loud voice. Thank God I don't have to pay for the admission. I suggest no-one else does either, ever.</fullReview>

It goes down there with Batman and Robin, Species II, Speed II: Cruise Control and the Lost World. Also, for most of the film, you only see Godzilla's foot. A more suitable name for this abysmal production would be "Godzilla: Foot to be Feared!". The two leads (Brodderick and that woman) are possibly the most miscast actors of all time. Oh wait, the guy that replaced Keanu Reeves in Speed II was the most miscast actor of all time, but these two people come a close second. The lady just can't act. She can't. Brodderick can act, but in this film, his acting is...Laughable to say the least. This film also rips off other films. Let's see now. When the discover the eggs in Madison Square garden, Devlin and Emmerich (The producers) rip off alien. When the four characters are being chased around in a cab, the film rips off Jurassic Park. When Godzilla jumps into the water, before you can say "Brain Dead Production", it rips off The Hunt for Red October. I read a review and the reviewer said "The only rip off I was waiting to see next, was of Devlin's or Emmerich's head". Whoever wrote that is a genius. I couldn't agree more. This film is just putrid. Horrible. Whenever the lead female came on screen, I felt like vomiting all over the screen and protecting everyone from her...Well, crap acting.

The duo behind the successful Independence Day would resurrect the Toho legend Godzilla from yesteryear to unleash a wave of destruction on New York. The film had massive awareness and was coming on the heels of the mega-hit Jurassic Park ? so dinosaurs and their similars were definitely riding a wave of popularity.The film opens with depictions of nuclear testing by the French in the Pacific Ocean while indigenous lizards look on. Years later, this results in the gigantic mutation that is to become known as Godzilla. For some nonsensical reason, Godzilla starts swimming its way to New York City leaving a trail of underwhelming destruction in its wake. A group of disparate characters pool resources to locate the creature and end its rampage.Unfortunately, what should have been a sure thing here ends in a complete botch. The film is a haphazard mess hanging together by fraying threads.The visual effects are fairly strong, but the film keeps the creature off stage for practically the entire first half and then depicts most of its appearances in rainy darkness. Truthfully, has New York City ever been the victim of such an endless spate of torrential storms as is depicted in this film? The story is fairly asinine. It concocts a barely logical reason for Godzilla's sudden swim to NYC, but the destruction that the creature leaves in its path is so minimal that one wonders why so much military and scientific effort is put into the search for the creature. Indeed, NYC survives largely unscathed from Godzilla's wrath and few people seem in any genuine danger from the creature. A good deal of the destruction, in fact, comes from the blunders of the military in trying to detain the creature. Additionally, we are told that the creature is able to hide within the underground subway system, but given the enormous size of the creature that seems highly unlikely.Additionally, the film is absent of nearly any tension. Director Roland Emmerich imbues everything with such a strangely light-hearted tone that there is no urgency to this material or the ho-hum action scenes that he creates. In fact, the film only truly comes to life in the final 20 minutes and at that point it is simply too late and altogether too brief to salvage this sinking ship. Additionally, once we have the back story, it is hard to feel threatened by or root for the death of the title creature. In fact, some degree of kudos must go to the effects team and screenplay for drumming up sympathy for the creature's plight, particularly in its final moments on screen.By contrast, the people populating this foolishness should be so sympathetic. There are so many useless extraneous characters introduced into the action that one about needs a score card to keep track?and none of them are killed by the creature. We get Matthew Broderick's dorky scientist, French agent Jean Reno, reporter Maria Pitillo, cameraman Hank Azaria and his blowzy wife Arabella Field, Vicki Lewis' scientist and her assistant Malcolm Danare, military colonel Kevin Dunn, ineffectual mayor Michael Lerner and his assistant Lonny Goldman. The ideas on character development revolve around making Lerner and Goldman an idiotic riff on Siskel and Ebert and Reno a coffee fancier always on the hunt for a great cup of java. The film would not have suffered in the least by cutting or combining any number of these roles. For instance, the Pitillo and Lewis role could easily have been combined into one (preferably Lewis since Pitillo is a nightmare).Acting-wise, the film is equally lamentable. Broderick is all wrong to carry an action film and often comes across as a double holding the stage until the real leading man shows up. Azaria seems game, but Reno looks justifiably bored. The worst performance, hands down, comes from Pitillo, who spends the film whining, crying, pouting and delivering her lines in a voice that reminds one of a low-rent Betty Boop. Simply excruciating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does Hollywood insist on making films for money purposes???? It seems to me that if they make a film that has a great storyline, good acting, good producing and good directing the audience would come back again and again to watch a certain film because of the company that made the movie possible.yet in this film we find that there is terrible acting, a bad script, and a poorly directed film that expects the audience to look past it to a higher "cause". That cause would be "give me money because the movie cost us a lot of money".That doesn't do it for audiences. For example, look at "The Dark Knight". A well written story, a strong cast, well directed, very well edited. Furthermore, it gave the studio who produced it credibility with audiences.This movie "godzilla" was just a pathetic attempt for Sony to cash in. How could people actually like this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A montage of French nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean, observed by many marine iguanas. Then, in present days, a Japanese fishing ship is being attacked by an unseen monster; only one survived. Traumatized, he is later questioned in a hospital by a mysterious Frenchman and repeatedly says only one word --"Gojira". NRC scientist Niko "Nick" Tatopolous is called in to investigate the matter, and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant, irradiated lizard known as Godzilla has been created by the explosions. Then Godzilla makes its way north, landing at Manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city! Even with the combined forces of the U.S. military are going to destroy Godzilla at all costs, but will it ever be enough to save the people of New York? Good premise with good effects, but why does everyone hate this, the answer I say.Rated PG-13 for Graphic Violence and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billed as one of the biggest summer blockbuster's ever, this movie fell short in just about every category. It is no wonder the previews showed nothing of the creature and revealed none of the story. If Godzilla fans had known that 'Godzilla' would turn out to look and act like he does in this movie, nobody would have gone to see it. This creature does not look like Godzilla in the least, and that's not even the worst part! He ACTS nothing like Godzilla, does not trample buildings, does not run towards a battle, and is a big coward. It is no wonder that Godzilla fans have taken to calling this creature G.I.N.O. (Godzilla in Name Only). The one highlight of the movie is Jean Reno. Oh, and the title sequence isn't bad either. This movie may single-handedly killed off any chance of a good film maker ever working on an American big-budget Godzilla film.</fullReview>

It's also the best movie to watch with surround sound. Other than Michael Bay flicks this has to be the best way to test out your sound. I've actually gotten complaints whenever I watch this to turn it down but how can you when your watching an Emmerich movie. Of all of his movies this one is my favorite.

After the nuclear explosion one lizard egg appears to remain. Leading off to a two year reign as my favorite movie until x-men came along. The movie is about a hybrid of lizardous creature name Gojira (Godzilla) The lizard romps through a middle America type town on its way to new york. I liked this movie because the effects are great the plot rocks and the new lizard is awesome looking. The babies look and act like velociraptors and godzilla like a fish eating tyrannosaurus rex.

		<fullReview>This movie is so unspeakably atrocious that I actually screamed "it's over!" as the closing credits began to roll, and rushed out of the theater with my arms flailing wildly. You might even say they had gone "akimbo."Anyway, I do regard Godzilla as the ultimate example of story and characters shamefully subjugated to money-making devices, such as explosions, big shiny weapons, and giant piles of fish. To all those that mock the likes of me for "expecting Shakespeare," I say this: clearly I was not expecting high art. The title alone should suggest, even to the most unsophisticated moviegoer, that one is in for two and a half hours of lizard warfare. Most of the time, I enjoy movies like that, escapist movies, simply because I find it fun to get caught up in the action. But isn't it a bad sign when, in the case of movies like Godzilla, you CAN'T get caught up in the action, because you are completely distracted by the flaws in the plot, the endless lifting of material from other films, the truly despicable "heroes" and the fact that the monster is BORING?!As if that weren't enough -- this is where the film jumps from "bad" to "indefensible" -- does everyone remember Mayor Ebert and his little nerd sidekick Gene? Well, that stupid act of bitter self-conscious critic-bashing is a good example of just how childish as filmmakers can behave. Siskel and Ebert gave a negative review to "Independence Day," so that bit was a little act of passive-aggressive revenge on the part of the filmmakers. By virtue of that act alone, the makers of this film have hereby been disqualified from the "artist" category forever. Amen."Godzilla" is the worst film of 1998, and the worst film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

That's like hiring someone who doesn't believe in electricity to wire your home.The only thing heretical than the film is the soundtrack. Sweet Christ, why would you allow Sean "Puff Daddy/Puffy/P.

The criticism I read about poor acting (Jean Reno for example: "Jean Reno was obviously repaying a favor" - fourque2 - I find totally based on wishful prejudice) seems to me trivial. In the given situation and genre, I think it fits in quite admirably.Of course I respect the verdict of the Godzilla fans, that's their prerogative. Mine is to enjoy.So as far as what I expected, entertainment and good effects, this rates first class for me :) My 2 eurocents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is NOT a Godzilla film: it's BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS meets JURASSIC PARK.Godzilla fans will be sorely disappointed, but shouldn't be shocked: Hollywood simply can't do Godzilla, because they don't understand why fans love the Big Guy. Ironically the producers already had a pre-sold audience (Star Trek &amp; Star Wars being other examples of pre-sold audiences). If they had simply delivered on their promise - a GODZILLA film - it could've been a slam-dunk hit. But they simply expected us to ooh and aah over technical effects *we've already seen* in lieu of plot, story &amp; character; here's what any Godzilla fan will tell you what belongs in a Godzilla film:1. Godzilla has PERSONALITY - namely, a bad attitude and is clearly "masculine" - NOT "just an animal" as defined in this remake, and definitely NOT an egg-laying mother (!)2. Godzilla *always* battles another monster; he first emerges for a destructive temper-tantrum, then goes head-to-head with another beast intent on destroying the world; Godzilla never intends to destroy the world; he just keeps us in our place, then saves us all from something *really bad*.3. Godzilla does not get killed - ever - especially not by humans, as in this one; although in Toho's most recent GODZILLA VS DESTROYAH, Big G is self-immolated by his own radioactive heart, he will most definitely return in one form or another.You get the idea; pass on this turkey and pick up GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAH instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years of waiting for Tristar to make a Godzilla movie, this is what they give us, two and a half hours of pure trash. This movie is so boring and talkative that I almost fell asleep the second time I watched it, there is at least a chunk of thirty minutes of not seeing "Godzilla" during the middle of the movie! All you see of this "Godzilla" is mostly his feet and tail, other than that, this "Godzilla" looks like a cross between Stripe from Gremlins, an alien from Aliens, and the tyrannosaurus rex from Jurassic Park and has the head of Mufasa from the Lion King. The thing died from twelve missiles to his chest, something the Japanese Godzilla would have never felt. This "Godzilla" doesn't have his famous radioactive breath, but some fire burp he only did twice during the movie. The military did more damage than "Godzilla" did and get this Devil, people run from Godzilla, Godzilla doesn't run from people. The acting is horrible, dialogue is even worse, and the plot holes! If I could keep count... Why does "Godzilla" even go to N.Y.? How can "Godzilla" burrow so deep underground and lay so many eggs his body couldn't hold? How could he lay eggs in Madison Gardens without destroying it? Why do cars bounce a foot off the ground when he is a block away but cars ten feet away from him don't even move when he is chasing the super taxi? The special effects are light years away from the Japanese effects but they are so overfull of computer animation, it doesn't even look real (the helicopter chase scenes). The other really bad thing about this "movie" that really ticked me off was the music. No Ifukube music, just dull music from some composer no one has heard of. The reason why this film did so bad at the box office is because most Americans think Godzilla is just a big joke. Just look at what we have done to him over the years, bad dubbing, poor toys, ugly video boxes(Paramount/Gateway, Simitar), etc..This film is just a ripoff of Jaws, Aliens, Alien Resurrection, Jurassic Park, The Lost World, King Kong, and other great movies. Thank God Toho is bringing the real Godzilla back with Godzilla Millennium this year. In the next hundred years, people are still going to be watching the classic Godzilla films, no one will be watching this.</fullReview>

The film itself is poor, a definite thumbs down. No drama, no suspense, no thrills. For a monster film it kind of falls flat on it's face.It's real crime is that it's called Godzilla. The creature itself has so many differences to the original that it's not right to call it that (Gojira was over 400 feet tall and would tower over the world trade centre). So it's not the actual creature, let alone a remake (it has nothing to do with the plot of the original film either). Just plain fail from Emmerich and co.

		<fullReview>Yes, I'm a die-hard fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies, but that's not the only reason I hate this film. Like many fans, my biggest problem is that the American 'Godzilla' is that it's nothing but a CGI lizard with NONE of the character, personality, symbolism, or even sheer power that made it's Japanese cousin so indescribably cool.However, forgetting this, even when I view this film as a run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster, I can honestly say it's among the worst I've ever seen. So what's wrong with it? Where do I start? Annoying, unlikeable characters, (Particularly the downright hateable Audrey, who I got the impression we're supposed to LIKE [!?]) flat, uninspired acting, a unimaginative and ridiculous script, (Yes, I know some of the Japanese films suffer from this too, but they were at least fun to watch) sloppy direction, a stifling lack of originality, and sheer bad taste combine to make this the cinematic equivalent of nails on a blackboard.Even the super-high-budget special effects aren't too impressive; while the Japanese films used their $11 million budgets to create awesome scenes of pyrotechnic destruction, this film's $120 million budget seems entirely devoted to endless shots of a giant iguana running through city streets. The LACK of satisfying destruction is hugely disappointing; to put things in perspective, imagine what the Japanese filmmakers (Especially Shusuke Kaneko) could do with a budget of $120 million. Wait a moment while I wipe the drool off my keyboard.Basically, this is a downright terrible movie, and not just from the perspective of disappointed fans. If you want more proof, check out the 'Awards' section for this film; it won Razzie awards for Worst Remake/Sequel, and Worst supporting actress (Maria Pitillo/Audrey) and was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Director. All I can say is that it should have won the last two.</fullReview>

For someone who was quite young when it came out would be entertained by its whole "cool giant lizard" aspect, and that's what matters. The film sets out to entertain, and, for the most part, it does. The special effects are good, the acting satisfactory, and the dialogue passable. Come on, it's not that bad!

		<fullReview>If you were just to watch the last hour of this film, you might be able to convince yourself that it's a tolerable whole. But there are simply too many flaws to make the entire experience enjoyable.The biggest problem is that it's simply too dull at the start. Revealing the creature bit by bit is a classic device; unfortunately, the massive hype, endless trailers and ubiquitous merchandise utterly ruined the attempt. Nobody watching this film is in any doubt about what Godzilla is going to look like, so holding out just seems like a mean spirited way to save on the FX budget.While the main Godzilla FX are superb, the Godzuki raptors are inconsistent and a little blue-screenish. They also seem to be suffering from a strange disease where they can easily smash their heads through windows and steel doors, but seem unable to drag the rest of their bodies through. This gets tiresome very fast, and the other thing that drags this sequence down is that it's so obviously ripped off from Jurassic Park that it becomes painfully intrusive.As a pet peeve, the military hardware in this movie really annoys me. Hollywood seems stuck somewhere in the 1950's as far as technology goes. Every single weapon or vehicle in this film is badly - and deliberately and wilfully - incorrect, and the continuity is shoddy: note how many times aircraft fire off their "last" missiles. The reason that this annoys me is that there ARE weapons that do everything the scriptwriters wanted. If they'd done TWO MINUTES of research, they could have found them. That they didn't bother to do that says a lot about how seriously they take their job. Add to that the fact that they couldn't even be bothered to invent a plausible excuse for some of the idiotic snafus (why can't the helicopters fly UP?) and it becomes plain insulting, and makes it very hard to suspend disbelief.The actors in this film are irrelevant, and so it really doesn't matter that they range from mediocre to insipid, and that they have lines so trite that they would make a five year old blush. Honestly, it doesn't matter, so try to get over it.On the bright side, the score is acceptable. It's blaring, but it does match the action. The sequences are well lit and shot, and there's a definite big budget feel to everything (except the cast).I really do think that this is close to being the best possible Godzilla movie that Hollywood could make. Unfortunately it's a dull, patchy, soulless, derivative, irritating snoozefest with exactly zero unexpected scenes or twists. It's the perfect example of how to make a zero-risk film by committee, and given that it made it's money back and more, it did exactly what it needed to do, which is to pander to the sheeple that make up multiplex audiences.Well done Hollywood, you've managed to lower the bar another notch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Movie!!! Belongs in the dollar store!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen most of the old Japanese Godzilla movies, as well as Godzilla 2000. When I first heard that Hollywood was going to make a Godzilla movie of their own, I was excited. However, one look at this poor excuse for the King of the Monsters ended that excitement. Hell, I didn't even go see this movie at the theater. I just watched it at home when my brother got it for Christmas (no idea why he would want it).Instead of a huge, vicious T.Rex-Stegasaurus combo destroying a major city without much effort, we have a cowardly iguana hiding in New York City! Instead of Godzilla destroying an entire army, we have this big iguana running in terror from a few friggin' helicopters! Instead of an indestructible terror, this big iguana is killed by a few measly helicopters. This ripoff from Jurassic Park does less damage to New York City than the armed forces do! Oh, and lets not forget about the baby iguana-zillas, a blatant ripoff of the Jurassic Park raptors.My rating for this movie is 0.5 out of 10. What a horrible movie! Toho probably made Godzilla 2000 just to repair the damage caused by this poor excuse for a Godzilla movie. Hopefully, Hollywood has learned that if it isn't broke, don't fix it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN! TINY SPOILERS SHOWING UP ON RADAR! MAY REVEAL WHAT LITTLE PLOT THERE WAS! WARNING!!This lame excuse for a movie is an insult to every sane movie-lovers' intelligence. I saw it on video so was glad I did not have to shell out dosh to watch it in a theater.From beginning to end, this monstrosity of a film was one big cliche-ridden pile of shat. I did my ultimate best to ignore them, but one hour into this, so-called cliches became virtually impossible to ignore!!!Acting was abysmal. Even I could've done a better job. Matthew Broderick was simply awful. It looked as though he was forcing his lines with no effort whatsoever. As for his girlfriend, her acting was worse. It would have been nice to see the lizard eat her! Some reviewers likened this to light-hearted slapstick comedy. Slapstick Comedy??? More like slapstick farce!! None of this drivel was slightly amusing!There are mind boggling scenes: submarines in rivers firing torpedoes - and said rivers looked more like oceans. Helicopters quite capable of flying up to escape stomping, chomping building-sized dumb lizard - but flies forward all the way. Most mind-boggling of all - how in the world can a giant 20-story tall dinosaur hide in New York subways?? Oh yes, we mustn't forget the hundreds of eggs it laid in a stadium building and somehow going completely unnoticed. And then there is the unbelievable climatic ending in a New York Yellow Cab.There are dozens more along this vein, but space wouldn't allow me to put them in, such as Guess What Scene We Copied This From. There are enough scenes in this to infringe the copyrights of nearly a dozen other movies, don't movies have copyrights?MY CONCLUSION? So its a kids movie. It does not have to mean - kids movie atrocious acting = reiiculous plot line. This is the worst movie of all time. I give it 0 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that adding a comment to the lot of 235 for this movie is probably as fruitful as pouring table salt into the Atlantic Ocean, but when a picture is this revolting it could use all the pans it can get. I saw it the day before it was released at a free sneak preview, and I still felt I needed my money back. I know plot and dialogue aren't terribly important for a 'summer blockbuster'(hey I enjoyed Independence Day for what it was), but anybody could have written and filmed this tripe if they had the resources. It seems if you hype something up long enough, people feel compelled to see it. And to top it off, Maria Pitillo and Hank Azaria(who was terrific in The Birdcage) give what have to be the worst performances I've seen. The saddest thing about it is that a few weeks after watching it, I saw a British Godzilla go through the Mystery Science treatment, and it was a much better film.</fullReview>

He wasn't as terrible in his earlier films as he was in this film, so I think the director must be to blame.Nonetheless, everyone else's acting performances made Broderick look like Lawrence Olivier.

		<fullReview>It had to happen eventually. 44 years after the original the Americans have to bastardize the Japanese classic. Well the results are here, and they are not looking good. The story is simple, all you really need to know is what you expect. Godzilla comes, he destroys, people fight, they die, eventually they defeat the creature. Well simplicity isn't the problem. Stupidity isn't either. Don't get me wrong, the film is stupid, but what do you expect from Roland Emmerich and his pals. I am not going to talk about how the people manage to lose a 400 foot tall creature several times, and I am not going to talk about how he changes sizes throughout the film. Stuff like this is to be expected. The Japanese movies commit atrocities just as bad as this.What I am here to talk about is the shere boredom induced by this movie that the Japanese movies never brought about. The film is over 2 hours long, and throughout the only mildly entertaining scenes are the first time the creature shows himself and the car chase that concludes the film. There is a certain visual wowness factor at watching Godzilla tear his way through the city, but it wears away quickly. It was more effective on me when I first saw it when it came out when I had just turned six. I mean seriously, this movie is over 2 hours long and Godzilla is only on screen for about 15 minutes. Something is wrong with that. I mean really, did they expect us to be entertained by the idiot humans and their pointless talking.The comedy is lame and so is everything else. We don't care about these humans and would rather Godzilla just kill them right of the bat. The movie also wastes a full 45 minutes dealing with Godzilla's children in a blatant Jurassic Park rip-off. It is yawn-inducing, as is most of the film. This film is a dull experience, from beginning to end, only occasionally resulting in some fun, but it is not nearly enough for a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the only films bad enough to make wanna leave halfway through. I mean, I was so bored, so disappointed, that I was squirming in my seat. This horrible waste of time, talent (whoops! did I say TALENT?), and money completely convinces me of how bad and commercialized films have gotten in the 90's. Does a film really have to have a multi-million dollar budget, nonstop action, and a no-brainer plot to make money nowadays? I'm just downright sick of it. I usually stick to the lower budget pictures in order to make sure I keep my brain cells, but even those have gone to pot in our cynical society. So just ask yourself one question: how the hell did this film get made?Easy answer. You see, according to today's Hollywood standards, all you need is a bankable icon, such as a star or a franchise, and people will allegedly pack the theaters in herds. I see it happen again and again. Stupid, dumb, idiotic moron movies like this one are making swarms of cash, while the little-known better pictures are being dubbed as "boring". Well, let me tell ya, THIS IS BORING. And totally stupid to boot. Like the dreaded "Independence Day", another one of my pet peeves, this film has a script more contrived and pathetic than a five year old could write. Where are the brains in these characters? How stupid can one character possibly be? And how stereotyped as well? The writers must have just rushed into the schtick of the Godzilla character and forgot about a story. All these idiots care about is making their shots look "cool" and seeing how much money they can blow on moronic special effects that were, in my opinion, frankly not that good. I could care less about how neat they can make Godzilla look. Who cares? I'm frankly getting sick of stupid computer special effects, because, unless they are used to move the story along, they're worthless and sometimes look ten times worse than just using conventional stock motion animation (look how they ruined "King Kong"). If I had it my way, you wouldn't even see the friggin effect. You'd have to imagine it. Or at least it would be good for camp. This isn't even worthy of that status. I mean, isn't that the only reason to watch the original Godzilla? For camp? To see how cheap and tacky the creature and cities look? Not for some mega budget, computer-generated moron who looks like he doesn't even have a face. Kinda reminds me of the bugs in "Starship Troopers" and how they were so uninteresting and lacked any personality or facial expressions whatsover. At least with stock motion animation you get some sort of emotions.But stock motion is too outdated, now isn't it. And so is talent. Roland Emmerich and that Dean Devlin character are the two biggest airhead sell-outs in film, and Hollywood whores to boot. Why are they still employed? Simple. Because they had a big hit with "ID4" and now they're cash cows, a perfect necessity to Hollywood. Frankly, I think that if I had that huge budget, I could make fifty little films, each twenty times better than "Godzilla", each more entertaining, and each would probably pay the bills. And I don't need all the sugar-coated Hollywood hype either. Word of mouth spreads fast.So give me one reason to even waste my time explaining the plot. A big dumb creature stomps on a big dumb city. Whoopie. And he stomps on big dumb people while he's at it, the only redeeming quality to this tripe. Sounds sorta like the catch to "Independence Day", huh. You can either sit back and take in how stupid the plot and characters are, and how horrible the actors are (in a mega movie. hmmmmm.), or you can go to sleep. For some reason I saw this crap in the theatres. Human nature I guess.Number one on my All Time Worst Movies List. {zero} outta **** stars on my personal scale (Before this garbage, it never even went to "zero").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(sorry, this may be a repost from one of my different handles) Wow, I never in my life thought I would ever merit a movie with the "F" honor. But this one, this one deserves(too bad the grading scale doesn't go to Z). The very simple-minded plot is this: A scientist(Matthew Broderick) is assigned to assist the military in locating an amazingly-sized and extremely dangerous mammal. Of course, the monster soon makes his way to The Big Apple and all heck breaks lose. If that weren't enough, it also has ridiculous subplots with an ex-girlfriend and some French secretive group(I was in the bathroom when they first met). Sound stupid? It gets worse.This movie could have been semi-decent if the acting was. Instead we're treated to the worst mauling of a screenplay(that's not too great to begin with) that I have ever seen. Broderick did not say one line convincingly, and, on top of that, never said one line as it SHOULD HAVE been said. He doesn't get excited, scared, happy, just one emotionless goop. But, well, Matt Broderick deserves an Oscar compared to the horrific acting of his girlfriend. I kept on wondering if they wandered the streets looking for the first pretty girl they saw and then asking her to be in a movie. If you want some laughs, rent the movie, watch the scenes with her, and fast forward to the end when she says "I quit!" as wrong as she possibly could have made the line. Oh yeah, the acting of the quintessential geeky photographer and the best friend plain suck too. Overall, don't waste one cent of your money on this trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich and the studio company used Godzilla's name merely for marketing business. In other words, earn more money.The creature shown in this movie is not Godzilla, nor is it a monster. He is merely a giant mutated lizard looking for a place to live in, which is in New York. He has no weapons/powers of any kind, only a flame blast from it's mouth, which was used only twice in this movie and did little damage. He is extremely afraid of the military, running away every time they pursue him and attacking them only when they're in small numbers.One thing I didn't like about this movie is the fact that France was to blame for the mutant lizard's creation, instead of the United States, who is the actual culprit (In reality they tested nuclear weapons in the Bikini Islands). Not even actors Jean Reno and Doug Savant could save this piece of crap, who were the only ones making a good performance.As a matter of fact, nothing in this movie impressed me. Emmerich portraying certain characters after people in real life he hated is extremely childish and immature (He named Mayor Ebert after critic Roger Ebert, who gave negative reviews for movies Emmerich directed). Grow up, man.Sure enough, he is killed, and like every other monster movie which has failed, an heir always appears in the end. True Godzilla fans must avoid this movie and stick to the Japanese version. That's not Godzilla, it's merely a giant lizard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There oughtta be a law that says, if you purchase the rights to a recognized entertainment franchise for your own use, you are required to USE THE REAL PRODUCT, OR AT LEAST TRY TO REPRESENT IT. This is TriStar buying a famous monster's name and then trying to use it to sell a totally different monster.Not that this is necessarily a bad monster. Heck, I actually LIKED the monster, even if they are just animating the Jurassic Park 'raptor' model on a macro scale, especially for the baby monsters.The point is, this is obviously not Godzilla, not by any stretch of the imagination. They don't even take the time to explain WHY the beast is CALLED 'Godzilla' (or actually, 'Gojira', as they take enough time to make a lame joke about). The solution: don't call the movie 'Godzilla'. Give your new monster a new name and put the movie out.Still, even if they HAD done this, it would have been a pathetic movie nonetheless. The monster, interesting though it was, is a big part of this problem.GINO (Godzilla In Name Only), as the monster will hereafter be referred to, simply doesn't seem to exist. Yes, the rubber-suit Godzilla was hokey and campy, but he had some stage presence, for crying out loud. GINO is nothing but a special effect. Since it can't actually be filmed against a real background, even a campy miniature of downtown Osaka, it never gets the chance to truly interact with its environment. When your audience can't believe in your title character, your movie fails.Another little suggestion for future filmmaking: either DO, or DON'T. I'm referring here to the tacked on 'fire-breathing' scenes that appeared twice in the version I saw. Being a longtime Godzilla fan (the real one), I was involved in several discussion groups and online lists while this movie was in production. One of the questions that kept recurring was, 'Does the new Godzilla breathe fire?' The answer we finally got from the source was 'No, it does not,' but they didn't have the guts to stick by that. In a pathetic attempt to win the true Godzilla fans over, they spliced in two post-production scenes of Gino bending low over burning debris and apparently just exhaling forcefully enough to LOOK like it was breathing fire. Bad, bad choice.Speaking of bad, bad, how about that dialogue? How hard IS it to pronounce 'Tatopoulis', anyway? It's a FOUR-SYLLABLE-NAME. It's not even a remotely challenging Greek surname, so the attempt to make a running gag out of it falls as flat as the acting itself.This movie can't be fairly compared to the Toho Godzilla series, because the two are totally different. Apples and oranges, as the saying goes. However, taken on its own merits, TriStar's 'Godzilla' is still pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was indifferent about this film when I first saw it, having never seen the original. I'll be bluntly honest in saying I spent at least two hours bored out of my skull. Alright, so monster-on-the-loose films are not known for in-depth plots and characterisation, but this really is a cynical cash-in. It shows promise to start with, what with the topical French nuclear testing being responsible for Godzilla's mutation, and the monster itself looks quite impressive, even if it is only fleetingly glimpsed in the pouring rain. But apparently the makers of this film hated Godzilla, and if you don't have any faith in your own film then how can you expect others to? The acting is of the couldn't-care-less-as-long-as-I-get-my-big-fat-cheque variety, and the monster is killed far too easily. Say what you like about the Japanese Godzilla films, at least the bad ones were a laugh. In Godzilla '98, fans of unintentionally comic monster movies have only a scene in which the film suddenly turns into Attack of the Wind-Up Baby Dinosaurs. It's no surprise to me that the two planned sequels were never made. More recently, I've seen the first Godzilla film from the fifties. Despite the low-budget effects, it's much better than this big bore. If this re-make didn't have the name 'Godzilla' it would just be yet another one of the nameless, faceless Godzilla rip-offs, would have been ignored by monster movie fans in droves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the typical "all flash, no substance" 90's flick.While Godzilla looked and sounded great, the visuals of mayhem in NYC tickled the senses, the plot had holes bigger than those Godzilla himself was digging.As usual, the moviemakers ignored physics more times than one could count and set up the most fanciful scenarios. Have you ever wondered what was holding up that suspension bridge when the cables snapped and were tangled around Godzilla? How the car wasn't crushed in his mouth? How that high voltage cable happened to be in reach and remain there long enough to be grabbed?That aside, I also hated the 'heroine'. There was this attractive, interesting redheaded scientist available but the hero winds up with a woman whose only gutsy action was to selfishly and foolishly steal a tape? Argh!A last criticism would have to be that HELLISH music playing while the end credits rolled. It had nothing to do with the movie and was nothing but low brow street rap. What were they trying to do - clear the theatre as fast as possible?Oddly, the effects make this movie somehow enhoyable to watch, problems aside.

I've viewed other movies I really enjoyed and found out later they have a low rating so don't automatically not watch a film because it has a low rating. Although I will admit that most movies with a really low rating deserve it. I do base whether I am going to view the whole film or not on how good the acting is.

		<fullReview>Is this movie bad? I suppose so...I still love it! And nothing will ever change that. Godzilla was created by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the same team behind Independence Day. There is no better way to describe what this film turned out to be. It's Independence Day with a giant Iguana, instead of aliens. As a lifelong Godzilla fan, I do have to agree that this is Godzilla in name only. But how does it stand on it's own merits. The tone and direction is exactly the same as Emmerich's other films. Fun action, amazing special effects, cardboard characters, wooden performances, and cliché filled scripts. Matthew Broderick is amusing to watch in the film, he seems to be trying to do the "awkward nerd" routine, but it just comes off as rather awkward in general. Jean Reno is fantastic. I maintain that there is no movie this man could not save. He does all he can with this performance, giving us mystery, a commanding presence, and some of the films genuinely funny moments. The design of Godzilla (or Zilla as he is now known) is very strange. At the time this was somewhat of a disappointment after all of the marketing. We we're expecting Godilla, and we got a ugly looking Iguana. They really, truly did take the "God" out of Godzilla here. The effects are cool though, even for a nineties movie. So why do I love this movie? It's a fun movie, and it doesn't need to be anything more then that. The 2014 Godzilla and Pacific Rim became the new standard for American monster films, but this one came long before, it failed. But it's still fun...Granted I was 7 years old, that could be a factor I suppose. Is the movie good? Nope, not really. Would it work for a modern audience? I doubt it. Did 7 year old's in the late nineties like it? Good god I hope so!If you found this review rather boring, you most likely would not like the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An overwhelming, series of brightly inflated lights takes over the skies where a nuclear bomb is being tested in French Polynesia is being examined. Moments later, the Pacific ocean is churning as a freighter is moving at a very rapid rate. Giant footprints have been spotted around the South Pacific beaches and rainforests. American coastal ships have been wrecked as they were twirling into a rolling sea with no logical explanation. The carnage then manifests all the way to Manhattan, New York (big surprise?)where the culprit centres around a giant dinosaur-like creature bigger than a Spinosaurus ruthlessly destroys the city leaving it near rubble as panic and fear comes into full effect. A scientist Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), an ambitious TV journalist Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo), her cameraperson Animal Pilotti (Hank Azaria) and a French insurance investigator (Jean Reno) where an unorthodox camaraderie comes into fruition. Despite their working agendas and contrasting ways to go about it, they join forces to defeat this beast before her babies hatch before its too late. Back in 1998, everyone's favourite super-dinosaur who has terrorized audiences for over 60 years had returned to the big screen stomping on vehicles, destroying tall buildings, and breathing fire from its mouth. In this 1998 adaptation, more so than the 2014 remake, "Godzilla" was the most hyped summer blockbuster at the time. But the final product resulted in nothing more than an overdone, overrated abomination. It just lacked in excitement, thrills or even exposure to the massive beast, which was what I was expecting. Back in the 1950's when Godzilla was wrecking havoc in Japan, the stories focusing on the monster was often intense, though campy, with cheesy archaic technical effects, but did reflect a true phobia and distrust at the time when science and nuclear war was becoming a threat. However, the 1998 version, is contrary to the intentions that the Japanese versions had. Okay the technical features improved tremendously, but the fear factor was not very effective. Godzilla in the more modern day feels not well needed and has no symbolic references in our less than paranoid world than in years before. Directed by Roland Emmerich (who also directed "Independence Day") made "Godzilla" to cater towards the audience into making him a spectacle rather than to implement a significant story behind the beast and its destructive nature. The monster just plows his way across the Pacific towards New York City where all modern day giant beasts make their homes to proves themselves formidable. The main thing wrong here is that the monster's screen time seems to be at only thirty minutes long. That's quite a record low. The unleashing of the monster is to be blamed towards nuclear testing. When the opening credits come into fruition as iguanas are staring at a giant mushroom-shaped cloud is coming down. Radiation has a lasting effect on these lizards and before you know it, Godzilla materializes standing over 100 feet tall, leaving massive footprints and demolishing fishing boats.Matthew Broderick is Dr. Tatopoulos a nerdy kind scientist who was brought into the mix while his ex-girlfriend, TV journalist Audrey Timmonds who has ambitions of being promoted news anchor and coverage of Godzilla's destruction is her ticket to that position. Let's just say the apocalypse of the modern day world is just another shoe in for career opportunities. Once again Matthew Brodrick is playing the same character he's played all his career. Maria Pitillo fared better and was adorable, it's too bad she knew it herself. The real stand-out performer comes from Jean Reno was the French secret agent. With his panicked eyes and his pock-marked complexion and his harried expressions, he was the sole character other than the giant lizard that held my interest. He scoffs at awful the coffee the New Yorkers make and when impersonating Elvis in front of American soldiers. The missing ingredient that would have made "Godzilla" better was some tongue-in-cheek humour which Emmerich used in "Independence Day" that he neglected here. As it stands, "Godzilla" falls flat by simply lacking in wit. Michael Lerner can pass off as the most loudest, annoying political leader as Mayor Ebert, as he bears a stunning resemblance to film critic Roger Ebert. Oh what a coincidence, his partner is a balding man named Gene. How funny is that?The only thrilling moments often feels recycled from "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" only exception, those two movies executed it far better. The monster's features are only shown waist down crushing cars and demolishing cars with his powerful tail. Meanwhile at Madison Square Garden, little Godzillas wreck havoc against feared bystanders that once again steal pages from Spielberg with the velociraptors. Fifth Avenue was in rubble, Chrysler Building is crushed and the Brooklyn Bridge is now eradicated, by end the end of the destruction that may cost trillions of dollars in damages. The beast is never good or evil. He's just an animal, a gigantic, loud shallow beast with reboots, remakes and sequels in the future, his reputation's slowly becoming extinct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's big, it's scary, it's loud? it's Godzilla!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep, Hollywood did it again. They took yet another Japanese star and turn it into a movie, this time under the direction of Roland Emmerich. Now? I will never, ever deny that I enjoy this film, I really do. I always wanted it in my collection, I was amazed by the trailer and I was blown away by the film? but in all that shock and awe? alas? the movie is one large, noisy turd? as most of the Emmerich films. But, I got to admit, Emmerich can make some highly entertaining turd films. And I think this is one of my favorite of all Emmerich films ever? I still have it in my DVD collection. Now, if you have watched the original Gojira (1954), then you realize that you are expecting a totally different story. First the movie opens with atomic bomb footage, in French Polynesia, something big? emerged from the depths and attacked a Japanese fishing ship. Yep, that's one of those "slap in the face" scenes, where the writer, or director wants to say to the original Japanese film ? our monster is better! Well? talking about ego. And after that, another accident occurred, this time with US fishing boats. Now? that's entirely different from Japanese movies. In their movies we saw Godzilla fights numerous monsters, aliens and even King Kong? but the Americans are the one who increased the plot with the Godzilla's plans to make a nest in New York? where else? But, the idea of nesting? Hmmm? well, I guess that we needed a new idea for a big lizard. And it's not male, or female, it breeds asexual. Although I thought that there are two big lizards, but fortunately I was wrong, and good thing I was wrong. So, the story is simply American? in a simple American way. It's bearable.Time for actors: Matthew Broderick as Dr. Tatopoulos. Matthew was definitively very well payed for this film, so he looked all the time without any emotions, he was just staring at people and stuff and a big lizard? and talk in his usual youngster voice and? the guy never seems to get old. But, what I like about his performance that he constantly looked funny, especially in Madison Square Garden scenes, he entertained me pretty enough. Jean Reno plays Philippe Roache? the French intelligence agent who came to "clean up his sh*t". What do I mean by that? Now? this is not a big spoiler? the French atomic testing were done by? French people? and that's why Roache (his last name was there to make ridicule of him) is here. Reno was good, in his own French guy in US element. He was the badass of the film. We have Maria Pitillo as Audrey Timmonds, a former girlfriend of Nick's. Pitillo was so funny, so bad in her performance, no wonder you didn't saw her anywhere else in other films, this film remains the best known in her career. Hank Azaria? Oh, that's not all. Harry Shearer and Nancy Cartwright are also in the film. Moe the Bartender , Mr. Burns and Bart Simpson are in the film? What was that for? You expect for American audience to recognize them? To recognize their voices? Well, maybe some of them maybe know? but that does not helping! Hank and Harry were funny? well it was their job to be funny in the film. We also have Kevin Dunn and Doug Savant, they were good? but somehow? aw f**ck it, they were all funny in their performances, it's like you are watching a film based upon a world where everyone is comedian except Japanese and the monster itself. To also mention Michael Lerner's appearance in the film as Mayor Ebert? yep, you are right? another slap in the face to the two famous, respected and hated critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, who obviously didn't like Roland's previous films.When it comes to the monster design, I won't lie to you? I kinda liked it. It was an idea that Godzilla mutated from ordinary Iguana, but when you look at it, It doesn't even look nearly as Iguana. This Godzilla is more lean, to make him more faster and more well built for swimming. So? it's not that bad. Overall, this is one large, imposing turd of a film. It's your opinion? you like it, or you don't. And I do, because I think that the movie is very entertaining. But I do not include the humor in the film? not all the time. I mean the script is just ridiculous, CGI is not bad, it's very good at some scenes, visuals are good, camera work ? not bad, I like the underwater scenes, sound effects are brilliant, but I think the best thing is the music score by David Arnold, it's powerful and it presents monster pretty good. So? no matter how amused I were? it's still? that's a lot of turd?And one more thing? Hollywood? stop touching Japanese things?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a critical review on the 1998 Godzilla remake directed by Roland Emmerich.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1954, the film "Gojira" was released and became an instant classic spawning numerous sequels some of which became classics too. The 1998 American remake, however, just isn't that.Keep in mind that this is a review from my critic side and not my fan side.The story centers around a giant reptilian monster that was created by nuclear tests in French Polynesia. After attacking a Japanese cargo ship carrying fish in the Pacific Ocean, the creature somehow swims towards New York City of all places to make a nest. Now, it's up to Nick Tatopoulos and his friends to stop the monster.The story as you just read is just a typical monster plot, and the writers try way too hard to make this flick interesting by including "realistic science". What do I mean by this? Well, Godzilla is a mutated lizard specifically a marine iguana, but he doesn't look anything like the lizard he originally was. Another example is when the film explains that the monster is asexual which is absolutely absurd because a mutation caused by nuclear bombs does not include being asexual. I know about "suspension of disbelief", but there's only so much the audience can believe. If having ridiculous science talk isn't bad enough, "Godzilla" down-right steals scenes from "Jurassic Park" that this should have been called "Jurassic Park 3" or "Jurassic Park- Giant Dino".The characters are either bland, hateful, forgettable. The main character is Nick Tatopoulos, played by Matthew Broderick, who is the clichéd boring, dorky, socially awkward scientist who never are good main leads. I understand that Emmerich wants to make heroes from normal people, but they have to be interesting and/or likable. Tatopoulos is not likable. In fact, I don't know a thing about him. He's a bore, but what's worse than a boring character? A hateful character. The romantic interest Audrey Timmonds, played by Maria Pitillo, is a despicable, selfish character who I wanted Godzilla to eat so badly. Here an example on how she's hateful: She is talking to her New York stereotypical friend about her relationship with Nick, and her friend asks her how long they dated. Audrey said about 3 or 4 years, and this is what her friend said, "Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry you." Then, Audrey says, "That's the thing. He did." There's nothing more we learn about their relationship expect that they get back together in the end. So, she wanted him to ask her but declined when he did. Why should I care about her? Also, she steals top secret information from Nick's tent when she knows she's not supposed to, and it was for her career as a news reporter. Additionally, after putting the information on the news, we see her crying while watching the news, but she's not crying because of what she did- we know this because we see her give a horribly acted and soulless apology to Nick prior- but because her report was stolen by her boss. What a selfish broad. The other characters aren't all that memorable outside the fact that they're just New York or French stereotypes giving us some tasteless stereotypical dialogue and jokes.Despite the poorly written characters, the actors do a decent job playing them. There's just nothing else to say about the acting. They did what they could and did okay.That is expect for Maria Pitillo who was just awful.The special effects when looked at a modern aspect are bad, but in the context of 1998, they're from okay especially when you compare the effects of "Godzilla" to the film that it strongly plagiarizes, "Jurassic Park". One scene from "Godzilla" that might have looked good in '98 but looks really bad today is the footstep scene shown in all of the trailers and commercials where Godzilla's foot slams down and raises back up. However, some effects still look really good which include any particle effects, and, my favorite shot, when Godzilla jumps over the bridge to dive into the Hudson River. That shot still looks really impressive.Now, let's talk about the monster Godzilla. I will not be judging this creature to the original, but instead on how he stands on his own which is pathetic. One of the main problems with him is that he's not scary or endearing. If you're going to do a monster film, you have to do one or the other, and this monster fails trying to do either one. He's not enduring because you don't see any reason why we the audience should care about him, and he's not scary because not only does he not look scary, he's a coward and a wimp. The only reason he stays alive as much as he does in the film is because the military sucks at hitting him. Additionally, we never see him showing why he's a force to be reckoned with. He's constantly running away. Bottom line, this is one of the worst monsters put on film.Overall, "Godzilla" is a bad film, but there are a few good things in it. Outside of the monster and Audrey, nothing in the film can be heavily criticized or hated for. This is one of those movies where if you "turn off" your brain and just put it on to kill some time, this film would be fine to put on, or if you want to watch a movie but don't care what it is, "Godzilla" would be alright to watch. Now, I can't hate on this film too much because there is a good or even great monster film in here but just not fully realized, and "The Word to Sum It" best explains it best.The Word to Sum It: stale. This flick feels that everything was rushed and not fleshed out.IMDb Rating: 4/10 Personal Rating: 2/5 Rotten Tomatoes Rating: 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much Fun Like Independence Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really stupid movie, but I guess one could try to enjoy it if they think of it simply as a "popcorn" movie. sold tickets, but it lacks in quality. Why couldn't this live up to the fun provided in Independence Day?The first thing this film lacks is a solid cast. The only actor I really liked in this film was Jean Reno, and I guess since his character was quirky Matthew Broderick did an okay job. I cannot stand the actress who played Audrey, nor the character itself. Her character has no depth whatsoever, and seems to be placed into this movie simply as a love interest to Nick (Broderick). She is a really stupid character, asking bluntly if Nick is still mad for her leaving him, crying like a baby (seriously, it is so childish) when Nick leaves after she steals his tape, and offering the least sincere apology I have ever seen. And why are there 3 or 4 Simpsons voice actors in the cast? Hank Azaria's character can be funny at moments, but he definitely does not belong in this action flick.The CGI looks really bad, which is disappointing since Independence Day's effects didn't look too bad. That's all I have to say on that aspect.As for the pace of the film, while this movie brings Godzilla into play sooner than the more recent version, this movie is overly long for a monster movie. It takes forever for the movie to get to the second BIG fight with Godzilla where they fight him in the waters of Manhattan. This could have happened 30 minutes earlier and the film would have been on a good pace, but this movie insisted on playing things slow between each action sequence, though the action sequences can be long (especially when they get to Madison Square Garden) and somewhat fun to watch. However, if you examine the sequence with the babies hatching and attacking Nick and crew, it rips off a lot of shots of the velociraptors in Jurassic Park. The only difference is that these dinosaur-like creatures are taller.This movie had potential but fell very flat compared to that potential. I wish I could laugh at this movie like other bad movies, but to me this movie was just plain bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST Modern Godzilla, better than 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And thats including the 2014 version which had some moments but was pretty bad overall.This Godzilla monster was the best believable version ever, as an irradiated lizard. The shape of the monster, his gait, motions and action were excellent especially weaving through the city in chase, superb. Digging under the city and getting lost was also a good idea. The French aspect taking responsibility of the disaster was an awesome addition and of course Jean Reno was superb, usually is.This was great effects for its time, funny, super characters, worm guy, , Marie Petillo animal and his lady, funny comical and had a cliff hanger end.Even the new Godzilla for all its expense is a terrible story with poor acting and stupid monsters it fights. This is my favorite since the guy in suit Japanese movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to spend much time on this special effects extravaganza. Godzilla, a giant lizard the size of the Collosus of Rhodes, demolishes half of New York City in its quest for fish. Not quenelles de brochet or sole Florentine but sashimi, with or without wasabi. He's not fussy.The thing is really titanic. It emerges from the East River and smashes through buildings. The Army, with its small arms and heat-seeking missiles, can't do a thing with it because it's so big and it's cold blooded. The missiles bring down the Chrysler building.Now, any thriller of this caliber must have a car chase. But there's a problem. There are no villains to chase or be chased in a car. So we get to witness Godzilla in hot pursuit of a fleeing taxi through the streets of the city.There are scenes lifted from "Jurassic Park", in which dozens of Velocirapter-sized juvenals sniff around Madison Square Garden, ready to try red meat instead of fish, regardless of the threat to their health.There is a famous scene towards the end of "Wait Until Dark" in which the supposedly dead killer leaps suddenly onto the screen, making a grab for Audrey Hepburn. It's a real shocker. Just about every horror movie since then has copied it. Here, it's copied twice. Godzilla, bombarded, groans and sinks to the bottom of the river.The end? Not on your life. He was pregnant and has deposited a couple of dozen eggs in Madison Square Garden. They all hatch simultaneously, sans egg teeth, and the stars now have a horde of new enemies to defeat. They eventually do so, at great sacrifice. Not only are some French troops killed (don't ask) but Madison Square Garden itself is obliterated.The end? That's what you might think. But -- Lo! -- Godzilla emerges intact, full of pee and vinegar, from the ruins of the Garden and is thoroughly annoyed by the death of all its spawn. More battles ensue.The score can't decide whether it would rather imitate Night on Bald Mountain or Bernard Herrmann, so it rips passages off from both sources, pounding the tympani was megabels of drums and electronic percussion. If a helicopter gently touches down on its landing pad, the first contact of the nose wheel is a loud WHOMP. There is no acting to speak of. None is required. It's a commercial spectacle with unbelievable holes in the story and in the subway system. The impact of having seen this movie is indistinguishable from that of having been hit over the head with a crowbar.See it if you must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finlly we got godzilla out of that fat looking costume! We got an actual movie instead of those childish movies. But then again. Godzilla in this movie flees the most of the time and lacks the bad ass thing. It also doesn't look bad ass when we look at the face. But the rest of the body is spectacular! It actually looks like a living creature! The godzilla in this movie is agile and intelligent which also is pretty awesome. If we added some nukes and more power and aggression to this godzilla, this would be the best godzilla film ever made. Being killed by 6 rockets was a bit of a letdown.The storyline is also a bit thin but it is something to live with. all in all, not a bad movie (Y)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh I can't stand it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film's a bit of a paradox, on the one hand it does have its awesome moments and is frequently thrilling and entertaining, but it is also so damn dull! And some of the characters were impossibly annoying! "Not anymore Chuck, I quit!" Gah, that bitch thoroughly deserved to get her Razzi! I was never able to sit through it without fast-winding.. To me, it was stunning how badly they misjudged the material. After how terrifically Roland Emmerich staged mass destruction in Independence Day, I was really excited to see what he could do with Godzilla. But, yeah.. What a wasted opportunity. Did anyone in the audience ever walk out thinking that wait a minute, hadn't they already seen the same thing done elsewhere, like in Jurassic Park, not to mention done better? At the climactic seen where Godzilla's on top of the Brooklyn Bridge and he's hit by the missiles which knock him off the bridge and kill him - Even as a kid I thought: what, that's it? That's all it takes to kill him? It didn't take a fan to recognize that this was just plain anticlimactic, like someone pulling out a gun to shoot the bad guy in the finale of a martial arts film. I will say though that I thought the follow-up animated series that they did was not too bad at all. They kept a loose continuity with the feature film, and despite being unable to use any of Toho's famous monster characters, did a decent job of making an interesting set of stories from week to week. One time they even had him up against Quetzalcoatel! They at least had the smarts to make Godzilla a bit more powerful and aggressive, edging him closer to what the original Japanese series embodies. Sigh, I might have liked this picture a lot more if it had been called something other than Godzilla(!) At best, it's a below average monster-on-the-loose film, one that rips off a true classic I might add: Q the Winged Serpent, a film which unlike this one, is not soulless. Aside from the title of the movie, it has nothing to do with Godzilla. I mean of course they should have tried to do their own thing and in their own way, but if you are going to call it Godzilla, then you should at least retain some basis of the original character. That was their fatal flaw - they discarded *everything* except the name. Instead of a somewhat invulnerable dinosaur-like creature with dorsal fins, aggressive and destructive nature, that's equipped with his signature atomic breath and distinctive roar, and a symbol of the nuclear threat, they gave us a radiation-mutated lizard with no special ability who runs from conflict and destroys things by accident. In the end he is easily killed by a single volley of conventional weaponry. There's no discernible subtext to this turkey other than "let's make money!!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Hate The Monster, Hate The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to believe it's been 16 years since we were force-fed this film! But, on the eve of a new Godzilla thrashing theaters, I felt the urge to see a blast from our G-Fan past. Fortunately, much of the hatred for Zilla '98 has died down (mostly due to anticipation for the upcoming redemption by Hollywood next month).While I could sit here and write volumes and volumes on 'the bad' of the film, I think it's been done to death. Instead, I'd like to focus on some of the 'good' the film had to offer (yes, there was SOME good to the film). For parents, this movie is what I could call a "safe" G-flick (much like the original Toho films). By this, I mean there's barely a foul word uttered, no graphic violence I can recall, and no "every film's gotta have one" sex scene. I felt it was safe enough for my 8 year old step-daughter to watch (yes, my step-DAUGHTER loves Godzilla! I'll make a Jedi out of her yet!).The action is over-the-top, well in line for a Godzilla movie. Lots of Godzilla stomping (away from the military), big and loud building explosions (mostly by the military), and absurd amounts of "under-the-line" references to other sci-fi and action films (mostly by the military). There's a lot in Zilla '98 for giant monster fans, action movie fans, and summer "popcorn" movie fans.As a giant monster movie, Zilla '98 works, and it works rather well. For a Godzilla film, maybe not so much. I myself have accepted it as part of the Godzilla mythology, much in the way as "Halloween-III: Season Of The Witch", or maybe "Friday The 13th Part-V: A new Beginning". It will forever be razzed as a Godzilla film. But, if you look past that, and see it more as a giant monster film, it's not half bad. In the end: don't hate the monster, hate the movie.</fullReview>

But to be the Godzilla movie everyone wanted...it needs some work.The little things...the script is really cheesy, and the characters seem to be acting totally brain dead throughout the entire movie. It just doesn't make sense. But now onto the big thing...I can deal with the cast, the script and the brain dead characters....but. WHERE IS GODZILLA? Godzilla looks like a dinosaur off of Jurassic park. Nothing's wrong with Jurassic Park but I expect Godzilla to be amazing and look like the king of all monsters...sadly he doesn't come close. Even in the ending when Godzilla dies and Nick is face to face with him. I understand there's suppose to be a emotional connection they tried to build...but it just wasn't there and neither was the magic that could have made this film a epic classic. So many things were out of place. Starting with the look of Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn irritating actors ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the new release of Godzilla this year, and I'm looking forward to that, I watched this old blockbuster of 1998 once again. Well, it's obviously an old movie in terms of CGI and the acting is sometimes hugely annoying and childish. Compared to the new movie this year it really looks miserable sometimes . On the other hand, I can still remember the original Godzilla movies I saw when I was young in an old movie theater on a Sunday afternoon . There always was some Bruce Lee movie programmed in conjunction with a Japanese Godzilla (vs. King Kong ) or a Bud Spencer/Terence Hill movie . The Japanese Godzilla was hilarious . It looked like a plastic figure between cardboard boxes with some terribly bad special effects . By comparison, this Godzilla is state-of-the-art .Lets have a look at Godzilla first. At times the images are quite good like for instance the underwater images. In most of the movie, we only see parts of Godzilla: a leg that is put down on some stationary taxis, a swishing tail or only his head. Not exactly high technology. What bothered me the most is the fact that the thump of the drop of a foot followed with the subsequently shock wave is not properly synced with the bounce of people and cars . I thought this happens with a bit delay. The fact that New York is turned into a ruin is one thing. The fact that the army is the main cause of this instead of Godzilla is another thing. It's totally ridiculous. And sometimes I had the feeling that the decor was also made of cardboard boxes .The most irritating thing in Godzilla, are the stupid and terrible performances . I think Mathew Broderick is totally misplaced in this monster movie. I can tolerate him in a comedy like "She's having a baby", "Addicted to Love" or "Inspector Gadget ", but not in this disaster movie . Or they used him to pump up the comedy-rate. His name Tatopoulus is already a reason to make some hilarious (sarcastic) jokes. All the time he runs around through the rain with that ridiculous hat and every time he says something it sounds implausible and totally made up .Maria Pitillo looks like an angel but is corny and predictable. She's the blonde bimbo in the news department who's not allowed to bring important news. Eventually she's steals some footage on a tape and makes her own reportage. Her boss uses that for his own benefit but eventually she triumphs with a report at the end. She also appears to be an old sweetheart from Broderick. What a coincidence ! Hank Azaria was actually the best actor. A nice guy at the right time to use the camera for exclusive images. Kind of weird that every time something like that happens, the camera doesn't function properly. Then there are some more irritating people, such as: Kevin Dunn as a pedantic and clamorous Colonel, Michael Lerner as a stupid and thick mayor, Arabella Field as a friend of Animal who apparently doesn't know a cameraman sometimes experiences dangerous situations. Her reaction is almost hysterical all the time. Then there's Vicki Lewis the horny science woman who, despite the apocalyptic situation, still has time to start drooling whenever she looks at Broderick. And last but not least, Doug Savant as the most stupid soldier of the U.S. Army . The PeeWee Herman of the American army .You shouldn't assume that this movie is accurate and realistic. If you seek that in a movie, go watch "The Butler". But there are still quite a few things that look ridiculous . That Godzilla was created by radioactive radiation by nuclear tests in French Polynesia, is actually a variant of the original film . Why that animal must swim all the way to Manhattan to lay her eggs, is a mystery to me. He/she swims from the Pacific Ocean through the Panama Canal, along Florida and then straight to New York . Is he/she making a tourist trip ? The pilots who control the helicopters apparently never had to do an IQ test. They are chased by Godzilla, look over their shoulders in a panic , knowing that if they just flew that thing straight up they would be safe . I also think their index finger got stuck with super glue to the firing mechanism , because they kept spraying bullets continuously even when there was nothing in their sight. And could they ever miss Godzilla ? Such a huge animal . Dr. Tatopoulus is a renowned researcher in the field of animal mutation by radiation. At the time he presents this as proof that Godzilla might be actually a mutant lizard ,everyone declared him as a total nutcase and crazy fruitcake. Why did they call upon him in the first place ?The end was somewhat entertaining with the "Jurasic Park"-like baby Godzillas . But overall it was a disappointment. "Godzilla" had no such effect as let's say "Jaws " or "King Kong". Those movies gave you an anxious feeling. As someone suggested on IMDb : you purchase a lifelike Iguana as a pet, place it in the middle of the living room between some Lego houses , and observe how it moves and destroys everything . This can also be nerve-wracking and exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A monster smashes up New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one expects a movie to be poor and it is not then one is pleasantly surprised. Godzilla is not the epitome of intellectual movies. Actually there is very little in the way of intellectual discussion in this movie. Godzilla is a disaster movie, it is a movie about a giant lizard smashing up New York, and it is a remake of a much older movie using much less money.I enjoyed Godzilla though I have been told that it is not a movie to see a second time. It is nice watching a huge lizard smash up New York. It is nice watching him leap across the FDR expressway (I think) and tip huge boats everywhere. It is also nice watching the three heroes running around Madison Square Gardens being chased by hundreds of mini-Godzillas, but beyond that there is little to raise the movie beyond a cheap thrill.What is interesting is that in this movie we get to see the faces behind some of the characters in the Simpsons. We see Nacy Cartwright (the secretary in the scene where Godzilla walks past the window of the TV station), Hank Azira (the cameraman) and another guy whose name escapes me. Matthew Broderic is the star and Jean Reno plays a major role as a French spy.There is a tiny anti-nuclear power sentiment in this movie, though the science is probably not correct. There is an idea that intense radiation causes creature to mutate by growing, and Godzilla was exposed to the French nuclear testing and is really big. The original though was Japanese and probably dealt with the Hiroshima (I haven't seen it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who said that this is a bad movie ?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a recommendation from a friend, I went to watch it on 11 / 8 / 1998. The theater's huge screen was replaced by a multiplex. I convinced myself to endure one of the new, very small, screens. Then, I sat at the last raw, which is something I regretted since I discovered that the ancient, almost tumbledown, projection was on in a room right beside me, and what an appalling noise it was producing ! Though, I savored this movie to the max. It's utterly fun. It has wonderful action sequences (the taxi's chase is epic), lovely comic atmosphere, non-stop thrill (the eggs' sequence still blows my mind), sedate editing, splendid music and impressive special effects. Maybe it missed more bankable stars, but the movie's cast managed to do well. Nobody was bad in any way. The team of rescue at the end was so funny and impeccable. Jean Reno, in specific, stole the show with memorable wit and charisma. The side characters were funny and interesting too. And I loved a line "Time changes. / some people don't !" which is so rare to happen in a disaster movie !It's, as a whole, an expensive comics, done so rightly. If something was possibly bad; then it could be about how the monster was kind when it came to killing. But this is PG-13 after all, and for my taste I love the no bloody movies. So you can predict my surprise when I heard after the watching that the movie was hated in its homeland, cursed by critics, and nominated for 5 Razzie awards !!!That was a shock. Especially when I knew that it already made good deal of money, locally and internationally ! I asked myself : were all the viewers in America drunk ?! Maybe it's different than the original Asian Godzilla? Maybe they didn't like Matthew Broderick in an action? Or maybe they needed any laughingstock of a movie for that year?It won the Worst Supporting Actress and the Worst Remake or Sequel. While feeling a massive rage, since the lovely Maria Pitillo wasn't close to "awful" or "not good" in no case (and the poor thing didn't get to be in movies again), I feel more rage when many perfectly Razzie material in 1998 didn't even get nominated under any category. Remember these and weep : Free Money, The Godson, Senseless, Hurlyburly, Crazy Six, Krippendorf's Tribe, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Phoenix, The General, The Naked Man, and yes The Thin Red Line. Actually, with that, unfairness hits a super level !Roger Ebert smashed the movie (he was parodied somehow through the character of the mayor). He saw it as bad disaster movie, giving it the famous thumb down, while ? in 1976 ? he gave something with a monster, named (King Kong), a positive review?? AHHHHHHHHHH !!! The lesson to be learned here is : while searching for a laughingstock, some reviewers turn into one themselves !I give Godzilla A plus as huge B entertainment. It will go down in history as one of the most wronged movies ever. Enough to say that it made me forget the projection's appalling noise one time, and makes me forget the critics' more appalling stupidity every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic and dumb, but not quite as bad as they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its category, Godzilla is a decent film. But it does has some big problems which cannot be ignored, and those who say that critics should just take it for what it is - entertainment - and not have high standards for that matter, are wrong. Not having expectations of great artistic merit doesn't mean you can treat the story any way you want without some criticism.The general clichés I think most people will accept, but well, Broderick as some nerdy guy amidst the chaos is afterall a minus, as it's just a bit ridiculous and not funny as they seem to have intended, and his whole romantic story with his old ex hurts the story more than it helps.But I guess the main problem was the unrealisticness parts. As in such a huge monster just coming out of the water in Manhattan like that without anyone noticing before he's actually there.Or the scene where the guys in the tunnel don't realize he's there despite the animal moving its eyelid just a few meters away and even making noise and moving.For me most of all it was the part of the film where the baby godzillas go after the humans. That they would start act like vicious velociraptors five minutes after birth is too ridiculous. You may call this a detail, but it is a key element in the plot. I know these are lizards who don't need the long 'learning curve' like mammals when it comes to hunting for food but Jesus, this was just over the top. They'd have to run out of fish long before they'd start behaving like that, and even then they'd be pretty lame at it at first.On the plus side though, there are a lot of cool scenes and you get plenty of good shots on Godzilla. And it being a huge blockbuster, I don't know what people expected if the disappointment is as huge as it is. I've seen a lot of films in the category that are worse. But Godzilla has somehow been talked of as one of the absolute worst big action flicks of all time, which I don't really get. It's certainly watchable, but it could have been a LOT better. Those who pretend like it's as good as it gets need to think of Jurassic Park.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood favourite monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Godzilla with my grandfather and my elder brother Abhinav in one of the cinemas in Shimla. It sure brings back some great childhood memories. With some brilliant special effects, good background score, nice performances and awesome cinematography it surely tops my list of favorite movies of all times. From the very beginning Godzilla was just meant to be enjoyed and not criticized. The action scenes are so well executed you can actually feel the chill run down your spine.Matthew Broderick as Dr. Niko does some commendable job as a geek main lead. The romance between Maria Pitillo as Audrey and Dr. Niko is not over the top but it surely shows nice chemistry between the two of them. Jean Reno as Philippe, a french agent and Hank Azaria as Victor, the cameraman (The scene where victor almost gets stepped down by Godzilla was nail biting) add humor to the story. The one liners are good but there's a lot of situational comedy in the action scenes which makes you laugh. In the end one feels a bit pity for the giant being, clearly showing that the presentation can alter the perception.With no obscenity or abusive language and no sex I would recommend Godzilla to all horror and action lover children and adult alike. The memory of this movie is etched in my memory forever. I am really unable to comprehend all the bad reviews that Godzilla got, but then to each his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good as a film in it's own right but as a Godzilla film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla is a brilliant franchise and a remake was going to happen sooner are later, but what we got, well, It wasn't really Godzilla at all was it? I mean nobody was expecting the original man in a suit campy monster film that captured our hearts but we at least expected a monster that looked like Godzilla. They made some big changes, eg: Godzilla can't breathe fire, he is much smaller and is not indestructible. Up until a certain point in the film the movie remains true to the original film apart from one thing. In the original Godzilla Godzilla was created by American nuclear bombs. In this remake he is created by FRENCH NUCLEAR BOMBS. Just shows how willing America is to pass the blame from themselves to their arch rivals. And why the hell is Godzilla killed by the military! That ruins the film for everyone. Then it just completely strays away from the original. GODZILLA LAYS EGGS? THAT HATCH INTO VELOCIRAPTERS? Godzilla's offspring was just an excuse to rip off the rapter scene from Jurrasic park. Overall it is in some ways worth watching just, don't expect much!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this Godzilla Failed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For any die hard Godzilla fan's; no matter the age, the movie was quit good but when this Godzilla ran from every weapon! I was waiting for it to run from the dreaded water gun. also The film's impression as real life failure because so many doors could have been opened such as never before seen monsters therefore adding depth to the story and most of all a can't wait for a part two. Some times film makers feel too much such as "How are the kids going to take this" get real- a good horror movie mission is freak you out years to come. Godzilla (1998) was O.K. but the story should have had more and next time don't run from all the weapons U.S. Of A. I'm sorry to say we had our shot but the next GODZILLA I've herd 2011 ALL OUT, WARS, NO HOLD'S BARD, Future story, three hour movie! To Die For movie - HORROR, unstoppable force, GODZILLA!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a Godzilla fan for many years you can imagine my excitement when the museum trailer burst on to screen showing Godzilla's foot! Finally my favourite movie monster was getting the BIG budget re-make it so deserved, coupled with my favourite movie makes Devlin and Emmerich it seemed as if the film was going to be taylor made just for me! After the months of hype and grabbing every scrap of info i could find to try to get the plot, Zilla's final look, and inside gossip, i bought my ticket and grasped it tightly as i was so wound up to see this movie and could only imagine what modern technology would do for my beloved monster.After 2+ hours of movie and coming back down to reality, i could not help but remain a little confused as to what i just saw? It sounded like Godzilla, the plot was a typical Godzilla plot, even both versions of his name were mentioned, but try as i might, i have to admit, it just didn't FEEL like Godzilla.If your just looking for a big monster mash up with some tongue in cheek humour, then this is for you. If its the essence and spirit of Godzilla then you might feel like me. Its a good movie but it promised so much, i suppose it was unrealistic to expect a movie with this kind of material to deliver the 'total package' that was in ID4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Godzilla was pretty sexy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was really the early stages of when Hollywood poured all the CGI to create its effects. It all began in the 90's and Godzilla 1998 was one of the first blockbuster Science Fiction monster movies to start the trend. In an age where remakes are told in a newer and updated version there are those who still yearn for the prototypical creations that began yesteryear.This Godzilla is sort of a culmination of a giant monster action film and Jurassic Park. The characters are all familiar and likable. Throw in a love interest subplot along a plot involving scientific experiments gone haywire and civic corruption and you have Godzilla 1998. The special effects are good and there are some laughs. Godzilla the creature looks different than the earlier creations played by men in rubber suits. This Godzilla is actually a much prettier, sleek and elusive reptilian. He doesn't breathe gas or fire, but just simply leaps and swims in a lithe and sexy way. He doesn't even cause much destruction or human death. He just runs around in a leering and menacing way. He's actually rather pathetic since he doesn't cause much havoc, but rather gets enough abuse from gunfire and explosive rockets from the U.S. National Guard. The old Godzilla was a much more formidable villain as he destroyed many lives and buildings. The new Godzilla leaves mass destruction in his wake, but doesn't assume as many victims. I guess if he did they would have to ratchet up the rating to R.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the movies that i end up watching every time it comes on TV. I know its not the best movie, but for some reason i can watch this movie without being bored every time. This is really strange because there are movies that i really liked the first time but i just cant stand to watch it again. An example is TDK; I loved it the first time but could hardly sit through it the second time.I don't know the exact reason i i like this movie but maybe its because its got very few scenes thats taxing on me. There are secens in TDK and Shawshank redemption(two movies i really love)that are a bit taxing for me, like the scenes involving Gordon's faked death and his family or the scenes involving the sisters in SR.I really like Mattew Broderick. I find his acting really unassuming and straightforward which is perfect for the role and i like the chemistry he shares with the girl. Coming to the plot there isn't really anything special or surprising(other than they finding a million egg in the garden), just the usual Hollywood disaster movie formula; thinking that they had killed the monster and then it coming back in the end. But the action scenes were well choreographed and the VG was top class. I Never remembering having noticing the VG, it seemed pretty natural(the matrix style dark/blue ambiance helps in that department).Overall really watchable movie(although not multiple times).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good But Yet Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GodzillaStarring: Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, Kevin Dunn, Hank Azaria, Vicki Lewis, Harry Shearer and Malcolm DenareGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated: PG-13This is another movie that a lot of people and critics have bashed on but once again I disagree. The movie is about Nick Tatopolous (Matthew Broderick) who mainly studies earthworms until the government reassigns him to an even bigger (and I do mean bigger) assignment than earthworms and that is the footprints of a giant lizard that attacked some Japanese ships. Of course the lizard turns out to be not other than Godzilla which ends up running out and causing havoc in New York. So now it's up to Nick Tatopolous, The Government, Philippe Roache (Jean Reno) and his French organization to stop Godzilla. Now I have never seen any of the original Godzilla movies (the ones that were made from Japan) but from looking at the original Godzilla, this one doesn't have the same characteristics as the original, the original Godzilla breathes fire and is invincible and this one in the movie doesn't breathe fire and is weaker since he gets shot down by missiles when the only thing that can defeat him is another monster. But I most say that I take the design of Godzilla in this movie more serious than the original Godzilla because this Godzilla looks cool and the original Godzilla to me looks funny looking. I didn't like the fact that they made this Godzilla lay eggs because male lizards cannot lay eggs and the whole egg bit was just an excuse for Roland Emmerich to copy off of Jurassic Park instead of staying true to the character. I did think it was funny that this movie spoofed Siskel &amp; Ebert (even though I like Siskel &amp; Ebert) which Roland Emmerich did because they have never gave thumbs up to any of his movies, but Roland didn't even take advantage of this joke and even Gene Siskel mentioned that Roland Emmerich should've taken advantage of putting the critics in this movie. I also thought some of the dialogue in this movie could have been way better but other than that everything else is alright. The movie even had a surviving egg at the end that was going to set it up for a sequel but it never happened due to all the negative reviews. I would've liked to see a sequel to this movie but at least I'm glad that they continued this movie in a cartoon series which was good. Overall just decent popcorn entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as they say!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I just want to say that I know this film is nothing like the original Godzilla (although I actually haven't seen any of those), and I respect that some people won't like it for that. But I feel myself that even if it's failed as a remake, it's certainly a thrilling movie in its own right. The opening was really haunting; the music and the nuclear montage really reeled me in, and the attacks on the boats were amazing (especially the state the big fishing boat ended up in). When Godzilla gets to New York, things just get better from there - the effects are good, and the cast play their characters well (yes, even Maria Pitillo). I only have a few small criticisms; 1. Even without knowing the true Godzilla very well, this one is clearly a total Hollywood farce - an iguana on steroids, that has a massive chin and looks completely different than it did before the nuclear thing (it was supposed to simply grow, but its like its been to the gym too) 2. That taxi in the chase must've been indestructible. I swear, it wasn't a regular vehicle... the suspension was incredible, surviving being almost swallowed and trodden on and thrown about,and then the high-beams... and the JUMP off the collapsing bridge onto the road! 3. Speaking of that bridge, it must've been made of reinforced diamond - it sort of half-heartedly collapsed even after a dirty great anthropomorphic lizard jumped on it. 4. In real life, I doubt four people would escape a hell-hole like that with just a gun and some chandeliers...Despite these flaws (which I think added a bit of comedy) I think it is a much underrated film that deserves a bit of slack. Maybe just give it a second chance, hm?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GOOD FILM, but shouldn't bare the name Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good action popcorn movie. The thing is, it shouldn't be called Godzilla because it bares more respect towards Jurrassic Park than it does Godzilla. Godzilla doesn't even look like Godzilla, he looks like a T-Rex, Godzilla isn't a T-Rex, he's a cross between two dinosaurs (the T-Rex and Stegasorause) In this film he doesn't even breath fire (the scene where he roars and the cars blow up is often mistaken as him breathing fire) Godzilla isn't to be taken out by the military, he's suppose to be attacked by another monster which defends the city. Over all, its OK and great for the action, but doesn't count as Godzilla. In the Film "Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack" they mention that a giant monster sitting happened in New York City which was believed to be Godzilla, but really wasn't. Then in "Godzilla- Final Wars" the Japanese Godzilla fights the American Godzilla (Japan renames him Zilla) and the Japanese Godzilla take him out with his fire breath easily. This should be renamed "Zilla" thats all it should be, GREAT FILM, not a Godzilla film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Were They Thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely include a spoiler in my review unless it is impossible to discuss what I want to without one. Most of the people who bash this movie are off base. What occupies the screen more than suffices. The characters are lacking, but not cardboard or boring. The dialogue is bland but never bad. The visuals are awesome. Nobody uses scale and lighting to create tension better than director Roland Emmerich. He is one of the great action directors of our time. The problem is what we never see. It is a colossal, titanic, mammoth, astronomical and gigantic omission.Many people assert that the script is dumbed down. It is not. "Con Air" is dumbed down. "Charlie's Angels" is dumbed down. "Batman and Robin" is dumbed down. "The Avengers" is dumbed down. "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" is dumbed down. I have not seen "Armageddon," but judging by what I have read, it is the epitome of dumbed down.The "Godzilla" script makes sense and moves with clarity. It does not jump right into the action. Godzilla does not make an appearance until 25 minutes into the movie and we do not see his face until the 45 mark. The plot is simple to follow, and the main ideas and numerous developments are repeated in conversation. They also hold up under scrutiny. Roger Ebert raises many questions, but is wrong on the details. He questions why Godzilla fits into a subway tunnel. He does not. He burrows under it. We even see him do so later on. Ebert sees many movies so mistakes do happen. Speaking of Ebert, the mayor of New York and his assistant are patterned after him and then-partner Gene Siskel. I happen to like Ebert, but he was a grouch towards Emmerich's first two blockbusters: "Stargate" and "Independence Day." "Godzilla" invests a lot of time into its humans. There are four separated from the rest in the credits: Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), the expert on Godzilla; Philippe (Jean Reno), a Frenchman with initially mysterious motives; Audrey Timmonds (a hot Maria Pitillo), a reporter with ties to Tatopoulos; and 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria), a cameraman who wants to help. Broderick and Pitillo fail to bring enough life to their characters. Pitillo cries in once scene, but the angle and lighting of the shot prevent me from seeing if her tears are real. Reno and Azaria inhabit the most distinctive roles in both writing and acting. Kevin Dunn plays an unusually smart military leader who makes Andre Braugher ("Rise of the Silver Surfer") look like a cadaver.The Omission: Godzilla's signature weapon, note the word *signature,* is the atomic beam he emits from his mouth. The beam is intensely hot and causes explosions upon impact. It is not fire; Godzilla is not a dragon. King Kong's size engenders fear, but Godzilla stands six times as tall. Nevertheless, *his beam* sets him apart from all other monsters. I watched "Son of Godzilla" as a child, and was awed by his neon blue ray. I was too young to see this "Godzilla" in theaters, but when I remembered and rented it, I eagerly awaited the atomic breath.*It never came!* Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (writers, producer, director) try to fool the audience that the movie is over. I am sure many people fell for it, but I knew there was more to come. "It couldn't be over," I thought, "I have not yet seen the ray!" I felt disbelief when I realized it was not going to come. Devlin and Emmerich stripped Godzilla of his most popular and distinctive quality, and cheated the audience of what most of them desired.The atomic breath had been used in 22 movies by that time. I love Devlin and Emmerich. "Stargate" is solid sci-fi entertainment. It spawned two television series with a combined 15 seasons and counting. "Independence Day" is the most stunning movie ever made. Twenty-two movies and cultural legend status is a lot of history. This is not their original material. Nobody, not them, not even Alfred Hitchcock, has the right to alter Godzilla. "Godzilla" could easily be a nine, but scores a six of ten instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright here it is, for one i have been a Godzilla fan since i was a kid. This movie was excellent for special effects and story line. BUT.... what i didn't need to see was a few actors from a previous movie of both dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. For those who don't remember during the sub scene one of the captains from the sub was from independence day. A helicopter pilot who came to one of the ships in order to make contact. A black guy i cant remember his name offhand, but it was so disconcerting to see him in there playing again a soldier or captain or such. Some of the other actors also appeared in the film from independence day. I hate to say this, but even though i hold very high regards for both dean and Roland, it would have been nice to see some new fresh faces on the screen rather than looking at a few of the same actors who made their film independence day so huge. Other than that Mathew Broderick was very classy in this film as a biologist in the field of chemical attributes from fallout effects on animals. Along with his cohorts who help his theories of trying to convince the army that Godzilla has laid eggs in Madison square garden. It was a very approachable story and to watch Godzilla in action again was a treat. Very well done special effects and keeping his size the same. But for the downside it was sad to see same actors in this film from a previous one. This is the first time i gave a movie of this caliber below ten.</fullReview>

The only actors I enjoyed were Hank Azaria and Jean Reno. The whole thing with the nest was definitely an interesting point in the story and the action during that time was great, and then when Godzilla came back and saw his children dead was a heartfelt scene where you could sympathize with the creature.

		<fullReview>OK, a lot has been said here of why this film ain't what it could have been. To me, it was vastly superior to the original Godzilla flicks. Things have moved on from latex suits. As soon as the monster appears, it's sheer size and incredible scenes involving it running through New York had me very impressed.The problem I have is the script. How, in all possibility, can a monster lizard that leaves ten-feet deep footprints on city streets, end up evading it's pursuers? Follow the huge holes! (Ok, with this film, that's what you have to do). Also grating was the over-use (once was too much) of a lame gag involving Matthew Broderick's character's hard-to-pronounce Greek name.The ending was pure Jurassic Park (a long-lost mate of equal or even larger size would have been the ending that saved it, not pseudo-raptors sliding around a building)That said, Hank Azaria and Matthew Broderick show they can star alongside Jean Reno and come off pretty well. Reno must have needed the money; this is no Leon or Ronin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla--Great Monster VS Dumb Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla was a great visual experience, and with great sound for that matter. What the movie lacked in plot and substance, it made up for in effects. Acting wasn't too horrible (with, perhaps, the exception of Ms. Audrey Timmons). In fact, I believe Matthew Broderick did a very nice job with the poor plot he was given. Also, Jean Reno's character is probably one of my all time favorites.One of the biggest flaws in this movie is editing. More jabber by the actors than destruction by our Godzilla friend. The film makers had a great CGI monster on their hands--I really don't see why they didn't take more advantage of it.Other than that weird music at the end credits, I'd have to say the music was at least decent.I think the main factor behind Godzilla's downfall wasn't the planes at all, but the advertising before the movie ever came out. That got on MY nerves more than anything else ("His eyes is bigger than this billboard," etc.).Other than the plot holes and editing problems, Godzilla was a fairly good film. I place blame on the director more than anyone else for not making it "Bigger, Louder, and Funner!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get real its a creature feature, not a serious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the Godzilla films. I love the original the most, but this is a respectable addition of the family of films. To the critics, get real its a creature feature, not a serious film. The acting is irrelevant. Watch the original. What fine acting!!! NOT! The characters are what they are, objects for the audience to care about and move the story along.Things I really like about this film. 1) They make the monster mortal. Japanese films make Godzilla indestructible until the very last sequence. If bombs, electricity, depth charges etc. can't kill him, how can oxygen destroyer? or a bomb that digs into the skin? This film is unique in that his ability to survive has more to do with being cold blooded, and quick, than to being indestructible. In the final sequence he is netted by the cables of the Brocklyn bridge and killed by missile. This is a much more realistic creature feature. (er, except for the fact that a creature that big would have broken its own legs walking... darn physics, but who cares).2) The big chase near the end is more personal -- The big mommy is upset over her dead offspring. Japanese films have a complete split between the monsters world and the people -- little interaction (except perhaps at the end of All Out Moster Attack (or whatever its called). The destroys kills, but for not real reason. 3) Its a creature feature and knows what it is. The special effects are really nicely rendered, but the producers didn't try to thrust into movie any attempt at a real story -- its a creature feature, nothing more, nothing less. In contrast the remake of King Kong completely forgot that the film was a creature feature and tried to make it into a story. They ended up with something twice as long as it should be... good special effects but a terrible script.4) The monster is not inherently destructive or brutal. Unlike the 1954/56 original the monster is not out to get people, it just wants to nest. Its an animal. It has babies. It makes no effort to kill people.5) The monster looks much more realistic than the Japanese versions typically do). The original with the upright stance was filmed when scientist believed that dinosaur carnosaurs walked up right with their tail on the ground. We now know they didn't they help their tail off the ground. The stance in this film is based on the movements of dinosaurs.Things I didn't like. 1) The physics and biology of laughable. How did it get into the subway, how did it get into Madason gardens to lay eggs? But then who cares, as I said its a creature feature.2) The issue of nuclear testing is brought up, but it creation is attributed the the French. So although it added in a hint of the original anti-nukes message, they attribute nukes to the French. Hello, haven't the Americans done far more testing of nukes than the French? Its a bit of French bashing showing that French bashing predates their refusal to back the American misadventures in the Gulf. But the French secret service character is very entertaining (a great actor).On balance, this is a good creature feature... Much better than the recent remake of King Kong.It should also be noted that at least 2 recent Japanese Godzilla films have made references to this movie. In one, a scientist summarizes the history of Godzilla attacks and mentions the one that hit New York. In "All out monster attack" the New Yorker is Zilla (shown attacking New Zealand according to my kids), he is one of the bad monsters controlled by the space aliens. The fact that the Japanese have added this film to their collection is a tribute to the films success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun but frightening American Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is kinda a fun film! It really is! Matthew Broderick played in it and many other actors and actresses. Godzilla wasn't a large walking puppet in the east?Asia?but a computer roaming the west?USA. It was rather scary! A little like Jurassic Park but not really. We saw this at the theater and had lots of laughs and fun. But we got pretty scared too! It wasn't exactly a light film but kinda dark instead. Literality, it was often night and it rained, rained and rained in the film. And that made Godzilla just as scary. I think you should see it, people, if you want fun thrills and chills from an American Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is not a Godzilla movie. It does fairly well as a monster movie except for the god awful choice of Maria Pitillo as the lead actress. She makes dumb blonds seem like Einstein. There are plenty of really smart blonds out there but Pitillo is just plain embarrassing. The computer graphics are outstanding. I would have rather seen someone like Peter Weller as Dr. Tatopoulos. Why they kept making a joke out of his name is beyond me and the total disrespect shown him is uncalled for. This man is a scientist of some esteem. How he ever had Pitillo as a romantic interest with his genius and her crass stupidity is a true mismatch. Jean Reno is very good as he is, in my opinion, all of his roles. Vicki Lewis, who I think is sexy as hell, as Dr. Elsie Chapman, also did well in her role considering the script. Hank Aaria as 'Animal' and Arabella Field, another cutie, did quit well with their parts. Kevin Dunn as Colonel Hicks was a disgrace to our officer corps. When Broderick corrected Hicks' mispronunciaton of his name, Tatopouolos, Hicks answered with a 'whatever',,,disgusting! What's the story with Sergeant O'Neil? He is not funny, just plain sickening. He is as dumb as a brick and a disgrace to every non-com in our military. The opening scene with the fishing vessel in natural and 'unnatural' distress is impressive. I was nine years old when the original 'Godzilla' was released and it scared the bejeesus out of me. I now have fifteen follow-up 'Godzilla' films in my collection and love each one. These are tongue-in-cheek matinée gems. I am a physician and when I want to escape from reality, and 'Godzilla' movies are a real escape from reality, I pop one in the VCR/DVD player.For crying out load, one has to understand that this new version is still a reality escape but with tons of acting flaws with weak scripting which I can love in B films like 'The Monster that Challenged the World' but are inexcusable in a costly film like the one under discussion. With all of the actors and actresses out there that would probably jump at chance to play(and have fun)in a really good write of this film, I can see why they did not jump. If they had a really good screenplay script and the actors were anywhere near believable this could have been a really good film. They missed a real opportunity here, an opportunity wasted,,a chance to introduce 'Gozilla' to an entirely new generation of kids and adults that are kids at heart,,not to mention the opportunity for at least one sequel. Where was the Morgan Freeman narration, Will Smith's excitement or even Elvira's campiness.Sad. When I left the opening day showing at the local cineplex, I was almost in tears. No fire breathing, no empathy for the big 'G', ...what it could/should have been and is not...so sad :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining, but flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla 1998 is a re imagining of the original Godzilla rather than a continuation. In this version, Godzilla is a far more realistic beast. He is an iguana vastly mutated by atomic bomb testing in French Polynisia rather than a prehistoric monster coming out of hiding. Godzilla migrates to New York where he makes a home for himself in the sewage and subway systems, occasionally coming above ground to wreak havoc. While Godzilla is not a great movie, it is highly entertaining. In fact, it's more entertaining than the original films.I'll start with the good. First off, Roland Emmerich is like Irwin Allen for the new generation. He makes some really good sci-fi/action/disaster movies, even though they don't have great acting or writing, the plots and action scenes are entertaining. Roland Emmerich puts his style into the new Godzilla and it makes for some great action sequences including a couple of scenes of Godzilla tearing through New York. Every scene involving Godzilla is about as entertaining as you can get. This movie even shows what I would believe to be an accurate view of how far the U.S. Army will go to end a threat by showing the army blowing up buildings and streets in an attempt to stop Godzilla.Now with the bad. The actors cast in this movie aren't great. Matthew Broderick is really weak is Nick Tatopolous, the scientist trying to learn from Godzilla. Maria Pitillo absolutely sucks as Nick's love interest. Jean Reno is always pretty good, but he's just playing his average french action hero in this. Hank Azaria isn't a great actor, but he's okay in this due to his comic relief. Oh, and what's with the Simpsons alumni in this film? Harry Shearer (Mr. Burns, Smithers) plays Charles Caiman, Hank Azaria (Moe, Apu) plays Animal, and Nancy Cartwright (Bart) plays Caiman's secretary. The dialogue in this film isn't anything special. All of the touchy love scenes that they threw in for dramatic effect fall flat.Overall, an entertaining film, but not an accomplishment.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I was rooting for the big, funny looking lizard called Godzilla. I grew up watching the old Godzilla movies, but I really don't have any crazed devotion to them like some people seem to. In this movie, poor Godzilla just wants to eat some fish and have some babies. It was nice to Ferris Bueller even! Then the evil American military opens file on poor Godzilla, with the gay guy from Melrose Place inexplicably cast here as a soldier.While this movie was watchable, it didn't really deliver, as far as wholesale destruction and mayhem. I think there was more destruction in Superman 2. Also, the monster kept running away when attacked. It didn't really kill anybody, except maybe a couple of Army 'copter pilots. There should have been crowds of screaming, annoying New Yawkers getting crushed underfoot. And what was the deal with the French super-spies? They seemed like they wandered onto the wrong movie set. And it seemed strange that while mommy Godzilla was rather sweet, that her newborns would be so vicious and deadly, right out of the eggs, very much like the raptors in Jurassic Park.There was also a couple scenes when it kind of looked like Godzilla was breathing fire, but it could have just been explosions in front of its mouth...It really wasn't clear. And when poor giant lizard dies at the end, I wished all the people there had died instead, since the poor thing was more likable than any of the bland, one-dimensional characters...Even the despicable TV anchor survived!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy watching this movie, but I felt (possible spoiler) that the directors should have picked a CGI Godzilla more like the classic Godzilla I grew up with. I don't mean a bulky man-in-a-suite looking Godzilla but a sleeker version of the 90s version of Godzilla. But other then the CGI-zilla, I have no problems with the rest of the movie. One thing I noticed was the stupidity of the military I think is a tribute to military of the old Godzilla movies, who never learn that tanks do not hurt the giant monsters. I think people should just sit back and enjoy the movie as a fun action romp with big explosions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The monster under (and over) the asphalt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first of all we must forget about the original (and better Godzilla). Thsi new monster is now an already defeated beast, not an unforgettable character or a powerful image. Is a creature that is scary, and when you see it in full lenght, is kinda cute, but the scary effect is already lost. Still showing a dangerous aspect even after it presentation. The worst part of Godzilla, being honest and straight, are the characters, all of them very cliché, written using a book of "How to write successful screenplays and don't die trying to". The only two actors and character that survive this mayhem are Hank Azaria and Jean Reno, both of them not only funny but credible in their cliché skins.The creature design is kinda good, we can't say something bad about the guy who gave us the horrific aliens of ID4. Roland Emmerich is a good director, but this is his lowest movie till the date (not reaching the levels achieved by ID4 or The day after tomorrow) And if we add a too much long duration (more than 2 hours...what the hell they have in mind?) we can say only one thing. The original spirit of Godzilla is dead, but what came from the ashes is a very cool way of present a creature to the new generation, and also a good show for the special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pseudo-Godzilla is Still a Fairly Engaging Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If only the creature had only been named something else and not touted as the "Godzilla successor", the movie would have done much better.I saw the movie in a theater almost as soon as it came out in 1998 and I own a VHS copy. It's been about five years since I've seen "Godzilla [1998]" (hereafter G98), but I generally have favorable memories of it. No, G98 is not a masterpiece; it has its flaws, but it is far from being an abomination. The movie's major strength and flaw simultaneously is Pseudo-Godzilla himself(or is it herself-oh androgyny!). As a mythic force of nature, it falls short; it is vulnerable to heavier artillery, it is not wantonly destructive, and it deigns to stoop to Tatopoulos's (Matthew Broderick's) level (like a man wishing to communicate with an ant). As a super-beast, Pseudo-Godzilla is more impressive; it is extremely powerful, lithe, agile, clever, and tenacious in self-defence and of its raptor-like brood. I think the decision to cast Pseudo-Godzilla as a plausible animal with plausible animal behaviors, instead of, well, as a "God Lizard" was G98's major fatal flaw.When Pseudo-Godzilla is striding across New York, one feels a frisson of awe; he's so tall all you see are his muscular legs trampling across the street. But, the problem is, this Pseudo-Godzilla is apparently agoraphobic; he prefers to burrow and live in subterranean passages (although as an irradiated iguana, instead of say, a Gila monster, it's not really built for digging). Instead of terrorizing the world, all this titan wants to do is eat fish (again, not part of a herbivorous iguana's diet) and raise its young. Like a zookeeper using a steak to rouse a sleeping lion so the visitors aren't disappointed, Tatopoulos and the military employ fish mounds to entice the lizard to the surface. In short, Pseudo-Godzilla is not the supernatural monster summer audiences anticipated, but a simple creature that is monstrous only by accident.Therefore, in my opinion, I believe that to get the most out of this guilty pleasure of a movie, pretend that the creature is not Godzilla, but instead, say, the more prosaic Beast from 20,000 fathoms. Then one can appreciate the thrilling set-pieces more thoroughly. Also, to compensate for Pseudo-Godzilla's relatively scanty screen time, take the banalities the human cast utters with a block of salt, block any comparisons to "Jurassic Park" in savoring the infant Godzilla sequence, and commend Tatopoulos for his ruse in leading Pseudo-Godzilla to his Waterloo. I am aware this involves some "intelligence dampening", but again G98 was always intended as a roller coaster sensation machine, which it succeeds in being to some degree, certainly more so than the outlandish dubbed Toho schlockfests of the last four decades or so.In conclusion, to paraphrase a former acquaintance who saw G98 in the theater with me, it's not Godzilla, but it's fairly good.</fullReview>

The actors are well chosen and do their best, to entertain us. You can say whatever you want about Roland Emmerich, but he always knows how to find the right actors. Then everything goes "Boom" and "Crash" and you got no time to think about something like plot holes and THAT'S what I wanna see, when I go to see a Hollywood-action film!

		<fullReview>That's the only reason. The French save the world. That's the only reason almost all people - in USA, I must say - hate this movie.In despite of the people searching for sci-fi in a movie named "Godzilla", of the fans of the Japanese movies (Heavens!), of all the past times the duo Emmerich-Devlin had ruined a not-bad-but-remake-of-an-old-idea (i.e. almost all their past movies) this one it's not so bad, guys. But that is not the point. It's about the "masterpiece" of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich.The aforementioned duo have spent last years delighting us with some remakes and the like of sci-fi films or ideas (Years ago a young jury at a Cinema Festival for the young here in my country voted "Joey" as best movie, while the real jury voted, more accordingly, "My Life as a Dog". If you want to know for sure Emmerich's opinion about his favorite film, pay attention to the Star Wars DVD Trilogy extras(1)).The first real "success" of the duo was "Stargate", which is nothing but "Flash Gordon" with the Army around. An almost decent movie, not much expensive (by Hollywood standards) and with a script capable of solve the whole crisis in a hurry that would make George Lucas face turn red in envy. We arrive, we discover this Egyptian demigod (Ra!), we killed him and destroy his superior technology and his powerful pyramid-vessel, thanks for everything, next time will stay a bit longer. Pathetic (the TV series is terribly boring. Sorry).And then came the martians (whatever). And this, my friends, is your idea of a good spectacle. In that time was fun to see the White House blowing up in a zillion fragments, and your sympathetic army saving the entire world by destroying a whole technologically superior civilization (I'm sorry, not too advanced after all; 50 years and they use the same fighters-computers, as we see in the 51 area sequence), I repeat, an entire civilization (as the president reads in the mind of the "martian", remember? They traveled all at once as friends, like the Indians in an old Spanish joke :D) destroyed in 2 days, at time for the 4th of July. You know, here in Europe we laughed deeply at cinemas with the speech of the president. And cheered, too.And then came this Godzilla flick, which is, I'm sorry again, the best movie this German-americanized-in-more-than-one-way duo has ever made.I can remember that in that time, France was really doing nuclear tests in Moruroa (or was Mururoa?). This was the perfect starting point. Given the love this two, Devlin &amp; Emmerich, feel for their land of adoption, USA couldn't at all be responsible for the needed nuclear explosion that, traditionally, unleashed the beast, oh, no. Not the only country who has ever used the bomb against civilian targets, making later the role of victims in "The Day After"."But ?what the politics have to do with a movie like this?". Since ALL the cinema is politics, everything. And in this very case, the most. This is a film in the "tradition" which gave fame and fortune to Emmerich-Devlin: an old idea modernized, for all audiences (meaning this you can save the dog but not the woman in certain situations, I suppose), a constant rip of classics (it was "Lawrence of Arabia" in Stargate), like the galactic trench run of the helicopters after the lizard in the middle of NY among other "homages" (not to mention "Jurassic Park", another "masterpiece") and with nerd-but-nice scientist and too-much-nice army men (not to forget the real heroes, the french secret service) who save the day and everything.At this point I want to call your attention to the other duo, with much more artistic sense than the first one, responsible of the script; I mean the Ted Elliot-Terry Rossio tandem, writers of some very good blockbuster movies like "The Mask of Zorro", "Aladdin", "Pirates of the Caribbean - Episode I :D" and others. I bet my neck about the fact that, having in mind what the first team can do, the best ideas in this movie are the second's: the french not only creating the monster (only an animal hungry for fish!) but in the end destroying it (while the army destroys the luckily evacuated city; luckily for the MPAA and the rating of the film), the origin of the name of the creature and the joke about the Americanization of the original name-film, from "Gojira" to "Godzilla", and fortunately, the US army dying as idiots and destroying NY (is a right-wing classic topic to despise the media, so that's another very different thing, more to the likes of Emmerich-Devlin). About the fact that the french agent's names are "Jean-Claude", "Jean Patrick" and "Jean-Philippe", the "bad" news chief is "Caiman" and the "good" cameraman is "Animal", I can't possibly imagine who had the idea.The real thing is that the French save the world, man. The Army almost destroy New York. That is no good, right?Like another American hero would say, I have nothing more to say about this. And sorry for my mad engrish.(1) In Roland Emmerich's own words "My friends in school liked Fassbinder, and I liked Star Wars", or something like that.</fullReview>

We have a huge CGI Godzilla crushing everything in New York City, Mathew Broderick and Jean Reno sporting semi-funny lines while trying to stop the thing, some unknown actors in the rather pointless supporting roles (unfortunately none of these annoying people get eaten), a big bunch of Americans firing everything they've got on this powerful PC creature, and a Madison Square Garden filled with the monster's eggs.If you're looking for home entertainment, this is the movie. Turn off your brain, put it in a sack, hide the sack in your basement so that the brain doesn't try to escape, and then tune in to the Americanized Godzilla. Note: I haven't seen the original, so I can't tell which one is better.A wonderful, crazy monster movie with decent actors who don't divert your attention from the real star of this movie: Gojira!!!!

The old fashioned film at the beginning, showing what basically is the birth of Godzilla is great, acompanied by awesome music by David Arnold. We get to learn a lot about our characters before the action begins, and the enterence that Godzilla makes in to New York is just fantastic. It's filmed in a way that doesn't allow you to see the actual creature as a whole, but by just running when Godzilla walks through the streets, only being able to view his massive legs. I feel the movie also has a message, and that message is, we can all learn from our mistakes.This is a great movie, directed superbly by Roldand, and the Special effects (Like in Independence Day) are ahead of their time.My official rating for this movie, is an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, if you are expecting a movie starring that Japanese sensation Godzilla, you WILL be disappointed. If you have no expectations, then you may enjoy this movie. However, you have to overcome some very large obstacles first. With big budget Hollywood movies being what they are, there is a tendency to be formulaic. "Okay, we want a large animal destroying a city." "Which City?" "How about New York?" "Good! Now what kind of monster?" "Hey lets make a Godzilla movie!" "A giant radioactive Lizard! Great, but why New York?" They answer all the broad questions, but leave gaping holes they hope the viewer doesn't notice. Some of us noticed.The movie is long. Perhaps even too long. In the tradition of many true Godzilla movies, the monster doesn't appear in full glory until well into the movie. Godzilla fans at this point will probably say, "Hey that's not Godzilla." By the way, why would you make a movie called Godzilla and NOT make a Godzilla movie? Problems below which contain spoiler information.They tried to be scientific with this Godzilla. They imply that SHE is some form of marine iguana. However, they run in that whole "born pregnant" scenario. Godzilla is a Tribble?The further trouble they run into is Iguanas are cold blooded creatures. New York gets cold. Winter would kill all the baby Godzillas. So, Mamma G would look for someplace warm like the Bahammas. No big cities to trash there.So, in their attempt to be more scientific, they run into more problems. Also, if a 40 story monster was in my city, I think I would be able to find her. Unless she is a chameleon too. Could a 40 story lizzard fit into the sewers?If you can suspend belief to a huge extant, then you may be able to enjoy this movie. There is plenty of eye candy to go around. There are a few entertaining moments, but with its length they are too few. Also, it simply isn't a Godzilla movie. The Japanese have spent the couple of years since showing what the American's could have done with their movie. Each one of those are better than this one. Check out one of those they are vastly superior to this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While other commenters have given mixed reviews of this film, I have to say that this version of Godzilla is way overblown, boring, and almost not worth watching. Anyone who watches this expecting it to be superior to the original Japanese versions of the Godzilla films will be greatly unimpressed, as Godzilla here looks and acts much less menacing than in those 1950s and 60s classics. Quite literally, this movie is almost like Jurassic Park set in Manhattan, as Godzilla looks much more like a dinosaur than a creature spawned from radiation. Additionally, we actually see very little of Godzilla as a whole, as over half of the shots of the monster are of its tail swinging or a closeup of one of its eyes. In reality, this movie could be called The Worm Guy Story, as way too much time is spent focusing on Matthew Broderick's character ("The Worm Guy") and it seems at time that Godzilla is secondary to his trials and tribulations. I actually cannot recommend this movie at all, and I nearly shut it off halfway through it was so lame. Avoid it and rent one of those Japanese originals for a good time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many reviewers here I am shocked at the immature and startling comments regarding this new Godzilla. To begin with the fanboys begin dissing this film months before it was released because they have too much time on their hands. Things went south from there.I like this movie despite its many faults because, for the most part, I buy into it. I suspend reality -- reality has no place in films of this nature.If you're gonna remake a movie, one assumes it will be a completely different animal. How can it not? The original Godzilla costume would have looked ridiculous in modern day New York. The original was a lumbering dinosaur. How many reptiles do you know lumber? So let's end the dissatified comments on how the creature looked. They did a good job updating it. Do you have idea how dumb the original would have looked strolling down Park Ave??Okay, lets dig deeper. The acting styles from all six major characters were very different -- that's the directors fault. Broderick had no business being in this movie (This is not the thing he does well, he is an emotional actor) Action is not his thing. The horrible actress who played his college girl friend was so awful, she was in a different movie. Totally incongruous to the rest of the story -- like she was in TV drama. Jean Reno (all praise Mr. Reno) was the only actor who knew he was in a Radition Theatre Action film and played his character accordingly. His funny team was cool too. Hank (Animal) was sweet comic relief BUT did we need the character? Did we need to know the army personnel, especially that red haired horny woman. God I prayed for her to be eaten by Godzilla. In conclusion, there were too many characters, too many subplots,But I accepted it. The studio wanted a big film. Different stories, perspectives. In a ID4 we were given different parts of the country responding to the alien event, each region, each situation, each actor rang true for their segments. I believed Randy Quaid and his portion of the film. The President scenes also. I believed each region -- it was focused.This studio decision of a Big Flick was wrong for Godzilla. Wipe out the newscaster subplot and the ex girlfriend entirely and concentrate on the hero, the anti-hero's (the French) and the bad guys (The army) This would have made for a better film.But who the heck cares about a better film!! This isn't a drama. This is cartoon action. This is a ride film. This is check your brain at the door and hang on.My last comment is about the lack of respect for Godzilla the film makers exhibit. We had no point of reference to . . . the twins, other alien monsters, no hero-Godzilla, no Japan influence -- no spirit. It was just an animal looking to lay it's eggs -- and that isn't a Godzilla film and that's why people were upset and stayed away. But who cares. It's a ride movie, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blown opportunity to make a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I really did not like anything much at all about ID4. Give me the War of the Worlds anyday. Having said that I still really very badly wanted to like G 1998. I expected his look to be quite different that was understood but what were these guys thinking? Wasn't the point of the whole thing to see an updated Godzilla do what he has always done best? With state of the art effects? Where were the city trashing scenes? The fierce battles with the army? The mythological angle? The force of nature? Why did we have to watch Gino (godzilla in mane only) make flirty eye contact with Ferris Bueller? Where was the dread? Why was the humor so lousy and script so mediocre? Why do I get the feeling that the filmmakers were embarrassed by the subject matter in the first place? If you are embarrassed by the subject then don't make a movie about it!I won't cover the plot as you can easily find that in other reviews, but why couldn't he catch the taxi after outrunning army helicopters? Why couldn't he immediately crush the cab in his mouth? Why did they have him chase 4 people instead of laying waste to NYC in a fit of rage? OK the site of a giant reptile running down Park ave is impressive but so what? Some of the quotes coming from the filmmakers have revealed some of the whys.Devlin: We want to make everyone forget the old GodzillaEmmerich: For some reason people kept watching these movies.They just didn't get it and thought they could reinvent the wheel.Shusuke Kaneko the director of the excellent 90's Gamera trilogy said:It is interesting that the Americans have trouble excepting a creature that can not be put down by their arms.Ken Satsuma (the man in the G suit for 7 movies said: It is not Godzilla, It doesn;t have his spirit.Arrogance? Stubborness? Who can say for sure. All I know is that these were the wrong guys to make a movie about a (at that time) 44 year old icon. Some people argue that it is not a good Godzilla movie but it is a good monster movie. I can't see it that way either! It is dull, has no wit or humor, and I really don't care much about what happens to Gino for most of the movie. There are a thousand points to make but for a very unbiased, rationale review read Stevee Ryfle's "Favorite Monstar." Available on Amazon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I thought the movie was pretty good. I'm a big action-movie fan and was looking forward to this from the moment I saw the teaser trailer involving the T- Rex skeleton (man, that was cool!). Let's start with the good parts of this movie: the special effects were superb. Godzilla and his/her children looked flawless, and I especially like the new look. If you look at the pictures of the iguanas (or komodo dragons, whichever they were), you can see a lot of similarities in design, skin patters, everything. For the first time, I can see see exactly how a creature like that would have evolved. Though a lot of people complained about the eggs being useless time-filler, I thought the idea was pretty good; after all, how long can an audience watch the army shoot at Godzilla before they officially get bored?Right here, I think I have to put a positive note on my favorite part of the movie: right after the attack on the eggs, when the supposedly "destroyed" Godzilla shows up and sees the dead babies... and then sees the humans responsible. You can hear the entire audience saying, "Oh man, now he's pissed."However, the actors were poorly picked, obviously chosen because no major actor would touch this role with a 10-foot pole. Matthew Broderick is a great actor (he's proves himself on stage and screen), but he just doesn't fit into the action-move leading man, coming off more as a wuss than anything else. Maria Pitillo is in the same situation; even though her character is supposed to be a "nice-girl stereotype", even when she is trying to show how tough she can be, we just can't help but laugh. Aww, the sweet little girl wants to be a bitchy reporter! Sorry, just doesn't work. Jean Russo, Kevin Dunn, and Hank Azaria are the best parts of the whole movie, though most of Azaria's lines were put in for comic relief than anything else (mostly good, but often excessive). Unfortunately, the second bad part is the realism of the whole movie (besides the giant lizard walking through downtown trying to catch a cab). Read any other review and it will give you countless reasons why nothing in this movie won't make sense. My main complaints include the stupidity of the army, the needless jab at Siskel and Ebert, and how I couldn't stop comparing the babies to the raptors of Jurrasic Park. Seriously, did someone cut and paste?Not bad, but not very good either. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILERS It is a good movie, but it is not a good Godzilla movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to go see this movie a couple of years ago for the first time I kind of knew what was going to happen. Obviously I was not going to see Godzilla fight some other monster in another climatic battle, or see missiles ricochet of his supposedly indestructible skin. I instead expected to see some cool looking godzilla-like creature try to survive in modern day Manhattan. And that is exactly what the movie showed. It is a good movie but it is not a good Godzilla movieTHE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERSNow that I got my little intro out of the way, on to reviewing Godzilla as "just some movie". The script was as good as it could get. Nobody who rents this movie to see it should be expecting a competitor to the brilliantly written Jurassic Park, it is a popcorn movie, the plot is about as complex as first grade math. The actors did well with what they were given to work with and none really have a bad moment in the film. It takes a bit to take off, but when it does, it is quite a ride. The special effects are also well done and nothing looks to cheesy.Now, on to reviewing Godzilla as a Godzilla movie. Why did they decide to kill the guy? The whole magic about Godzilla is that he is an indestructible force of nature, not some helpless animal that can get killed by a few missiles. Why did they decide to make a whole portion of the film dedicated to the Godzilla babies, putting Godzilla's sexuality in question? Obviously reptiles, especially Iguanas, are by no means asexual, as they state in the movie(In the beginning the film shows footage of Iguanas being affected by nuclear radiation). However, I did very much enjoy Godzilla's face lift and is by far my favorite design of all the Godzilla movies. It is a good movie, but it is not a good Godzilla movie. I enjoyed the film and I still do not understand why people say that it is a horrible movie in general. Yes they took a bit to many liberties in Godzilla tradition but, maybe it was necessary for the majority of today's audience. Would it have made the millions it made if today's modern audience (Not Godzilla fans, like myself)would see that an F 18s missiles would not even scrape the guys skin? All in all it is a fun movie and is one of my favorite movies to this date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a certified Godzilla fan. I must add, though, that I have been disappointed with the many "Godzilla" sequels that followed the original black and white classic (Am I the only one who wonders why the Japanese can invent a computer that fits on your thumbnail but can't seem to make a movie!!!). The original message was so pertinent to the day: think of Raymond Burr's opening remarks about this menace being so new and so horrible that it can destroy a city in no time and could leash-out at anytime at anyplace in the world; who could not identify Godzilla with the bomb? Anyway, this new version was exactly that: NEW! The special effects were superb (A big-screen video game of sorts), Godzilla sleek and gigantic, and the twists and turns (literally) of the plot were brilliant. I did find the acting, however, a bit wanting: in my opinion the movie was great in spite of Audrey's "performance" which was just a bit worse than Broderick's (Compared to the excellent job of New York Italian Lucy!). All in all, see it, enjoy it, and remember: Big is BETTER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the slow and painful torture as one writer put it. I think was every bit as interesting (and more) than any previous godzilla flick. These movies are made to not OVER analyze and just for entertainment. Broderick delivers a great performance. The fact that Godzilla hides in the underground in NYC is ingenious and thus allowing him to disappear at times. I wasn't so sure about the "pregnant" part as I guess I have always figured Godzilla to be a male (not a hermaphrodite). The scene in the end was a little sad as Godzilla being caught up in wires if left wide open for an aerial assault.</fullReview>

And for me, this is such a flick. If i want a good, original and coherent storyline i probably shouldn't be looking in the action movie corner anyway, and the ripoff/remake section isn't exactly keen on originality.

		<fullReview>Here is a film that is totally, 100% what it is and, while I'd like to congratulate Roland Emmerich, that isn't a good thing in this case.This is your only spoiler warning...Godzilla is a destructive creature that destroys symbols of capitalism and consumerism (e.g. Madison Square Garden).The film itself a destructive entity. Reno is himself again, he has never recovered from 'The Professional'. Broderick is obviously forced into this mess. Even if Emmerich could think up some inventive things to do, I'd have some higher praise, but he's stuck in a script obviously inspired by having watched 'Jurassic Park' several thousand times. Judging by its economic backlash, I'd say it too died painfully.On the offbeat side, we have the addition of the military contributing to the destruction of society (again with the Garden and Chrysler building). Nothing is meant to be serious and we get the torpedo joke from 'Red October' all over again.The moral is the old nuclear parable.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of what you might have heard, 1998's Godzilla is a pretty decent remake of the original.I had seen the movie in its' original release and remembered having a negative opinion, but couldn't remember the details. I recently found the DVD on the cheap and decided to give it a second chance.Watching the giant iguana Godzilla tear through rainy New York was a lot of fun. The CGI didn't bother me and Godzilla's new look wasn't bad. (Not as good as the Japanese one though!) I started to wonder why this movie didn't do better and if maybe I was too critical. Then about 90 minutes in, Dean and Roland lose track of the story (they are listed as contributors to the screen play, so I feel it's fair to blame them).The movie suddenly stops focusing on Godzilla and switches to Madison Square Garden where a bunch of mini-Zillas hatch and chase the cast around. This drags on for a half an hour. Hank Azaria's part in the movie suddenly becomes too big and you realize that Steven Spielberg has directed a MUCH better version of this same set-up in Jurassic Park. This movie starts to become waterlogged.Once the main characters escape and Godzilla starts running around again, the movie picks up, but at that point my fiance and I were already yawning.If you like the idea of big monsters stomping cities, I'd still recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always known about Godzilla and when I see the USA movie at the cinema, I was a huge fan of the movie. I loved Godzillas new reptillian looks and personality. I watch this movie alot and enjoy it everytime and when I watch the old movies I just cant help laughing at the fake looking Godzilla and background and the peoples mouths which isnt in rhythm with what they say but anyway thats just my opinion. I have always hoped there will be a sequel to this movie and being a fan of this movie has made me want my own pet iguana. If there ever will be a sequel to this movie I think it will be good if there was a giant military robot for Godzilla to fight and I hope in the new movie GODZILLA DOESN'T DIE! Many people say that Godzilla wasnt scary enough but Godzilla wasnt ment to be scary, he was placid, killing and destroying things accidentally untill the army started on him. And you cant compare this movie with Jurassic Park cause GODZILLA'S NOT A DINOSAUR! HES A MUTANT IGUANA LIZARD!</fullReview>

It's very clear to see that writters had a hard battle against common sense and brightness, and unhappily for the viewers, the writters did win that battle. Common sense is dead, long live to the common sense!The most dull and idiotic fact is that Moronzilla cared so much to hunt Broderick &amp; friends, and didn't care for all the military men that where stalking it. Yeah, Mr. Size-Does-Matter, it's very clear that your brain didn't match up to your size. Waste your time and energy hunting that bunch of losers instead of worrying about the army, cause of course Jean Reno &amp; Co. are the real menace to you. Those guys down there with those canyons are really no danger for ya....?ja!Let's not mention the fact that a monster that big did actually hide inside a building and no one could tell where ?Are we in blindness land?

His acting in Godzilla is wooden, his lines lame and delivered without conviction, his love interest in Maria Pitillo (she of the utter lack of talent) unbelievable, his so-called science laughable.

Hank Azaria, a tv man, who does the voice of Apu, Chief Wiggum, Karl, Kletus, Scientist Frink, and many other main characters, and Harry Shearer, has been in alot of movies and does Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Otto, Princaple Skinner, and alsodoes many other main characters, and has and also has a major, role. There's planty of laughs, and a wannabe Jurassic Park sequence with mini Godzillas.

		<fullReview>Like many thirty-somethings, I have vivid memories of staying up late on Friday nights for the regular 'creature-feature' on TV, so the remake was eagerly awaited. When seeing this in the cinema however, I longed for a remote to fast-forward through the atrocious human element and simply get to the creature scenes; they really are awe-inspiring, terrifying and everything the Japanese creators of Godzilla would have envisaged for the screen if only they had the technology at the time. Aside from this, let there be silence. Matthew Broderick looks embarrassed, Jean Reno has his tongue firmly planted in his stubbly cheek and the female lead deserves eternal obscurity. Broderick's line as an enormous pile of fish is dumped in the street as bait "That's a lot of fish.." sums up the level of wit in the screenplay. OK, I admit, it's not intended to be Shakespeare, however given the excellent recent rash of comic-book creations (X Men, Hulk) Godzilla misses (by a mile) the opportunity to have been so much better. Favourite scene - the wall of rock that opens slowly to reveal Godzilla's eye. Wagner fans might well be reminded of the dragon Fafner's fight with Siegfried. Worth seeing on the small screen, (with remote)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly bad for such a no-brainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're making a movie, nothing could be more ideal than use of one of the most popular characters in history and a major budget to back it up. You have to actually try to screw it up. That's even doubled with something like Godzilla. It's a fairly straightforward formula: all people want to see is a giant monster destroy things. Simple, right?Apparently not to the people who made this movie. I can forgive the many faults of this film: wacky French militants, Hank Azaria's terrible New York accent, really lame and obvious chroma keys on the effects, a complete idiot of a protagonist female character, totally inappropriate and retarded comic relief, scenes directly ripped off from Jurassic Park and not even done as well, and all kinds of really bad plot holes.Hey, it's a monster movie. All of those things are forgivable so long as I see what I want. That, of course, is lots of destruction.Alas, Godzilla falls short on this. Most of the film takes place in Manhattan, so there are all kinds of opportunities for great destruction of landmarks. Admitedly, nobody wants to see the World Trade Center blown up nowadays, but it should have been obvious to do this in 1998 when Godzilla was made. Couldn't they at least have taken out the Empire State building? Or the Statue of Liberty? Everybody loves to see New York get obliterated (especially those who have lived there). The problem is, most of the destruction in Godzilla is nondescript and could be anywhere. Few landmarks are destroyed. It's been proven how much people love to see recognizable landmarks blow up. Remember how much you cheered when you saw the White House in flames in Independence Day? Somehow it's just not as much fun when it's a generic looking building.Despite Godzilla's faults, it could have redeemed itself by simply following the proven formula of wreaking total havoc in the city. Instead, Godzilla leaves us with a Manhattan that is amazingly intact for a city that just had an enormous lizard run wild in its streets. Godzilla isn't terrible. It's just a very mediocre monster movie without enough destruction and cheese that isn't bad enough to be camp, but that's way too bad to be good. For that reason, there are way better action movies to invest your time in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One good thing about this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one good thing about this film for me was Jean Reno and his DSGE gang. He is Mr Cool, and cracks about american coffee and a great Elvis accent make this film for me. Not that the rest of the film is all bad, it's an OK romp with a beer or two at hand and I thought Matthew Broderick and Hank Azaria did a reasonable job, Maria Pitillo didn't make much impression and no-one else had much of a role - but then isn't the sort of film where acting is required. I suppose that makes Jean Reno a sort of bonus feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One exciting action scene in a movie that runs 139 minutes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2.5 out of 10This American update of Godzilla stars Matthew Brodderick as a scientist who's got to do battle with the big lizard. That's right, you have to accept Brodderick as both a scientist AND action hero. Where's Jeff Goldblum when you need him? That quibble aside, Godzilla is still a mostly very bad movie, lacking in exciting action and sporting the worst attempts at comic relief (the jokes here-which include quips at Siskel/Ebert, mispronouncing a guy's last name, a cowardly guy named Craven who can't stop sneezing-are even worse than those in Wild Wild West). Most annoying of all, it never stops raining, which got on my nerves after five minutes, so you can imagine what that's like for 100 minutes.There is, however, one moderately exciting action sequence, set in the ruins of Madison Square Garden, as the baby 'Zillas hatch and search for prey. Jean Reno's performance is also pretty good, which means he's obviously in the wrong movie. Avoid, and stick with the Jurassic Park movies for fast-paced big lizard fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a KID's movie, and as such it ain't half-bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, grown-ups took their children to the movies, even if those children were 10 or 15 years old. And once upon a time, movie-makers understood this, and so on top of lots of fun, simple and even simplistic entertainment for the kids, movie-makers always threw in jokes and gags for the grown-ups, so they wouldn't fall asleep in their seats. The old Muppets, both the T.V. show and the first movie, were masters at this. "Godzilla" disappoints people not because it was badly made, but because it was badly marketed. "Godzilla" is a kids' movie (barely) disguised as an action movie. For a Hollywood PG-13 movie in which scary things happen and things blow up, there's remarkably little profanity, and I don't recall a single F-word. Yes, the characters are simple. So is Kermit. Yes, the relationships are simple. So is Kermit's and Miss Piggy's. Yes, the CGI is pretty fake looking, but isn't it just about always? Yes, "Godzilla" is not "The Matrix" or "Alien" (though clearly the monster design and a couple other points owe a lot to "Alien"). But it's full of lots of great little bits that grown-ups should get and be able to appreciate, from the bickering in the taxi to the French guys to the Mayor and his aide to casting three "Simpsons" actors (voices), especially Harry Shearer who does his "Simpsons" newscaster voice while playing the evil-jerk TV reporter character in the movie."Godzilla" is a juvenile movie, which is in and of itself grounds for disapproval only if the movie is trying to be adult. Which it isn't. The marketing campaign, with its "Size Does Matter" poster and its attempts to piggyback the same director's commercial success with "Independence Day," is what's to blame for grown-up disappointment.(And "Independence Day" IS a movie which is bad because, along with many other reasons, it's trying to be adult but it is hopelessly immature and juvenile, maybe even infantile)"Godzilla" is "good bad," not "bad bad." Sophomoric plot, reliance on spectacle (see Aristotle), cardboard characters with one-dimensional relationships going through one-dimensional trials and tribulations -- when you're making a movie for kids, those things are just fine. And if you throw in inside jokes and humor for the animals the kiddies might have dragged along to the cinema? Bonus. If I had tykes old enough for PG-13, I'd be happy to watch this with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hype killed this monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla looked so promising in the trailers and previews that I saw in early '98. Everything just looked so nice, the special effects were great, it had so much potential. Then the hype began, almost a year before this movie began, the studios began to put the hype machine in motion. Pushing advertising to new levels never seen before, multi-million dollar deals were signed up with big corporations like Taco Bell and the merchandising was pumped to ridiculous Star Wars-level proportions. What Columbia Pictures failed to realize was that this was like opening Pandora's Box, they didn't know what they were dealing with and and consequences. It all came crashing down on them.I'll start off with the things I did like about Godzilla. I'm really glad they used the classic trademark "Godzilla" roar, without changing it too much. The opening attack on New York was easily the closest they ever got to the true original Godzilla theme. I also like the green text they used to show the location of the current scene, reminded me of the Alien movies. The box art for the video was also nicely done, maybe it's because I'm just a sucker for shiny holographic things.OK, now the bad thingsI honestly don't know why Emmerich thought that Matthew Broderick would be a good main actor for this film, now I'm not saying that Broderick is a bad actor or anything, but he just isn't that strong of an actor to hold this movie together. The supporting cast is even worse, I'm guessing that Emmerich &amp; Devlin held a raffle at a "low-key actors that noone really cares about" convention, because that's the only excuse I can think of for hiring a no-name actress and a Simpsons voice actor (I love the Simpsons by the way). This movie is just too slow, I expected to see Godzilla smash buildings, stomp innocent people and torch the military with his flame breath, like the original 1954 Godzilla did. In here he just walked around buildings, ran away from the military and any damage he did to life or property was an accident. At one point, Mayor Ebert says to the military "You guys did more damage than that damn monster did!", he speaks the truth, the military just blindly opened fire on Godzilla, always missing him and destroying private property without care (how can you miss a target that big?).The pointless scenes dragged the movie down even furthur, suppling this movie with an endless supply of plot holes; how can Godzilla fit in a subway tunnel if he towers over high-rise buildings? If he can catch up to an Apache helicopter, then why not a New York taxicab? Why do the military think he is "hiding in a building", is that even physically possible? The scene that featured the baby Gozillas has got to be the most blatant ripoff of the veliciraptors from Jurassic Park I've ever seen, you guys have GODZILLA for cryin' out loud, why do you need to rip off another successful movie?This could have been a fun summer movie, filled with flaws, but you could still watch it, have fun, then forget it. The hype that the studio only highlighted and enlarged the flaws that the movie had, making it a doomed failure. This should remain as a symbol to studios; if you create a bad movie, and expect to shove it down our throats to get our cash, we will resist and destroy the movie. OK, so I was a little aggressive in that last sentence, but you get the point.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem was casting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin create films such as Stargate and Independence day, and then somewhat fail with Godzilla. Watching it the third time last night I tried to analyze what I felt was wrong with the film. Everything is done to perfection when it comes to the technology behind making films. Godzilla looks great and all surroundings are professionally done (excluding the scene where three helicopters follow Godzilla between skyscrapers, which was too much like a computer game, with fake looking buildings). The story is not that badly written either. It is somewhat believable in the sense that the army is quick to respond, and work systematically to eliminate the problem. And the dialogs and character building is pretty good as well. So where is it that this film fails, because no one that I've spoken to has much good to say about Godzilla? I think it is the actors. If you think about Independence day we have Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum which carry the film through, complimenting all the CGI work and professionalism that went into that film. Same with Stargate where we have heavy weights like Kurt Russell and James Spader really making the film what it was. In Godzilla we lack that, as Matthew Broderick, while undoubtedly being a good actor, just isn't that larger-then-live character which was required for this sort of a film. He seems to kind a flounder from one scene to the next, never pulling of being the hero of the day. Same with Maria Pitillo, while being both beautiful and good actress, she seemed just as lost as Matthew in this part. And this can be seen when we have Jean Reno on the screen; the film pulls itself up and becomes interesting. He has that magic and is both believable and interesting. I also liked Hank Azaria, as the camera man trying to film the great story, while being more afraid of his wife then Godzilla. Godzilla is one of the best examples of how important casting is. Because without a doubt Godzilla had everything else working in its advance, while just lacking the thrust which powerful lead actors can give a film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont really know what people were expecting going into this film. I mean the film is called "Godzilla". The jaded and privileged humans that we are ran ourselves into the theatre and shelled out seven bucks to see a cgi lizard tear up New York. We didn't pay to see anything more. Did you expect good writing, great score and cinematography? Yes the writing and sentimental moments were pure garbage and yes it does rip off "Jurassic Park", yes Godzilla looks stupid and unconvincing but that was always the appeal of the Godzilla movies. I mean take any of the previous Godzilla movies they're all lame but enjoyable to an extent. This one was just a little more lame and a little less enjoyable. Hey Jean Reno wasn't bad now was he? 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers for MAJOR GODZILLA FANSAs a huge fan of Godzilla films I had huge hopes when this movie came out in the theatre that this was going to be one of the best movies ever. Boy was I disappointed. Don`t get ME wrong here,I loved the way Godzilla looked and infact I don`t think he could have looked better,his spines and and face was so awesome! But what I didn`t like about this film was how they used Godzilla. They made him out like an invader and shooting him for no reason and he turns about to be pregnant and not immortal like the the other Godzilla films. He looked to ME like a super hero and then turned on. The people who made this I think should have let someone else do it or not have done it at all. I was so sad when it ended and I couldn`t stop crying. I`M sorry but I just don`t like this movie like the TOHO movies.The bottom line is this: Great looking Godzilla,fantastic effects,but everything was just not used right. I hope you fellow Godzilla lovers have not seen this please don`t because it`ll bring tears to your eyes with so much disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopefully they'll try Ishiro Honda's approach if there's a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We can't feel awed or excited by an on-screen threat that costs the characters nothing and doesn't require some form of emotional responsive action. The second a giant monster usually hits Tokyo, air raid sirens begin sounding and thousands of people scream &amp; scramble toward the subway.When this Godzilla first steps into NY harbor the entire city population acts like they're sleepwalking. New Yorkers are supposedly the most profane, argumentative, aggressive screamers and yellers in the world but this movie cleans them up so much Godzilla might as well be attacking a Nazarene ladies convention. Upon first viewing Emmerich's attack scenes I immediately asked my audience companion, `Where's the air raid sirens? Why aren't the air raid sirens going off?' The film lacks any sense of brutal imaginative chaos like you get in the 80's films of Terry Gilliam i.e. BRAZIL. Godzilla doesn't care about real estate--he should knock over lines of skyscrapers in huge clouds of dust like they were made of cardboard and make someone else clean it up. People shouldn't be hiding in houses above ground having parties--they should be vomiting from contaminated water supplies, racing away from the city en masse, or shivering underground so they won't be crushed (the filmmakers oddly keep shying away from even implying how dangerous Godzilla's mere physical existence is) or, worse, eaten (the original 1956 Godzilla was a carnivore). What has charmed generations of audiences to Ishiro Honda's Godzilla &amp; kaiju eiga films is that humanity succeeds against such an outlandish, multi-threat creature. It is fine and well for the charming, intrepid scientists &amp; investigators of Emmerich's version to `figure out' Godzilla using insurance reports, home pregnancy test kits, and fish bait. But the people in a Godzilla film must ultimately outwit and outmatch him--they must never spend so much of the film's running time figuring him out that they trail behind him.</fullReview>

But it's the movie itself that stunk!! I think people were expecting Godzilla to destroy New York. Crush the Statue of Liberty, rip down powerlines, crush subway's, nuke buildings, and wipe out the military. In other words an exciting film. But NOOO..We get to see a giant chicken lizard who spends more time hiding, running away, and eating fish then doing any real damage.(He hardly uses his patented fire!!) Then in the second half of the movie we're treated to a swarm of raptor ripoffs (the babyzilla's) chasing Matthew Broderick and friends through MSG!Throw in horrible acting and you have yourself a joke of a movie. Any wonder that Devlin and Emmerich split up after this fiasco?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange combinations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination mentioned above includes excellent CGI and cheesy acting. Also known as "Godzilla". When I first saw this movie in theaters I didn't really understand some of it and I was kind of uninterested in movies at the time, so I could have cared less in thinking about the movie. But I recently watched the movie again and realized just what happened. The special effects of this movie are astounding. Godzilla fits in perfectly with his surroundings and interacts with the buildings and helicopters really well. What threw this movie into a terminal velocity speed fall was the horrible acting. Maria Pitillo can't even cry correctly--she sounded like a dog being beaten instead of a distressed woman (I don't mean to sound insulting). Doug Savant's character, Sergeant O'Neal, was nervous no matter the situation. He never once spoke clearly, and acted like a frightened schoolboy rather than an enlisted man. Hank Azaria tended to sound childish in some of his remarks. Arabella Field overstressed the New York accent and sounded more like a cross between Olive Oil and Madonna. There are some exceptions to the horrible acting. Matthew Broderick fit the part of Nick Tatopoulos perfectly and did an excellent job, as always. Jean Reno played well as Philippe Roache, and seldom a moronic word came from Vicki Lewis' mouth. You can tell most of the actors are just that--actors, nothing more. It was as if half the military personnel had no idea what they were doing or how things worked or how military personnel were supposed to act. All in all, this movie isn't a complete waste of time, thanks to the great action and CGI effects involved. It was a really well put together movie if the corny actors are discarded from further thought. And it's much better than seeing a psychotic man in a cheap monster suit thrashing at little model buildings. This American version is worth more than, say, Godzilla 2000. The creators of the movie took an overseas idea and made it so much better, but somehow forgot to take out the dense acting. Let's hope that the casting will be a little more thought out if there are any more Godzilla movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not too sure why people don't like this movie. Its a remake of an old classic with a lot better effects. The original Godzilla could no where near match this film. Even Godzilla 2000 couldn't. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich have this great flare for movie making that is unmatched anywhere. Everyone of their movies has been successful. They were just outshadowed by the other big names that made it and the ones that bombed at the time.Matthew Broderick is not one of my favorite actors, but he is very talented, and I have to say his performance left something to be desired. A better choice for that role is someone who can generate emotion a little better and not lag when trying to be sarcastic. Hank Azaria is one of the better players in this movie. He is very funny, smarmy, and an interesting character to watch. Those of you who've noticed that Hank, as well as Harry Shearer, are voices for The Simpsons, may be interested to know: The woman with the bandage on her hand in the news building is Nancy Cartright - Bart Simpson.So overall, the effects were quality CG, the acting balanced out, and the story took a nice new spin on the typical monster-goes-on-a-rampage movie. A good pick for get-togethers or sleepovers.</fullReview>

I think that it's a great action movie, and right in line with the classic Godzilla movies of old. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should the viewer.

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie for one reason: Jean Reno. And I was expecting that he would be the only redeeming feature of it. Well, he was, but the special effects were great, too. I was more entertained that I thought I would be because I'd heard about how much of a steaming pile of Godzilla poopie this movie was. Sure, it was mindless entertainment where you need to check your brain at the door. But so are the old Japanese guy-in-a-rubber-suit Godzilla movies where you not only have to suffer through prolonged battles of ridiculous monsters stomping on models, but you also have to suffer through mind-bendingly bad dubbed dialogue. I can only watch Godzilla movies when accompanied by MST3K's Joel and the 'bots. On my own, I become a blubbering mass of jelly.This movie was easier to get through and I didn't really feel like it was long. I certainly enjoyed it better than Independence Day, what with all that rah-rah patriotism which has become part of our lives since Sept. 11th and which has worn extremely thin. This story was expensive, yes, but it did deliver on the thrills, and having Madison Square Garden filled with little Godzillas was pretty neat. Kind of an Alien/Jurassic Park type of thing combined.The acting did leave much to be desired, mainly Maria Pitello who has a perpetual "Man, I'm so bummed!" expression on her face. She was awful, and Matthew Broderick isn't exactly the studly action hero. But in today's action movies, bio-scientists aren't normally the heroes anyway. And it was kind of a nice change to not have Chunk Studmeat blasting his way across the screen. Hank Azaria was good, too, for what we saw of him. And I thought the Godzilla creature FX rocked. And so did Jean Reno. :P7/10</fullReview>

And once again we're forced to endure another moronic ending (a la Friday the 13th) that suggests a sequel.

I found Phillipe, the mayor and Animal were quite funny. Devlin did a pretty good job with the humor and the supporting characters. The action and humor were a huge improvement from the boring Independence Day. But he didn't develop the main characters, Nick and Audrey very well, and that brought down the movie. They were very wimpy. Most of the dialogue involving the love story was cheesy. Nick and Audrey have their moments (when he sings Singing In the Rain is hilarious, how she talks about why Caiman is dirt was written inteligently) but are the overall terrible products of shoddy character development. Main characters are the big guys of the stories they're in. So they carry the stories. And when they're not developed well, the story doesn't hold up. Nick and Audrey brought the movie to a catastrophic crash (and a big, huge, loud thud). Godzilla has a lot of cliches but it wouldn't have mattered if the characterization was done right.</fullReview>

Not only that, but the baby Godzillas look more fake without the rain and darkness that masks Godzilla throughout the film. **END-O-SPOILERS-O!*** Despite it's bad reception, it deserves a sequel, as the only thing I felt was missing was a titanic battle between Godzilla and a powerful three headed dragon from space....or something.

		<shortDescription>If you have a brain....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...you will realise Godzilla is a very good film. The skin of the film may look weak and it may not have lived up to the expectations to those who saw trailers but within the bones and beneath the outer layer of the film there is a skeleton of brilliance. The trouble is people do not go see $80 million films for this reason, which is why it suffered. Godzilla has all the components that an action movie needs. An almost indestructable monster, lots of explosions, guns and chase sequences. whilst at first it looks as if these set pieces are moulded together haphazardly on a second look you will realise that they are constructed more intelligently than you originally thought. I myself, when seeing Godzilla at the cinema was not overly impressed but on second viewing you spot the things you originally missed out on. The dialogue gives clues and if you look at the faces of the lead actors it is acted fabulously. There is a hidden story behind the obvious evil monster destroying America plot. I won't spoil it by giving it away but remember Godzilla was always intended to be the first of a trilogy. Just as in Star Wars the relationship between the main characters made more sense after seeing Return of the Jedi a sequel to Godzilla would enhance the deeper meaning. Gozilla may be a multi-million dollar blockbuster but it works much better on the small screen. Watch it again and pay more attention to the non-popcorn-fodder parts and you will see a whole different movie. The sooner a sequel is made the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, you people keep comparing Godzilla to Jurassic Park. Why? If anyone were to ask me I would say that Jurassic Park had a horrible plot line. Dinosaurs get loose and kill people who are too stupid to stay out of the way of the creatures. Stay alive for one night, is that too hard??? Don't even get me started on JP2. Come on. Godzilla was a great movie. For all you people who call Godzilla drivel you don't see a movie for what it is worth. I thought that the actors did a rather well job of portraying REAL people, not some supped up stud or blonde bombshell that can miraculously save the world with super-human powers. Ok, so 200+ raptors was a bit much, could have come down a little to maybe 50. someone brought up the point of why the American military stood by not doing much while the French military was in the middle of the fray. Gee there's a shocker. Did you see how poorly the US military was portrayed? They looked like sniveling babies who couldn't do anything without a strong chain of command. Guess what, your boss at work probably looks the same way. I think people should watch the movie and not try to compare it to the waste of time Japanese `man in a rubber suite stomping on a miniature town.' I think the computer animation was rather well done. As for you 'critics' who can apparently do a much better job at making this movie, I say lets see what you have done for the entertainment industry. Oh wait, you wouldn't be able to make a better movie if you tried. Quit complaining, it's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Cheesy Schlock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading user padawan1224 and his comments on the film, I was compelled to write. For him to say that the original Godzilla being a better movie than the American schlock is drivel shows how out of touch with film he or anyone else who thinks this way really are. THIS film in all aspects is drivel. The characterization is missing in action, much of the logic is absurd (how does a creature that size hide out in the subway with nobody noticing?) Say what you will about the so-called ignorant stance of the cheesiness of a man in a rubber suit, the fact of the matter is the Japanese portrayal of Godzilla is MUCH more realistic than this American crap, as real lizards move the way the Japanese portrayed Godzilla. The japanese original featured excellent characterization and a more coherent and somber plot. Anyone is enttield to their opinion, but facts are facts, and anyone who says the Amercian Godzilla film is better than the Japanese film is certainly not educated on what good film-making is. If you can rent the origianl Godzilla, subtitled (so as to avoid the lip-synching that Americans are scared to be without) rent it and see just how much better it is story-wise than any other American giant monster film since the 50's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, I'm a film student and have actually seen this movie and own it on VHS. It's not really as bad as everyone says. Sure it's stupid and really all about the special effects, but that's what makes it enjoyable to a certain level. I agree that the plot was absolutely and it could have worked out really nicely if they had better actors. Personally, I can't imagine what led the filmmakers to cast Matthew Broderick in this movie. Also, they say that the original Godzilla was much better than this movie. That's the most ridiculous drivel I've ever heard. At least the plot in this movie was more believable and made more sense, giving Godzilla that more down-to-earth feel. I don't understand how some cheesy guy in a rubber suit and a bunch of off-synch Japanese people screaming "Godzilla!!!" can be much better. But for what it is, it's not exactly torture to watch. Just shut off your brain and sit back for a big budget Hollywood roller coaster ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fun and quite exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appear to be one of the few, besides my wife, who like this film very much. Although it doesn't have the cute story that Jurassic Park did, its effects are on par and the story takes very little time to get cooking. It is a long film and at times in the middle parts of the film it drags just a little bit due to plot development. However, as is the norm with pictures like this, there isn't a whole lot of plot. It is meant to be an exciting picture and that it does well. I can think of two other pictures (Independence Day and Twister) that received better reviews but had plots no better, and I have to say, in my opinion, worse.It also seems that with pictures like this, to really enjoy them, you need to see them in the theater of have a large screen television with most important: a great sound system. I have both and with a film like Godzilla the house really rocks and rolls.It seems to me that one critic put the film down and then all the rest followed suit. I have my doubts if they actually saw the picture. I bought the film first for a reduced price on VHS. I liked it enough to purchase it a short time later on DVD. I seldom do this. If you can accept the idea that Godzilla came to New York City to have her children, you are half way there. Also, when you watch the film notice that she really isn't mean spirited until the end of the film. The picture starts fast as the story is really about Godzilla, and it is no time at all until you are in New York City with all hell breaking loose. The plot sorta develops around what Godzilla does. No, this picture would never be nominated for an Oscar. But, how many of those pictures have you seen that you could hardly get through. It took me three times to get through "Chariots of Fire." I kept falling off to sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brave attempt to bring Godzilla to the big screen. Godzilla was always going to be an ambitious task for any director to work on, and it could have been worse.Dean Deviln and Roland Emmerich both love working with miniatures and the proof is evident in Godzilla. I did not like the effects that much as all you saw was mainly Godzilla's feet crushing stuff. The CGI was too obvious even in the dark(which most of this film is filmed in), and so too were the miniatures.After seeing Jurrasic park 1 and 2 Godzilla isn't that impressive, and the scene when the little dinosaurs came out of their eggs reminded me of the raptors in Jurrasic Park. Another problem is that parts in the film are so dumb like how they lost track of Godzilla in New York city. I mean this guy is supposed to be as big as a skyscraper. That brings me onto another point which is Godzilla's scale keeps changing. His size is varied throughout the film. Godzilla ends up being a bit of a mess, but it was a well marketed mess.Godzilla is the only movie in which the music videos for it are more spectacular than the film itself (namely Jammirquai's and Puff daddy)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy to classify movies to genres, this one, I suggest it to be a disaster movie. For a horror, usually the monster is only at the most the size of a dinosaur. This one, with the size of maybe the Statue of Liberty, is too large to be a monster, better say it's a disaster.You know Hollywood movies always raise new suspense again and again. So in this movie, it first make many baby godzillas, and for the baby godzillas, it's maybe only a horror singly, but there are so many, in total they are still a disaster. Finally they are destroyed by the air force. Then it makes the seemingly dead old godzilla alive again. Surely there is a continuous fight for this.It is said that the godzilla was mutated by radiation, so that's the point, people should always be careful that their new inventions can harm themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fairly average as monster films go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(warning: parts of this review *may* be interpreted as spoilers)This was an okay film - worth seeing once, I think. As monster films go, this was fairly average.The effects were good and well done. The acting was also quite good. The arguably main character, the monster, was amusingly maternal, and I found the scene depicting the hundreds of baby godzillas quite surreal.The part of this film I found particularly annoying was the rain. In Godzilla it rains 24-7 and it is constantly dingy and dark. You may say it adds to the atmosphere, but I found it a bit excessive. Also, there is one part where a guy comes face to face with the monster and just smiles nervously and waves to his mates, which I thought was annoyingly unrealistic. Of course, the whole film is unrealistic, but unrealistic in an acceptable kind of way.The last comment I want to make about this film is - I came out of the cinema feeling incredibly sorry for the monster. I really did. It wasn't an evil monster - all it did was try to feed its babies - and humans being humans, went and treated it as if it was a manifestation of Satan or something.I wouldn't advise you not to see it. What I will say is: should the chance come up, see it. But don't go too far out of your way to see it.Overall, it is a fairly unimaginative, fairly forgettable film, but with good effects. As I rate Godzilla as no more or less than an average film, I give it a neutral mark of 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good FX, but the characters are annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Godzilla on cable, and I think I have a few ideas as to why it bombed in the theaters.1) Why is it that whenever a character stands face to face with Godzilla, his reaction is invariably to keep standing there and stare at it as it approaches? A cameraman runs out into the street soon after Godzilla shows up in New York and STANDS THERE as Godzilla's foot crushes a taxi cab parked right in front of him. The strangely unmasculine hero of the picture with the Greek last name nobody can pronounce, along with the Frenchmen, just STAND THERE in the bowels of Madison Square Garden as Godzilla's eggs start hatching all around them. Having characters standing there in the middle of imminent danger does not build suspense; it makes the characters look stupid.2) The hero of this picture is - well, somewhat less of a hero than we usually expect to find in an action picture. Let's face it, Matthew Broderick is not an action star. He actually looks a little ungainly in the shots showing him running from the Godzilla hatchlings. Imagine Bruce Willis in the role and you'll have an idea of what kind of excitement is missing here. Nevertheless, the movie has Broderick spending the final third of the film running around. And unfortunately, he isn't running around trying to be proactive, setting up traps and thinking on his feet (if he were, that all by itself would have made this movie much more enjoyable). No, instead he spends lots of screen time being chased and calling on the military for help. You might ask, "This guy is Mr. Everyman. What else could this guy do?" -- to which I would reply, "Why have as the hero of what is supposed to be a high- octane action picture a guy who can't do very much about the problem that the movie presents, other than calling in the military?"3) Various inconsistencies. Other posters have listed a few of them, but the one that really annoyed me was the difference between the initial dogfight with Godzilla and the scenes in which our "heroes" are fleeing Godzilla in a taxi cab. How is it that Apache helicopters have a hard time keeping up with Godzilla, but the taxi cab (surely a much slower vehicle) manages for long minutes at a time always to stay inches ahead of Godzilla? Has Godzilla gotten tired by that point in the movie? After the helicopter-attack sequence, the fleeing-taxi-cab sequence feels like a cheat to keep the suspense going. So my answer to the people here who genuinely liked this movie and keep pointing out that the movie is supposed to be a roller-coaster ride, not "Shakespeare in Love," is that the movie doesn't quite work even as a roller-coaster ride -- for reasons that include those I've just listed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fares better when viewed on TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just sat through Godzilla '98 at home in widescreen format. I had seen with my family when it opened, and frankly we were very disappointed. My feelings then were: the film was murky, anytime the creature made an appearance it was dark, or raining, or very grey. There was never a ray of sunshine. I felt this is what may have turned people off about it. In the theater it was very hard to follow because of the lack of color. I was also distracted by the sound, it did not enhance the movie for us one bit. My wife and kids felt pretty much the same way. But now nearly 2 years later, I picked up a widescreen videotape, and to my surprise, it was much easier to sit through on a smaller scale. I was able to control the sound so that distraction was easily remedied. The film itself seems so much more entertaining as TV fare, then it did on the big screen. What little color there was to the film seemed to stand out better on the TV, probably because everything was condensed. Although this updating of a classic is not one for the books, it does seem to stand up when viewed on a smaller scale. I think people who saw it in 98 should find a tape and view it again, but, remember to put aside your thoughts about the old Godzilla,and enjoy for what it is-a 2 hour time waster. One more thing, try to get a widescreen version, it does help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many parts, Godzilla is nothing else but a cheap rip-off from Jurassic Park. The characters, the monster, even the sound effects all cause nothing but Deja Vue. Matthew Broderick saves the world again - it's been a long time since Wargames - and the US military causes more damage than the monster itself. Nothing new. Nothing special. Watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here is a hint about How to don't waste your money?DON'T SEE THIS CHEESE PIE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, Godzilla is a cheese pie the director throws in our faces...The special effects were not that good(and even before seeing the movie, I knew it would be the only interest in this one)and the girl who plays Matthew Broderick's wife is even worse than Rose McGowan and all the stupid ''actresses'' in Jawbreaker. She didn't have a lot of things to say and she got nominated for the worst actress at the Rizzies' fest. And what about Matthew Broderick? He played in ''MASTERPIECES''like Inspector Gadget and Godzilla...what an annoying career! I am kidding when I am saying he had a good career. Jean Reno deceived me a lot, even when I think about the fact that he had not a big role. But when I think about the fact that the biggest role in this film was the dinosaur made by computer, I tell myself; let's skip this one in Jean Reno's career. He was excellent in The Professional and in other movies...The film is completely ridiculous, and doesn't follow the steps of the old Japanese series, in which he was fighting other monsters to save the city. In this thing, he is the big enemy...and the last twenty minutes were supposed to be the most suspenseful part of the movie...nobody saw it, because everyone was asleep after the FIRST twenty minutes. Even The Lost World was better than this all the way(and The Lost World was a BIG FAT HUGE disapointment)! I just want to imagine what directors as good as Martin Scorcese, Stanley Kubrick(he was alive when Godzilla released)could have done with a near budget...this was a nightmare from the awful beginning to the awful ending...I don't think any other mistakes like this one should be done in the future...well....I hope so! I give it 39%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a single word.....Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After tons of publicity including green painted walls and buses and a fairly descent trailer, Godzilla could not match the hype. The relatively weak story, limited comic relief, and flat out lack of suspense killed the otherwise superior special effects work. OK, we know that Matthew Broderick was in it, so we knew it wasn't going to be "Places in the Heart" but we were expecting some thrills. The single biggest problem was the over exposure of Godzilla to early. For example in "Jurassic Park" sure, you saw dinosaurs right away, but not the raptors or the T-Rex, they were given a frightful build up that slowly made your heart race with anticipation. Once you had seen a full screen shot of Godzilla it was like the cat was out of the bag. As you watch you know what is going to happen at every turn, nothing was unexpected. It was worth the price of the video rental, but at the box office you got ripped off. I felt like I was. The end threatens a sequel, so be weary and wait for the video. If Hollywood is smart they will market it direct to video. I don't think we will see any more huge objects painted green.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The preview was better than this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember sitting in the movie theaters when I first saw the preview in which a giant monster green foot crushed a T. Rex skeleton in a museum. It was a good preview, and I thought the movie would be just as good. I was wrong, the preview was better than the movie itself. The movie was boring, plotless, unfunny and annoying.The acting is not very good. Aside from Inspector Gadget, I think this is the worst that Matthew Broderick has ever done. The plot was almost nonexistant, much like the original Godzilla movies. The monster Godzilla and its babies were ok, but nothing too spectacular. I was hoping a few of the main cast would be eaten or fried or something, which didn't really happen.Most of the jokes really didn't work, the story was boring, the characters were flat and annoying and the movie itself, although it had a few fair moments, was very dull. Your kids may enjoy it, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun flick in the tradition of Jurassic Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not nearly as bad as a lot of the reviews below would have you believe. Worst movie ever made? Hardly. Worse than the old Japanese versions? Not in my opinion. I found it only slightly less entertaining than "The Lost World- Jurassic Park", but for the most part it has the same chills as that movie and there's a couple of scenes that would be too intense for children under 12. I thought the special effects were pretty good- not great, though. As far as Matthew Broderick's acting, I think he did as much as he could with the script he had to work with, or maybe comedy is more his style (i.e. "Ferris Bueller"). But, here again, I didn't feel his lack of charisma in this role was enough to detract from the film. One other point about this flick I haven't seen mentioned was that Jean Reno's performance was quite good. So, I would recommend this film to rent without hesitation if you're a fan of the Jurassic Park films. It's really not a bad film, although not exactly a classic. I can imagine seeing it on the big screen would do it a lot more justice.</fullReview>

At first, they are trying to imitate "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" at the beginning, I'm talking about the lone survivor who yells "Gojira! Gojira!". And when the monster gets to N.Y.C., the movie gets simply boring. Come on, this sh*t ain't fun to watch! The only good part is when those tiny little Godzillas run at the Madison Square Garden chasin' the "heroes". Too bad they didn't catch 'em. Although this scene is a straight loan from Jurassic Park and its Velociraptor attack. And the end, oh boy, now it gets nasty. FIRST, they manage to sneak out of a skyscraper-tall monster's MOUTH and THEN kill it with few simple rockets? When Godzilla finally dies, I wouldn't have wondered if it would have moved its mouth and said "why can't we just be friends" or something like that.

It's even got the anti-violence science geek that Jeff Goldblum played in ID4, played here by Mathhew Broderick.

		<shortDescription>Cool Giant Monster Movie, But Godzilla? I Think Not....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In true Hollywood tradition, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin decided to take a pre-existing concept and do it bigger and hopefully -- better. Well, this movie is certainly bigger than any of the Japanese Godzilla movies in terms of budget and special effects. But is it better? Well, it all depends on your point of view, I suppose....The good news is that this is a really fun and entertaining movie. Even knowing most of the plot ahead of time, it kept me on the edge of my seat. It was fast-paced, witty, exhilarating, and just plain fun! The special effects were awesome, and the CGI scenes were integrated well enough with the live footage so that it was easy to suspend disbelief and accept the thought of a gigantic monster rampaging in New York City. No, none of the actors are going to win Oscars for their performances, and the script probably won't be considered one of the classics of Western literature, but who really cares? This is a giant monster movie, and this movie certainly delivers a fantastic giant monster! Everything else is incidental. I mean, the more time they spend on character development, the less time they can spend showing the monster destroying New York, right? So, as giant monster movies go, this one is definitely a four star movie. Well, at least three and a half....But is it truly a Godzilla movie, or is it simply a great monster movie?Basically, this movie is a retelling of the original Godzilla movie, starting anew as if none of the previous Godzilla movies has ever taken place. This allows the film makers to play fast and loose with the character, without having to worry about monkeying around with the existing Godzilla continuity. Toho did something similar to this in 1984 when they "deleted" all the previous movies except for the first one. This is definitely an American movie, though -- Godzilla attacks New York, not Tokyo, and there is no connection to the atom bombing of Japan which served as the moral compass of the first movie. The important question, then, is whether this is really a "Godzilla" movie in anything other than name only.Well, it is about a gigantic mutated reptile that attacks a major metropolitan area. And he does have these really funky spines running down his back. And, unlike movies like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and The Giant Gila Monster, this new monster does walk on two legs just like the traditional Godzilla. And this new monster does have a breath weapon of sorts, although instead of the traditional atomic plamsa breath we get a strong wind and a major case of halitosis. So, if Godzilla is simply a giant reptile that was created by radiation, has spines on his back, walks on two legs, breathes something destructive from his mouth and destroys cities, then yes, this probably is a Godzilla movie, in spite of the fact that this Godzilla also burrows underground and lays eggs.Is this all Godzilla is, though? Personally, I think not. Although this movie preserves the basic concept of a giant monster attacking a city, that basic concept has been used in countless other movies. The original Godzilla was portrayed as an unstoppable force of nature, whereas this monster is simply a giant animal trying to get along in the world. The original Godzilla was an allegory for the horrors of nuclear war visited upon Japan, whereas this monster doesn't seem to be much of an allegory of anything. And, most important of all in my opinion, the original Godzilla had a powerful weapon that made him truly terrifying, his fearsome atomic plasma breath. That's what made him uniquely different from every other monster, and it was a clear, visual representation of his atomic-spawned origin. Monster, on the other hand, is able to blow hard enough to knock cars over, but it's just not the same. The film does pay homage to the traditional breath weapon by having vehicles ignite in mid-air, making it look briefly as if Godzilla is breathing fire, but that's as close as they come. Apparently, a fire-breathing 200-foot tall radioactive iguana would just be too hard to believe.... Unfortunately, Godzilla without his flame breath is like Batman without his batmobile, batcave and batarangs. Or perhaps a better analogy would be Superman without his ability to fly. Flying may not be "realistic", but it is an essential part of the character....So, what's the final verdict? It's a fun movie. Go see it. Enjoy it. See it again. Check your higher reasoning functions at the door and just think about how lucky you are to have finally seen a giant monster movie done with such great special effects.And then, when you're done, go pop Godzilla: King of the Monsters into the old VCR and remind yourself what Godzilla is really all about....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, Godzilla is great.Well, the acting sucked, but hey, all we want from a monster movie is A MONSTER! Not a dinosaur people, I can't spread that enough! Godzilla is a mutated lizzard, definitely NOT a T-Rex, and the movie is everything but Jurassic Park. There is no resemblance at all. Try to understand that, please. People who are/were interested in this movie probably know a little about Godzilla history like me. People who don't should get themselves informed before they tell everyone it was a ripp-off (which it wasn't!!!).Second, the monster in Ronald Emmerich's Godzilla is unique.It really is a totally new animal, with its own habits and behavioures. In the old monster movies Godzilla just destroyed buildings and fought monsters (that's cool, but...) In the new movie, Godzilla has no intention of destroying the city. He is just an animal. He reacts like any animal would react. A great improvement, really!!!Third, the effects are NOT bad.In fact they're quite fascinating. "It isn't realistic", I hear people scream. Well, DUH!!! There is no such thing as a 300ft lizzard, of course it isn't realistic! But that's not the point. The point is you really get the feeling of Godzilla being there...I love this movie. No 10 because of the acting and some other (minor) mistakes, but a fine eight!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what everybody expected from this movie. I guess a whole lot. Most people probably don't know that most Godzilla movies have a plot of one sentence, mostly: Godzilla versus [insert your own monster here], while destroying stuff. For me, this movie was a whole lot better than Monster Zero. I guess most people never saw another Godzilla movie. The video of the film lies in front of me now. And I'll enjoy watching it again.I'll tell you how to watch Godzilla '98. Forget what the American press wrote about it. Please for once be someone who can make up his own mind. Try to act like an individual for once. It's not like everybody still writes that Godzilla was a rip-off from The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms. If you have forgotten about the bad publicity, then watch the movie.I'm a big monster fan myself, and most monster movies were made a long time ago. So I was thrilled with this one. For once the monster was not a slow animal walking on 2 feet. For once the animal didn't have a grudge against the human race. I heard a lot of complaints, including that Godzilla looked like a big iguana (duh, Godzilla IS a big iguana, but due the radioactive radiation he became Godzilla) and that Godzilla looked like the T-rex from Jurassic Park. I don't see the slightest resemblance with the T-rex from Jurassic Park. First the T-rex doesn't have scales on his back, his arms aren't as big as Godzilla's. And I don't think the T-rex moves as swift and agile as Godzilla.Next people complained about the story, or better the lack of a story. What the hell did they expect? A movie that tells the world the dangers about nuclear power? It's Godzilla for crying out loud, the only thing he has to do is destroy a city, fight other big monsters.And who cares that the actors didn't act so good. Did I want to see very good acting? Nope I'm sorry, I watched the movie because of a big a** monster. Maybe the biggest mistake of Roland and Dean was to name the film Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had my own hopes and aspirations for this movie, and some of them were fulfilled, but the majority were just crushed in Godzilla's wake. After viewing yet another screw-up by Emmerich and Devlin, I decided to work out how MY Godzilla movie would look.....and MAN did it kick their's! Firstly, cut the duration down to about 115-120 mins (there were heaps of insignificant parts to cut out), give Godzilla a more destructive flair (audiences want to see him/her beating up buildings) and it would've looked good after Emmerich and Devlin's experiences with destruction in ID4, make Godzilla a more terrifying sight (i was more scared of a 20ft T-Rex in JP than of a 300ft lizard!)....making the audience scared is what brings in the dollars, and come up with a more creative story (if u look at the credits u will see that it took 4 people to come up with that poor story! disgrace!). The acting in this movie is below disgraceful, as u can clearly see that the director is not from an English-speaking country.....the actors sound like foreigners trying to speak English and use our expressions. Even though the monster itself was quite a spectacle, the makers didn't harness the full potential of it to create a terrifying film. Terror is the way to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla is a pretty good movie, though I miss the part when a school class of kids are in the museum and the guide mentions the part about the dinosaurs being the biggest "animals" ever, living on the face of the earth and then the trembling begins and the skeleton of the T-Rex gets stamped on by Godzilla. I have only seen this part in the trailer, and it´s sorry that it couldn´t be in the movie as well. A large plus for Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno for excellent acting. These to really lights up the movie, and because of them the movie stays pretty decent, but I must say that I had bigger thoughts about Godzilla, but still it is a nice film and I suggest that you can go and rent it if you haven´t seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The folks at Tojo Pictures are probably still crying over this one. It's Ferris Bueller meets the World Gym Iguana (with the help of some _Lost World_ FX). No intelligent storyline. Why should this lizard go all the way to New York when other metropolises are closer--say Tokyo or Melbourne, Australia? (Or even LA). And why is it that in one scene, the lizard outruns Apache attack helicopters, but in the finale, can barely keep up with a NY taxicab?The only solid performances were from Hank Azaria and Jean Reno. And the extras. When they screamed, you honestly believed they were screaming for mercy.... "Please, please, Godzilla, stomp me flat so nobody sees me in this film!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good gravy this movie was bad! I mean, it was phenomenally bad! When one day, you look through the annals of movie history, and you come across Godzilla(1998) you will say "BAD!" and maybe suffer a hemorrhage remembering how bad it was. Keep that in mind, and be careful when you get older.But really, I mean, the entire 'baby Godzilla' sequence was directly ripped off of the Velociraptor sequences from Jurassic Park. It couldn't have been more derivative, even using the same 'Dinosaur on slick surface fall down go boom' jokes.The acting was terrible, the characters were unlikable two dimensional Jackie Drapers with no Puff to give them a new lease on life. The French secret agents were laughable at best. And this is even BEFORE going into the state of our poor beloved lizard.How dare they call this movie Godzilla? This overgrown Lizard is not our beloved Gojirra, king of the monsters! It actually RUNS AWAY from the military, dodges missiles, and when it actually gets hit with a few missiles, it DIES! The whole POINT of Godzilla wasn't that you couldn't hit it, it was that you didn't have any weapons strong enough to hurt it. Had they called this movie "Mutant Lizard" or "Super Iguana" or even "ID4" this movie would have been better, merely for not defaming the once-great Godzilla.Miki</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To summon this movie up one can say it's just a bad Jurassic Park wannabe. The plot is however not half as interresting as the Jurassic Park movies (and their plot isn't very good either). This movie is not based on a plot at all but on the chance to make special f/x more breathtaking than those in ID4. The actors do a fine job, but they are lost in the explosions and computer work. This movie is also very full of cliches like: The monster manages to evade super-modern heatseeking missiles and the choppers are so bad at aiming that they wouldn't hit an elephant if it stood still in front of the choppers' machineguns. And when the movie finally ends one is sure that you will have to suffer a continuation. So let's settle down and wait for Godzilla 2 to attack the world with its meaningless plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*1/2 out of *****There are so many things to criticize about this film that I´ll do it step by step. Devlin and Emmerich have a serious identity problem. It all started with the fist Godzilla trailer. That was an extremely clear way to say: "Spielberg´s T-rex is nothing compared to our Godzilla" Oh! Were they wrong! For starters, why try to "crush" Spielberg by using a lot of elements from his movies? They started using a kind of publicity that Spielberg made popular (In which they didn´t show the complete monster, but only parts of it). Did Spielberg showed the shark on the Jaws trailer? Or a dinosaur on the Jurassic Park ones? Did he let us see E.T. or the Gremlins on the movie trailers? NO! But those were original and surprising creatures to look at for the first time. Godzilla shows up on its entirety after forty minutes, or so, of film. Now, one condition Spielberg proposed for him to accept the directing task on Jaws, was that the shark would not appear until an hour after the film had started. But Spielberg´s monster was scary, because it looked real, and acted like an animal...no conscience, no remorse. When I saw Godzilla for the first time, a mix between Aliens and Gremlins came to my mind, and because of that, it wasn´t much of a surprise. I had waited a whole year to see that unoriginal design? The babies were so raptors look-alike that they didn´t scare me at all. Patrick Tatopoulos, the Production Designer, should stop watching Spielberg movies too. My question is: What happened to the Patrick Tatopoulos that made the excellent design for Alex Proyas´ Dark City? The movie would´ve survived if Devlin and Emmerich had included more logic sequences and less "humor". The obligatory love scene, was so obligatory, I felt pushed into it. The three attacks on the city were great. What I can´t understand is, if Godzilla can catch a helicopter, why can´t it catch a New York City taxi cab? If it wants to destroy a car that´s hiding on a tunnel, why try to grab it, if it can burn it with its atomic breath? A submarine in New York´s East River? Is it really that deep? There are a lot of sequences that remembered me of memorable movie scenes: When the boats are pulled underwater...Jaws The babies sequence is a bad copy of Jurassic Park´s raptor scene. Godzilla swimming on the East River? It was like seeing the underwater sequences of Alien: Resurrection, all over again. Godzilla´s heartbeat...King Kong. But worst of all...Did the buildings being destroyed by the U.S Army reminded you of something? Yes! Devlin and Emmerich´s own ID4! On ID4, I called the resemblance with other movies (Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, War of the Worlds)an homage. In Godzilla it´s a clear lack of creativity. One last thing...(or two)What a cheap trick to hide a bad FX by covering it with rain and darkness. Spielberg allowed us to see his dinosaurs on broad daylight. I can easily say that Devlin and Emmerich have become public enemies to movie fans. They thought that after the box-office succes of ID4they could give us anything and we would buy it. Guess what! We´re no fools! Even sci-fi movies have to have a little logic... And I´m not asking for Shakespearean lines, just decent ones... "Better start counting" "Try to stop me" "It looks angry" "We better run" "I think that´s a good idea" You don´t even think those things, you automatically start running. At least, I would do that if I had in front of me a monster that size.Please make yourself a favor...Wanna see a good city rampage scene? Rent The Lost World: Jurassic Park. It´s really not that good, but compared with Godzilla, anything is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure I'm not alone here, but I found myself cheering for Godzilla throughout this film. Every time he ate a helicopter or squished a tank, cries of "go on boy!" reverberated around the room. The reason I think was that the computer-generated monster was not only the best aspect of the film in terms of special effects, but also acting ability. Matthew Broderick is a talented individual but his character, along with all of the others was not developed in any way. The cast seemed to just be there as cannon fodder for Godzilla. As I said, the real star who I found myself pitying as, as the film tried to suggest, he was only there as a result of man's tampering. Of course it was the French that had been tampering, not the Americans. Oh no, never the Americans!I wonder also if I'm alone in spotting so many parallels to other films? I noticed distinct similarities or references in parts to Wargames, Jaws, Independence day, Alien and Jurassic Park. A good "wallpaper" film then, and worth watching to cheer on the anti-hero. 6/10</fullReview>

It's got a big dinosaur that chomps things...things get blown up and crushed...and it almost has a plot. What more are you looking for with $3.95 clutched in your hand at the rental counter?This movie is more closely a remake of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1954), the movie which in most eyes actually started the Giant Monster genre (not counting the original King Kong of course).I'm a diehard Godzilla fan...and because of all the negative press, I didn't go see it in the theatre. But I have it on video and DVD and I think it is a good movie. You just have to look at it in the proper prospective. High art this is not...nor is it Godzilla.

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the biggest flops in the history of movies. I was expecting this to be a lot bigger than it was. Independence Day was a masterpiece compared to this. It wasn't like it was a hastily made film, since there was a year of advertising. But due to the criticism I heard I decided not to see it at the theatre and rent it instead; and I have no regrets. Bad acting and a bad casting was one thing. But the Siskel and Ebert thumbs up jokes the director's kept throwing in with the mayor and his aide were pretty dumb. It seemed the only plus this movie had was the special effects.But there were some good parts. Like the part where Godzilla first arrived, the part where Godzilla chased down the choppers -- gee, all these parts have Godzilla in it. Perhaps, if they made the focus of the movie on Gozilla instead of some lame sub plot they tried to create, we mighta had a movie. But this is the part that throws me: Why is it the Godzilla can outrun and outmaneuver a trio or Apache Longbows travelling at 100 - 200 mph and can't seem to catch up to a taxi cab going 60 to 70 mph?? But I have to say the biggest disappointment was that Godzilla only gets to use his trademark firebreath twice in the movie, and it was a SORRY re-creation of it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike Armageddon, the other heavily hyped film of '98, this film is actually watchable. In fact, I enjoyed it! Matthew Broderick is delightful as the "worm guy" with his typical understated charm. His scientific expertise seemed genuine. Jean Reno is appealing as the French "undercover" agent. Hank Azaria is funny in all his scenes. Maria Pitillo plays a woman who once dumped her lovable boyfriend so, as written, this is not a sympathetic character. She learns to take the initiative and have confidence in herself, but only after betraying the trust of Broderick one more time. This is a coming of age story for a woman. It was interesting to see in a genre film such as this.Godzilla himself is very impressive, running through the skyscraper corridors, breathing fire and looking very realistic. I'm glad he was given a sense of intelligence, especially in the scenes with the chopper pilots. The nesting sequences are very well done. Inspired by Aliens/Jurassic Park, the hatching and subsequent flight from the reptiles is truly exciting and well staged. Excellent use of CGI!There were a couple of minor distractions. Mayor Ebert was idiotic and obnoxious. Standing (not running) while watching the pavement split open between one's feet was certainly silly. All in all, a good time at the movies. It's written in the spirit of the original Godzilla movies, with plenty of humor and a coming of age story. I was impressed. I'd be happy to see a sequel. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

Great special effects made the Iguanazilla come to life, but the trite story never gave him any personality. The biggest problem with Godzilla is that you never know if you should love it or loathe it. He destroys military craft and kills soldiers, but he is an innocent, instinctive animal. Also, the performances lacked greatly. Broderick is better than this, but it is a big lizard's movie. Azaria and Pitillo are pathetic, and we all hoped they'd get chomped early on. Jean Reno is the only other bright spot, but he is underused and hard to understand. See Godzilla for yourself, and decide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film. Broderick is one of my fave actors and he is charming here. Jean Reno is excellent. Maria Patillo does a nice job; she makes me like a character written as whiny and manipulative. Most female movie roles are saints or witches. This falls in the middle and I think audiences were thrown by this independent, yet insecure late bloomer of a girlfriend. As For Godzilla, he was awesome. I like his physical appearance and his very fast footwork running around the skyscrapers. He showed some intelligence during these chases. This is great because the original Toho Godzilla was dumb as a rock in all those old movies. The special effects are truly wonderful. I like the recruitment of the "worm guy" and his scientific expertise, as played by Broderick, seemed real. The Mayor Ebert character was overdone. He was deliberately annoying, but even New Yorkers wouldn't tolerate that level of buffoonishness. When all the baby Godzillas start to chase our heroes, this is too reminiscent of Jurassic Park. On the other hand, when Broderick and Reno first discover how many eggs there are,and they begin hatching in front of them, this is truly terrifying. It's one of the best sequences in the film. I consider this film to be very underrated. There are three interesting characters, great F/X and action scenes and some humorous moments from Hank Azaria. I had a really good time watching this movie. I give it eight out of ten stars.</fullReview>

Some movies out there are in the "so-bad-they're-good" category (the "Evil Dead" movies), this fits in to the "Just-flat-out-s****" category. The special effects weren't even that great! Sure they were animated with good results, but they just look bad! The baby rampage in Madison Square Garden (aside from being boring and totally pointless) was one of the most unrealistic CGI sequences I've ever seen, even in the dark. (Jurassic Park looked better five years ago in the light). I genuinely hope Roland and Dean learn something from this waste of talent (I could be financially secure for a long time with this movie's budget) and will finally pull their heads out of their hindquarters. Step one would be to find some screenwriters that have at least half a brain. I wonder what the reaction will be to their next project.By the way, to anybody who thinks this movie has a great script and good acting...... I can find a nice hospital for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say it was very cool to see good old Godzilla in action again - and more ominous than ever! But nostalgia and decent effects is where it ends. How many films have we seen with this plot?? Are we not yet tired of it? Boy gets called in to help (sure, he's worked with mutant earth worms but come on!). Boy meets girl (and gee whiz, the girl's a wannabe reporter who gets the story of her life!). Blah blah blah and then they all run toward the camera from a ball of flame. Sound familiar?? This American plot is wearing thin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i guess the movie is ok... really a no-brainer, and i think that also includes the *geniuses* who hacked together the military details.first of all, the F/A-18 hornet canNOT carry four harpoon missiles. they weigh in excess of a half a ton each, and the two outer pylons just cannot support that kind of weight. (only the F/A-18E superhornet can carry these, and they are not even in service yet!)second, the harpoon missiles are NOT laser guided nor are they heat seeking. they are RADAR guided!third, harpoon missiles do not travel at 900 kts, and burn out the back like a rocket. they are cruise missiles, and have a regular little jet engine, and only travel about 600kts if you're lucky!fourth, harpoon missiles do not head straight for their targets, they arc upward, and come down directly vertical!Hornet pilots will tell you, they do not *usually* launch four radar guided 1200 lb missiles at a cold blooded target which is laser designated, call it "heat-seeking", and then say "firing LGB" (laser-guided bomb, which is actually called "DEPLOYING LGB" if ya wanna get REAL technical!)!!!!!!!!FIFTH!!!!!! AH-64 apache helicopters do NOT, i repeat NOT, carry aim-9 sidewinders, and have gun turrets on the sides of the canopy!!!!!!!!!!!!! they carry HELLFIRE anti-tank missiles, and have a SINGLE turret on the ventral fuselage!i could go on, but honestly, these people need to check their little details before promulgating this mindless crap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To smooth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest problems I found with this movie (besides the acting)was the lack of suspense. No breathtaking stunts! No unexpected surprises! When I went to see this movie I thought it was going to be one of those movies where you never know what's around the corner or behind the door. But no! Everything just went along smoothly. The only thing that surprised me about this movie was when Godzilla seemed to come back from the dead. But Godzilla himself, was not scary at all. He was more the victim than the monster. And that's another thing about this movie that ticks me off. Godzilla made us look like the monsters who were trying to kill an animal that meant no real harm, and was only trying to find a decent place to lay his(her) eggs. And at the end, they tried to make you feel sorry for him by elaborating his death. Why? When the monster dies you're supposed to clap, not cry! But the thing about this movie that really p***** me off was the shameless opening for Godzilla 2 at the end. Most movies don't flatout tell you that there will be a sequel. And what if the sequel is canceled because of the bad ratings or something? (It didn't stop Batman). Then the original movie leaves you hanging by your thumbs. I give this movie a 7 out of 10. And if they do make a sequel, I hope there will be some improvement. But sadly still, most sequels never live up to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly anticipated disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first decided to rent this one, I figured that it was worth a shot. Maybe the critics were being too harsh. Was I ever wrong...Just the first opening minutes of this film made me want to gag. Besides the obvious predictable plot, this film lacked many important things. First, after all the media hype killed it. I expected this to be as big as the Titanic. It was big alright, a big disappointment. Then came the cast selection. No one did even the slightest decent job with the exception of Hank Azaria. The acting was horrendous, and altogether it was a poorly made film.The best thing about this film were the special effects, even though it did not even come close to comparing with such movies as Titanic and Star Wars. The special effects were alright, but sadly were the only point of interest for me in this film.If you want to see Godzilla, stick with the old black and whites. If you want to rent a "monster destroys city" movie, get Lost World.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>B-Movie with a budget is the new Godzilla movie. The main character Neck (worm guy) is assigned to track downGodzilla. The idea they give us for this creatures creation is radiation which I'm not sure I can accept aspossible. Radiation can cause defects in babies both humanand animal but mutate them to grow to be that large isnot possible. The movie has a weak plot and some of characters are annoying (blond chick at the top of thelist). The French soldiers are smart but the American soldiers are stupid. The babies of Godzilla are about thesize of Raptors when first born which in real life notlikely. The babies are also more vicious then their he/shefather not likely. The creature looks realistic and themovie has a lot of action to kept you interested. The movie is better then the original b-movies with bad special effects. (Too much hype) I give this movie 2/5. Rated PA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to say anything about the plot, acting, or diologue in the film because if you have read the user comments, you'll see that there are already over 100 comments about that. I want to talk about the so called "Wonderful" graphics and special effects in the movie. To be honest, I don't think they're so wonderful. For example, how many times do you remember seeing Godzilla in broad daylight? still thinking? Most CGI effects take place in darkness or rain. Examples: Jurassic Park and the sequel The Lost World, Aliens, Men in Black, Independance day, And Godzilla. You might think that the purpose of the darkness is to make the movie scarier. Well, it's not. The purpose of the darkness is to cover up the things that make CGI unrealistic. One example of unrealistic CGI is at the end of The Lost World: Jurassic Park, when they show all the dinosaurs in broad daylight. I don't know about you, but those Stegosauruses didn't look very real to me.I've also noticed that whenever CGI effects do take place in broad daylight, It's usually for a short amount of time. If CGI was so great, it wouldn't need rain and darkness to cover it up. When Godzilla first appeared during the daytime(cloudy sky), his entire body was never shown. Most of the action took place during the night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed the action and special effects, I do not think this is a good movie. To those who whine that this is fiction and doesn't need to be realistic (the "check your brain at the door" crowd), some of us enjoy a film more when we can lose ourselves in it. When a movie is unrealistic, it snaps me out of my immersion and reminds me that I'm sitting in a theater watching someone's poor effort at making me believe that I'm watching something more exciting than my mundane life. In this film, the suspension of disbelief was ruined by the heroes abilities to so easily avoid and escape the seemingly invincible creature(s). Make them do something clever, not just run and hope that 500 creatures will miss them or inexplicable pause to stare at them. I lost any suspense or tension as to whether the heroes could be hurt when I repeatedly saw them simply run away from every danger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla as the best actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting in this movie was so bad that I almost wanted the Godzilla babies to escape and take over the city. The characters acted stupidly in many situations. For example, when the baby Godzillas started to hatch, everyone was just standing around like lawn furniture. It's obvious that when a baby of any kind is born, the first thing that they will look for is food. So why are they just standing around?! STUPID! Another example is when the helicopters are shooting Godzilla with guns. COME ON! Thats like shooting a human with a stapler. It doesn't do anything. I was on Godzilla's side for the whole movie! That's right! The acting was so pathetic that I found myself rooting for Godzilla. That's like watching Jurassic Park and rooting for the dinosaurs. And why do they have to bring up Nick's past love life? Who cares? I certainly don't. This is a Sci-fi movie, not a love story. But I think that Nick's air-headed long-lost girl friend was the worst excuse for an actor I've ever seen. She acted stupidly in almost every situation. But I think that the stupidest thing she said in the entire movie was "Do you think I should have had my hair back?". who the hell cares about her stupid hair. The movie in all should get an 8 out of 10. But on acting alone it should get a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big lizard, big production, big piece of crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot summary: Big lizard comes to New York and causes trouble. Buildings are destroyed, eggs are laid and at least one baby survives. Can you say sequel? Not today folks, thank you very little.The special effects are clever, albeit inconsistent. You're never quite sure how big Godzilla is, or what his capabilities are. He can out-maneuver a dozen sidewinder missiles launched simultaneously, but he can't catch a frickin' taxi cab. What gives with that? And what about his fire breathing capabilities? I thought he would toast the folks in the tunnel, but either he has lousy eyesight or the movie script was weak. I tend to agree with the latter. My favorite part was the suspension bridge scene which, if you haven't seen, I won't ruin by giving away the details. The best part of "Godzilla" was that it featured two main voices from "The Simpsons": Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer.The scene in Madison Square Garden where baby Godzillas were chasing people reminded me an awful lot of the raptor scene in Jurassic Park. And the bubble gum scene was taken directly from a 60 year-old episode of The Three Stooges.A trend exists in Hollywood in which movies are produced with heavy emphasis on computerized special effects and little emphasis on script and acting. Two examples come to mind: Starship Troopers and Lost in Space. Eventually audiences will become more sophisticated as home theater systems and big screen TVs become commonplace. In fact it's already happening. Back in the days of the nickelodeon, people were impressed by images on the wall that appear to be moving. (Look out! Here comes a steam locomotive!) George Lucas had no trouble merging the technology of computerized special effects with clever plot and dialogue when he made Star Wars. Maybe today's movie producers are using buggy software from Microsoft (redundant, since all software from Microsoft is buggy).I wanted to see Godzilla destroy the city of New York, and never once did I root for the military who were trying to kill the poor guy. How can you enjoy a movie if you're rooting for the villain? And another thing, wouldn't Godzilla be protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973?"Godzilla" has some fun moments, but it's mainly just a highly-produced, dimly lighted piece of crap. And I'm not even going to get into the whole shemale thing.On a scale from 1 to 10 I give Godzilla a 4.7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not anymore understand why personnages have to be so "at first level", and almost always stupides in American movies. Is it because people from USA could not catch the sense of an intelligent dialog ? I don't think so, but the producers should have an other opinion about it. In the next Godzilla, please give a replica to Godzilla, I am sure it is going to be more interesting than listening up a really stupid mayer and the rest of the children who seems to play monster games in the garden. And, Monsieur Emmerich (and all the others), consider it : if you want to get by the humuristic way to go thru an action movie package, you do not have to absolutely build idiot characters everywhere. Well, the take with the bubble gum (with Reno and Bergeron the Quebecoeur)was, I have to admit, very interesting. Too bad, it is not enough to support the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this puppy last Friday with my wife. We loved it, even though it thoroughly sucked. Does that make sense?Anyway, after renting Deep Impact (it should have been called "30 seconds of Impact, over 2.5 hours of Deep Crap!") any halfway decent FX movie would have seemed like Citizen bloody Kane in comparison. Godzilla benefitted from this context.very simple, very fun. Actually a little bit touching in the end. The characters were pretty much worthless, especially the supposedly-spunky love interest who came across like yet another action movie waif. Pretty good pacing leading to Godzilla's first appearance. Lots of stuff stolen directly from Jurassic P. But they saved the best action for last. Good move.Two questions remain:1. How come nobody wanted to attempt to tranquilize the beast?2. After 1st miserable attempt to shoot G down, why did they even bother with the stuff that didn't work (helicopters, small arms, tanks) for the second failed attempt?3. Why didn't they poison the fish (or at least slip a mickey)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not expecting much when I saw this, so I took the advice of people who had seen it and parked my brain at the door and told myself to just enjoy it. It was so bad I could not believe it. The acting was vile. PoorMatthew Broderick, normally a good actor, must have beendesperate for work to make this, and it shows. He doesn't even *try*. He is tragically miscast to begin with (who can take him seriously as an action hero), but then he sounds like he'sreading his lines. Maria Pitillo as his shallow air-headed long-lost girlfriend was--shall we say--atrocious? The special effects were decent, but over two hours of SFX a movie does not make. That's *all* this movie had. The characters were so stupid I actually found myself rooting for Godzilla. He's 500 feet tall and 10 blocks long--and they're shooting him with *guns*? Please. The idiots caused more damage to New York than to Godzilla himself. I actually felt sorry for the poor thing. He (or she) just wanted a place to nest and hatch young. The "science" was flawed, to say the least--testing its urine with a take-home pregnancy test? Also, if the creature reproduced asexually, as was apparently the case (and anyone who took high school biology knows asexual reproduction in reptiles is impossible), how could it lay EGGS??? And Pitillo's whining about her career--what was that about? Who cares? And who could take her seriously with such immature, unprofessional behavior.I had no sympathy for her character--or any of the other humans in this pathetic excuse for a film. My rating: -10 out of 10. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE unless you want to laugh at pathetic "acting" and an even worse script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to let you know I am a fan of the original Godzilla movies. While I was watching this version I had that in mind(maybe that was a mistake), there is no comparison except for the name. The special effects are good, don't get me wrong, but you need more than that to make a great movie. There are some major differences between the two. The face on the old is smaller, the mouth is smaller and not filled with teeth like a dinosaur, the tail is shorter fatter rounded at the end not a sharp point, he was not a flame thrower but had a nuclear breath (which he used as an jet engine to fly, the new one didn't use his very often) the walk is also wrong it was more like some thing from Jurassic Park. There was also no mention about being asexual or laying eggs, the only one that comes close is the one about baby godzilla and that was a dream a child was having in the movie, there was nothing about how the baby came to be. The original monster didn't accidentally detroy some thing with his tail, he destroyed it on purpose plus most of the movies he is saving the town from another monster then leaving. With this new movie I just don't get it. The plot was bad, the acting ok, I have to ask. Did the wirter see ANY of the original movies and if so WHY so drastic of a change to the main character? I can only hope that if there are any more in the making that they are better and more closer to the original. If not I would rather they not be made, as in my opinion this new movie is an insult to the orginal GODZILLA and the people who made him.</fullReview>

It will take a while for Matthew Brodrick to redeem himself to me. And, oh, my God, Maria Pitillo is the worst actress I have ever seen. She makes Angie Everhart look good. SOME of the special effects were good, but Godzilla was very disproportioned, changing in size. Some effects were obvious CGI. The last action sequence with the taxicab, one of many, was so preposterous, my friend and I stood up and screamed, "Bulls---!"

		<shortDescription>The very best of all the Godzilla movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it came out in cinemas. At the time, I worked for a media company and one of its movie critics couldn't help telling everybody how much he hated it, even writing two pages for the newspapers to downgrade it. Bad actors he kept on saying. Silly! Well, you get the idea. Two whole pages of critics for Godzilla I asked myself? What kind of nut was he? Anyway, I loved the movie. Bad actors? Seemed to me they acted like many youths at the time. Some of my coworkers were just as dumb, including the fore mentioned critic. Who cares anyway? The big star here is CGI Godzilla, along with a lot of pouring rain probably to help hide a few defects in rendition of the creature. They even put a couple of pretty girls, one with red hair and the other with curly blond hair. And there was a cute boy for the female patrons in the cinema. Why ask for more? For me two pretty girls and a big mama monster rearranging the New York skyline made my day. Does anything make sense? Absolutely not! But the writers made a good enough effort to tell a linear story, one that is exciting, often funny and of course, amazing to watch. Of all the Godzilla movies I've seen since the fifties, this one is the very best, much better even than the last over the top remake. Anyone going into that movie believing he/she would see great art has to be profoundly delirious. I went there to have some fun and I came out very satisfied. I give it 10 stars because it delivered fully on fun, and damn the torpedoes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla (1998): Dir: Roland Emmerich / Cast: Matthew Broderick, Maria Pitillo, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn: The big lizard is a big two hour long spectacle where special effects replace plot. The image of Godzilla looks great but its story is littered with stupidity. It is never established where this freak of nature came from and how it has survived. Matthew Broderick plays a biologist assigned to figure out what made the giant footprints. His ex-girlfriend is a reporter used by her boss. Godzilla develops the ability to hide from helicopters in the city. It eventually reaches the same height of stupidity as The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Directed by Roland Emmerich who made the over-hyped Independence Day, which is another overrated stupid spectacle. Broderick is at his worst while Maria Pitillo is unbearable as an idiot reporter. Together they pull off performances that would warrant having a jacket over their head during any career retrospect. Appearing in laughable performances are Jean Reno, Kevin Dunn and Hank Azaria who really shouldn't be proud to be part of this over budget circus fiasco. How many stupid Godzilla movies are they going to make before they get it right? This version may be the worst version yet and that is saying something when one factors in the budget of this bullshit. Pointless noise that is about as entertaining as an episode of Barney.

		<fullReview>The biggest issue with this film is its title. If they so much as removed Godzilla's name from it, it would be an acceptable piece of trash. But by having the Big-G's name slapped on the posters/DVDs, what we have is Godzilla's anorexic cousin destroying the king of the monsters' reputation. How do they ruin Godzilla? Well, he doesn't even breath fire (that's like Spider-man not shooting webs), his origins are about as throw-away and unimportant as can be (considering the original Godzilla's metaphor, I feel his origins should NEVER be shrugged off), he doesn't battle any enemies and he's taken down by a taxi and a couple of jet missiles?!?! What?! I thought he was created by nukes! From miscasting (with the exception of Reno), to a lot of uninspired FX work (with the exception of the scenes before Zilla is revealed - after that, it just becomes a Jurassic Park rip-off), I personally don't see how this film can be enjoyed even when set aside from the original Godzilla universe. It gets lost in its own logic and expects its audience to be dumb enough to go along with it (giant lizard just disappearing? Come on!) Even for a Godzilla movie the characters suck... big time. In Toho's original Godzilla series our human characters were a majority of the time cartoony, yet had a certain charm and never got in the way of the beasties at hand. Heck, there's plenty of Godzilla films with real genuine characters that make this remake seem like it was written by a 6-year-old.What is nice is that Toho has actually tried to redeem the American Godzilla. In fact, he's now dubbed just "Zilla", as he's unworthy of "God" in his title. In true Godzilla entries like GMK (arguably Godzilla's best ever sequel) or Godzilla: Final Wars, they actually include "Zilla" into their story lines and explain that he's basically just a tuna eating lizard the Americans mistook for the real Godzilla. Pretty neat? "Zilla" actually goes up against Godzilla in Final Wars, and it's one of the most satisfying fights ever! This shows just how hard Toho tries to please their fans.However, to get back on track, I'll say that if you're unfamiliar with the original Japanese Godzilla films, then you're justified to like this movie. On the other hand, you really need to check out the originals. There are some Godzilla films that surpass this, and any Michael Bay film, both in terms of adrenaline pumping action and even heart.The best I can honestly say about this film is Zilla's roar is great... And I suppose the soundtrack was alright (even if there is no trace of the classic Akira Ifukube theme)Thank god Legendary got it right with their 2014 remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I get where all the camps are coming from, let me just spell it out basically, and help those of you who rated this highly just plain understand why you're wrong. ;)Basically, for the time, special effects were great. Actors and actresses were not bad. It made me laugh a little to think "Did they take stuff so fluffy back in '98?' Also, even though I'm only giving this a 3, i'll say story wasn't horrible either. So what gives then?It's not GODZILLA. As many of you well know, and some of you wrote in your reviews, GODZILLA sprays radioactive fire from his mouth, gets down when it comes time to fight the enemies of Earth(or just his)(like people pointed out about the rubber-suit fighting), and laughs off military fire like it ain't a game. GODZILLA is a legendary beast, not just a big lizard, and there's a big difference. It would be like making a Superman movie, but replacing superman with just some big normal Weight lifter or something, some puss that could only benchpress a couple 100 lbs.To be Godzilla, again:You must be fearsome and laugh off even the military's best attacks like they are a joke.Must spray radioactive fire from mouthMust be a wrestling bad-assMust be essentially undefeatable(A tie in battle with King Kong is acceptable, as we all know the only other legendary bad ass that can hang with Godzilla is King Kong)Also, must not be pregnant.=) Again, not saying this couldn't have been a good movie, it just shouldn't be called GODZILLA, as this is a movie about giant lizards in Manhattan, and Godzilla is GODZILLA. Peace.Edit: Also, in case some of you didn't notice, a loooot of the CGI was designed more for marketing then scary awesomeness. They were planning on selling a zillion Toys, Videogames, and even the ride at Universal or wherever obviously with this one, and it's blatant in the CGI style. Pay attention peeps, heavy on the marketing plans, they were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tiggerzilla's spines light up... And thermonuclear blast shoots out the rear end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, you might be wondering why I call this dumb iguana "Tiggerzilla". Well, have a drinking game on how many times I will repeat that name, the crew that choose to design that ridiculous chin of his based it off Sheer Khan from Disney's Jungle Book to make the monster more intimidating. One problem with that idea, what made Sheer Khan look Boss also made Tigger from Winnie-the-Pooh look goofy and ridiculous, and in Tiggerzilla's case, the stupid chin is only one of many reasons I can't take him seriously. The primary problems I have with Tiggerzilla is that he is fragile, cowardly, and has a lame excuse to please true Godzilla fans by belching on cars to make them explode and have that pass off as fire breath. Oh, by the way, he also lays eggs that hatch into thousands of cheesy looking Velociraptors.The rest of the film has morons bickering about canceled dates and the military having the skill of a marksmen on par with the Vogons from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (they hit everything they shoot at but the target, A.K.A., a 200 ft tall salamander)! Siskel and Ebert star in this film portrayed as a bunch of quack jobs, which was a stupid idea as "quack jobs" was a good name for the two film critics to sum up the idiots behind this flick later after Tiggerzilla's release in theaters. The most ironic part was that the people at Toho actually approved the idea of this Tristar designed Tiggerzilla and anticipated it way too seriously. After the release, Toho has ever since made their way into isolating the Tristar design from the genuine design as far as possible once gaining the rights to it. They more than redeemed themselves when they had Godzilla blast Tiggerzilla into smithereens in Final Wars.This is not a Godzilla film, let alone the first American Godzilla film. That goes to Legendary Pictures Godzilla 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad that it took the God out of Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the new Godzilla film being released in cinemas now, I couldn't help but think back to this 90's version of Godzilla. A film so poor that it is often called Zilla because people do not consider this film to be deserving of the name. But what made this film so bad? Well, everything. From the weak writing to the poor CGI there was nothing that made this film worth watching.But the bigger question is, how do you screw up such an easy premise? The concept of Godzilla is easy, a monster who causes havoc and destroys cities, often choosing to fight other monsters also. In this film however, the destruction that Zilla causes is minimal at best, as more damage is done to the city by the army. And this is probably the main reason people hate this film. If you can't understand the basic concept that the monster is supposed to destroy the city then don't make a monster movie.You can also go at great lengths talking about why none of the characters work at all. Broderick being bland and generic. Mario Pitillo being weak love interest who we never see any reason as to why the pair were interested in one another. And then there is the dreadful Siskel and Ebert parody which was a very weak poke at two of the greatest critics just for putting down Emmerich's films (which Ebert actually commented on stating that if Emmerich was trying to put them down on film they could at least have them be killed by the monster). But far more than anything else in this film we again think of how they screwed up the monster. He is a bland monster who lacks any character whatsoever. In the old Godzilla films the monster did have a personality with various fighting and death scenes having an emotional impact. The only way this one can have an impact is how we feel about it killing are beloved real Godzilla from the classic movies.Then there's the action itself. The destruction that Godzilla does cause is often off-screen with the film only showing us the aftermath such as badly designed destroyed building. Then when it does get to showing us the action (in those rare scenes) the effects are weak. In contrast to a film like Jurassic Park which came 5 years earlier using ground breaking special effects and making us believe those dinosaurs are there, Godzilla seems to do the opposite and do everything possible to show that it wasn't there. It would be difficult for anyone to believe that he wasn't computer rendered for a single frame with a weak design and incredibly unnatural movements.The worst crime this film commits is that it lacks a single moment to make this film worthwhile. It had no good action sequences. It lacked any funny moments. And it failed to create the monster Godzilla instead creating a bland generic monster who seemed to be coming off from the Jurassic Park hype, trying to rip of the film in every way possible with its monster. I can only hope that when I see Godzilla (2014) next week it's a better film than this and at least bares some resemblance to the character of Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Poor Man's Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it, I used to be a fan. When this first came out in 1998 and I saw it on the big screen I had a blast. Sure, there were some flaws, but none of those kept me from having a monstrous good time while I was watching it that first time. But of course, I didn't have much experience with Godzilla, or Gojira, back then. Basically I had seen the animated series on Saturday mornings back in the 70s and a few excerpts of the Japanese films, and so I didn't really have much of a basis for comparison.But then the movie came out on home video and of course I bought it. Upon repeated viewings, some of those aforementioned flaws really became hard to ignore, so much so that I found myself wondering why I had such a high opinion of the film before. Then I actually saw some of the original Godzilla films, and I realized that in context, the 1998 American film is really just a poor man's version of the real Gojira.The filmmakers essentially throw out everything about Godzilla except the idea of a giant lizard. Unfortunately, there's more to Godzilla than that and the result is a pretty weak monster. Sure, this film's monster is still really big, but he's apparently not that powerful. He's not even bulletproof, which means that instead of wading through bullets and artillery shells like they are just so many gnats, he has to outrun them. Okay, let's think about that...we have a giant lizard as big as a skyscraper who manages to avoid taking any kind of direct hit from an entire army equipped with assault rifles, rockets, and big guns. Even helicopters can't get a clean look at him. Seriously? The idea that something so big can go most of a two-hour movie without being hit by more than a glancing shot is far more ridiculous than the concept of a nearly invulnerable monster. Moreover, once the new wears off, this Godzilla isn't really even all that spectacular from a visual standpoint. Yes, he's huge and reptilian, but he's also kind of spindly and he sort of hops around like an ostrich. And does he even breathe fire? No, of course not. That would mean he has to be something a bit more malevolent than an overgrown iguana. And that's really all this Godzilla is...just a mutant lizard like the ones living under my deck. Awesome? Not so much. And to think, all it takes to make Godzilla happy is a peace offering of fish. If only the Japanese had known this decades ago, imagine how much money they could have cut from the defense budget! At least Godzilla's mammalian rival, King Kong, had the good sense to demand a blonde.But the movie has problems even bigger than the eponymous monster. Some like to criticize the Japanese films for being too campy and cheesy, and some of them definitely are. But they've got nothing on this one. The characters we have to put up with in this film are, frankly, a set of losers. Not only do none of them engender the least bit of viewer sympathy at any time, but they are all about as likable as the stomach flu. Matthew Broderick is a poor choice for a lead in this type of film, but none of the other protagonists come off any better. The script forces all of them to say the stupidest things over and over again, and despite the fact that many of them are supposedly talented professionals in high-profile jobs they all come across like idiots from beginning to end. And really, what's up with all those major New York accents? The Yankee dialect is so thick that combined with the insipid dialog this film makes even the most badly dubbed of the Japanese movies seem like Shakespearean drama by comparison.I could keep going, but what's the point? If you've ever seen it you already know how lame the little raptor--er, I mean Godzilla clone--subplot is, how poorly the film's attempt at satire comes off (putting a caricature of critic Roger Ebert in the movie is a horrible misfire that says more about the filmmakers than it does Ebert, and I don't even like Ebert), and how weak the eventual climax is. The only thing this movie has going for it is scale and production value, both of which are indeed quite impressive. Some have said this wouldn't be such a bad movie if it didn't try to market itself as something it's not--a Godzilla movie!--but I think even that is an overly kind assessment. Even if the title monster were renamed "Giant Fish Eater" or something, it wouldn't help. The monster is weak, the dialog is laughable, and the characters are grating. This is just a bad movie, and changing the name wouldn't have solved it's manifold problems.</fullReview>

I was interested that he states in his review that people take the comic strip Godzilla franchise too seriously. Firstly Godzilla does not originate from comic books. The effects of the atomic bombs on both Hiroshima and Nakasaki contributed to his very existence. A Japanese elegy on the power of the post apocalyptic atomic force. But then, Dal Boy would have known that if he had read some of Gojira's history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film isn't all that bad to be honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realise that on a critical level this film has been panned, but in terms of watching it as an audience, I don't find it as awful to watch as others would make out. Yes it is factually inaccurate in some places, the CGI could do with a little brushing up and the acting could be refined slightly, but other than that, there is nothing to say this film is that bad to watch. It's pretty much just a turn off film for a rainy Saturday night and basically I have no real problems with that, just as long as it's not obnoxiously unenjoyable like other films of this calibre.The film begins showing reels of the Atomic bomb tests on the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, and focuses specifically on the lizards that inhabit the island. The scene then cuts to a Japanese Cargo Ship, which is suddenly attacked by a large underwater creature with the loss of all but 1 of the crew. We then move to the evacuated Chernobyl, where our lead character Niko Tatopoulos is carrying out tests to see the influence of radiation on the genetics of earthworms in the area. But suddenly he is called in by the US Military to examine a large set of footprints that are spread across the Panama countryside. Meanwhile, the last surviving member of the stricken Cargo ship is asked questions by a mysterious French man played by Jean Reno, the only answer he is given is the chilling name of 'Godzilla'. The trail of the large footprints eventually leads them to Jamaica where another cargo ship has been attacked and washed ashore. The damage on the ship's hull indicates that some kind of large beast had clawed its way through the hull in order to access the large numbers of fish the ship was carrying. Meanwhile a trio of Fishing Trawlers off the Atlantic Seaboard are dragged under for some unknown reason. The film then moves to New York City where we are introduced to Niko's ex-girlfriend, who is a struggling news reporter desperate to make her name with a major story. Coincidently, her big break arrives as Godzilla begins his attack upon the city, smashing his way through buildings, stomping on many unfortunate Taxi Cabs and generally running wild in the city before disappearing from sight. Niko is then brought to New York to assist in the search for the vicious beast that lurks in the bowels of the city. Realising that Godzilla has an appetite for fish, the Military prepare a fish trap by bringing piles upon piles of fish to one place in order to lure him out. But the plan fails and after another mad dash through the city, Godzilla loses his pursuers and disappears into the city's underground. Meanwhile, using some blood samples Niko determines that Godzilla reproduces Asexually and is either about to lay eggs or has done already. However, he is kicked off the case after his girlfriend steals at Top Secret tape from his tent in an earlier scene before broadcasting it on the news. His girlfriend attempts to apologise but Niko no longer has faith in her and leaves the scene, only to find that he has been shanghaied by a group of French Secret Service agents who had previously posed as Insurance agents. They plan to assist Niko in finding Godzilla's nest by breaking back into Manhattan disguised as American Soldiers. Meanwhile, another trap is set up in Central Park to subdue Godzilla, but this also fails and after another chase scene, the creature is forced into the Hudson River where he is blasted by torpedo's from pursuing Submarines. The city assumes Godzilla destroyed and prepare to re-inhabit Manhattan. However, Niko and the French agents, followed closely by his Girlfriend (who is desperate to make up to him) and a fellow News Cameraman, discover the nest in Madison Square Garden, where several hundred eggs have been laid. As the French agents prepare to set up explosives to destroy the nest, the eggs begin to hatch and since they smell of fish, the smaller monsters attack the agents. Eventually the group find themselves cornered in the Commentators box and send a message to the outside world about the presence of the deadly reptiles that could potentially become the new dominant species on the planet if the Garden is not destroyed by US Fighter Aircraft. Responding to their demands, fighters are dispatched and with seconds to spare, our heroes escape the building just before it is levelled with missiles. However, just as the group consider the day saved, Godzilla is revealed to have survived and now in a fit of Paternal rage, chases after the group who have now commandeered a Taxi. In a daring chase across the city, the group eventually tangle Godzilla in the suspension cables of the Brooklyn Bridge, allowing the fighters to come back and finish off the beast, which falls the ground and slowly dies. The City celebrates, Jean Reno quietly disappears and Niko and his Girlfriend get back together.Although this film seems to have a typical sort of story to it, and with the numerous factual inaccuracies and errors, it really is a good popcorn movie, and like many Roland Emmerich films, they are not there to be watched with a critical eye, but more to be watched with a casual sort of attitude, where you just sit back, disengage your brain and enjoy the film.</fullReview>

Godzilla is supposed to run through and knock over buildings not around them or climb them.All the baby Godzillas was something too much out of a Jurassic Park movie.Honestly I don't think that Roland Emmerich or Dean Devlin had ever seen a Godzilla movie prior to making this movie since this movie clearly doesn't deliver as a Godzilla movie at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monster movie purists gave Roland Emmerich's Godzilla a bit of a mauling when it was first released. The reasons for their discontent were multitudinous: it was an Americanised version of a Japanese creation; the new creature design barely resembled the original; the creature changed size throughout the film; there was an over-reliance on CGI; the acting was poor (particularly from Maria Pitiful... sorry, I mean Maria Pitillo); the film turned into Jurassic Park halfway through.Admittedly, many of these complaints held some degree of water, but what many people neglected to mention was that, despite all of these things, the film was also hugely entertaining?chock full of top notch special effects and spectacular action sequences. Even though, at a whopping 133 minutes, the film is unnecessarily long, I don't think I could ever tire of a huge, mutated lizard stomping Manhattan and have no hesitation in recommending this film to anyone who enjoys big-budget creature features. Sure, it may be dumb, but it's also a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich, the director of Independence Day, directs the special effects blockbuster Godzilla, which grossed $379,014,294 in worldwide alone. It was the third highest grossing movie of 1998. Also Godzilla isn't good at all. At the start of the film, the monstrous Godzilla was created when nuclear fallout caused the lizard to grow enormous huge. After it grows as big as an house, the rampaging attacks an Japanese tanker and three fishing boats. Then, an scientist played by Matthew Broderick, come to investigated the tanker that was attacked. Aftrer that tanker, it heads to the Big Apple to wreck more havoc. Godzilla, then destroys most of New York City and its locals and residents are forced to evacuate. The problem with the script of this movie is that the characters don't reveal their background or their personality. Instead, the dialog is either screaming for help or commanding someone to let's go. Another problem is that this Godzilla doesn't even look like the original. This one looks like an giant lizard rather the title character. Godzilla is loaded with dumb special effects and stupid dialog that doesn't go anywhere other than making it. I would more impressed if this movie was more smarter for the screenplay of this mess. &#x2605;&#x2605; 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic like the original 1954 version,but still fair enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie six out of ten because the first time i saw it i was about 9 years old,so obviously i was blown away by seeing something so big and so amazing looking,but now after watching over the more recent years i can see why its not as good as it could be.Even though Godzilla looked nothing like the original i still though the monster was super cool looking,it was cool to see Godzilla as a cgi monster in my opinion cuz i think a guy in a rubber suite stepping on lego houses or what ever is meant for the silver age of cinema,now we can do better i believe.Godzilla complete tears up new york and causes fear and panic everywere,scary,powerful,destructive,not much more to ask for,except a better cast! i generally don't like Mathew Broderick too much but in this movie i feel he did a poor job,some of the dialogue didn't make sense,and some of the theories they come up with are later contradicted along the way,I also wasn't crazy about the fact that Godzilla has a bunch of mini godzillas running around Madison square garden,the idea was great but not for a Godzilla for that matter,alitle bit more science involved would'not hurt either,the original 1954 did not lack much science and caused the audience to wonder,all in all it was not a terrible movie and a couple of things about it were actually very well done,like sound,special effects and action scenes,so i'll say its fair enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Media Vs. Godzilla fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, Classic Media has done a great job presenting Godzilla the way he should be on DVD. They've previously released 5 of the big guy's flicks with both American and original Japanese edits in their widescreen glory along with some decent bonus material. The problem is two Godzilla films are currently only available in this set. It's been reported on a few posting boards that they will be released early in 2008. Good news for those of us who have been rabidly buying each title as they've been released, but it would have nice if they were put out at the same time as this set. For those who haven't dipped in the Godzilla pond yet, this is a great package if you enjoy these kinds of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most underrated movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is the best Godzilla movie ever made, the old movies I don't like. This version of Godzilla isn't supposed to be a sequel to the old movies. This movie completely stands on its own. The storyline isn't the greatest but I still like it and for a 1998 movie, it has outstanding graphics, one of the best movies I've ever seen.Why do people hate this movie? Honestly, I don't know. I think they are just afraid to admit that it's a great movie because they think others will scoff at them, the same with Titanic. Well, I'm not afraid to admit it. Godzilla is one of my favorite movies, ever since I saw it in theaters and I was 9 years old at the time of the release. I'm proud to say its still one of my favorite movies.It's high paced, action packed and deserves a lot more credit than the negative reviews it got. They made the monster look so believable and the actors were great, specifically speaking of Matthew Broderick and Hank Azaria. I can understand that fans of Godzilla like the originals better but I think they should take the time to enjoy this movie for what it is and not compare the old Godzilla movies to this one because this one isn't supposed to be like the old ones at all.It's extremely disappointing that this movie is one of the most underrated movies of all time. It makes me mad. It's one of the best movies ever made and I still watch it. People just need to suck it up and enjoy this movie for what it is.I wish I could give this movie more than 10 stars. That's how good it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla A Good Remake But Overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla is a good remake but overlong from director Roland Emmerich whose admirable in making this movie but a slow pacing at times and a predictable ending is what weighed it down but it's still not that bad it just could've been better. The cast for the most part are solid in their roles including Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pittillo, Hank Azaria, and Kevin Dunn. The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well but don't have much to do. The special effects are impressive especially for that time and it does off some suspense. The Godzilla creature is cool but you can tell it's CG most of the time and seemed to resemble a giant version of the raptors in Jurassica Park movies. Godzilla looked terrific none the less showing audiences glimpses of it first before revealing what looks like in full view. The action sequences are well executed and there is some comic relief mostly because of Azaria. The pacing of the movie was a little slow at times but once the action kicks into high gear things seemed to movie at a steady pace from there. The surprise at the end I saw coming and does sort of leave it open for a possible sequel but if they had changed the conclusion the film would've been a little better. Overall despite its flaws, Godzilla is for the most part an entertaining film with enough action, cool special effects, some suspense, thrills, humor, a little romance, and decent performances by the cast who make it worthing watching at least once.</fullReview>

The acting is weak and it seems most people were there simply for the pay-check. The script is full of holes and there are hardly any thrills. There are some attempts at humor but they mostly fail. Godzilla himself is pretty impressive to look at. Also there's a segment (MINOR SPOILERS) with our heroes chased by just hatched, ravenous baby godzillas that's watchable though not very exciting. See only if you are bored.Overall 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember this movie when it came out. I was like 8 years old and I remember the huge hype on this movie before it came out. I never got to see it in the theatre and I really wanted to see it. They never showed in the ads how the actual creature looked like. I really wanted to see how it looked like. I finally did see this movie. This movie is ahead of its time. The technology to make CGI characters was very limited in 1998. To show a really big lizard trash New York city for a movie of that time is something that deserve props. For a movie that came out in 2007 it was more than possible to show giant robots battle each other and trash a city. All that can be done with blue screens and a computer. But in 1998, model cities had to be used while the CGI lizard was composited in. And remember the lizard is like 10 times the size of optimus prime. Whether these smart ass critics like it or not, films that use a huge amount of special effects will always be a hit at the box office. This movie was way ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every flick has it's share of flaws, and this one is no exception. But none of them would prevent me from recommending it for your next family movie night. It has something for the whole family.I purchased this movie when my kids (particularly my son) were around 8-10 yrs old. He fell in love with it. The scientific information is explained in a manner that is easy to understand and it has NO foul language, "blood/gore" scenes or anything else that any normal parent with at least half a brain would object to.This film offers plenty for grown-ups as well. There are tons of "inside jokes" that will soar right over your kid's heads and settle directly on your funny bones. It satires many clichés (soldiers chewing gum because it makes them look "more American") and the spoofs of Siskel &amp; Ebert are a hoot. Sure it gets campy at times, but that's part of the fun! My only real criticism of this movie is Maria Pitillo (Audrey Timmonds) acting. I hope she took the money she earned from this movie and got some acting lessons. But considering the campiness of this film, it doesn't detract from the viewer's enjoyment of the film.I know a lot of die-hard Godzilla fans took issue with this movie's not sticking with the true 'spirit' of previous Godzilla films, but this is American Godzilla, not a Japanese one - and I think this film deserves a lot more credit than it received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Godzilla, American style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The majority of Godzilla fans probably despise this movie because it doesn't stay true to the original Godzilla character. People even named this film GINO (Godzilla In Name Only). Even the Japanese poked fun at it, dubbing it as "Zilla." I didn't care too much about this film after I first saw it. It is basically just another monster-on-the-loose movie; the producers just decided to borrow the "Godzilla" name for marque value and put the monster in its own flavor. I guess they couldn't completely imitate the original Godzilla movie.This movie begins with the aftermath of French atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific. After the explosions, it was discovered that a gigantic monster dubbed Godzilla rose out of the water and the scientists concluded that Godzilla is an irradiated lizard created by the explosions. Godzilla then makes its way to New York and begins wreaking havoc. It's somewhat entertaining-lots of monster destruction, with the military frantically trying to save the Big Apple from the Big Guy. The atomic bomb theme is surely a homage to how the original Godzilla was created. The acting, though, was unremarkable and very campy. The Godzilla design wasn't that good - looking more like an overgrown lizard than the original Godzilla. There are also monster scenes where the filmmakers ripped off elements from Jurassic Park and Aliens - no originality. While some of the action was entertaining, the story itself is dull and boring. I personally am glad, in a way, that this movie was made because the demand for the Godzilla franchise grew in America in anticipation for the film's release, which resulted in Godzilla merchandise to be exported in America, including the release of the remaining original Godzilla sequels from Toho: Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla and Godzilla vs. Destoroyah. Toys and video games related to the King of the Monsters were in high demand, and the book "The Official Godzilla Compendium" was published. Everything you wanted to know about the 22 original Godzilla movies (made by the original Godzilla producer), and his foes and allies like Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah and Gigan, can be found in this book. When I bought this book in 1998, my brother (also an avid Godzilla fan) and I were ecstatic. At that time, we had not seen all the Godzilla movies and this book revealed the missing movies we haven't watch, and much more. All thanks, ironically, to the American "Godzilla" film.But overall, a below average movie. If you're a hardcore Godzilla fan, stay away. If you're a general and casual fan of sci-fi action, give this a watch, but don't expect a masterpiece. Grade D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just think that Godzilla is not ever boring at any point. Its one of these movies that is only meant to be for the people who know what to expect....and that is action, great special effects and awesome pictures and stunts. Just like Independence Day, which didn't really have a unique storyline either, this reminds me why I like going to the movies....Pure Excitement and adrenaline rush....one after another! The acting was suitable for a movie that focuses on a big monster. I just really liked the way Emmerich takes the size of this thing and makes us think about what it could do with a city like New York. It looks expensive and some funny lines here and there were to be found as well. So I really don't understand why it didn't do as expected because I thought that most of the American Audience would ask for movies like Godzilla, Independence Day and others. Very surprising and disappointing to me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie would vastly improved if they don't name this movie Godzilla. They can call the movie Mutations, or some other names. So the name really hurt the movie. As a movie goer, you will expect certain fidelity of the original Godzilla.This is true whether you talk of the movie Superman, Spiderman, Batman, or any other movie that is a remake. The movie is remake from a popular series because there was something people like about the character which absolutely had nothing to do with the name. The big name will buy you box office in the first couple of days, after a week it is downhill. If the director and producer would get the idea that a remake is not reinvent. Also Dean Devlin completely forgot people watch the movies not for special effects, they come for the movie because of their strong identification with the character of the movie.For original Godzilla, people love the stupid dumb bumbling beasts who are indestructible from man's own sins and he is punished. That is basically the psychological attachment we have with the character. The feeling of pity we have for the monster, much like Hunchback of Notre Dame, or the Beauty and the Beast, well, you get the idea. The concept and character of this beast is within the bounds of a classic story while the movie Godzilla (1998) had none of those classic story identification. It is very close to a cheap copy of other movies from George Pal's movies and other similar American made movie without any character identification. As a professional screenwriter the most important factor in a successful writing is the strong identification of character where the audiences strongly identifies with his thinking, philosophy or other things. If there is none, then it is just nothing but a fantastic mindless SFX movie without any cult following.Cult following needs a certain element of identification, Star Trek (utopia), Time Tunnel (be part of an important events), Matrix (choice of reality), Casablanca (personal bitterness versus greater good), Dr. Strangelove (the inevitably of destruction), and Godzilla (man's sin will be punished). All these hidden meanings not mentioned in the movie is what gives movie its magic. Take for example Godfather, there was absolutely no mention of the word mafia, and the writer and the director made sure of that fact. Because these concepts lurks in our darkest corners, the psyche is very powerful.If you WANT to enjoy the film rename this movie or put in a new label and call it "Jurassic Park 6" and you will find it tolerable to watch, and enjoy the movie. If you have not watched original godzilla before, then this is good news, because this is a blockbuster movie. Don't make any references to original movie though, it is an American monster movie, has absolutely nothing to do with Japanese monster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Razzie nominated director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 BC), when I was younger I used to quite like this film, a remake of the famous Japanese original, but I had to see it again in my older age to get a definite opinion. Basically French nuclear tests have been going on in the Pacific Ocean, and it was observed by marine iguanas, so obviously the radiation has fused with one of these lizards to create a monster that first attacks Japan. Dr. Niko 'Nick' Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is investigating a giant footprint found on the border of New York City, and soon enough this large dinosaur like creature, Godzilla, rages through the skyscrapers to terrorise the people. They know that Godzilla is fulfilling some kind of need, so they decide to lure the monster back and plan their attack to pile a mountain of fish in the middle of a road, and then fire at the creature, but this plan doesn't work very well. Nick comes to the conclusion that Godzilla is asexual, which means that he/she will give birth to other babies that will also be pregnant and reproduce rapidly, but they supposedly manage to kill Godzilla on its way back to the ocean. Nick, French Secret Service agent Philippe Roaché (Jean Reno), Nick's ex-girlfriend and aspiring journalist Audrey Timmonds (Razzie winning Maria Pitillo) and cameraman Victor 'Animal' Palotti (The Simpsons' Hank Azaria) manage to find the nest in Madison Square Garden. The hundreds of eggs hatch and the baby Godzilla chase them, as they smell of fish, so they rush upstairs and try to get away from the creatures, and they manage to find a news casting room to give out a warning. The armed forces send out bomber planes to destroy the building, and all the babies are killed in the wreckage, but then all of the sudden Godzilla crashes through the floor and has returned, and it wants revenge for the death of her offspring. While trapped in a tunnel, Nick works out a way to possibly get the opportunity to attack Godzilla, by trapping the monster in a suspension bridge, so they head for Brooklyn Bridge, and it does indeed end up trapped in the suspension cables. It ends with Godzilla attacked by missiles and killed, Nick and Audrey possibly back together, and Roaché disappearing with Animal's camera footage of the monsters, but of course it returns to the wreckage of Madison Square Garden, where one egg remains and hatches. Also starring Small Soldiers' Kevin Dunn as Colonel Hicks, Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert, The Simpsons' Harry Shearer as Charles Caiman, Arabella Field as Lucy Palotti, Vicki Lewis as Dr. Elsie Chapman, Doug Savant as Sergeant O'Neal, Malcolm Danare as Dr. Mendel Craven and Lorry Goldman as Gene - Mayor's Aide. The cast are I guess fine, but it is obvious most attention is drawn to the monster, using some pretty alright special effects to create the roaring beast and the buildings being destroyed, I think the most memorable sequence is the characters chased in the building by the babies. I can see however why the critics give it two stars out of five, it is not all that scary or thrilling like the original version, and it does at times feel very cheesy, but if you do like an easy watch with some fun action and a fair amount of destruction then I guess this isn't terrible, a sometimes dreary but relatively alright monster horror disaster movie. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Okay!</fullReview>

It also gets its CGI backside kicked back to the ice age by the true and proved Godzilla the King of the Monsters. I did like Star Gate and ID4, and cant understand how the directors, writers etc could have ever let this movie be released with there names attached, not to mention the cast.

		<fullReview>"Independence Day" creator Roland Emmerich tried to make a great scifi action with his remake of the classic Japanese story of the giant monster Godzilla - and failed completely. His film basically is not about Godzilla, the strange invincible monster, which is a nemesis to the arrogant humanity. It's movie about some big monster, which is walking in New York, not doing really anything. There are some stolen moments from "Jurassic Park", but this does not saves the movie, on the contrary, it makes it even more pitiful. The main character is incredibly annoying, I really hated him. That said, the film has decent visual effects and Jean Reno is really cool, as is the monster itself. Even if not a real Godzilla, the big lizard is devious and clever and I actually liked it more than the stupid humans from this film. But overall I was quite disappointed. I have seen worst movie, but I have seen far better too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I would like to point out that I have only seen the original Godzilla movie and therefore would not really call myself a fan of the whole Godzilla franchise. Also this movie has so much more wrong with it than just the fact that it is GINO (Godzilla in name only), and the lizard creature featured in the film is missing all of the original Godzilla's trademarked powers/personality/etc.This movie really sucks for one reason and one reason only. Roland Emmerich. Now I have to admit first, that I did enjoy Patriot and it does not follow the exact same formula that Emmerich does with all of his movies, so don't apply the following to the Patriot. Stargate, Indepedence Day, Godzilla, and probably Day after Tomorrow (haven't seen it yet but from the trailers looks the same) all follow the same action/adventure/sci-fi formula created by Mr. Steven Spielberg. Clear sense of who the good guys are and who the bad guys are; storyline centers around action that needs lots of special effects; corny, campy (and in Emmerich's case not funny) jokes; action sequences that are exciting but not too intense, so that young kids can watch; and a light-hearted fun adventure movie that is supposed to leave you with a good warm feeling by the end.Unfortunately for Emmerich, he fails in every aspect of this formula that Spielberg created. And his attempts come off as very superficial. The characters have no depth. The story lines are EXTREMELY predictable, overly simplistic, and because everything feels like a rip-off (unless you have never seen a Spielberg film), leaves you feeling bored, your intelligence insulted, and just wanting to leave, turn it off and go and rent Indiana Jones.This was my all-time worst movie I had ever seen, until I saw Battlefield Earth. Please avoid at all costs!</fullReview>

Matthew Broderick was good in it but not as good as he was in Glory and The Lion King. What was Roland Emmerich thinking? I mean come on it's not the next Jurassic Park. I don't think Roland is a good director. I do want to see The Day After Tomorrow but I'm just worried if it's going to be terrible and I'd waste 6 dollars. I thought Godzilla was pretty entertaining and I did like some of the actors but that's all that's good about the movie. I also liked the songs and I bought the soundtrack but ignored seeing the movie the second time.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is there something so monumentally cool about a gigantic radioactive lizard smashing apart Manhattan?Frankly, I do like this film a lot. Sure, it doesn't rate high on my list of all-time greats, but it is one of those films I keep coming back to at least once a year.So what makes it so good? I've seen the Japanese "rubber suit" versions, and I've compared them to this. Really, this is a whole different beast. Leaner, smarter, faster, more vulnerable, the Godzilla of this film is very different to the Japanese "Gojira". In many ways, the name is the only real similarity between the films. on the one hand, you have this world-threatening monster, and on the other hand you have this confused animal being hounded through the streets of New York for reasons it can't possibly fathom.You can feel more for this Godzilla. When the japanese rubber version was finally defeated, you always got the impression of a monster having been rightly stopped. It felt like a good and heroic event.In this film, however, we have a character, as opposed to some brainless engine of destruction. Godzilla has believable motives, such as reproduction, revenge, and self-defense. Was it ever satisfactorily explained why Gojira was always on the rampage? When the end of the movie comes, and Godzilla's lying in the street, mewling as it dies slowly, we're left feeling sorry for it. I say well done, Hollywood, for giving us a film that makes us the death of a building-sized monster.On a technical note, I still very much like the way the creature was done. A lot of work went into modelling and animating that thing, and it very much stands up to scrutiny today. Gojira never moved like a lizard, it always looked big, clumsy and stompy. Godzilla really puts us in mind of a lean, muscular, predatory reptile, like an enormous alligator. It moves with the kind of agility and grace that all real animals have, and that sense of sleek, if monstrously large, death gives Godzilla a much more menacing air than Gojira ever had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie I must say that it was a huge disappointment. The script is god awful and has the stupidest dialogue taking place between many of the characters. I personally can't believe that Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno agreed to be in this film. Not to mention that Godzilla now looks like a T-Rex from the Jurassic park set. Roland Emmerich is now going to be known as the disaster movie guy especially with the upcoming release of another of his disaster flicks "The Day After Tomorrow" which I'm sure will not be that good. Bring back the days when the guy wore the rubber suit and you could see the zipper in the back because this movie stinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>attack of the ugly Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Americans have only been exposed to heavily edited, badly dubbed versions of the old Godzilla films, and they judge these films to be poor based on incomplete information. In the original Japanese, with more serious acting, the oft-derided Toho movies are actually quite good, if you can tolerate foreign special effects that are more imaginative than convincing. This movie, on the other hand, is a dog in any language. The first Japanese Godzilla film is an exploration of the atomic threat; Godzilla is not so much a monster as he is a walking symbol of the nuclear bomb. In this film, radiation does play a part in mutating Godzilla into a giant, stooped-over and ludicrous-looking iguana, but the "cautionary tale" aspect of the original concept is lost. Godzilla is supposed to be a condemnation of America's use of the bomb, but in this film, we pawn off the blame for Godzilla's creation on the French - how lame is that?Ridiculous attempts have been made to make the creature more "realistic." It reproduces (just so we can have a "Jurassic Park" ripoff sequence involving raptor-like babies), it doesn't breathe radioactive fire (arguably the coolest thing about the old Godzilla - why change a thing like that?), and it's not indestructible (again, another cool trait of the original creature is lost). The old Godzilla waded through buildings, fire, missiles, lasers, EVERYTHING, on a mission of total destruction; the American Godzilla runs around New York, squawking and burrowing underground like a camera-shy mole. Pathetic.Godzilla is one of the greatest science fiction icons out there, despite the negative (and poorly informed) opinions of his American viewers. This movie, however, is a poor tribute to the big G, and an astounding waste of money as well. The original films are full of great imagery, ranging from poetic to just downright funky. There are no compelling visuals here to equal the sight of Mothra hatching and spreading its wings in "GMK," or Godzilla squaring off against a three-headed gold dragon in the "Ghidorah" films, etc. With all of the imaginative imagery removed, along with the Japanese culture, social commentary, and mysticism, the Godzilla concept is stale and ludicrous.As the closing credits for this movie began to roll, I groaned. Audibly. That's the only time I've ever done something like that in a movie. I mean, how hard is it to get this concept right? All I wanted was a radiation-shooting, indestructible dinosaur smashing through a city. I didn't even expect the subtexts to survive. But my modest expectations were not met. Godzilla is not only an inaccurate adaptation, it's also boring, and that's just plain unforgivable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes the worst of the Japanese ones look like Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godzilla is the ultimate in dumb blockbuster film-making,from the masters who gave us the dumb blockbuster Stargate and the dumb blockbuster Independence Day. However,at least those two movies were enjoyable and succeeded in what they set out to do. Godzilla manages to be a failure on every level. Obviously Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich regarded the Japanese Godzilla films as cheap rubbish and thought it would be easy to do better. Ironically,there is far more fun and even wit to be found in five minutes of something like Godzilla V Megalon {to pick a very silly example of the Japanese series}then in all of the American Godzilla.Perhaps if it had not been called Godzilla than one might be able to forgive a Godzilla that is basically a giant mutated iguana,that runs away from the military and doesn't even bother to cause much destruction. It is an insult to fans of Godzilla. But even if you forget about the original Godzilla this is an amazingly bad,inept movie. The effects are shoddy and mostly take place in heavy rain,probably to help obscure them a little. One area where the film could have outdone the Japanese Godzilla films is in destructive spectacle,but we are even denied that. The script's idea of characterisation is to have Jean Reno's French scientist moan about American coffee,and it can't even come up with an interesting way to kill Godzilla. There are loads of gaffs,such as a Godzilla who can run fast but can't even catch up with one car,or Godzilla hiding underground undetected,and the filmmakers have so little evident interest in their monster that they devote almost an entire middle third to a Jurassic Park rerun with lots of baby Godzillas {read Raptors}. Composer David Arnold admitted that he did not know what to do with the film,and it shows.Horrifyingly,the filmmakers planned a sequel,but public indifference to the film put paid to that. At least good came of it-lots of the originals were released on video and showed viewers of this film what both a Godzilla film and a good monster movie was. Most people still think of the Japanese Godzilla whan the name is mentioned. Despite all this,there is still potential for a good American version.Maybe one day........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The anticipation and excitement in waiting for this remake didn't pay in dividends. This movie misses the whole point of what makes the Godzilla films so great. The high camp quotient and energy of those films is totally missing from this remake. It has good visual effects but no life and the characters never grabbed me. There were stretched where I was even yawning..something unheard of for me when I watch the older silly yarns. Those films were completely silly and that's the whole appeal. You watch for the enjoyment of knowing that the film is badly dubbed and Godzilla is essentially a big rubber suit battling another rubber suited creature. This film was so lifeless devoid of any true fun. The creature is basically a "Jurassic Park" cast off. That hurts the films credibilty. */*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has a few good action scenes, but the whole film is just too slow(and possibly too long... did this perhaps take itself too seriously? As in, *way* too seriously?), and most of the scenes are boring. The pacing could have used work, as could the plot, and come on, any attempt made earlier in the film to turn the creature into something reasonably realistic and explain it all away goes away the instant "Godzilla"... yeah, I won't say it here, but other viewers may already be aware what I'm referring to(and hey, if not, feel free to drop me a line and ask... my bite's not as bad as the title creature's). I must admit, part of this film, maybe 20-30 minutes of it(I'm referring to a specific portion), entertained me more than the entirety of Jurassic Park(why is that movie so popular?). The end scene is also somewhat interesting to watch. Something that got my attention was the number of Simpsons actors in this: Hank Azaria(Animal), Harry Shearer(Caiman) &amp; Nancy Cartwright(Caiman secretary). I found that to be a funny coincidence, if it was a coincidence, that is(or is someone in the casting department rounding them up? I'm not aware of any other movie with that many of them). Somewhat entertaining, and maybe worth a single watch, if you can stand to sit through the whole thing(or jump to lay past the half of it). 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the attack of Jurassiczilla!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. But the name "Godzilla" should have never been attached to it. As a monster flick it is quite good. But this is NOT the Godzilla I love.I'm going to try to be fair here. I LOVE the hokey old campy "Godzilla" monster movies of the 50's and the 60's...the 70's and the 80's even. And the idea of Godzilla being an irradiated iguana is preposterous. That not withstanding, this is still a good production; highly entertaining; and creatively directed, enacted and presented.Matthew Broderick is wonderful in his role as Dr. Niko "The Worm Guy" Tatopoulos (Project X, Ferris Beuler's Day Off, Election, etc). I've never been much of a fan of his work because I've never been able to identify with his characters. And I thought he REEKED in "Inspector Gadget," but to his credit, that was more the fault of the direction and a really stupid script, than his.Maria Pitillo (Olivia Honey of Roseanne Barr's "She-Devil") demonstrated her best talents in my opinion; the best of her career. (For my review of She-Devil, please click my name and then click the corresponding link.) After a long string of obscure titles, this vehicle gave her a chance to show her true abilities. Her portrayal of Audrey Timmonds is open and appears genuine. She makes you care what happens to her character. That is the start of a good performance. But she never loses that open quality which makes you feel as if you know the character as a person. That is the mark of a great performance; such as the one with which she presents to the viewer in this production.Although the scene in which Dr. Tatopolous finds himself standing inside the footprint of Godzilla was directly ripped off from the '76 remake of "King Kong," the rest of the movie was quite creatively done; written, directed, filmed and presented. I had a lot of fun with this movie, by ignoring the constant references to Godzilla, itself. The "monster" featured in this film is NOT Godzilla, but rather some "Jurassic Park" rip-off of Godzilla. I can enjoy the movie for what it is, rather than what it is supposed to be. What it is supposed to be is a modernized remake of a classic monster/horror movie. What it is, is a top quality monster movie which bears NO resemblance whatsoever to the original.PLOT: "Godzilla" is a colossal irradiated iguana who has come to NYC. The US Army, Corps of Engineers, and a band of French nationals know that "Godzilla" has found a home in the sewers of NYC, but have no idea where. After bombing and blowing up several buildings (the Chrysler Building, for one..."Negative impact?! That's the Chrysler Building we're talking about here!" Mayor of New York City), they finally decide to listen to their hi-jacked expert, Dr. Nico Tatopoulos, and allow him to bait the monster to lure it out into the open. Well, that works, but not as planned. (Do their plans EVER work right? lol) So now, Dr. Tatopoulos, his ex girlfriend (a would-be reporter), and the leader of the French Secret Service unit sent here to monitor and intervene in the capture of the monster, must go down into the sewers to find this elusive terror. Dr. Tatopoulos determines through scientific methodologies and just good old fashioned horse sense, that the monster is in NYC to find a breeding ground for his/its(?) brood of world-dominating spawn. It seems that it reproduces asexually and therefore needs no mate. "What's the fun in that?" Audrey Timmonds. But when they discover that our little "friend" has not only been busy, but very Very busy, in its egg-laying capacity, no one will listen to Nico's insistent pleadings to destroy the building in which the eggs reside, and it is up to our hero to save the day.Excellent monster movie, if you can just ignore the obvious and constant "Godzilla" references. Horrid, atrocious, blasphemy of a remake in the field of "Godzilla" movies.As a Godzilla movie, it rates a 1.2/10.As a monster movie, it rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Godzilla fan. So you can imagine my anguish at seeing Godzilla for the first time. Part of Godzilla's magic is that his movies are corny. A guy in a rubber suit fights other guys in rubber suits. Bad dubbing, bad music, and fun for all. Godzilla shouldn't have been made because what kills Godzilla, besides the fact that he looks like no Godzilla before him, is special effects. State of the art CGI is unwelcome in a Godzilla movie, and the production team of Devlin and Emmerich deserved a bomb after the undeserved success of Independence Day. The cast is disposable just like real Godzilla movies. New York takes a little beating and the army gets humiliated. Everything is in place except for the Godzilla that isn't. Bottom Line: This is a movie that should never have been made. That said, you shouldn't be seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What IDIOT decided it would be a good idea to make an American Godzilla movie? That's like haveing James Bond work for the CIA. It just isn't done! But, I tend to be generous whenever I watch this movie (always it's so me and my friend can make fun of it) I prefer to view it as a some-what passible remake of "The Beast From 20000 Fathoms". I mantain that the stupidest idea in recent filmaking history is the decision to try to pass this off as a Godzilla movie. It's not. Just because it has a monster named "Godzilla" Tramping around a major city doesn't make it a Godzilla movie. The impossibly stupide (with the exception of the French guys and the two military officers) human actors are given the front stage, GINO (Godzilla In Name Only) is in barly half the scenes and doen't hold it's own (I'm not going to honor it with a gender) at all. But I think it does look like a Rhedosaur quit a bit, plus the similar plot lines (Returning to it's nesting/breeding grounds and tramping NYC). If they had done this as a remake of TBFTTF, it might have been watchable. But, seeing them try to pass of a plump, light-blue, camera-shy, personality-less, over-grown-bipedal-iguana-komodo-dragon-hybread as the beloved Kaiju, is just WRONG! It's enough to make any G-fan sick!I'll end this saying that if they do go through with their plan to release a sequal to this abomination in 2004, Godzilla's 50th birthday, then I think we should add that as the 8th deadly sin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT AS BAD AS IT MAY SEEM...LOOSE THE NAME THOUGH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In direct response to this movie and the many comments on both sides of the fence on this issue, I thought another look at the movie was due. What I found wasn't a bad movie. At least not as bad as I first perceived. This version of "Godzilla" is not bad as a movie apart from the series I remember as a child from the great Toho Movie Company. The only thing I wish is that it had lost the title of that Japanese Kaiju Monster. "Godzilla" for me always stood in one realm: Mythological. The whole background of the story of the original monster meant that it had to do with the crucible of fantasy and myth. The great dragon come up from the hellfire of man's folly to do battle with legendary beasts then go once again into the pit to resurrect itself again and again when the need arose. "Gojira" as he is known to Eastern cultures is that legendary beast. He is so known for his mythic birth, death and rebirth that I think it's hard to think of anything else with the name attached to it.With this Emmerich/Devlin production, I think what the purists have issue with is the treatment of our mythological monster. The only things left in tact from the original was the roar, the birth and the name. And on a whole the movie is not bad...but not as a "Godzilla" film. Some of the other reviews stated that this movie is just a "sequel" of sorts to Jurassic Park. They're right. This monster and it's offspring are very much like the Raptors from Jurassic Park. Everything about their appearance and nature conjure the ferocious little creatures from the Universal release. And I think that is what should have happened. It should have either remained as a "fish out of water" story much along the same lines as the remake of King Kong (1977), or it should have broken apart from the mythology of "Godzilla" and made it's own statement. The story of nuclear tests isn't just a Japanese-owned concept. Yes they made the need for nuclear disarmament a frontburner topic, then cloaked it in such a way for younger audiences to understand the higher meanings. This is what Devlin and Emmerich should have done. Made an Americanized tale with the same impact as the Japanese version but not called it Godzilla.The effects are top notch. The casting, in a way, typical of an American made movie. Done for kitche rather than substance. That is a lesser flaw. The redemption is in Jean Reno's "Roache". He is a class act all the way. In a sense recreating his role of Leon from "The Professional", his role of a French Secret Service guy trying to "clean up" his country's sins in Pacific nuclear testing is brilliant. A star in Devlin and Emmerich's column. Maria Patillo is also good for what she does. Her need to redeem herself in the eyes of Matthew Broderick's "Nick" is a good storyline and Hank Azaria's "Animal" is a good sidekick who provides most of the movie's best quips and one-liners. And Broderick himself, does as he always does: Stumbles his way around in the movie trying to find out if he belongs. Again, these are lesser evils.What makes this movie good is it's use of New York landmarks and makes not one attempt to keep the city as sacrosanct. Coming on the heels of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the city, the reminders of the army and airforce presence is a little disturbing, but it is good that all these things haven't been airbrushed out. To do so would be ridiculous. This is just a movie. And I think that is how this movie should ultimately be judged. On its own merits rather than on the mythology of another nation. The creature is good. The design is in line with komodo dragons who inhabit the islands of the French atolls in the Pacific. So it is possible for this monster to look like it does. The situations that the creature finds itself in are also plausible, though I still don't know how and why New York was chosen as its stomping ground. That it came from the Pacific and trekked its way across the world just to nest in Madison Square Gardens is just one of those little sniggling difficulties I had with the movie. The old Gojira of the movies always had his beef with the Japanese. Tokyo or Osaka were always prime ground for Gojira's rants, but again I don't understand why this Godzilla didn't go after Los Angeles or San Francisco or Hawaii for that matter. But again a minor bit of nitpicking. LAX would have provided a good nesting ground. And to see it interact with the HOLLYWOOD sign would have been a personal touch that would have been uproarious in the face of how the town takes itself entirely way too seriously.The homages this movie pays to its predecessor are subtle. Necessary to keep it in line with the origins of the 1954 Japanese non-Raymond Burr version. And some of the other homages to movies like "Jaws" and "King Kong" are evident. I say that this movie should be taken on its own and not as part of the Kaiju Showa, Heisei or millennium series. For anyone to say this movie needn't have been made is silly. It has its moments and again is not all that bad as a stand-alone in line with Emmerich and Devlin's other disaster flick "Independence Day" but not as original as "Stargate". To bash it outright is also silly. The raison d'étre of this movie can be that as a companion piece to the Japanese version. As I said, it just should have lost the name. Calling it "The Beast" or "It" could have sufficed and not have caused such an uproar to the legions of Godzilla fans around the world. I think that is where Devlin and Emmerich stumbled over themselves...to think they could have rescued a legend and made it "better" was a fine bit of hubris on their part. One cannot hope to eradicate over forty years of a series of magical movies and claim the franchise overnight. Some bit of humility would have been appreciated. I think that is where the schism between the purists and the newbies ripped wide open. Devlin and Emmerich should have been mindful of that fact. That they weren't shows they had no intention of honouring the original Godzilla. That was a shame. And since when is suitmation a dead art? Sometimes computer CGI gets a little boring. It's good to see some ingenuity still exists. That Toho in its newer films haven't completely succumbed to Western commercialism is refreshing. I did love the "homage" Toho payed to the 1998 film with its "Godzilla 2000" release. The recreation of certain scenes from the Devilin/Emmerich movie shows that there was no ill will towards the filmmakers. In fact, I feel it was an attempt to show that even Gojira has a sense of humour.</fullReview>

I first got to see this during G-CON, a gathering of Godzilla fans from across the country and almost everyone agreed that any resemblence between this one and the original was a dirty shame. (One of the actors from the original Godzilla series, who was a featured guest at the convention, walked out during the movie-can't say that I blame him). Granted, GODZILLA '98 was nowhere near as bad as, say, KING KONG LIVES, but it's painful to watch, knowing all along that a far superior remake had been in the works by director Jon DuMont (SPEED, STARSHIP TROOPERS) and had been canned just before being picked up by Devlin &amp; Emmerich.And by the way, the acting is hideous. Only Hank Azaria and the monster( I refuse to refer to that mutated iguana as Godzilla) turn in a decent performance.Rating: *1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fresh off their heist from the awful "Independence Day" comes the even worse "Godzilla", so bad that I didn't even bother trying to watch it in full. After 50 minutes, I couldn't bear it.The plot is from the classic 1955 version. Godzilla comes to the U.S. to do his usual thing, which is just an excuse for the SFX (again). Once again, the usual suspects are here: bad script, awful acting, corny dialogue, etc. Memo to Dean and Roland: Why not hire a soap opera actress like Lauralee Bell instead of getting the awful Maria Pitillo if you're looking for the worst performer you could get? Was Vera Hruba Ralston unavailable? Matthew Broderick continues to show why he and his wife have no business being famous, and the supporting cast is given the usual monotone drivel that continues to fuel today's movies.There's no reason to see this on your VCR or DVD. The good news is that bad script-writing blockbusters are now confined to one category: Star Wars films from 1999 on.BTW, The Video Movie Guide gave Godzilla *** and a half stars and Independence Day ****. Another reason why I don't buy their book any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie on T.V. the other day, and it was spectacular. An all star cast matches wits against a nuclear altered iguana. Godzilla is a nonstop, heart pounding thrill ride all the way. The audience is shocked, however, when Godzilla is seemingly killed about a half hour into the movie. The audience is shocked again to see that in the end--wait, wait, I won't give away the ending for those of you who haven't seen it(If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?). The audience is confronted with a new feature to Godzilla: he reproduces. Wait, what am I saying? Godzilla has had a child before, so I guess it's nothing new, but it has never been to this magnitude before. He is able to lay two hundred eggs at a time. The nuclear blast makes Godzilla and all of his offspring asexual, so that means if Godzilla can lay two hundred eggs, each one of those eggs can lay two hundred more eggs.Let's see, that makes about...WOW! That's a lot of Godzillas. Behind all that action/adventure, and dazzleling special effects, the movie has an overall good message about the world: "Don't let the French handle any nuclear weapons." I'm sure you'll love the 1998 movie, "Godzilla" as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IN short, this movie was quite a disappointment.By showing the monster quite early on, they defuse the rather good suspense mood of the early movie. Since the monster looks and behaves like something out of Jurassic Park, it is not even scary.The only fun part is watching the monster duck missiles and the US military blowing up parts of New York. With interesting weapons that fail to hurt a big lizard but that do blow up skyscrapers...</fullReview>

There is no plot. The acting is awful, and the SFX? O.k. their nice to look at, but they look really dated now. How did this ever get made? Oh yeah I remember, it was made AFTER 'Independance Day' wasn't it?! Well, that explains it then!!!Save yourself the time, you could do far more constructive things for the 2 hours that this film takes to resolve itself!!!! And I can't believe they left it open for a sequel!!! Now THAT is insulting!!! not to mention up themselves!!! A good thing to do would be to watch a blank tv screen, your own imagination could come up with better things than this!!!2/10 - and judging by other low scorers, I'm being NICE!!Do not Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I didn't leave the theater half way through this horrible movie was because I rode with my friend who actually wanted to stay and finish it out. To this day I cannot believe that Matthew Broderick is the same actor who gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This guy hasn't done anything worth watching since then. Let me just state for the record, that hollywood couldn't have made a dumber looking godzilla than what they put in this one. And the mickey mouse plot was about enough to make me want to vomit for actually willingly giving away $6.25 of my money to see this worthless piece of work. I haven't seen a more predictable, overly dramatic plot using overly dramatic theme music (which was oh so annoying) since I saw Twister. I thought that Godzilla was supposed to have a cult following. I respect movies or actors that have earned those followers, hence the reason I wanted to see Godzilla. I had never really watched a godzilla flick from beginning to end before, so I figured I'd go to this one to see what the hype was about. I have rarely been as disappointed in my movie going life as I was on this day. Other movies that are comparable to this in terms of how poor and disappointing the movie was are in my mind Twister, Armegeddon, Scream 2 and 3, and Jurassic Park 3. Honestly I wouldn't sit through this movie again even if Hollywood offered to double my money back. Just horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's take on the Big-G ripped off so many movies so blantantly it's pathetic. Here are some very specific examples: The whole Madison Square Garden sequence is just an overblown version of the kitchen scene of JURASSIC PARK, w/ little 'Zillas replacing the velociraptors. The nest full of eggs is from ALIENS. And watch the ending, when Godzilla is killed and Brodrick is looking at him. There is complete silence except for Godzilla's heart-beat slowing to a crawl, and finally the crowd cheers. Now go back a few decades, to the remake of KING KONG (I think in '75 or '76) and watch this ending. Replace Godzilla with Kong, and Brodrick with Jessica Lang, and you have identical endings. It's so obvious someone probably mentioned it already. Not to mention Emmerich ripped off his own, much better, previously made action movie, INDEPENDENCE DAY. As for the "new and improved" Godzilla himself, he's just a big dumb schmoe who couldn't grab that little taxi if it was sitting in a desert missing all 4 wheels. The real Godzilla would whip his ass from Manhattan all the way back to his native stomping grounds of Tokyo. Actually, that would make a GOOD Godzilla movie, heh heh.</fullReview>

Now he looks like an overgrown iguana, not a giant, evil-eyed dragon. His fire isn't blue, and he doesn't even use it that much. I didn't really understand this movie that much. In every other Godzilla movie, it seems like the entire army of Japan had to be sent to destroy him. Now it's just the CIA or something. Really stupid. And they kill Godzilla with only about 4 rockets? COME ON! You have to be more clever than that to kill Godzilla.This movie is a bad combination of Jurassic Park and Independance Day. I can't believe how anyone could have made this movie and then looked back on it and have been pleased. Blah. They must not have a cerebral cortex.Save yourself some time.

		<fullReview>This film starts out with a great deal of promise, but soon degenerates into a display of the efforts of the special effects department to dazzle the viewer. Unfortunately the story line somehow gets lost in all of this. A major glitch occurs when the creature, Godzilla, has attacked New York but disappears, only to be found underground when Matthew Broderick opens a man hole cover. A creature of this size can burrow underground without leaving a trace? NO WAY. The creature then pops out and once more terrorizes the city. The city is supposed to go through an evacuation, but, if this happens, it is cleverly concealed, since it remains populated with myriads of people. The creature supposedly lays a few zillion eggs, requiring massive efforts to destroy them, apparently successful until the ending. I wonder how Matthew Broderick managed to get himself trapped into this turkey. He was excellent in Torch Song Trilogy, The Freshman and Glory, but this was a real mistake for him. I think he needs to fire his agent and get a better one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla had an intriguing trailer. But, lots of films have enthralling trailers and are bad films. Godzilla is one of them.Nuclear testing accidentally resurrects Godzilla, a huge foot monster with a big appetite. The monster takes Manhattan, and it's up to a select group of people, including Dr. Niko Tatopolous (Matthew Broderick) and Phillipe Roache (Jean Reno), to stop the monster, and it's soon-to-be-hatching eggs, before Godzilla's destroy the whole city, and maybe even the world.The postage-stamp-sized plot is poorly written. Everything is so repetitve! Godzilla attacks almost everyone on boats, and every time he comes to town it is raining like heck. Also, here's a question for ya. Why does Godzilla eat none of Manhatten's residents and it's babies do? There are many more questions to be answered, and mostly everything important about films has been ripped apart here. It has some slight pleasures, the monster itself is pretty well-done for special effects and the dumb acting is sometimes laughably enjoyable. But the characters are unlikeable, the plot is predictable and Godzilla, the monster itself, would suit a dancing film rather than a try-hard thriller.A pointless addition for Matthew Broderick's once-good career, Godzilla is nothing short of a let-down.I rate Godzilla 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

Mr. Devlin and Mr. Emmerich gave us this smaller, sleeker and faster creation; typical 90's style. Don't get me wrong because it's pretty good, but the GODZILLA name should have been left out. Oh, and the acting was great, too. Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno carry this movie very well.I have been a big time GODZILLA fan ever since I was a kid, and I have seen all of the new movies just released over hear from Japan. Now THAT is GODZILLA!! If Mr. Devlin and Mr. Emmerich are planning to do a sequel (which in my opinion is not necessary), they should take MORE notes from the Toho Co.Still, it's a great movie all in all. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I see it there are three categories of bad movies 1) those that are boring 2) those that are unintentionally funny and 3) those that move you from the bottom of your soul by being so incredibly, mesmerisingly awful. Godzilla falls into the third category, and it's a straight insult towards the viewer by being as brainless and stupid as it is.Godzilla is one of those "Independence Day"-offsprings that are trying to cash in on the publics craving for special FX and stuff blowing up. Godzilla's sky high budget goes alltogether to waste, and the director has only succeeded in producing a two hour long piece of S**t! The director has made a sloppy job on everything, I don't think he even spell-checked the script. The actors don't seem to know what they're doing, and they don't seem to care either. Same goes for the viewer.The dialogue is some of the silliest I've ever heard, even the monster is more human than the main characters. The plot consists of people screaming, buildings exploding and high-tech babble, and it doesn't get any better towards the end, either. The result would be a very boring two hours, but there's one more fatal flaw.The very fact that someone actually thought that this could be entertaining to someone is incredible! The huge underestimating of the viewer is to me very insulting, and the na?vity of the producers is unbelievable. How someone could invest 100 million dollars on this, is past my understanding, just think how many brilliant indie-movies could have been made with that money!If you want to keep your faith in the future of film industry, don't watch this. If you're expecting another "Plan Nine", prepare for worse. There is no reason for someone to watch this, so don't. You'll end up wasting two hours of your life like me, and believe me you don't want to spend them this way!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the team that made Independence Day, you expect this to be the coolest movie of the year. It isn't. Starting with Godzilla, here's a giant lizard that has no presence. At least when you saw the guy in the rubber suit, you sat up expecting something to happen. Not here. Matthew Broderick is horribly miscast as Nick Tatapolis (named after Patrick Tatapolis, Centropolis FX whiz). You never believe he has the analytical skills befitting a scientist. Other characters, except Animal, are weak. Jean Reno has the best character as a French operative, and should have been the focus of the movie if Godzilla wasn't going to be allowed that privilege. The dialogue is flatter than a script page ("That's a lot of fish." No kidding, Sherlock). The action is contrived, with helicopters that fly forward instead of up to escape the lizard. The opening has some effective moments, but feels a lot like the opening of ID4. With this movie, Godzilla isn't the only one laying eggs left and right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're at the boiling point of classic movie / TV series remakes, folks! Combined as a rip-off of JURASSIC PARK by modern standards, GODZILLA is another in recent attempts to win over new generations of young moviegoers. It's one of the few that fail to dupe their original counterparts, all because of big budget visuals and lackluster writing. That pretty much explains why Sony wanted another blockbuster franchise since MEN IN BLACK to gain control of the movie industry, and I'm sorry to say that their luck has run out. An aged and weakling plot isn't the only disease it suffers from. Godzilla's character design is a terrible pity and so does its politically incorrect New York setting. For DVD owners, the best use of your new disc is a doorstop for expensive graphics, and that's it! If you think it's a waste of money, consider these important facts: $50 million on promotional theatrical advertising! 8 1/2 minutes of end credits! A soundtrack album featuring The Wallflowers! Need I say more? We can expect better movies in the future, but not like this! I'll stick to those classic Japanese monster movies, thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg must have thrown up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone remember the trailer for Godzilla ? Godzilla's foot smashes a T-Rex skeleton on exhibition in a museum. This was at a time when we weren't quite sure if Roland Emmerich had talent. ID4 was cheesy but no doubt had its moments. 15 years later we know for sure that he is one of the worst directors ever to have made it to Hollywood. Flicking through his works that were yet to come and insult our intelligence, I am now sure that Emmerich is the one big (not great!) Hollywood director to even make Michael Bay look "maybe not quite as bad". Comparing Godzilla to Jurassic Park fits quite nicely as both film makers had the ambition of creating a fun and exciting roller-coaster ride of a film. But JP was about ideas. It had some profundity to it where Godzilla was merely about size and discarded the actual appeal of the original. Spielberg was able to create suspense and tension. In JP he refined it to perfection. The T Rex was beautifully designed and somewhat had the weight of a believable entity. Godzilla's design was ridiculously puberty-boyish, had no weight, didn't scare. The set pieces were awful. The logic gaps were a disgrace. Matthew Broderick was a bad cast. The reporter's behavior was as non-sequitur as that of a schizophrenic idiot. And then the rain... Godzilla's dead.. Broderick waddles up to its carcass and now we seem to be supposed to feel sorry for this misunderstood creature.. I mean it just wanted to destroy the city and kill us all :( I can't understand how anyone could ever like or even appreciate this peace of cinematic horse.. manure. I hate the fact that I watched it all the way through. I'll never be able to get that time back.. ever.Conclusion: Jurassic Park relates to Godzilla like Spielberg relates to Emmerich or like Marilyn Monroe relates to Paris Hilton or like Dolphins relate to Leeches. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this. I was told by one of my students that a big buck remake of Godzilla was coming out. Then, like happens too often, the big bucks were spent on eye candy and not on a really engaging film. While the lizard was certainly amazing, the way he jumps around and squashes things is almost too formidable. Had he been bent on total destruction there would have been a total annihilation of New York in a few minutes. Of course, his motivations lie elsewhere. He certainly is better than a guy in a Godzilla suit, but eventually get to the humans. I'm not quite sure what to think of Matthew Broderick. He is one of the most bland people I have every seen. Even on Letterman he comes off as the dull guy next door. He also still looks like he's about sixteen. Instead of building really great suspense and waiting for the lizard to make its movie, we have these scientific ramblings. There is humor injected here and there. The newspaper people are ridiculous. The French guys are so out of place that all they do is confuse everyone. Just because you are French, doesn't mean you are stupid. It is a Western country and the people know what's going on in the world. French Roast coffee, indeed! A lame excuse for an on screen commercial. I tried watching this again and was befallen with the same basic endless boredom. The special effects are nonpareil, but after a while they only get you to first base.</fullReview>

There is not an ounce of wit, charm nor are there any thrills to be had other than a car chase (where have you seen those before?) and a people chase (Raptor-like monsters that are fast, but not fast enough to catch slow-running actors! Spielberg's dinos AND approach have yet to be matched). This a damn shame considering this film cost enough to feed a small country or help re-build Iraq. We American's waited for this???? I think the film suffers from a bit of presumption on behalf of the Hollywood duo who made this. They seem to want to avoid anything that made the Japanese films charming. In this flick, there are no colorful sets, no complex plots mixing the monster action with the human action, no rival monsters...and that's just to name a few. This film offers a few explosions (Hollywood films live and die by their explosions - original, eh?), a car chase and some military fire (okay - I liked those). As for Emmerich/Roland's take on the lead character...boy this is one camera shy monster! This giant lizard (yeah that's all. Just an overgrown lizard with zero personality. It is so undefined and kept hidden most of time that he hardly seems a threatening presence! It doesn't cause too much damage, either - not in these faux politically correct times. NYC is "evacuated" in a matter of hours. Now that is the one truly funny moment in the movie. Overall, the film just has too many pretensions to be a really engaging thriller. Why bother if (as a filmmaker) you're not gonna thrill us besides showing us bits and pieces that we've already seen in better films? This "Godzilla" is supposedly as tall as a skyscraper but you'd never know it since this one changes size in every other shot and has an annoying habit of crouching really, really low to fit into the film frame...*sigh* so much potential flushed down the toilet for us fans of giant monster pictures-especially one as expensive as this one. Roger Corman made bad films (fun, charming and memorable ones at that!) for pocket change compared to the 100 million plus $$$ here. The Emmerich team STILL came up short ("Size matters" indeed). This film made money since the curious (including myself) bought into it...with regret. The film took a nosedive in popularity (and $$$) as time went on and lacked the legs to become a true blockbuster. Moviegoers wisened up with time. Glad to know I'm not the only one out there...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On one hand, there was bad acting by Maria Pitillo and the talented but wasted Matthew Broderick, cheesy dialogue, and wimpy main characters. On the other hand, parts of it were hilarious(and yes, the little intelligent dialogue that was there), and it's exciting when they're in the Garden. And the supporting characters, especially Animal, the mayor and Phillipe were good. So I'll give it a 5/10 since it's so hard to judge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So why wasn't Godzilla in the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie I looked forward to for a year. I have always enjoyed Godzilla flicks and now we the Americans were going to make it with all our special effects and know how. I can not tell you how disappointed I was with this movie. One of my main gripes (and certainly not the only one) was Godzilla himself/herself. It looked nothing like the Japan version. It sounded like him (because theirs is a guy) and that is it. I heard that Sony had to show them our version before hand and Toho had to approve...why did they approve of that? Not only did it not look like Godzilla, but it did not act like Godzilla. Godzilla does not burrow underground he just stomps through the city. Suffice to say those missiles would have crashed into him with no effect. Godzilla is bigger than they portrayed as well, and he breaths much cooler looking fire breath that the American version. Let's face it the Japan version would kick our version's but in about five minutes, the only reason it would last that long is the fact is moved like a raptor from Jurrassic Park. It was also killed to easily, the Japan version would never be taken down that easily...they always have to come up with some new and innovative way of getting him back in the sea, not just slam a couple of missiles into him. And what is up with him being pregnant, sure the Japan version had a son that was never quite explained, but ours has to have a litter of raptors. And Godzilla is not a lizard, but a dinosaur a mix of T-rex and stegosaurus. I would have had a sub accident in the polar region to have him born, because I have never heard of a creature migrating north to give birth. Then of course there is the story that was dumb...they evacuated the city in five minutes so there goes the fun of seeing people flee, you get to see a woman trying to advance her reporting career (was that really necessary), and our military is hardly in the film except for a few scenes, yet the French military is for some reason (I don't think they could have ever traced Godzilla back to them).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: The following may contain spoilers. Read no further if you don't want any detailed information about this movie.Being the Godzilla fan that I am, I was both excited and skeptical about the "new" Godzilla. Excited because there would be more "Godzilla " for me to see. Skeptical because I didn't know if they could pull it off.Did They? Let's see...My whole life Godzilla has been a man in a suit. While, throughout the years this suit has changed (almost every single film used a different suit), Godzilla still looked generally the same. I knew going into the film that there was a new look, and was pretty open minded to that. I also knew that he was to be computer generated (CGI), which I was anxious to see. Upon seeing Godzilla in the film, I was very pleased with the look of the creature, but felt that maybe this film should have been called something else. I don't know what, but just not Godzilla. Well, I guess they knew that if they had made a film with it's own identity, they would have been taking a greater risk. We all know it's not about risk, it's about money. Would I have been as excited about a film called "Iguanasaur"? Probably not.The Godzilla effect looked good and the creatures introduction was very good. The audience gets to see the creature a little at a time while he has an exciting romp through town. That, however, is about the best of it.The acting? Bad. Every time Mathew Broderick opens his mouth he sounds like an 8 year old boy. The other actors are not much better, except for Jean Reno, who does an ok job. However, if you saw him in The Professional, he looks like a caricature of himself here.As far as the other effects go, I could have done without several scenes. They can suspend my disbelief enough to make a "giant dinosaur thing" seem real, but then try to tell me that a fisherman is going to get his line tangled in something that looks like it's more than 200 yards away? Dock scene: Cut it! Helicopters flying very quickly between buildings? Cut it! Bad CGI helicopter flight paths? (one of my pet peeves) Cut it! And that horrible "drive out of the mouth" scene! Cut that too!The part of the movie I liked least is the velociraptor- uh, I mean baby Godzilla submovie. They spent way too much time on this and it really detracts from the "Big Creature" feel of the movie. Even so, keep your eyes peeled for the baby Godzilla with the big bag of popcorn in it's mouth, it's really funny. Baby Godzilla submovie: Cut it!Well, if we were to cut the scenes from the movie that detracted from it, we would have little left but the trailers for the film, which were excellent.Did they pull it off? No. Did it make money? Yes.All in all, it's the Halloween III of Godzilla movies! (Halloween III had no relation to any other Halloween film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable movie, but as had been said a billion times before, it's not Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a highly enjoyable movie, with some good scenes in it, and I have a lot of nostalgia for this movie as well. However, I do of course have some gripes. The biggest one is the huge lack of Godzilla in this film. You'd think that a film called Godzilla might actually feature, ya know, Godzilla, but instead we get a completely different monster that we're expected to think of as Godzilla. Now don't get me wrong, GINO (Godzilla In Name Only, as pretty much every G fan knows) is an awesome monster. He's very well designed, and pretty damn cool. But really, the movie should have been called something else, because calling it Godzilla is false advertising. Heck, the director, Roland Emmerich, didn't even like Godzilla movies very much, making one wonder what on earth made him want to direct one (money). But in spite of all this, this is still a highly enjoyable monster movie.Now the thing that I like the most in this movie are the scenes with the monster. They're all very enjoyable. First is the scene where GINO attacks a Japanese fishing ship. It's very effective when the monster shows up on the sonar and everyone is freaking out, and then the awesome pause where we hear that ominous groan the creature makes before all hell breaks loose and its claws break straight through the ship. Next of course is when GINO shows up in NYC, with a brilliant shot to reveal him rising from the sea, and a subsequent scene which shows as little as possible of the monster as it rampages through the city streets. Of course there are also the scenes where GINO goes up against the military, which are all enjoyable scenes.Now for the things that annoy me, apart from the movie not actually featuring Godzilla. For one thing, the characters. They are all 2 dimensional idiots. The only likable one is the french guy, who's name I cannot recall. Next is the fact that they set up the monster as a sympathetic creature, and yet expects us to celebrate when it dies. It spoils a kind of sad moment when it dies, and there's silence, and suddenly everyone bursts into applause. And of course, there are the baby Godzilla's. They kind of felt like an unnecessary addition to the story, pretty much just filler. So over all, I think it's an enjoyable movie with some great moments, but of course, it does have a good number of flaws, and calling it Godzilla was just milking the name, because it was really its own thing. Anyway, that's all I have to say on the matter. Ta ta</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can enjoy stupid movies when they are done well The Day After Tomorrow and Waterworld to name two, but this movie was a total waste of time. Between the technical inaccuracies, the physical impossibilities, and the improbable actions of the characters, I found myself the entire time thinking (and even speaking to myself) "this is a really bad movie, why am I still watching this".To be brutally honest, I prefer the old Japanese movies with a guy in a suit stepping on models. At least then the cheese is consistent.What are my complaints? I don't want to give anything away so as to be a spoiler, but let's just say the actions of the military personnel, the effect of the munitions, and the reactions of Godzilla are so ridiculous at one point I thought to myself, "the writers obviously didn't spend any time on research." And the dramatic pauses? Talk about ridiculous. "I'm about to be eaten, I'm just going to stand here and look curious." "I'm about to fall in a hole, I'm just going to stand and look dramatic." If I had to sum this movie up in one word fit for family consumption, blech!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't smug me, but Garfield Gets Real which is in the 4's on IMDb is actually pretty good. But this movie is absolutely terrible! So bad in fact, that it makes you wonder why this movie was messed up.The plot of the movie was terrible. After meaningless atomic bomb test on the South Pacific, a creature attacks a ship in the Panama Canal, I think. After being hired to investigate the matter, scientist Nick Tatopolous jumps to conclusion that it must of been a giant lizard created from those pointless explosions, and we know who he is. Godzilla makes his way to New York City and causes mahatma there, so he has to be defeated. Now it sounds simple, but they over-dumbed it by putting in stupid news reporter story stuff. We have an issue about news reporting with characters we're not fully introduce to. It seems like a strange complaint but the news issue was too long. It tended to drag on from 20 to 30 minutes, while I was waiting for another scene with Godzilla which is a little short and not really exciting.All the characters were laughable and unlikable. A example is Mayor Ebert and his aide, Gene (which is really insulting to Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel). The effects will not blow you away and the action scenes are not fun at all. So what could director Roland Emmerich do to make this movie even worse then putting stupid characters, lumpy effects, and boring action scenes? How about messing up Godzilla's design which ends up not looking like Godzilla at all. I couldn't believe how badly they screw up Godzilla's look in the movie. The producers put in the laziest opening sequence I have ever seen. I think they knew they were making a bad movie so they didn't care. All I saw were lizards and explosions which is kind of hard to figure out.The last and big complaint I have is the movie contains no references to the original Godzilla movies, aside from the name and roar, and doesn't have the Godzilla spirit. This could've been a great movie, if the script and Godzilla's design were faithful to the original Godzilla movies.The bottom line is Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin made the Godzilla movie all a disaster! The movie will bore and disappoint Godzilla fans.Do not buy this movie, do not watch this movie, do not even look at this movie. It's a sin that this movie was even made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought into the hype when this came out in 1998. I was younger then and went to go see it opening day with my friend. He loved it, but the entire time I saw there awestruck thinking to myself, "Wow, this is actually BORING!" It's not that the film is just stupid. All blockbusters are, after all. It's that Roland Emmerich is so inept here at delivering any sort of entertainment value -- the film takes itself way too seriously for a summer popcorn flick, trying to insert depth and dialogue - both backfire miserably.Matthew Broderick is sorely miscast as the lead hero and Jean Reno has perhaps the only good role in the entire film.The CGI sequences are alright I suppose but compared to today's effects, they're outdated -- and when a film relies entirely on effects to wow over its audience, you know it's in trouble.The end of the film turns into "Jurassic Park" with little Godzillas running around chasing people like Raptors.This movie is too long, too stupid, too pretentious and too boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Version of Godzilla not worth the time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've come a long way baby. Godzilla which Sony hoped would be the big movie of the 1998 summer season, stomped its way on to a record number of screens its opening weekend. Once the star of 22(At the time of the films release) Japanese films, Starting out in 1954, Godzilla' latest American version is handled by director/Writer Roland Emmerich and producer/writer Dean Devlin. You may remember Emmerich and Devlin as the team that bought you the summer blockbuster "Independence Day." With a reported budget of $125 million and in excess of $50 million worldwide in advertising, does Godzilla live up to all the roaring? How believable is Matthew Broderick ("Cable Guy") cast in the lead human role as the scientist Nick Tatopoulus? Although some may feel it's a good attempt to pull it off, Broderick seems out of place in this role, maybe due to the Hollywood typecasting that makes it hard for moviegoers to see an actor out of character. As I entered the theater, I was apprehensive. Is this a kiddy movie or am I just not ready to see another campy monster film? Wellis that not what Godzilla is all about? Did not the Japanese seek out to make a campy film that mocks the sci-fi monster genre? If that is the case, than Hollywood pulled off another one. Emmerich shows the classic campy satire of the original films throughout the movie from the scene of fruitless air attacks to the monster himself. Emmerich could not find an improvement in the voice of the monster so he borrowed the infamous roar from the Japanese films. Thank heavens he did not decide to make Godzilla speak, as the monster did in one of his past films. I don't think I could have handled that. One other actor of note is Jean Reno as Philippe Roche, insurance investigator. As in all films I've seen him in, he brings great seriousness and acting to the role. Also Godzilla, the monster, I feel was not as campy as his Japanese counterpart. Going into this movie I was ready to see a forgettable film. Well, maybe it was better than I thought even with its simplistic and somewhat predictable script. I think fans of Godzilla will delight in another visit with the prehistoric movie star. Kids who may or may not have seen any of the original 22 films will undoubtedly love this kid-friendly movie, although young children may find it way to scary to watch. Adults on the other hand, may find it hard to swallow. Rating 2.5 stars..</fullReview>

A few CGI shots of an overgrown lizard would make up for the pitiful performances and non-existent plot in this stinking pile of cow manure? Jean Reno was perhaps the straw the directors were grabbing at desperately when they realized their over-hyped project was heading south. The blonde was particularly annoying and I was hoping she'd be either eaten by the lizard or catch a sidewinder up her skirt to spare us the whining!. Inconsistencies such as the size of the lizard (seemed to vary from small enough to squeeze into the NY subways to large enough to dwarf skyscrapers) only made a bad movie nauseatingly intolerable. The CGI shots were sub standard - I've seen better rendering of the tail pipes of an F-18 in 16 bit video games. The scary news is that I hear the producers want to make us re-live the horror by making a sequel! Run for cover!</fullReview>

However in that movie we were not given a glimpse of the shark until 3/4 of the way through, just the carnage it left behind...which was what made it so terrifying.In this movie a half an hour hasn't gone by and this totally unoriginal unscary monster shows up and the audience had nothing to look forward to.If there was rating lower than 1 on the imdb I would give it -15.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could have been good. It could have had a real Godzilla in it with the budget and realism seen only in a good Hollywood movie. But no, for some reason the producers decided to blow up an iguana to Godzilla size and call it Godzilla. Why they did this is just beyond anybody's comprehension. But I guess same thing did happen to Catwoman, and few other icons that made a translation from other medium to the big screen. But this was especially bad because it was a big screen to big screen translation.Godzilla is supposed to be invincible. Not die with mere missile fires from F-16. Such weakling does not deserve to be called Godzilla even if it looked like Godzilla (which in this case didn't).Casting was (uh) bad. Story was confusing with so many characters crossing paths but didn't contribute in making the plot better. This includes the baby monster iguanas too.I'd like to see the real Hollywood Godzilla.

		<fullReview>Every critic on the planet thought Godzilla demonstrated with absolute perfection what not to do when making a film, so 'I was bored' is my best excuse for why I saw this. From the title sequence I knew not to take this movie seriously, or at least, not to take this as a serious movie: Lizards sprawled on rocks wave their tongues as a nuclear bomb explodes. This is real drama, people. When the movie begins, Godzilla has attacked a small island somewhere and people take notice. Well, the stupid people on the planet take notice: a scientist who studies radioactive grubs (hereafter known as worm guy) and some uncouth military leaders whose approach to combat strategies involves a lot of maps with arrows that point in no particular direction.As Godzilla makes his way to New York City, a ditsy and highly irritating wannabe reporter also takes notice because she sees her college sweetie, worm guy (Matthew Broderick), on TV, looking at a big footprint. Apparently this was an attempt at a subplot, but you need a plot before you can have a subplot. The reporter's friends consist of an equally insipid co-worker and her loud cameraman husband. He's played by Hank Azaria, apparently the only one who was actually paid to act.Okay, so FINALLY the lizard gets to New York City (he got stuck in traffic in the Lincoln Tunnel), and goes to see `Rent' on Broadway. Not really, but that would've been fun, huh? His less-than-subtle arrival is actually a pretty cool sequence, with the ground bouncing up and down and people staring around, though it copies a bit too much from Jurassic Park. The sluggish, hackneyed dialogue and the numerous shots of gaping-mouthed onlookers soon gets real old, real fast. We get it: Godzilla's here. Within 10 minutes, Godzilla tears through the place and then vanishes. Did I forget to mention that Godzilla is 100 feet tall and weighs more than 10 elephants? His disappearance is announced by `Melrose Place's' Doug Savant, playing one of many vapid military officers who whines through the entire film and manages to accomplish nothing. The film contains lots of helicopter-following-Godzilla/Godzilla-following-helicopter chases, but the thought of 14 Tomcat choppers zipping through the maze of NYC buildings while chasing a giant lizard is more unbelievable than the reptile they're after. What can a helicopter do to what is essentially a giant salamander taller than the Empire State Building? And who would've thought to fly ABOVE the buildings? That's another problem with the film - there are too many easy answers that these supposedly bright people can't figure out. And no one seems to be frightened at all that they might die. The military and press calmly set up camp across the river in New Jersey, because we all know that Godzilla, who swam across the Atlantic Ocean, would never be able to wade across the Hudson River to eat his enemies. Meanwhile, worm guy thinks of a brilliant plan to smoke out the elusive gargantuan lizard by FEEDING HIM. How scientific. Along the way there seem to be several attempts at a bonding between Broderick and Godzilla, but somehow that just doesn't play across on screen. Go figure. The only suspenseful part that brings much needed excitement to the movie occurs when little 9' tall baby Godzillas hatch inside Madison Square Garden (they're trying to score Knicks tickets). I would have thought I was watching an original film if it weren't for the fact that it felt like exactly Alien meets Jurassic Park: the Lost World.  So finally it ends (I won't spoil *that* for you), the wannabe reporter pulls out her can o' whoop-ass on her boss and then reconciles with worm guy, and you leave feeling sorry for the big G. To sum up, most of the special effects were not special at all. For the majority of the movie Godzilla is hiding under New York City so we don't even get to see him. Plus, his fire-breathing skills are nearly non-existent, when they would clearly be an effective weapon against flammable New York City and the less-than-competent armed forces (plus, adding fire always ups a movie's excitment factor). There was no plot, horrible acting, miscasting, an unbelievably stupid military, too many news-happy reporters, and lots of stereotypically mysterious, coffee-drinking, chain-smoking, complaining French people, who somehow had a hand in it all. If I had submitted this script to a studio, they would have taken me out in back and put me out of my misery. Maybe it was trying to make fun of the old Godzilla flicks, but I think it was just bad movie making, considering all the failed wisecracks that were painful to hear. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it comes damn close.My grade for "Godzilla": D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film blows.But more lines are needed to be approved for reading which shows the inherent problem of this review page.People are encouraged to continue writing for length when a short concise reading would suffice. Good Lord....I said it blows and it truly does blow.....how many times do I have to say that it blows for it to be accepted as blowing. Matt Broderick looks like a little kid looking at a kitten when Godzilla puts his enormous face up to his.......what director would possibly accept this crap. The one who did this movie I guess. He blows as well........what was the point. Have I said that it blows enough yet. How many of you have been helped by this comment.period</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smellier Than Godzilla's Breath In The Morning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's reminisce about Independence Day. What a movie that was. I remember being dragged into it by a friend who was into action movies, whereas I am more your regular art house cinema goer. At the beginning of IE4 I was complaining about how some people are willing to watch purest American propaganda if there are only a few explosions in it; yet half an hour later I was sitting at the edge of my seat, screaming "nuke the freaks", cheering our boys into battle and spilling my Big Gulp Diet Mountain Dew.Then the original Godzilla movies. Naff, yes, but atmospheric, innovative and entertaining even today, with their hideous dubbing, the C - list American actors dressed as Japanese (including the unavoidable blonde scientist, who's always a bit of a women's lib sympathizer in the beginning) and their Japanese counterparts dressed as American C - list actors, and the lovingly executed special effects.But the 1998 Hollywood Godzilla: oh deary me. What a fall from grace for Roland Emmerich. It is unbelievable that he could have FIRST made IE4, where he got it all right, and straight AFTER that Godzilla, where he simply gets everything wrong. The movie itself: special effects -- solid, but you've all seen it before (literally! it's a cross between Alien and Jurassic Park); the story -- non-existent; the dialogues (the essential OTHER ingredient in an action movie) -- a bunch of monkeys on Prozac briefly hacking away on a type writer would have done better; acting -- if it was possible to force Charlie Chaplin into exile, why not try the same with Maria Pitello? Anything to stop her from publicly putting on her doubtful "I am a little girl with fabulous blonde curly hair toughening up to the Big Apple" expression (and I am using that word liberally here). (Message to Hank Azaria: I feel your pain. Honest, man.)As an aside. Roland - next time you are looking for comical Greek name to base half of the dialogue on: I once had a class mate named Charalambos Korioglokglu. We called him Bobbes.Hey, don't mention it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to the trailer- I prefer the original Godzilla (or Reptar)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the trailer came out showing the pounding of Godzilla's feet getting louder and then the museum scene getting squished my husband and I cheered. But when the film came to the flicks we heard it stank, so we stayed away.Godzilla came on TV last night so I decided to watch it. The buzz was true: it didn't live up to the hype or the legend.The storyline started promisingly, with loads of nuclear blasts and shots of lizards, the Japanese boat getting slashed and sunk, and the old guy screaming Godzilla's Japanese name. But when it switched to Dr. Nick hunting for earthworms and started following him around it quickly turned into another mediocre movie with taglines to tell the audience where the characters were.The love story with Audury was out of a TV movie. Most of the characters were out of TV movies. The special effects were great: the shots of the planes chasing Godzilla around the canyons of New York skyscrapers were breaktaking.But poor Godzilla didn't get to do what he does best: knock down buildings, scream, breathe fire and flatten cars, people, and anything that gets in his way. Godzilla mark 1998 is Godzilla lite. He isn't angry, he rips into buildings by accident with his tail, he's too busy looking for fish. The plot with the eggs was as plausible as Dr Nick discovering Godzilla was pregnant with the aid of drugstore Be Sure tests. The idea of Madison Square Garden full of eggs that started to hatch was awesome, and the baby Godzillas fighting over bags of popcorn was cute, but it was a plot from another film.I was glad when Godzilla came back and started eating the main characters. Why did the writers have to digress with the pregnancy plot? It wasn't the Godzilla everyone knows and loves.The movie needed to focus more on what makes Godzilla great: wailing and stomping buildings, cars, people. The Rugrats' tribute to him with Reptar was right on target. I wanted more shots of mass destruction that made Tommy gurgle and kick over his blocks with joy. I wanted to feel that delight in strength and power too.If this is Godzilla, I prefer Reptar!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS I'm sorry, but this movie sucks. About the only thing it succeeds at is showing that Hollywood wastes too much time and energy (not to mention our money) on cheap special-effects-dominated rip-offs. Sometimes, you can catch a movie with no plot but it has enough eye candy to make you keep watching. But this so-called 'remake' fails to capture that. And baby Godzillas?! PLEASE! Spare me the pain of seeing little lizards that were clearly influenced by the Jurassic Park raptors kill and maim people WITHOUT blood or gore! Of course, I should've known better than to watch this, being that the Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich credits were on the back of the package...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are only two good things in this film, Jean Reno as the French spy, and the editing, which keeps the film moving even when the screenplay clearly does not. For these two reasons alone, it might be worth wasting some time on this, but surely for nothing else.Here are some of the bad qualities of this mess: BAD science: it is physically impossible for this lizard to have laid 200 eggs in two days.BAD history: The French are brought in to hide the fact that it was the US that did most of the nuclear testing in the Pacific.BAD politics: In a State of Emergency military response HQ, the mayor would never be present - he has no authority in such a situation; so why do the soldiers here even tolerate him? BAD story construction: Only a couple missiles to kill off a monster, but two similarly explosive torpedoes can't do the job? And how did the lizard get from Guam to NYC without any further notice - in a single day, apparently. And why? We all know Toho's Godzilla's grudge against Japan, but it's senseless for GINO to swim thousands of miles, just to sleep in a NYC subway.BAD characters: The hero is boringly monotone, in appearance as in speech; the hero's girlfriend is a real bitch and deserved stepping on - why then bring the two of them back together? Are they sadomasochists as well? BAD special effects: The color values of the skin of the big reptiles never change, despite radical variance in tone, amount, and direction of the environmental lighting of any scene. A godzillion dollars on special effects, and they make such a serious goof?! Of course these critters are phony - they look pasted on the screen.BAD in-jokes: The Siskel and Ebert gag was amusing for precisely 10 seconds - unfortunately it was repeated through-out the film. And it is overtly insulting to two critics who deserved our respect, no matter how we disagreed with them.BAD performances: Is Matthew Broderick's face capable of more than one expression? If so, I've never seen it.BAD musical score: the main theme of the film is played over and over again, until we just want some big reptile to step on the orchestra.BAD psychology: The endlessly replayed musical theme is composed to arouse sympathy for the beast, when everything else in the film makes us dislike it. The disjunction is painful.BAD timing: This film goes on and one - the eggs are introduced for no other reason than to prolong a film that desperately needs trimming.I could go on, but what's the point. Roland Emmerich needs to find something other to do with his life, he's clearly not cut out to make movies. In an interview on a featurette in the DVD release of this film, director Roland Emmerich says that he wanted to make a "completely different" Godzilla, the original being - according to him - out of date. Does this man suffer from brain damage? Godzilla doesn't need to be different. Godzilla is the protagonist of a popular ongoing series of films made in Japan. Beginning in 1984, the producers of these films decided they would gradually update the series to take advantage of new special effects technology. They didn't need some snotty Occidental to show them how to do this. They were gracious enough to license out the series to Americans because they know our fascination with these films. I suspect they assumed that an American entry into the series would give it new energy. Instead, their series' title was ripped-off for a remake of a completely other American film.If you're going to make a pastiche of a famous adventure series, you had better find some way to fit your pastiche into the series as a whole. For instance there are many pastiche Sherlock Holmes stories written by authors other than Arthur Conan Doyle. Some of these stories attempt to fill in a gap in the original series - the years following Holmes' struggle with Professor Moriarity at the Reichenbach Falls, when Watson loses touch with Holmes for a few years. So a reader is permitted to imagine Holmes as having lived a whole life - no past Holmes episode is denied; no Holmes story to come is effected. The reader can thus ignore the question of authorship and concentrate on following the adventurous life of the great detective.While the original Godzilla series is not chronologically sequential (A few are, presumably, set in an "alternate universe"), they do share a remarkably consistent set of themes and subtexts. And while the appearance of Godzilla changes over the years, these changes are consistent with the notion that the monster somehow matures with every film.It is utterly pointless, therefore, to make a Godzilla film without any Godzilla in it. It is actually insulting - to the producers of the original series and to its audience - to discard the themes that brought the audience to the original series in the first place. And it is absolutely stupid (and racist) to presume that, because you work in Hollywood rather than Tokyo, you can get away with it.So this is not a Godzilla film - what is it really? It happens to be an over-bloated overly-rewritten remake of the Ray Harryhausen classic, "Beast From 20,000 Fanthoms". That film is also way better than this one; heck, while made in the '50s, even its special effects are better.Again, if you have two hours of spare time, and you can think of nothing else to do with your life, by all means let Emmerich give your brain a visual enema with this movie. But keep the toilet-paper handy, I guarantee watching this will leave a mess to clean-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This ain't Godzilla . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't recognize the Godzilla in this movie as Godzilla. I have seen most of the Toho films from Japan and somehow even though it was a guy in rubber suit he still managed to have a personality. The creature here is a mystery to me ? an overdone special effects lizard left over from the cutting room floor of 'Jurassic Park'. Somehow the more real Godzilla looks, the less impact he has.This answers the key question of why the ad campaign kept Godzilla hidden, not because they had created anything special but because the monster is so uninteresting to look at.The key difference between the Japanese Godzilla movies and this Americanized dreck are too numerous to mention. I will never forget Godzilla's victory dance after his battle in 'Godzilla vs. Ghidra'. This movie doesn't have time for scenes like that because it depends so heavily on its over-inflated budget of special effects. The Hollywood theory seems to be ? If the audience doesn't get it's special effects soon and often it will get up and leave.Somehow in this mess there is a story. Matthew Broderick adds this to his resume, alternating between impressive projects like 'Infinity' and 'Election' and hackneyed special effects movies like 'Godzilla' and 'Inspecter Gadget' as an expert in worm biology and hits upon the discovery that G is a female. Uh-huh. This is the set-up for a retread of the kitchen scene in Jurassic Park, this time in Madison Square Garden which doesn't resonate suspense so much as ? Seen It! The movie is produced and directed by the team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin who made a hugh smash with their alien invasion in 'Independence Day' and their other-worldly pyramid scheme in 'Stargate'. Those films had some admirers but I found them as noisy, dimwitted and forgettable as this one.The key problem is that they have tried to make a Godzilla movie with a sense a realism and that doesn't work. You have to make monster movies fun, campy and give the audience something to sink their teeth into. This lazy Godzilla production doesn't seem to much inspired by the Toho Films as the lame American summer special effects movies of recent years.NOTE: May I recommend: Gamera: The Guardian of the Universe, Mighty Peking Man, Godzilla vs. Destroyah and the original King Kong. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film should quite simply be renamed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a sad, misunderstood film on all accounts. "Godzilla" 1998 is probably one of the worst adaptations ever. Godzilla himself really isn't present at all in the monster character featured: A radical re- design, a cowardly nature, being a biological parent to raptors, death by military, etc. It's no wonder why Toho, Godzilla's parent studio, completely segregated the character from Godzilla, copyrighted it as Zilla, and made it the subject of joke and ridicule in at least two of their later pictures. This film should not be counted as a Godzilla film, reducing the count to 29 movies in total. While it's a horrible Godzilla film, the movie is a decent popcorn flick to watch occasionally if you butt out Godzilla himself. The characters are really not that great, Nick Tatapolus, Animal, and Philipe are just as caricature in nature as all of the characters in Michael Bay's Transformer series. The acting isn't so hot either, Audrey being the worst easily, not to mention the script is occasionally atrocious and meaningless dialogue is everywhere, especially during the beginning. The CGI effects are also dated and cheesy looking when you compare them to Godzilla (2014). However, the monster sequences are still fun to watch and are still entertaining, even if there are a few rip-offs from Jurassic Park here and there. Overall, this movie is a half decent monster flick, but a terrible re-adaptation/imitation of the Godzilla character. Although it may hold nostalgia for myself and others, it's really not as good as some people might try to point out. If you're looking for a monster movie, this one isn't too bad. If you are looking for a Godzilla movie, please stay away from this. It's probably best forgotten and left to sit in the dollar bin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German-born director Roland Emmerich is not noted for his subtlety - his previous film was "Independence Day" - and there is nothing subtle about this version of a huge monster ravaging an iconic city, in this case New York. Matthew Broderick struggles to bring some sense to the mayhem, while French actor Jean Reno seems to have wandered into the wrong movie. The script is very poor and the plot almost non-existent, but the special effects are fun in this cross between "King Kong", "Aliens" and "Jurassic Park". There are some familiar Manhatten sights including the Flat Iron Building, the Chrysler Building, Madison Square Garden and Brooklyn Bridge, but the city suffers as much as the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why make it a comedy ???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like Independence Day, the writers felt a need to make what could of been classic sci-fi/horror thrillers into a bunch of actors running around spouting one-liners in the midst of chaos. Why ??? do they not think people will go unless it has comedy in it ??? When I went to see the films, I had no idea they would take such an approach. Who exactly is their target audience because it sure wasn't science fiction or horror fans.Very dissappoining.Godzilla had a makeover in this film. It's not your classic look for sure. But that was okay. And the scene when it rises out of the sea onto NYC the first time was great.. ,, but that was about it though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original Japanese Godzilla, none of them. I've seen clips, and I basically know what it's about, but I have not seen them. Now that may be the reason I like this movie more than others. Believe me, if you are a fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies, I can totally understand why you would hate this movie. And even if you don't, it has flaws, I can see hating it even if you don't like the original. But despite it's flaws, it's many, many flaws, I do enjoy this movie.The CGI on Godzilla did not age well, at all. I mean at night he looks OK, at times. But whenever he appears during the day, and even at certain parts at night he just looks so fake. Maria Pitillo, the actress who played Audrey is horrible. I haven't seen her in anything else so I won't say she is a bad actress, but she certainly couldn't act in this movie. The Pacing is a little off, it doesn't get interesting until Godzilla hits New York. Before that it's very boring. And yes it has quite a few plot holes and errors in logic and continuity, and even geography.Yet despite all those flaws, it's a pretty fun movie to watch. Sure the CG on Godzilla isn't good, but the rest of the effects aren't bad. A lot of practical effects for the destruction of New York city. I actually really like Matthew Broderick in this movie, he's a likable enough protagonist. It does have enough action to keep you interested. From helicopter chases to running through Madison Square Garden while being chased by dinosaurs. There are some fun characters and it can be pretty funny at times.Is it a pretty bad remake, yes it is. Is it a rip off of Jurassic Park, yes it is. Does it have flaws, oh it sure as hell does. But is it fun to watch. For me it was. Yes I can totally see people not liking this movie, I understand. But I enjoy it. Take it for what it is, and it's a fun movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly underrated......one of the top monster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am happy that so many people have written here in favor of the movie although it was dumped by the critics. Frankly, as far as monster movies go, this one should rank among the top just because of the numerous subplots that it employs which sort of adds to the primary event. Also there is an elaborate attempt at the background behind the appearance of Godzilla and his activities, which is often missing in much more acclaimed films like Cloverfield (which I feel is a one-dimensional and grossly overrated movie). When you decide to watch a film like Godzilla, you are ready to suspend your disbelief but you hope that the events shown will be coherent and at the same time unexpected. That, in my opinion, this film achieves. Also, it is well acted, especially the ever reliable Jean Reno and a clever and vulnerable Matthew Broderick, ably supported by a cameo from Hank Azaria. It manages to be funny at the most unexpected situations, like the incredulous scene where the taxi is inside Godzilla's mouth. All in all, it deserves a 7, but an extra star in sympathy for the unfortunate critical response.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, so i liked it, kill me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich's Godzilla remake is an old enough film now to have a solid consensus on its quality laid upon it. Common knowledge would say that it was a very bad film. And yes, technically speaking it's not the best by any means. The plot's like swiss cheese, acting on most fronts is perfunctory, which compliments the script's quality nicely (if unintentionally) and the whole thing borrows and cannibalises many, many monster/sci-fi genre conventions. And you know what, ever since i first saw it on the big screen, i still enjoy it. Maybe that's because i was so young at the time that i couldn't care less about the finer qualities of cinema (i was, and still am to a limit, a self proclaimed monster movie nut) and have seen it so many times from then onto the present that i haven't had time to mature to its faults in between viewings. I'm not saying its a great movie by any extent. In fact there are moments where I admit it is very poor. But it does enough things right to stay afloat.Staying pretty close to the fundamental concept of the original Japanese "Gojira", "Godzilla" is all about a phenomenally massive, radioactively mutated reptile, causing mayhem and destruction to the nearest mass populated metropolis. It's up to the local scientists and militia to find out where this thing came from, why its here and how to stop it. That's not the most concise version of the plot, but it's not too bad either. Lets elaborate on the new stuff.Changes have been made to Americanize the story, two of which are obvious; the lizard wasn't a result of the Horoshima fallout but of French Pacific Island nuclear testing; the city under siege is Manhattan, not Tokyo. Attempts at modernising the tale for a contemporary, more environmentally conscious audience have resulted in turning the monster into a fish eating, asexual, egg laying creature just trying to find a suitable nesting site, thus he (why is it called a he if it's pregnant?) isn't just destroying stuff because it's a nifty past time. The person who finds this out is a biologist Nick Tatopolis (Matthew Broderick), who's dragged out from his study of Trenoble earthworms to deal with this slightly bigger specimen. Him, along with the US Army led by Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn), track the beast from early sightings and boat attacks on nearby island chains up to the big apple itself. They aren't alone. A French secret service group led by Philippe Roache (Jean Reno) is on the same trail to clean up the mess his nation indirectly caused. On top of all this we have Nick's college sweetie Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) in the city pursuing a news reporter career, with help from cameraman Victor 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria) and his wife Lucy (Arabelle Field), with a chauvinistic anchorman Charles Caiman (Harry Shearer) getting in the way. (You can choose to ignore the last plot strand if you wish)So that's Godzilla without the big 'plot twists' that take place at various points, but will no doubt be anticipated by any conscious individual watching. The main story and characterisations have never been the monster/action/disaster flick genre's main attraction and that's no more true than it is here. All the players are caricatures and genre stereotypes and any attempts at depth (Nick and Audrey get back together after a long hiatus) are dealt with very poorly, but thankfully its not enough to sink the whole ship. Its left to the actors to carry all the scenes that don't feature the titular monster (too few) and most of them do the best they can with a script that does nobody any favours. Shearer, Azaria and of course Reno have good comic moments and seem to take the script as the preferable but unintentional tongue in cheek variety, Reno especially, hamming it up as the dude who knows the score and goes through the whole ordeal with a knowing confidence and swagger. No one else makes an impression. Broderick is adequate for the lead but nothing more. Pitillo, despite looking gorgeous, comes off kind of annoying as the love interest, playing it in semi-dumb blond mode (still, that girl is hot!).The movie is successful in two areas, the first been Emmerich's once again not very subtle but still amusing political satire on America, from their gun ho culture in neutralising threats, the scathing media, to the mispronunciation of Gojira that becomes Godzilla. Genre movies are also parodied (although that could be kind talk for outright plagiarism) from the likes of Dino DeLaurenti's "King Kong" to "Jurassic Park" (featured in a horrendous chapter containing Baby Godzillas), plus the Mayor of New York, Mayor Ebert, is a caricature of the real movie critic Roger Ebert.The monster itself is the second and most noteworthy success. A concoction of both the original Godzilla and modern day reptilian design, it's a marvel to look at. Yes, the fact that it's a CGI creation is unmistakable, but it transcends the dated technology with a soulful performance, present mostly due to the way it's animated, with a lot of naturalistic detail in its behaviour, instilling feelings of intimidation, awe and endearment (its phenomenal size adds to the intimidation factor). The action scenes are directed and choreographed with Emmerich's nack for large scale destruction and special effects, and both are therefore top draw. There are some stand out sequences, the most memorable been when Godzilla first takes a stroll through Manhattan which is both awe inspiring and exciting.Godzilla is no masterpiece, not even a good film in some areas and as far as remakes go it doesn't rank highly. But it's an enjoyable piece of fluff that overcomes its glaring faults by been occasionally funny (sometimes unintentionally), satirical and containing a handful of well orchestrated action sequences featuring one of the best movie monsters in recent film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed yet strangely still entertaining Hollywood mess-up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, here's another darned review of one of cinema's most famous critical flops, the American remake of "Gojira." I hope you don't fall asleep, since there are about a million other reviews for this film and are bound to be either more interesting or informative than mine. But hey! My reason for writing this review is because I just can't stand all of the negative feelings toward this movie, and I feel that as a reviewer I have an obligation to help out this poor little dud.I'm not a big fan of long synopsis', so here's a short one: a lizard is mutated by French Nuclear Tests, and arrives in New York City to lay its eggs and create the new dominate species. Yep, that's pretty much all there is to it. But is it worth it in the end? To put it kindly, this film is a mixed bag, for all of the impressive effects and action and on heckuva cool Godzilla design, there is an equal amount of poor acting, strangely unfunny humor, and boring characters.I know many people who both hate and love this film for both it's faults and merits. I do not want to create a 195-page review that explores every single iota of this film, so i just want to get the message across. The fans should try and accept something different, as flawed and different as it is, newcomers should watch the movie and try to enjoy its good points and not think too much about the bad, and people who bashed it should watch it again, and just try, try, TRY to give it a chance!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i really enjoyed this movie.the filmmakers took an old premise and added a new twist:Godzilla in Manhattan.in this movie,Godzilla looks very realistic.beyond that,however there are some other great positives to this movie.the acting is believable,in part because the writing is much better than it was in independence day,which ironically had some of the same writers.this movie has no maudlin speeches,and things are kept low key here.the monster becomes, as the movie goes along,sympathetic up to a point,and almost humanized,which i thought was a nice touch and worked brilliantly.the motives for its destructive rampage are revealed as something more than just creating mindless carnage.you can feel the pain the creature endures,both physical and emotional.i actually felt sorry for the beast and its inevitable fate.of course the ending was designed as a lead in to the almost certainly inevitable sequel.but given the disappointing box office,a sequel did not happen and likely will not.Roland Emmerich,who also directed Independence Day,redeems himself with this effort.the writers,some of whom also had a hand in Independence Day,also deserve credit for this movie.they got it right this time.it is ironic that movie goers turned out in droves for Independence Day,yet largely ignored Godzilla,which i think is a superior film in every way.go figure. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess Who's Coming To Town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone is the guy in the baggy, rubber suit tromping through starkly lit minatures sets of a Japan. Enter the slick, computer-generated Godzilla, as he crashes through New York skyscrapers leaving huge holes through the middle of them. No more tiny cars glued to over passes, waiting for Godzilla to stomp on them. Instead, Godzilla '98 blows cars hundreds of feet in the air with the breath from his roar. A cross between Jurassic Park's T-Rex and a giant lizard, this Godzilla is a technical marvel. He is remarkably fast and agile, cleverly evading heat sinking missiles and casually ignoring rounds of artillery shells puncturing his reptilian skin. Unfortunately, improved film-making techniques don't necessarily mean a better movie.The new Godzilla is revealed to be a by-product of nuclear testing in French Polynesia who manages to swim all the way to Manhattan with out being detected along the way. He has come to New York City for no apparent reason other than to nest. It seems Godzilla reproduces asexually and has chosen Madison Square Garden to lay his eggs. As usual in movies of this sort, the only person who realizes Godzilla's true animal instincts (Matthew Broderick) is summarily dismissed by the military because secret information in his possession was leaked to the press by a dim-witted ex-girlfriend (Maria Pitillio) trying to prove herself a worthy reporter. Meanwhile the baby Godzilla's hatch and run-a-muck in Madison Square Garden, but are bombed by military aircraft before they can descend upon the city. Seeing all his dead offspring, papa Godzilla goes on an all out rampage and this last fifteen minutes of the film offers the most exciting and entertaining sequences of the entire two hours and thirty minutes.The original Godzilla movies, all 22 of them, were genuinely silly, but you rightfully assume a $120 million remake to rise above the cheesy and knock your socks off. Well, the visual effects are far from cheesy, but they don't show you anything you haven't seen before, many times before. Initially it's impressive to see the sheer size of this beast and the way he lithely maneuvers among the buildings of Manhattan. But eventually you tire of his massive feet coming down and crunching cars and people-whose bodies you somehow never see in his wake. In fact, Godzilla doesn't eat people unless they smell like fish (his favorite snack) or kill his babies.One would have expected David Arnold (Tomorrow Never Dies) to write one of his usual techno-laced soundtracks rather than fall back on a traditional orchestral track with sweeping strings for melodramatic effect. Yet, he does creating a score that just doesn't fit the visual content. On the other hand, the 5.1 sound effects in the film are exceptional creating one of the few enjoyable aspects of the production. Perhaps the best example of this is the scene when all the baby Godzilla's are hatching and you can hear their tiny roars all around you.Godzilla trashes more than buildings and cars, he devours the talents of some very fine actors on hack dialogue and poorly scripted plot lines. You get a sense that the script was written as they went along and most of the characters are just plain dumb and useless. Oddly, unlike other monster movies these useless characters aren't killed off, they just plod along with little to reveal or contribute to the story line.Of all the actors, only Jean Reno, a Frenchman with his own commando group, plays his part with the right balance of humor and action hero. Matthew Broderick is sadly out of his element and Hank Azaria spends most of the time running away from the great beast. Vicki Lewis from TV's 'NewsRadio' was undoubtedly brought in for comic relief, too bad they didn't give her anything funny to say. Meanwhile, Broderick's screen love-interest, Maria Pitillo is so obnoxious you are begging Godzilla to swoop down and gobble her up.Coming from the filmmakers behind Independence Day, you might have expected a lot more humor in this film, but unfortunately it's not here. Only a few sight gags and quickie one-liners ever hit their mark, leaving the movie is surprisingly empty, lacking a real sense of fun, despite its non-stop action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad but a poor script brings it down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgettable but not altogether disposable interpretation of the classic monster icon. As a result of dangerous nuclear testing carried out in the remote region of French Polynesia, a giant, mutated lizard makes its way to New York City where havoc ensues and it never seems to stop raining. Led by a brilliant but unorthodox worm scientist, and a shady but patriotic French 'insurance agent,' a small group of people band together to try and stop the creature from destroying the city and possibly wiping out the human race. Special effects are fairly decent and the action scenes are actually fun to watch; it's the film's brainless, far-fetched approach, crummy dialogue, and one-note characters that bring it down. Not up there with the previous renditions, but worth a look. **</fullReview>

I knew it would be bad....but not THIS bad! This lizard creature has no personality whatsoever. Even the moronic city dwellers of the film seem disinterested when the Big G slithers around in his worst CGI fashion.Even if this hadn't been called GODZILLA, it stinks. All the pratfalls of the nineties are here - from the despicable cast to the overbearing wisecracks to the overwhelmingly unnecessary computer effects. By the time I got to the big climax in Madison Square Garden (and all those baby Godzillas running around to justify the high admission price as well as ensuring more dumb sequels) the overkill literally bored me out of my skull...and nearly out of the theater.This wasn't GODZILLA, it was JURASSIC PARK PART 3. This travesty taught me one thing, though: GODZILLA VS. MEGALON wasn't so bad after all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the big-fella</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the thing I enjoyed most about Godzilla (1985) was the fact that the big-fella was completely indestructible and hell bent on simply knocking sh*&amp;&amp;^ over and destroying things indiscriminately. What Emmerich has given us here is an iguana that somehow, by being exposed to some nuclear dust whilst in-vitro, somehow managed o grow into a 400 foot tall dinosaur that is scared sh*&amp;%tless of anything the military was willing to throw at it.Remember in 1985, when Godzilla rises out of the water and, while the Japanese launch everything except the kitchen sink at him, he simply stands there copping the hits until he casually decides to gracefully thunder forward and start whoopin some serious Japanese hide. Man that was impressive. You actually are on his side the entire movie..........hahahah especially when he blows up the Russian sub. Anyway back to this film.Emmerich's Godzilla acts the way any animal would act in a strange environment - scared. I think what the producers were trying to do was give us a...ahem...realistic edge to this film, whose entire ethos is supposed to be based on the unbelievable.So anyway Godzilla manages to creep into some American city where we have the pathetically nerdy looking Mathew Broderick and the obligatory love interest story being developed almost straight away. And Harry Shearer? The way he announces the presence of this dinosaur is like he is announcing the prize for the contestants after a game of jeopardy (how the hell does he get, to use his exact words Garrrrrrrrd-zilla, from what was clearly being referred to as Gojira.This movie did not develop any suspense or terror in u the viewer at all. The horribly sad thing is that this movie could have been so good if they did it similar to the way the original was done, but maybe throw in King Kong or Gamera to fun things up a bit.Overall this movie is let down by the fact that Godzilla doesnt have any of the personality he did in the originals (he's simply a big lizard in this one) and well........it just plain sucked. Watch out too for the Jurassic park ripoff in the building and the woeful ending!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame updating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie update of the old Godzilla films falls somewhere in between the "trashy &amp; worthless" and "worth viewing if there's nothing else to do" category. I for one had to be one of the most disappointed people you could find who saw this movie. Now don't get me wrong, special effects and large scale monster carnage are great, but only when they're used right in a movie. I didn't get a chance to see this in the theater (now I'm glad I didn't) but I bought it when it was first released on video, fully expecting a summer block-buster, roller-coaster ride, spectacular computer effects, and first rate acting. Out of all of that I only got the computer effects. I knew this wasn't going to be exactly like the old ones, after all, it's an updated version, but then I thought that the acting was going to be better than it was. It turned out to be as lousy as can be expected. The film had plenty of monster-scale destruction, but so much that I couldn't really tell what was going on. This can't be blamed entirely on the destruction level or bad acting. No, I think it was the running time. I knew it was going to be long so I was prepared for that, but it turned out to be one of the films biggest problems. Now, I love watching long action movies, but when they're this lousy, it gets hard. I know that action films of this type can be good, I enjoyed "Twister", and I was looking for that same kind of fun. I've watched plenty of long movies, but none quite like this. To say that this film is totally terrible wouldn't be quite right, but saying this film is a great masterpiece would be way over the line. It wasn't the big budget roller-coaster ride I had whole-heartedly expected, just 139 min. of a total waste of talent. As cheap as the old films were, there was something about them that made them undeniably fun, and I wish they would have kept this film that way. I think that watching "Destroy All Monsters" or one of the other old ones would be a better choice than watching this. All in all it's pretty lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iggy Zilla stomps NY, self.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this the first week or so it came out, and to be honest, I kinda liked it. What is good-the taxi chase from hell, where Jean Reno drives and takes Ferris Bueller all around NY with Iggy(the big Iguana) Zilla in hot pursuit. Those scenes were great! The Jurassic Park rip-off with all the little Iggys in Madison Square Garden coulda been both shorter/or done away with altogether. There were parts in this that make 'X From Outer Space' look frankly better, as far's linear plotting and coherent acting.Ferris Bueller looked a little outta place, the blonde was pretty bad, Jean Reno was the best part about this and did a pretty decent job as it turns out, but then that is a given with him. I thought the Iggy F/X were pretty good, but with all the other, better F/x out in things like Armageddon, Jurrasic and Phantom Menace, I think they coulda done better.Independence Day was good, Stargate OK, this is somewheres in between. Personally I look forward to another installment by Emmericah and co. But not of this-IggyZilla should stay kaputsky. The studio head was quoted last year as saying you don't let a film that makes 400M world wide lie, you go and put out a sequel, albeit one that is more fan friendly.So-the Gazzo-2 rating? **1/2 stars, one for Iggy and the other for Jean Reno. This isn't as bad as others here have said, but its def. not a classic either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>possibly the worst cast ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this in the theater when i was 15 or 16. A lot of people dislike this movie for the story and plot, or lack thereof, or they have a problem with the effects or godzilla himself. I don't have a problem at all with any of that, I mean it's a big budget late 90's, remake of a B- Movie franchise, how good did you think the plot would be? Same goes for the acting, you shouldn't be expecting Oscar quality performances but the acting in this is so horrendous that it overshadows everything decent about the movie. And I don't (necessarily) blame the actors, they were screwed from the beginning, I blame the casting director and the director, producer and anyone else who put this train wreck of a cast together.The worst part is a number of the cast are actually pretty good actors (or can be) when they do comedy(or to a lesser extent, drama). Ferris Bueller, Apu, and Derrick Smalls (Broderick, Azaria, and Shearer) have no business in a big budget action movie, especially in the lead role. Not to say I don't believe Broderick as a research scientist, but not the one the government would call to help with godzilla. Same goes for Azaria, I buy him as a dumb NY cameraman, but not such a daredevil cameraman. While we're on the subject, Kevin Dunn as the guy in charge on the militaries behalf? Really?Those are the actors with talent who were just miscast, there are also a few who have no business acting in anything, period.Like Vicki lewis (she was awful on news radio too). Then there's Annabella Field (lucy) and Maria Pitillo (Audrey) both of whom I'm convinced only got cast because of who they did or were sleeping with, especially Maria. They lead female to the worst actress ever? And then Michael Lerner (mayor Ebert) who was only cast as the villain because Siskel &amp; Ebert hated ID4.In fact the only actor who has any business in this movie is Jean Reno, him I easily buy as a french military officer. It's just a shame cause this movie could have been so much better if only they took a couple more days to cast better. I still watch it when I get on a godzilla kick but it's difficult to get all the way through. I much prefer to watch others, including the 2014 reboot.</fullReview>

I was expecting to see a Godzilla with good CGI special effects who breathed nuclear fire his main attribute. No fire, he didn't sound like the original and he didn't even look like the original. The only think I liked better was the special effects. The guy in the suit was cheesy looking but the movies were more entertaining.I don't know what they were thinking when they made this but they didn't have old school Godzilla fans in mind. This is more like a lame attempt to beat people out of their money and make a quick buck.

		<shortDescription>So much better than the Japanese Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so tired of geeky fans of the Japanese Godzilla, stating this movie to be bad and suck. Excuse me, but they should shut the f*ck up... Yes; including AVGN. This movie is in so many ways better than the Japanese version. Okay, I know; the Japanese was first, and they created him. I totally respect that. Toho Studio did a great thing making him. But this movie is like a more realistic version of Godzilla. Like they did with the newer Batman movies. So there's nothing to be complaining about.Let's start with the storyline. The Japanese Godzilla movies NEVER had a good storyline. The first one was just Godzilla destroying everything, and the others after that was technically just Godzilla fighting other monsters. It's cheap, and stupid after over 20+ movies. The newer, American one is about normal persons facing this beast, and Godzilla's actual feelings. And you got; you just GOT to admit, that the American Godzilla is WAY better worked on. A computer-generated well-made mutated iguana with the size of at least 20 blue whales, he doesn't breath any fire and he looks so damn cool. The Japanese Godzilla is a guy in a rubber-suit.... that's bad. And yeah, have you seen "Godzilla: Final Wars" from 2004? The scene where the Japanese Godzilla fights and win WAY too easy against the American Godzilla? ........ that's just childish. They made a cheap lazy-made version of the American Godzilla to face the Japanese. First of all, the American Godzilla is actually bigger than the Japanese, so they already made wrong with that part in this short fight. And then, the American Godzilla is at least 10 times faster at running. So this fighting scene is just illogic. Oh, you mean the Japanese should win because he breathes fire? Riiiight.... And the villain is calling him "tuna-head"................... why?! He doesn't look anything alike a tuna! He looks like a monster! If they mean the fish he is eating in this American movie, it's salmons! Not tunas - SALMONS!!! And if you want to criticize head looks, check the Japanese Godzilla's head. He looks like a cat crossed with a reptile. So, touché if so...And the Toho Studio are actually calling the American Godzilla "Zilla"..... how childish. What's wrong with them - are they jealous or something?! Oh, and don't forget the whining about that Godzilla in this movie is "too invulnerable"..... it's more like the Japanese Godzilla got the "Superman" syndrome. He doesn't even get wounded by the army, so... I got to say; I respect the Japanese Godzilla as well. But after hearing a lot of people complaining about the American one, I thought it's payback time.This movie is the best Godzilla movie ever. You just have to be open minded, and not a grouchy Japanese Godzilla fan.... such as the AVGN; as I said before. If you like giant monster movies, this is for sure one of the best ever made. It's epic, funny, charming, cool and full with action.I give it 9 of 10. Yes, I'm serious. Out of my perspective, there is NOTHING bad about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Experience in my Life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to know what the best movie experience of my life, it's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It felt like I was in a grind-house theater where people from all sides had been cheering back and forth from the trailers to the beginning of the Warner Bros. logo. Girls were howling at Rupert Grint's arms, audiences of all ages were laughing at certain scenes and gasping at the special effects.Let me tell you the worst movie experience...I saw Godzilla on a Saturday in late May of 1998, the day of my middle school graduation. Sure the reviews weren't hot with the exception of Joel Siegel from Good Morning America saying how much fun it was; plus the film itself was marketing from commercials, action figures, trailers and interviewing the actors in all magazine publications from Disney Adventures to Nickelodeon.The plot of Godzilla involves the famous creature going from Japan to New York City where the monster wreaks havoc in town, causing panic on all sides. With the military involved, they hire field specialist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) to see where Godzilla is hiding and ask how to lure the beast into their tricks to kill him.Other characters include a French patriot (Jean Reno) who talks to witnesses from around the globe and tracks down Niko in New York to find any information leading towards Godzilla's hideout so him and his army could kill him before the marines. Maria Pitillo is Niko's ex-girlfriend who has dreams of being a reporter despite going out with the arrogant reporter (Harry Shearer) and being his little assistant.Not only is Godzilla too much of a long movie to be a blockbuster, but with many characters. I dealt with many things in the movie theater from hearing people booing at Godzilla because he wasn't the same as the earlier versions. Plus there was too many endings to think when the movie was going to be over along with the fact that somebody spilled soda on me.What a bad experience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, *I* thought it was brilliant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I'm one that never looked twice at the old GZ films, tho I'm sure they're good in their own ways, they just never caught me. But I did love Jurassic Park (first AND second, both awesome movies)- as well as Independence Day (what is up with other positive reviews for GZ'98 having to diss JP &amp; iD4?)- and this movie has everything I loved about them combined. I don't see movies just for "special effects", I see them for good adventures and snarky humour. If you're looking for the same, this movie shouldn't disappoint. I loved the casting AND the writing- all of the characters are memorable AND quotable (same writers as the Pirates movies!). I remember, when I went to see JP2 in 1997, there was a teaser for GZ'98 during the trailers. It was the scene where GZ's foot comes down on the T-Rex display in the museum (tho that later turns out to be a deleted scene). From that moment I was excited to see it- which I did the next summer on the bigscreen. I've loved it ever since. Matthew Broderick and Hank Azaria and Jean Reno are just great to have along in this adventure. It's one of those movies that I can watch whenever, and get hooked for the entire ride all over again, every time. Another memory is when it was on Pay-Per-View around late '98, sometimes I'd watch / listen to it in scribblevision (if you had cable back then, you might know what I mean). I got the video as soon as it came out. And then the DVD. When I started vidding in 2005, I made a vid for it, which you can see at my YouTube page (SimbiAni), it's titled "Feel The Rain". The reason I finally got around to leaving a comment for it here at IMDb, is because it is on TV right now and it occurred to me to check its page here, and after seeing the unfortunate low user ratings... decided might as well. It seems these days (from various movie boards) the majority of "average ppl as movie critics" can't make up their mind for what they want in a movie- either there is a somewhat or complete lack of plot or too much story to understand what is going on. Thankfully, I'm neither. If I had to choose a fave scene, it is definitely the taxi chase thru the city and onto the bridge. Likewise, if I had to choose a favorite quote (tho there are SO many!), it would have to be also from the bridge scene- Victor: "Oh you gotta be kidding me, man! We're in his MOUTH! We're iN his MOUTH!" *crunching* "You're going the wrong way, man! You're GOiNG the WRONG WAY!" Phillipe: "Will you shut up now?!" Just awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a (bastardized) piece of cinematic crud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, let's seeTHE GOOD: -The fact that it was based in New York City (good choice of locations, in other words; it might not be THAT big of an accomplishment but it's a start for this movie at least) -The visuals, for the MOST part, I thought were good (particularly when the army fires all of those missiles/machine guns at 'Zilla) -The story, not the monster involved with it but the story ITSELF is still in the spirit of the original movie(s)' (he develops/oversizes in the EXACT same way as the original Godzilla)THE BAD: -The acting sucked -'Zilla received hardly any on-screen time (which is actually more or less a good thing, if you think about it)-The "remade" Godzilla was toned WAY down from the original to the point that it was just too weak to be taken seriously as a giant movie monster (ie: dying from just a few missiles, bleeding from machine gun fire, etc) -The fact that 'Zilla ran more than it destroyed (and that the army actually caused more destruction than it, like somebody else said) -The "redone" Godzilla's complete lack of intelligence (running into and getting stuck between the bridge cables, chasing a taxi cab around town and underneath a tunnel instead of just stepping on it or blowing it over with it's air wave breathe)So all in all not a very good movie. Granted there are much worse out there but this I would actually rank lower than most game-based adaptions (and pretty much on par with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation). This is such an embarrassment to the original that they actually went as far as (WARNING: Spoilers for Godzilla: Final Wars if you haven't already seen it)Having this bastardized American Godzilla get killed off by the far superior original, King of the Monsters Godzilla in Godzilla: Final Wars. Serves the guys who made this movie right, they deserve it for literally crapping on such a popular FOREIGN-marketed franchise. In the near future I'm hoping for another remake, one that's at LEAST in the spirit of the original, not one featuring a big monster that's completely opposite of everything that made the original Godzilla great: intelligent, mean-spirited, violent, and highly destructive. LONG LIVE THE KING, THE KING OF THE MONSTERS! NOT THIS BASTARDIZED DOMESTIC CRAP!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about watching Roland Emmerich's Godzilla on TV (I taped it from NBC five years ago and finally sat down to watch it yesterday) is that it's free. I didn't have to pay for this mouth-gapingly incoherent mess. I don't think I've ever seen a movie so arrogantly incompetent; it will push the ceiling on your worst movie top-ten list.If I can find anything positive to say, it's that Matthew Broderick has gone on to better things, Hank Azaria did Tuesdays With Morrie, and New York can take a punch and come back strong.The most negative thing I can say about this preposterous-even-for-a-monster-movie movie is that there are oodles of folks who just loved it, according to the IMDb message boards.My wife came in to ask me how the movie was going, yesterday. I told her, "It's awful." She asked, "Then WHY are you watching it?" I'm still working on an answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why was this film made? Why was Jean Reno in this movie? Was Matthew Broderick that desperate? Talk about a boatload of questions in need of an answer. This entire movie is a major stumper, making me wonder how such crap can come from the mind of a human being. Seriously, the old school Godzilla movies at least had some camp value because of the strings and miniature sets, but this proved to be a big waste of time. How the heck do you lose a 300-foot reptile in Manhattan? That's a question I still want answered. Clearly, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin must have been getting sick of Hollywood or something because they actually thought this film was a good idea. Now the pair have to build themselves back up after making two great films in Stargate and Independence Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, any reboot of this Japanese sci fi classic that would even THINK of hiring Matthew Broderick to play the male lead is going to be a rampant disaster. And this pile of junk certainly doesn't fail to fail. I've never seen so much bad acting in a major motion picture in a long, long time, and even a porno movie is more engaging, not to mention the "pay off" at the end! When I saw this overgrown lizard destroy a nuclear submarine because it apparently knew more about nuclear weapons and tactics with it's pea-brained Jurassic brain, I couldn't stop laughing. And when I saw 100's of it's 10' tall babies taking over Madison Square Garden, this piece of horse pucky REALLY got stupid. If you want to waste your time and your money, watch this turkey. If not, STEER CLEAR. If the original Godzilla could watch this monumental garbage, he'd turn over in his grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is far from amazing, but it doesn't entirely deserve the maligning it gets. Is the pace plodding sometimes? Yes it is, especially in the middle act. Is the script weak? Yes it is rather. Is the direction unfocused? I think so, but it is Roland Emmerich, a director I never found particularly good anyway, that said I actually think it is one of his better directing jobs here. Is the acting bad? Sort of and sort of not. Matthew Broderick is very bland, and his character is poor, same with the female lead whose acting style doesn't belong but Harry Shearer is fun and Jean Reno is surprisingly dignified.I did love the idea of Godzilla though. There may be the odd hole here and there, but thanks to a quite riveting final half hour especially it remains interesting. The scenery is splendid, the editing is good enough, some sequences are entertaining and Godzilla while different is very well designed. The score is also memorable. And while there are flaws to Godzilla, I couldn't help being entertained. This film isn't Emmerich's best, but contrary to what others might say I don't think it is his worst either. Overall, it has a lot of problems, but I kind of liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr Niko Tatopoulos is called in to investigate the effect of nuclear radiation on lizards. He has a theory that the radiation may cause some slight size increase in some species of worm and other species. Tatopoulos' theory is proved true when the authorities suspect a giant lizard Gojira (mispronounced Godzilla by the media) is headed for New York. When Gojira arrives in New York he causes considerable mayhem in the evacuated Manhattan, however Tatopoulos has a further theory that Gojira has come to nest, a theory that the military reject but that a convert French military unit led by Philippe Roaché.This film made it's own hype, it took over Cannes, it started it's own rumours etc in order to get word going. However it wasn't successful and only served to highlight it's own failings. The story is daft - it starts well as we don't see the beast, only seeing footprints and swells in the water etc. However once it gets to NY it starts to fall apart. Gojira's size seems to change depending on what situation the film dictates - in one scene he can emerge from a subway from a hole the size of a car, while in another he is as tall as the NY skyscrapers. The chases in NY are exciting while they last, but its difficult to believe that the military keep losing this thing in such a small island! The second act of the film is the hunt for the nest - in Madison Square Gardens. Here we have the heroes confronting Gojira's babies. The babies play like the Marx brothers crossed with Jurassic Park's raptors. This whole section is poor. Of course Gojira makes a reappearance in a silly finale that, to add insult to injury, ends with a `it's not over till the sequel' style conclusion.The way the film just seems to do what it wants is a little insulting (size changes, losing the creature etc) and the destruction is not really infused with any sense of awe (the Chrysler building blows up - oh). The cast are roundly poor - Broderick is not good at all while Pitillo would be more at home in a sitcom than a blockbuster. Hank Azaria has fun and Harry Shearer and Michael Lerner have funny roles outside of the action. However only Jean Reno comes away with any dignity.At over two hours size does matter, and this is far too long to be fully enjoyable. If they had kept Gojira the same size all the time, reduced the bit in the nest and concentrated on making the film a real event (rather than just saying it is an event), then it might have been good. Unfortunately it's merely loud and annoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some prominent problems and I can sort of see why it bombed so big. It wants to have as much thrill candy as possible and the story is kind of a bit too far behind it to catch up. Godzilla is exactly how I would have brought him across, he has a cool shaped head (hamburger like I guess from some angles) and and Ok body shape the main problem here is the not so subtle Jurassic Park/The Lost World outtakes. The eye shots, the foot shots, the thuds, the footprints, the makers seemed to be screaming "we're going to beat Jurassic Park!", as for the add where the foot steps on the rex skeleton I was as far on the wrong side of nice as they were on the wrong side of subtle.They wanted to cover as much of echo system as possible, thats why they had the traulers pulled down out in the sea and the submarine battle in the harbour and then the wide plane footprint shots and then the above ground and underground action but the story moves forward fast tripping on obstacles periodically in it's wake. And as a reviewer previously stated, there is no way anything that big could go anywhere unnoticed underground included. It still has some pretty good thrills and entertainment.The baby Godzillas were their pretence at getting some Raptor-like action and then they rip off alot of Raptor like shots aswell, but still with some fun in the climax. Mathew Broderick demonstrates some evident and justified uncomfortability with delivering the line, "each of these babies is born pregnant" WHAT! They obviously were looking for somewhere new to go at the end and once again, America saves the world.All in all you can sit through this quite easily and be entertained but if you are a loyal fan of the originals or of Jurassic Park you will dislike this to an extent, by all means watch this if you haven't already, it's worth it at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla (1998) needs to be added to my list of movies I continuously revisit despite being terrible and that I want so bad to like more.I remember back in 1998 when I first saw this: It was one of my most anticipated movies for me in a long time. For, I grew up with Godzilla as a kid, though I couldn't tell you how many of the Japanese films I've seen. Just whatever was on Saturday Afternoons on TV. So, I thought: damn, here's Godzilla, with a budget and on American soil! And I love Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria and it also starred my soap-dish show's Doug Savant, from Melrose Place!I could NOT have been more let down than if Hank Azaria, himself, provided a voice for Godzilla.During my first viewing, I did all I could to get past the absolute trash of campiness they didn't need to hold onto. The horrid dialogue, bad acting and jokes that were as flat as anything under Godzilla's feet. I tried to forgive them to missing the mark and opportunity and said to myself: "Let's get to the goods!"When we finally did, and Godzilla revealed his new "look" I couldn't stop laughing. Sure the special effects were decent, and I knew where they were going by transforming his Rubber-Suit-Man into a more "realistic" lizard giant, but dang, he couldn't have looked more ridiculous. No wonder they never revealed his full body, or at least warped and hilarious head, to the media prior to the movie playing.Oh, and here's a spoiler, but don't worry; it's your fault if you haven't yet seen this 15-year-old movie. They rip off the very movie they're trying to top: Jurassic Park. The entire marketing campaign, namely "Size Does Matter," was trying to spit on the everlasting champ in this genre but, instead, steals the raptor scenes with the climax of this film. It was pathetic.The basic synopsis follows the previous synopsis of the established Godzilla series: radioactive (or nuclear) activity grows a lizard to, I don't know, 100,000 times of its original size, although Matthew Broderick's character says it's a "brand new species." And said monster believes New York City would be perfect for raising its youth. Um, it's not even good for humans, but maybe Godzilla first spoke with the rats and thought differently.The Gomer Pyle lead military decides it's best to blow up half the city in order to stop the beast after a convenient, albeit unrealistic, evacuation of 10 million people in a matter of minutes. When one doctor (Broderick) suggests feeding the beast is a good idea, the doofuses listen, comply and instead of killing Godzilla, they obliterate much of Manhattan while lacking any results.Meanwhile, a dizzy blonde, whom you'll grow to hate, wants her man, said doctor, back while stealing a story to advance at her news station.I just threw that in for the most inept and ridiculous subplots thrown in. There's many more, and sadly, the bulk of the movie revolves around live-action cartoon characters and their selfish lives while a monster threatens real estate.I digress. Godzilla lays some eggs and this causes more threats and the doctor's theories. Enter the Raptor Rip-off Chase scenes.Admittedly, if you get past the 80% of camp and cheese, some of the Godzilla chases were fun, but that's a lot to ask. In the beginning of my review, I said this is one I return to regularly, or say, every 3-4 years, and want to like it more, but blasted, I hate life when all I remembered was that 20% of good footage.In 2014, I've heard they plan on yet another reboot of this franchise. Oddly, I have high hopes again. I really do. I think they've learned from their mistakes here and despite the 16 year gap, or worse, 60 years since the original, they will take their time with a story that can be told, with actors that don't speak lines from a three-year-old's mind and with an even better threat to us than a military that couldn't stop an ant colony from gathering leaves.Skip this one, wait for 2014.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clumsy, elephantine monster-movie remake of a 1954 Japanese cult classic; an overachieving, multiplex-equivalent of a drive-in theater quickie. Mass hysteria grips the world after a mysterious terror causes destruction and death near Panama; biologist Matthew Broderick is lured away from his Chernobyl earthworms to help determine the cause and effect of an Atom Bomb-created modern day dinosaur. What could be worse than Godzilla in New York City? Maybe a dinosaur-sized Hollywood blockbuster designed to break the bank but engineered without a trace of nostalgia (the picture pretty much throws out the campy fun of the original at the outset, instead replacing it with smarmy "wit" and actors forced to scream at each other). Broderick, as Dr. Niko Tatopoulos--whose last name keeps getting mispronounced--sings showtunes in his truck but does have an ex-college sweetheart back home (don't worry folks--he's straight!); he gets sexually harassed by his female boss within his first day on the new job--while back home in NYC, ex-flame Maria Pitillo gets harassed by her boss as well, and yet the filmmakers don't even seem to make the connection (it's all just "cute"). Jean Reno looks entirely out of place with his low-keyed nods and stammers as investigator Philippe Roaché (his last name gets mispronounced as well), getting in the way of the military while making subtle, pointed observations (he's like the Truffaut character in "Close Encounters"). As an action flick, the film is pumped full of wheezing prestige and misguided ambition, too much of it for the picture to be any fun. As a career killer, it did send Broderick back to Broadway. * from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was 7 years old. And I loved it. I just absolutely loved this movie.Now I am 15 years old, and I still very much love it. I am tired of hearing people say how horrible it is, and that it didn't follow the original Godzilla. To tell you the truth, I hated the originals. Even when I was 7 years old, I hated the originals.I don't like the original Godzilla. Mainly because he is shown as an evil monster that destroys buildings on purpose, and is just out to kill everyone. He was a basic mindless monster that could breath fire and was just huge. Too me, that is not entertainment. Really I thought it was kind of lame. On top of that, the story was too far fetched, what with huge moth-things and other movie monsters, that really are just kind of weird. Don't get me wrong, the originals will always have a place in amercian and Japanese pop culture, but really I didn't get it.I like the new "American" Godzilla, because he seems just a tad-bit more real. Meaning that he was a victim of human carelessness, and he became a new species of animal, just trying to survive like all other creatures on earth. But he was too big in a world too small. He seemed almost kind of gentle and curious, but he was just too big for humans to coexist with him, just him finding food was enough to destroy half of New York.Really I think it should be OK, for someone to make a different "kind' of Godzilla. I like the Godzilla who was more of a victim, than a mindless monster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of the old Godzilla flicks, with lousy special effects, obvious cheap lizard suits and poorly detailed miniatures, you're apparently not going to like this movie, because the special effects are pretty good, despite a rather patent disregard for some basic laws of physics and moments of absolute abandonment of logic.However, if you're not a dedicated fan of the old, bad Godzilla movies, you might just enjoy this new, bad Godzilla movie. This ain't Shakespeare, folks, but it's entertaining nevertheless. It's a crazy, campy, rampage through New York, where the "good guys" do almost as much damage as the real hero of the flick, Godzilla himself. The dialog is over the top, but often witty, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. Matthew Broderick turns in an entertaining performance as the nerdy anti-hero, aided by the enigmatic "insurance guy" played by Jean Reno, and an assortment of variously goofy lesser characters.Don't expect a great plot, but if you give it a chance you might just be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godzilla (1998) * (out of 4) I'll never forget being in a theater the first time I saw the teaser trailer for this film. It received the loudest cheers I had ever heard inside a theater. I'll also never forget watching the actual film with a sold out crowd and hearing the moans and groans as the film slowly got to the ending. Revisiting this film more than fifteen-years later it's easy to see why this thing was such a disaster to fans, critics and pretty much everyone. Roland Emmerich has stated that he wasn't a fan of the original movies and that's pretty clear because this film is just dead weight from the start and it never reaches any good level. I'm not going to sit here and say the previous Godzilla movies were classics because they weren't. They were usually bad but charming movies. This one here is simply bad without an ounce of charm to be found and worse of all is the fact that it contains the worst looking Godzilla in history and I'd argue one of the dumbest scripts in history. Did Emmerich and Dean Devlin, the screenwriter, really think the humor here was going to be funny? You've got Matthew Broderick acting like a complete nerd and it's not funny. You've got Jean Reno making awful coffee comments throughout the picture. You've then got the director and screenwriter spoofing Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and all of this is just so downright bad that it's easy to say both film critics perfectly nailed this film when they mentioned that the filmmakers weren't even smart enough to kill their characters off or make them "suffer" any sort of fate. What really kills this movie for me is how long it is and how the middle section pretty much has zero things happening. The movie just drags on and on when in fact it probably should have lost at least fifty-minutes if not more. With that said, it really just needed an entirely new screenplay because what's here is just bad. Worst of all is poor Godzilla himself who sadly looks like a dinosaur reject from JURASSIC PARK. It's really easy to see why this film is so hated by so many people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge Godzilla fan. So when I first heard an American Godzilla was going to be made I thought that was pretty cool. However I was thoroughly disappointed.Nuclear bombs alter an iguana or something and it turns super big and becomes "Godzilla".,...............thats it for story pretty much.I really hated this movie because this is nothing like how Godzilla is in the great Japanese movies. He is not a dinosaur in this one, just a big lizard and his character in this has no heart it feels. Hes also got no personality. Also he does not really attack the city, he just runs around and when the army attacks him he runs away. Finally he cant even breathe radioactive fire. What were they thinking? You can alter certain things about a character if they aren't important, but these are all well established and important character traits of Godzilla that were all not done well at all.Also this movie is a downer cause it rains the whole movie. I just think it makes you get a bad feeling when watching it.The human cast was OK, I actually like Matthew Broderick. Hank Azaria is cool, but other than that nothing special.Basically this is not the Godzilla I grew up to love as a kid. I do not recommend this horrible film.</fullReview>

But the people behind "Independence Day" obviously didn't. They turned the big guy into an overgrown iguana. And the plot? The "plot", if we can call it that, involves two hours of destruction. The major problem with movies like this is that we want to see more of the title character and less of the people trying to figure out what to do; but that's what makes it a formula movie. Can't they just make something with a real plot?! Oh, I forgot to mention the characters. They're the types whom you want to see get crushed by the monster. The movie wastes Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria (I don't recall Maria Pitillo from anything else; "Godzilla" may have ruined her chances). Kevin Dunn, Michael Lerner and Harry Shearer also star. They're probably embarrassed about this.So, avoid it at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is going to have spoilers in it, and this is coming from a life long Toho Godzilla fan too. You don't like it don't read it. This is a Remake of the 1954 classic Gojira/Godzilla King of the Monsters. The premise of the original was a great sci-fi movie with a strong message of impending doom of nuclear weapons and there effect. The Toho Godzilla (Toho is the Japanese production studio) had been around for 44 years when this came out and a slew of movies, some good, and some cheesy. But this was an insult to what we fans know as Godzilla. And these are the reasons why. I will be referring to Toho Godzilla as Godzilla, because that what it is. And the American Movie Godzilla as GINO, because that thing is Godzilla In Name Only.1) - Godzilla is a irradiated dinosaur created from nuclear weapons testing in the pacific.- GINO is a freaking iguana. one in thousands on a random island the French did nuclear testing on.2) - Godzilla is nigh invulnerable to the weapons of man. Only being slowed down or stunned by them, Only killed once by removing every last molecule of oxygen in Tokyo Bay in the original movie and never since then.- GINO take 6 sidewinder missiles and dies... 3) - Godzilla feeds on Radiation making him stronger. - GINO eats Tuna...4) - Godzilla can let loose a fiery Atomic Breath melting metal, destroying buildings, hurting other monsters.- GINO can yell... really loud... no fire breath...5) - Godzilla is attacked by the military he faces it head on taking whatever they can dish and more.- GINO runs away.That is why this movie is abysmal to true Godzilla fans. There is a reason Godzilla, the true Godzilla, has been around for 50 plus years, and why this tuna-eating wannabe had one movie and was throw away joke in Godzilla: Final Wars.</fullReview>

No guy in a lizard suit, no atomic fire breath, and the King of all monsters spends more time underground than a groundhog.

		<fullReview>OK, this Movies isn't as bad as its reputation.The thing for me is, it's not a Godzilla movie. It may be a decent monster movie, but not a Godzilla movie. It misses VERY IMPORTANT trademarks.E.g. the monster doesn't really breath atomic fire. Where are the Stegosaurus spikes? The worst thing is that it's getting killed by the military. That never happened in any of the movies before. Godzilla is pretty much immortal. Only another Monster has a chance against Godzilla.It's not a complaint about the plot or the CG-effects in General. This movie just does not have the Godzilla feeling. The 2014 version did a way better job.If the movie wasn't "Godzilla in the name only" it would have been decent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring re-hash of every monster movie cliche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most derivative films the movie industry has ever turned out. The plot - a giant mutated lizard which makes its way to the city - is like 'Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' re-lived, the bursting of the babies from eggs is like 'Aliens', the monsters are obviously inspired by 'Jurassic Park' T-Rex and Raptors and the climax atop a landmark is copied from RKO's 1933 'King Kong'.Though monster movies are not known for their multi-layered plots or their in-depth characters, this is just a sham. The characters are all cardboard cut-outs, the monster has no character at all and its offspring are quite obviously CGI creations. The humour is also pathetic. A fat man who is constantly eating and has to often be stopped from doing so? A dated concept which belongs in uninspired cartoon strips. The contempt for Godzilla fans and the audience in general is obvious. This film is more of an advert than entertainment, all the tacky merchandise having been prepared in advance. It's dull, plodding and the monster itself is hardly visible through the rain.Do yourself a favour - find the original 1950s version instead and throw this piece of CGI dross in the trash compactor where it belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ha, ha, ha, ha. Revenge at last. Godzilla fans helped American money-mad directors stab Willis O'Brien in the back and then turn his creation into a joke and at last they have paid for it.Oh, a review of this new Godzilla film? Well, I'm not entirely certain it is a film. It seems more like a 2 and a half-hour long advert for a whole load of tacky merchandising rubbish. Actually, that's being unkind to adverts - most of them have more plot, character and long-term appeal than this non-entity of a film. Two sequals? Why? Who with an IQ containing more than one digit is going to waste money just to go and see another thrill-less, imagination-less, pointless plodder?Mind you, this is no different from any other recent film of this type. It's about money, not entertainment. It's all just a lot of computer graphics, and you can see those by watching somebody playing a video game, and you don't have to pay to do that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Harvey Keitel had played the "mutated lizard" he would probably have pleaded with the director Roland Emmerich, "Where's my motivation"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Harvey Keitel had played the "mutated lizard" he would probably have pleaded with the director Roland Emmerich, "Where's my motivation"?Of course, this dirty great beast need not have the IQ of Stephen Hawkins, but most audiences need to see a whiff of personality, however small.You could identify/sympathise with The Beast From The Black Lagoon because however dastardly his acts, he always looked somewhat lost and forlorn. And, of course, this distinctly amateurish Godzilla, comes nowhere near the beauty of King Kong - one of the greatest spurned lovers of all time. But surely it's the actors that count, not the monster? Well, it's not a great sign when you're backing the lizard to gobble up the leads.Damsel in distress Maria Pitilo (Audrey) is no Faye Wray. She arguably delivers the film's most irritating performance. With mannerisms copied from Friends star Lisa Kudrow (plays Phoebe, the most annoying of the six of them and that's hard to pull-off) and looks faintly reminiscent of Anne Heche, one suspects the makers originally actually wanted Heche, but were too terrified to employ her after the lesbian furore.As for Matthew Broderick, well his career has been very unusual indeed. Two seminal and hugely popular 80s flicks War Games and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, were followed for a short time by moderate obscurity. However, Broderick was re-born as an actor with three marvellous low-budget, low audience films: The Freshman, Torch Song Trilogy and The Night We Never Met. So, after all this considerable hard work to establish credibility, Godzilla is a genuine come down. His quirky, boyish scientist caricature, Nick Tatapoulos, ("worm guy") does not achieve the dry wit, cynicism or charisma of say a Jeff Goldblum creation and his lines are awful, "She thinks I'm cute". Where did I leave that puke bag?However, Broderick is by no means the worst culprit and a very ropey plot and script infest this film's innards like a tapeworm. In the first 80 minutes the lack of actual suspense is shocking and the film's values even worse. We are led to believe that the reason this aberration is stomping around Manhattan is because of French nuclear testing. Not the Americans of course. Now that wouldn't do to admit American failings. Worst of all, though, are the plugs or indeed digs at the Warner Brothers and Disney stores mentioned in the script. The mere mention of these film companies reeks of cynical product placing and the impending preparation of a Godzilla theme ride at Universal Studios or the like.Of course, the constant bombardment of Godzilla hype has been arguably the largest marketing exercise ever undertaken. Larger even than the first Batman film and even more disappointing. So, what is there to recommend it? Well the last forty minutes or so are a dramatic improvement. This is chiefly down to an egg-hatching scene straight out of Aliens, where hundreds of tiny Godzillas spring to life in Madison Square Garden. Reminiscent of Jurassic Park, the velociraptor-like beasts stalk our collection of stereotypes around a plethora of dark corridors, and the effect is all rather gripping. As is the car chase that follows.However, one decent sequence does not make a great monster flick and the combination of a diabolical script, idiotic stereotypes, excessive hype and a dreadful leading lady should be enough to deter you seeing this drivel until appears on Sky Movies. Blimey, they've got me at it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson to be learned here.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lesson was buried in the cinematic slop known as Devlin and Emmerich's "Godzilla". It's a lesson for anyone in the Movie Industry.All you industry types....listen up. "Godzilla" has taught us that just because you can get your hands on some supersonic PC's and the latest version of Lightwave doesn't mean that you're going to make the best thing since sliced bread. We, the audience, are wising up to you. (and it's about time!)Now I understand that this movie was meant to be, for the most part, a roller-coaster ride. We weren't looking for writing and performances sharing the caliber of "The Shawshank Redemption" or "A Midnight Clear". But what we WERE hoping for (and what the trailers clearly led us to expect) was the pure rocket-fuel of "Aliens" and the suspense of "Jurassic Park". Some have tried to explain this movie away as the kind where you turn off the ol' noggin and just enjoy. Well, if you're sitting there with your noodle trying to soak in the atmosphere of the flick and it isn't working.....then the word "bomb" comes to mind.Yes, the effects were great. I enjoy a good dose of eye-candy just as much as the next red-blooded American male. But when the pitiful dialogue, the questionable casting (Jean Reno was obviously repaying a favor) and the laughable acting (Maria Pitillo taking the honors here) keep distracting you from the whole "vegging" thing you're trying to achieve just to enjoy yourself, something has gone horribly wrong. In addition, this movie's idea of suspense is easily rivaled by the act of picking one's own nose.A special note (actually a plea) to Mr. Devlin and Mr. Emmerich, whom I understand are threatening us with not one, but two "Godzilla" sequels: Don't. It'll keep you out of trouble.</fullReview>
